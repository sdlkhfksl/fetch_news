Not SEC, Issuers Will Show Green Light To Ether ETF


                                SEC Chair: Ether ETFs Approval Hinges on Issuers' Responsiveness                                The current and future regulation of cryptocurrencies in the United States is complex, especially with the expected approval of spot Ether ETFs. Some of the recent statements by the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler have given a clear perspective on the timelines involved and what is expected in these approvals.What's the News?The Chair of the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler has mentioned that the moment when spot Ether ETFs will be introduced will heavily rely on issuers’ activity regarding the comments of the Commission. This statement was made following the approval of eight spot Ether ETFs through Form 19b-4 applications to trade on various exchanges in the United States. However, these ETFs can only trade after they have been registered with an S-1 registration statement.Gensler highlighted that the SEC is supposed to ensure investors receive enough information and that all parties are acting fairly. He also stated that the staff of the SEC has analyzed the filings and found out that they are similar to the approval of Bitcoin. However, the issuers have to be more receptive to the comments of the SEC. “It is really up to them how much they want to be responsive,” Gensler said implying that the pace of approval is at the issuer's discretion.Gensler reiterated that while spot Ether ETFs are approved in principle, they still require S-1 filings to be finalized. The approval process could take additional weeks or months, with the first week of July being a speculative target for some analysts. Gensler pointed to the importance of having strong rules and requirements for disclosure and compliance in the crypto space. He added that most of the exchanges lack enough transparency, which is crucial to avoid fraud and manipulation.Factors affecting the SEC’s decisionIt appears that the SEC has changed its approach to spot Ether ETFs based on the precedent set by Grayscale in a case regarding Bitcoin ETFs in 2023. The most crucial factor that Grayscale was able to prove its case was the approval of the SEC on Bitcoin futures ETFs. Gensler pointed out that Ethereum has a similar regulatory approach, as the relations between Bitcoins and Ether markets are studied by the SEC. This legal backdrop may have facilitated a more favorable view of Ether ETFs.Another angle to the SEC’s decision is linked to Commissioner Jamie Lizárraga, whose past ties to influential Democratic figures like Nancy Pelosi may have played a role. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart suggested that internal political dynamics and concerns over crypto’s popularity among Democrats could have influenced the SEC’s decisions.ConclusionAs the SEC continues to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency regulation, the approval of spot Ether ETFs will largely depend on issuer responsiveness and ongoing compliance with disclosure requirements, CoinGabbar concluded. The SEC’s actions might also reflect broader political dynamics, with significant support for crypto legislation among Democratic lawmakers. The passing of FIT21 in the House of Representatives exemplifies this trend, potentially shaping the SEC’s regulatory approach. The evolving regulatory landscape promises to bring more clarity and opportunities for investors and issuers alike.Also Read: US Antitrust Chief’s Vision For Preventing AI Monopoly

GameStop Dips in Premarket After Early Q1 Results, Equity Sale Announcement - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) released its first-quarter financial results for the fiscal year 2024 earlier than anticipated, coinciding with the much-awaited return of Keith Gill, also known as “Roaring Kitty,” to YouTube. The video game retailer reported a net loss of $32.3 million, an improvement from the $50.5 million loss in the same quarter last year.



However, the company missed analysts’ expectations on both revenue and earnings per share (EPS), with net sales declining to $0.882 billion from $1.237 billion in Q1 2023.



GameStop Misses Q1 Earnings, Plans to Sell Up to 75 Million Shares



GameStop’s gross profit for the quarter declined to $244.5 million from $287.3 million year-over-year. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to $295.1 million from $345.7 million, but increased as a percentage of net sales to 33.5% from 27.9%. The company ended the quarter with $1.083 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, while maintaining limited long-term debt, primarily a low-interest, unsecured term loan from the French government’s COVID-19 response.



In a separate announcement, GameStop revealed plans to sell up to 75 million additional shares of Class A common stock through an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC, entered into on May 17, 2024. This move follows a previous sale of 45 million shares, which generated gross proceeds of approximately $933.4 million.



The new share offering, deemed an “at the market offering” under Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act, could significantly dilute existing shareholders.





GameStop Stock Sees Extreme Premarket Volatility



As of June 6, 2024, GameStop’s stock price closed at $46.55, with a pre-market price of $42.78 at 7:26 AM EDT, representing a decline of 8.1%. The stock has experienced extreme volatility over the past year, with a 52-week range between $10.01 and $48.75, and daily trading volumes ranging from 1,731,300 to 206,979,100 shares.



Despite the mixed financial results, GameStop’s stock has delivered a year-to-date return of +165.54% and a 1-year return of +91.48%.



The significant pre-market surge in the stock price can be attributed to the anticipation surrounding Keith Gill’s return to YouTube.

Is Now the Time to Buy Shiba Inu? Crypto Analyst Says Yes


							

Popular crypto analyst Thescalpingpro has urged his followers on X to buy SHIB during its current dip.



SHIB’s trading volume has decreased by 43% to $397.78 million over the past week. 



SHIB faces strong resistance at $0.000026, where many traders tend to sell. Holding above $0.000025 is crucial for another upward push.




Crypto analyst, Thescalpingpro, has urged investors to buy Shiba Inu (SHIB) during its current dip. In an X post, the pseudonymous analyst emphasized that this might be the last opportunity to buy SHIB before a potential price increase.







Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.00002529, reflecting a 1.43% intraday dip and a 2.18% decline over the past week. SHIB’s trading volume has also fallen by 43% to $397.78 million over the same period. Similarly, its market capitalization has dipped by 1.50%, reaching $14.88 billion.



According to TradingView data, SHIB’s price has shown relatively stable movement with moderate volatility this month. The price consistently finds support around $0.000022 and encounters resistance at $0.000027, struggling to break through this level.



Furthermore, volume trends reveal a few noticeable spikes, which are significantly lower than in previous periods, such as during the March surge. Meanwhile, lower volume indicates decreased trading activity, often accompanying consolidation phases. These periods usually precede significant price movements as traders anticipate a breakout.



On June 5, SHIB reached a high of $0.00002633 after surpassing the $0.000025 level and 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). This development brought mid-term bullish momentum, supported by Bitcoin’s resurgence and a broader market uptrend.



However, the $0.000026 threshold remains a significant resistance level. According to IntoTheBlock data, 64,320 addresses purchased 69.74 trillion SHIB tokens at an average price of $0.000026. Each time SHIB retests this price, these addresses tend to sell off their holdings, increasing selling pressure and leading to a price correction.



As SHIB retraced most of its recent gains and slipped below $0.000026, it now aims to hold above $0.000025 to prepare for another potential upward push when bullish sentiment returns. Coincodex currently predicts that SHIB’s price could rise by 226.28%, reaching $0.00008195 by July 7, 2024.

            Keith Gill, commonly known as Roaring Kitty, is on track to become a billionaire if GameStop stock (GME) crosses $67.According to The Kobeissi Letter, GME’s price surged to $67.5 in Thursday’s after-hours trading. Gill’s holdings, including shares and options, are poised to hit the $1 billion mark if GME opens at or surpasses these levels.GameStock closed Thursday’s trading session at around $46.5, a nearly 50% single-day gain. The rally came shortly after Gill said he would start a livestream on YouTube on Friday.With yesterday’s rally, Gill, associated with the Reddit account DeepF***ingValue, saw his GME shares and call options surge by 119% and 376%, respectively. His portfolio, after Thursday’s market close, stood at approximately $586 million, with $382 million in unrealized profits.Roaring Kitty’s portfolio update on June 6Friday is shaping up to be a wild day with Gill’s upcoming livestream, scheduled for less than five hours (16h UTC). GameStop’s shares jumped over 40% in pre-market trading earlier today, according to Google Finance’s data.Robinhood CEO: We’re prepared for GameStop frenzyRobinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said Thursday that the trading exchange is ready for the GameStop frenzy, which is expected to come upon Roaring Kitty’s YouTube livestream.“We are prepared. We’ve been working on improving the infrastructure tremendously,” Tenev told FOX Business on Thursday. “So much of this activity starts on the weekends or late at night, Sunday evening in this case.”Meanwhile, E*Trade is weighing banning Gill amid concerns about potential stock manipulation, according to a report from WSJ on Monday.Keith Gill reappeared on social media last weekend, with a post on X and Reddit. The trader also revealed his purchase of 5 million GME shares for $115.7 million and an investment of $65.7 million in call options. GameStop’s shares jumped 19% shortly after his revelation.The trader’s return has also sparked a surge in Kitty-themed memecoins and the Solana-based token GME, which has no association with the retail game company.On Monday, GME surged 300% in a few hours after Roaring Kitty returned to X. The memecoin skyrocketed nearly 100% yesterday night following Gill’s livestream announcement.

Solana trader turns $53,500 into $2.86 million in five months


    GameStop stock (NYSE: GME) is up 165% year-to-date, and the cryptocurrency market has navigated this hype with a GME memecoin. A Solana (SOL) DeFi trader has made $2.8 million in unrealized profits with this purely speculative meme token.



In particular, the account ‘7eTbufa‘ purchased the GME token on January 29 and April 3 while trading at low prices. Overall, the trader stacked 90.23 million GME in Solana year-to-date and patiently held despite months of low volume.



This strategy is paying off, as these holdings were worth $2.86 million when Lookonchain reported the achievement. Specifically, GME traded at $0.03120 on the decentralized exchange Raydium, while Solana currently trades at $171.







However, the trader might face liquidity issues, and it’s not guaranteed that he can realize his profits with the Solana version of GME, which has no real value or relation with the GameStop stock.

GME stock hype and a meme coin mania among Solana traders



Meme coins like Solana’s GME have been trending among cryptocurrencies since May 13. Renewed interest surged when the famous meme trader Keith Gill returned to social platforms. Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, inspired the GameStop stock short squeeze in 2021.



His appearance is visible on the chart above. Notably, there was a price surge at that time, followed by a crash once the influencer went silent. The Solana trader held his GME meme coin untouched during the pump and the following crash.



Nevertheless, Roaring Kitty’s Reddit account disclosed a $180 million position on GameStop on June 3, pumping these meme assets again. GME stock currently trades at $44.07, up 164.37% year-to-date.

In this context, it is worth the warning that trading meme coins or meme stocks can be extremely risky. The risk of ruin with this asset class is high, and most traders will lose money instead of accruing gains.



Furthermore, experts warn of “The Greater Fool” theory dynamics that resemble financial bubbles, when the “mania” disappears and the late buyers remain with massive losses of assets that have no organic demand besides the highly speculative nature of traders trying to outplay the market, but being outplayed as soon as the “music stops.”

Ripple sells 150 million XRP of June reserves, pressures price


    Ripple, the XRP Ledger (XRP) developer and largest holder, sold 150 million XRP from this month’s reserves on June 7. The sale is worth $78 million, representing 0.25% of XRP’s $29.25 billion capitalization at $0.52 per token



On June 1, the company released 1 billion XRP from the initial distribution, locked in monthly escrows until 2027. Ripple then sent 200 million XRP to its treasury account and locked the remaining 800 million in new escrows.



Additionally, the ‘Ripple (35)‘ account sent an extra 200 million tokens to the sell-off reserves, totaling 400 million XRP.







As usual, the selling activity resulted from the treasury account, labeled ‘Ripple (1),’ sending tokens to the unlabeled account ‘rP4X2hTa‘. This action causes XRP supply inflation—by putting tokens that have never circulated before into circulation for the first time.

So far, the amount remains in the ‘rP4X2hTa’ account, which will likely be distributed to ‘rhWt2bhR‘ and other intermediary addresses before landing in cryptocurrency exchanges, as happened in previous months.

XRP price analysis amid Ripple sell-offs



It is noteworthy how Ripple sales directly impact XRP’s price, considering the supply pressure they create on the spot market. Historically, XRP suffered a local crash most of the time Ripple sold its tokens.



Year-to-date, only five of the 12 sell-off days had positive price action: February 5, 11, April 14, May 13, and 20. All the other seven days were of local crashes, evidencing the importance of monitoring the company’s activities.



Moreover, XRP had a negative monthly performance in three of the first five months of 2024, year-to-date.

As of this writing, XRP trades at $0.523 with an increasing supply pressure over its spot price. Therefore, investors should closely monitor Ripple’s dumps in June, as they could slow down an expected bull rally this cycle.

Bitcoin Open Interest reaches record levels: Could $80K be next? - AMBCrypto




The coin’s open interest hit the highest point since March, suggesting that BTC could break past $73,750.
Exchange withdrawal increased while the funding rate was positive, reinforcing the bullish bias.

For the first time since it hit its all-time high of $73,570, Bitcoin [BTC] Open Interest has hit a new high. Specifically, the Open Interest was $37.66 billion, according to data from Glassnode. 
Open Interest (OI) is the value of outstanding contracts in the derivatives market. If the OI decreases, it means traders are increasingly closing their positions, and this could lead to a price decrease. 
However, an increase in OI like Bitcoin has done recently is a sign that new money is entering the market. If sustained, this could back BTC’s uptrend and lead to a higher price.
Source: Glassnode
BTC aims higher, backed by exchange flow
As of this writing, BTC changed hands at $71,200. This represented a 3.89% jump in the last seven days. With increasing interest in the token, there is a high chance that it could surpass its all-time high and possibly reach $80,000.
Despite the bullish prediction, it is important to look at the spot trading activity on exchanges as this could also affect the price action.
One of the ways to do this is by looking at the supply on exchanges and the supply out of it. In addition, the balance held by some of the top exchanges could give an idea.
For instance, AMBCrypto found that Binance and Coinbase’s historical balance was down, indicating that users were withdrawing their BTC from the platforms. However, Kraken recorded a surge in BTC purchases on the 30th of May before the recent decline.
It seemed that many holders were buying more coins on exchanges and withdrawing them for the long term. If this continues to be the case, Bitcoin might evade selling pressure, and the price could hit an all-time high before the end of June.
Source: Santiment
Traders continue to bet on a rally
On the other hand, the prediction could be invalidated if supply on exchanges begins to rise. This is because an increase in the supply would mean that investors are willing to book profits. If this happens, BTC might lose hold of $70,000.
However, traders seem not to share the viewpoint of price decrease. This was based on the Funding Rate data obtained from Coinglass. 
According to the derivatives information portal, Bitcoin’s Funding Rate was positive. If the reading of the metric is negative, it implies that shorts are paying longs a fee to keep their position open. 
In this instance, the broader sentiment is bearish.
Source: Coinglass

However, the positive reading of the metric indicated that longs are dominant, and are expecting BTC’s price to increase. Should Bitcoin rise to $74,000 as it is being talked about, traders with long positions would be rewarded.
 This could also give way to $80,000 provided bears fail to nuke the uptrend.

DYdX To Complete v5 Upgrade Next Week - The Defiant

DYdX v5 introduces Isolated Markets, allowing users to partition their collateral across multiple positions.DYdX, a decentralized perpetuals exchange, is set to complete the rollout of its highly anticipated v5 upgrade next week.Announced on June 7, dYdX’s v5 iteration introduces a suite of new features including isolated markets, batch orders, liquidity vaults, and new price oracles. The dYdX community voted to implement the v5 upgrade with 98.4% on June 3.DYdX commands a total value locked (TVL) just shy of $500 million, placing it among the top 20 DeFi projects by TVL​, data from DefilLama shows. The protocol ranks second among perpetual DEXes, sitting behind GMX with $544 million.DYdX is followed by Jupiter and Hyperliquid with $412 million and $392 million, respectively.The protocol’s multiple iterations have generated more than $120 billion in cumulative trading volume​, the dYdX Foundation shared in an April blog post.New featuresThe introduction of Isolated Markets is among the biggest changes introduced by v5. Previously, all markets on dYdX shared the same collateral pool, limiting the number of markets available. With Isolated Markets, each market now has a distinct collateral pool, enabling the launch of up to 800 new markets on the protocol.Isolated Margin is another key feature in the update. It allows traders to treat each market as an isolated position with distinct risk parameters, rather than having all positions cross-margined against a single pool of collateral.“Traders have the ability to confine collateral to a specific position and manually adjust the collateral for that given position,” dYdX said in an announcement. “We believe this will allow users to more intuitively understand and adjust their collateral management.”The update includes price oracle integrations from Slinky and Raydium, a Solana-based limit order book DEX. The Slinky integration will enable block-by-block price updates with improved latency by leveraging dYdX’s validators, while the Raydium oracle provides price data on all assets traded on the Raydium exchange.V5 also introduces batch order cancellations allowing users to cancel up to 100 short-term orders simultaneously.The update will additionally introduce liquidity provider (LP) vaults providing automated LP strategies in the coming weeks.Season 5 incentivesDYdX’s v5 launch will likely coincide with the project’s fifth season of incentives for users. The campaign will offer $5 million in DYDX tokens to traders and will run until mid-July 2024, pending a governance vote.The season will also introduce a multiplier for DYDX stakers, enhanced points for front-end trading activity, and separate trading reward allocations for major markets including BTC, ETH, and SOL. Season 5 will also distribute $100 deposit bonuses to the first 500 new accounts that sign up.Migration from Ethereum to CosmosIn 2017, Antonio Juliano launched dYdX as an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.DYdX ranked among Ethereum’s top DeFi protocols for several years, with the project migrating to a dedicated Layer 2 appchain with the launch of its v3 iteration in April 2021. However, dYdX exited the Ethereum ecosystem to deploy a Cosmos-based appchain with the deployment of its fourth version in November 2023.The project attracted funding from top crypto investment firms including Paradigm, Polychain, and Andreessen Horowitz over four funding rounds.

dWallet Network brings multi-chain DeFi and gaming trust protocols to Aptos


    dWallet Network, a multi-chain technology pioneer, has announced its expansion to Aptos, a leading Layer-1 blockchain known for speed and security, as per the latest updates shared with Finbold on June 7. 



The integration aims to introduce Zero Trust Protocols (ZTPs) and seamless multi-chain interoperability to Aptos’ (APT) decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming ecosystems. 



By leveraging dWallet’s Zero Trust architecture, ZTPs on Aptos will be able to execute transactions on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other blockchains.







Effortless multi-chain Web3 interactions 



Aptos stands out for its high-throughput, low-latency blockchain utilizing the Move smart contract language to create a robust platform for building advanced applications with minimal gas fees. 



With the dWallet Network integration, developers will have the tools necessary to create ZTPs with decentralized, noncollusive dWallets, enabling effortless multi-chain interactions across Web3.



This development is particularly significant for DeFi projects on Aptos, as it allows for native BTC and ETH transactions. 



dWallet technology



Additionally, dWallet Network’s technology introduces a foundational building block that allows asset control and enforces logic across any network. 



dWallet-generated signatures are indistinguishable from a regular user signature, even on non-smart contract networks like Bitcoin.



Such capability facilitates the creation of ZTPs that operate across networks without bridging or wrapping, upholding the principles of decentralization.



2PC-MPC protocols



To implement the dWallet’s Zero Trust primitive, dWallet Network uses a cutting-edge threshold protocol called 2PC-MPC.



This protocol enables the generation of an ECDSA signature requiring participation from both the end-user and numerous validators, potentially numbering in the hundreds or thousands.



Professor Benny Pinkas, a researcher at Aptos, commented on the protocol, stating:




“The dWallet team led pioneering cryptography research to introduce the innovative 2PC-MPC protocol, enabling multi-chain Zero Trust. I’m excited about developers in the Aptos ecosystem being able to develop ZTPs that operate seamlessly across all of Web3 in a cryptographically secure way.”




Toward a richer blockchain experience



Omer Sadika, Co-Founder of dWallet Network, expressed his enthusiasm about the expansion to Aptos, stating:




“We are excited to bring our decentralized, noncollusive dWallet building block to the fast and secure Aptos blockchain to enable ZTPs. Doing so broadens horizons for DeFi and gaming protocols within the Aptos ecosystem, and represents a significant leap towards realizing our vision of a seamless, Zero Trust and multi-chain future.”

Bitcoin's price has been pretty steady at around $70,000 for a while now, since mid-May. Despite this, the cryptocurrency's price has shown minimal movement, fluctuating within a narrow 6% range. This period of low volatility has frustrated market participants, particularly as Bitcoin's all-time high of $74,000 remains tantalizingly close yet seemingly out of reach.The lack of movement in the price has seriously annoyed traders and investors, and there has been a lot of talk about price manipulation. Adam Back, who is a contemporary of Bitcoin's mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto, addressed these concerns in a recent discussion. Back suggested that the current price suppression could be down to certain sellers who urgently need cash and are offloading their Bitcoin holdings. He said that these sellers, who might not be willing or able to wait for higher prices, have a limited amount of BTC to sell. Once they have sold all their holdings, the market might start to move up again, says the developer.  These comments match what a lot of people in the cryptocurrency community are feeling. Many think that things like institutional investors and trading platforms like ETFs and Coinbase might be influencing the market. The idea is that these entities, possibly in collaboration with official agencies, are trying to keep prices stable or suppressed for their own strategic advantage.When breakout?However, Back’s perspective offers a glimmer of hope in the current market conditions. The idea that current sellers' influence is temporary suggests that once their selling capacity is depleted, Bitcoin could resume its upward trajectory.BTC to USD by CoinMarketCapThis view lines up with how the price has moved historical, as there have often been periods of consolidation before big price surges.Summing up, while the current trading range and low volatility are testing the patience of market participants, Bitcoin's price could break free from its current stagnation, potentially reaching new highs once the immediate liquidity needs of these sellers are met.

Why Roaring Kitty 'Has Already Won,' According To Crypto Traders - GameStop (NYSE:GME) - Benzinga

Keith Gill and his massive bet on GameStop GME stock sparked a debate within the cryptocurrency community about its consequences and lessons for the crypto industry.What Happened: Roaring Kitty could become a billionaire on Friday if GME reaches $69 per share and many within the crypto space are celebrating Gill’s potential win.“Roaring Kitty has already won,” declared veteran trader TheFlowHorse.“After this is closed out, I think this whole performance goes down in history as one of the greatest of all time.” This sentiment resonates with the “David vs. Goliath” narrative often embraced by crypto investors, who see themselves challenging established financial institutions.Others highlighted key differences between the GME saga and the cryptocurrency market.Ludwig Wittgenstein observed that Roaring Kitty “waited years for his play, striking at the perfect moment in a career defining way.” That kind of patience, he writes, is not one of crypto investors’ strengths. They “can’t stand a ‘chop’ for more than three seconds, running from one narrative to the other.”This comment criticizes the perceived short-term focus and volatility within some crypto circles compared to Gill’s long-term strategy.Also Read: JPM - Benzinga">JPMorgan: US Crypto Regulations Signal Opposition To CBDCs And Non-Compliant StablecoinsWhy It Matters: The potential influx of new investors from the GME frenzy raises intriguing questions for the crypto space.Anthony Pompliano, investor at Pomp Investments, noted the potential crossover in his tweet: “This story will once again rip through the media and be covered everywhere. What becomes of those who step up, as they did last time? Do they come into our world, looking for that opportunity?”Cold Blooded Shiller explores this further, questioning if the success of meme stocks like GME could lead to increased interest in cryptocurrencies.“Can crypto capture some of the attention mindshare? Perhaps things like the GME memecoin on SOL… are also positives for the crypto story,” highlighting the potential for a “perfect storm” where retail investors, ignited by the GME story, might explore opportunities in crypto markets.Read Next: Is Robinhood’s Crypto Exchange Deal Really ‘Massive’ And The ‘First Domino To Fall?’Image: Shutterstock

Sky Mavis says $5.7M recovered from $600M Ronin exploit - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Sky Mavis has recovered $5.7 million of funds stolen from Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge, according to a Friday announcement from the team.The recovery was achieved through the collaborative efforts of various entities, including the Økokrim, a Norwegian law enforcement agency, and the FBI, said Sky Mavis. Specifically, Økokrim successfully froze and returned $5.7 million stolen from the bridge hack.
“We’d like to publicly extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who assisted in the recovery efforts, especially Økokrim and the FBI in the US, for their tireless effort to track down and recover these assets for the Axie and Ronin communities,” the team stated.
Allocation of recovered fundsSky Mavis noted that approximately 15% of the recovered assets will cover recovery efforts, while the remaining 85% will go to the Axie Infinity treasury.According to the team, recovering stolen crypto requires collaboration between law enforcement, legal professionals, financial experts, and blockchain specialists, including Chainalysis.In addition to $5.7 million in recovered funds, law enforcement has frozen an additional $40 million in stolen assets. However, recovering these funds will take longer, with no definitive timeline provided for their return.On March 29, 2022, the Ronin network suffered a major security breach, resulting in a loss of 173,600 ETH and 25 million USDC, totaling about $600 million.Following the incident, Sky Mavis raised $150 million to reimburse users. In April 2022, Binance reported that the exchange had recovered $5.8 million of funds stolen in the Ronin Bridge attack.Sky Mavis has since enhanced security measures, including partnerships with new validators like Google Cloud.

In a recent interview, Ripple’s Middle East and Africa Managing Director Reece Merrick shared his personal take on the company’s plans to create and launch its native stablecoin.He also explained why he believes it will be a success, while such popular USD-backed stablecoins as USDT and USDC have already existed in the market for many years. The video extract was shared by XRP enthusiast @BankXRP.Ripple's activity in DubaiIn particular, Merrick spoke about the sector he is in charge of, and part of it is Dubai where, recently, the Crypto Expo Dubai 2024 event took place. The executive stated that Dubai now offers “forward-thinking regulation” and a major network for Ripple to continue exploiting this region, taking up the manifold opportunities it offers.Currently, according to Merrick, Ripple has been in this area for four years, working not only on fintech expansion but also increasing crypto and blockchain adoption in that region. During the talk, the Ripple Middle East director also answered a few questions about Ripple’s plans to release its own stablecoin and take some of the market share from USDT and USDC that has been actively used not only there but around the world in general already.Ripple stablecoin's key USPWhen asked about the approaching development and the launch of the stablecoin by Ripple, Reece Merrick admitted that this seems to be a logical step for the company. Currently, he pointed out, there is a $150 billion market of stablecoins, and its is predicted to reach a staggering $2.8-$3 trillion by 2028. Besides, there is also significant demand for more businesses, which are compliant and regulated, to enter this space.Ripple now, according to Merrick, believes that there is a great need for a regulated USD-backed stablecoin to emerge on the market since around 60% of all settlements outside the U.S., including the Middle East region, are made in U.S. dollars.As for the unique selling point of Ripple’s stablecoin, Merrick said that the company has spent 12 years building a cross-border offering. “We have the infrastructure. The stablecoin was the next evolution of that.”

Fake Elon Musk Live Stream During SpaceX Launch


                                Elon Musk's Deepfake Version Deceive The Viewers During SpaceX Launch                                Over 35 YouTube channels live-streamed deepfake versions of Elon Musk during the recent SpaceX Starship launch, aiming to deceive space enthusiasts and crypto investors. The streams featured an AI-generated voice of Musk, promising viewers doubled returns on their cryptocurrency deposits.What’s The StoryOver 35 YouTube Channels live-streamed in the name of Elon Musk during the SpaceX launch. These fake streams were identified by cybersecurity researchers at Avast Threat Labs during the fourth experimental flight of SpaceX’s massive reusable spacecraft known as the Starship.  The actual event, as seen on SpaceX’s live stream, depicted the rocket re-entering Earth’s atmosphere and splashing down in the Indian Ocean as intended. However, the scam streams gained a lot of traffic by mimicking the genuine SpaceX accounts and having 170,000 viewers, which is likely to be inflated by bots to increase authenticity.The fake live streams showed Musk at a SpaceX event, speaking to the audience, while some of the streams slightly pixelated Musk’s face to hide the deepfake. An AI-generated voice replicating Musk’s speech pattern, including his stammers and hesitations said to the viewers, “This is not fake, this is a real giveaway, I guarantee it to you.” The voice instructed the viewers to send Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Dogecoin to specific addresses and guaranteed double the amount back.The streams also contained the sound of a simulated audience clapping, which helped to make it more realistic. “You get a unique opportunity to watch your crypto soar multifold as our rocket soars into space,” the AI voice said. However, the streams seemed to be genuine, but the participants were being scammed.Nine wallets belonging to three different scammers have received almost $34,000 by the 6th of June. However, it is still unknown how many people lost their money to the scammers. The fact that these wallets still contain a large amount of money points to the fact that some of the viewers were indeed victims.After the exposure, YouTube removed the fraudulent streams. However, the scammers were able to re-establish the channel renamed it to the Cardano Foundation, and proceeded to use deep fake live streams of Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson.Previous Scams Using Elon Musk's Name In Crypto SpaceElon Musk, a billionaire businessman and owner of Platform X and companies like Tesla, SpaceX is also a vocal supporter of Cryptocurrencies. Recently, a Deepfake video of Elon Musk was made with AI endorsing Crypto Trading services in Hong Kong. According to reports, a fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange named Quantum AI released a Deepfake Video featuring Elon Musk. This AI-generated deep fake video falsely triggers Crypto Users by claiming genuine crypto trading services featuring Elon Musk. It is not a secret that scammers often use Elon Musk’s image because he is a supporter of cryptocurrencies, especially the Dogecoin. In April, the same Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk found the same fake SpaceX YouTube accounts that used AI-generated Musks to advertise a double-your-money scam during the solar eclipse visible in North America.There are many rumors surrounding the market in the name of Elon Musk. One of the News circulating about Elon Musk having a Connection with Pi Coin and that he will accept Pi Coin as a payment option. However, no official statement regarding this matter was provided on social media or elsewhere. Failure to receive an official statement from Pi Coin left room for potential scams exploiting Elon Musk's name in the crypto space.ConclusionCoinGabbar highlights that it's important for viewers to be cautious and skeptical about the content they watch. This kind of scam uses advanced technology to create convincing fake videos. As the deepfake technology develops, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the original stream and a fake one. The fake streams featuring Elon Musk were part of a scam to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting viewers. Despite being taken down, the scammers quickly shifted to a new target, showing how persistent and adaptable they are. Therefore, in such a situation be cautious and double-check information online, especially when it involves sending money or personal information.Also Read: The Truth Behind SpaceX and Cryptocurrency Rumors

The analyst discussed the European Central Bank’s rate cuts and positive job data as potential bullish triggers.




Cryptocurrency analyst and Crypto Banter host Dylan recently highlighted a list of altcoins with potential upsides. In a video, he focused on tokens including Injective, Runes, Cosmos, Floki, and Bitcoin. He emphasized several positive market developments, noting a significant influence from Chinese market activities.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $71,284, reflecting a modest intraday uptick of 0.19%. Dylan indicated the key support levels of $70,600 and $69,800 as potential buying opportunities. Additionally, he highlighted the $72,000 mark as a crucial resistance level to watch for a bullish breakout.

In market news, Dylan discussed Christine Lagarde’s announcement of European Central Bank (ECB) rate cuts and positive job data. According to the analyst, this could trigger bullish sentiments in the market.



Dylan further referenced the S&P 500 index, noting potential bullish divergence but advising caution against premature market shorting. Overall, the Crypto Banter host emphasized the importance of monitoring key support and resistance levels. He also urged investors to stay informed about market developments and remain adaptable in their trading strategies.

$500 Million in Bitcoin Open Interest Erased After US Jobs Report


The recent US jobs report has significantly impacted the cryptocurrency market, wiping out over $500 million in Bitcoin open interest. 
This drastic market movement comes after mixed signals from the latest employment data.
US Jobs Report Slashes Bitcoin Open Interest

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that May saw an increase in hiring by 272,000 in the establishment survey. However, the household survey indicated a drop in employment and a rise in unemployment, which climbed to 4.0% — the highest since January 2022. 
Average weekly hours remained steady at 34.3, which often aligns with a soft economy. Additionally, average hourly earnings rose by 0.4% in May, marking a 4.1% increase from a year earlier.
Private sector hiring averaged just over 200,000 new jobs per month over the last three to six months, a notable increase from the 155,000 jobs seen at the end of the previous year. The index of aggregate weekly payrolls for private-sector workers, which combines hiring, wages, and hours, was up 5.4% over the last 12 months. This is a decline from the 6%-6.5% range observed a year ago, bringing it closer to 2018’s highs for the 2009-2020 cycle.
Following the report’s release, Bitcoin’s price saw a 2% correction, dropping from $72,144 to $70,668. This sudden price movement triggered significant liquidations. 

“Over $500 million of Bitcoin open interest wiped out within minutes. Shorts and longs were liquidated,” IT Tech noted.

The job report’s mixed signals have caused significant market fluctuations. While an increase in hiring suggests economic strength, the rise in unemployment and steady weekly hours indicate underlying weaknesses. 

The reaction from the crypto market reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic indicators but could soon revert.

“Unemployment just hit the highest level since COVID, and markets whipsawed down. Often, the first move on these announcements is the wrong one. Time will tell. But it for sure looks like unemployment has bottomed now, which suggests US liquidity will need to rise and rise soon. Rate cuts incoming,” Charles Edwards, founder at Capriole Investments, commented.

Big Shorters Bet $6.9 Billion Against Pro-Bitcoin MicroStrategy, How Are They Faring? | Bitcoinist.com


								Big shorters have placed significant bets on Michael Saylor’s business intelligence and software firm, MicroStrategy, selling stocks worth approximately $6.9 billion. Despite the substantial short positions, MicroStrategy stocks (MSTR), have continued to rise, outperforming investor expectations. 
MicroStrategy Big Shorters Lose Confidence
MicroStrategy short sellers are currently losing confidence as the price of MSTR stocks has skyrocketed over the past six months. The software intelligence firm currently holds a staggering $6.9 billion in short positions, constituting 23.14% of its market capitalization of nearly $30 billion. 

Short selling is a trading strategy where investors speculate on a stock’s potential decline. These investors, typically called shorters, borrow shares and sell them in the hopes that they will fall and then buy them back again at a lower price to take profits. 
In the context of MicroStrategy, the company’s stocks have not witnessed a significant decline since the beginning of the year. To be precise, MSTR stocks have risen by approximately 190.08% over the past six months. 
Numerous institutions are still hoping for a decline in MSTR’s price to enable them to generate profits. The high stakes and substantial capital involved in shorting MicroStrategy could pose a risk to several investors if the price of the stock does not plummet. 
Moreover, the tripling of MSTR stock value from $570 in December to $1,656 has made current short positions incredibly expensive. If the company continues to record more gains in its stock prices, short sellers may be put in a precarious position, potentially forcing many to exit their trades early to avoid bigger losses. 
Fintel, a financial data and intelligence provider has revealed a big short list, outlining the largest short positions disclosed by institutions to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the data, MicroStrategy’s biggest net short position holds approximately $2.4 billion. 
MSTR’s big short position is also the 27th largest amongst other institutions. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust currently ranks first, holding more than $114 billion in net shorts. 
MicroStrategy Stock Price Update
Short sellers have not been the only investors making big bets, as MicroStrategy founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Michael Saylor has been making substantial wagers on Bitcoin for the past few years. 

Earlier in January 2024, Saylor revealed he was selling shares to buy more Bitcoin. This decision comes after numerous Bitcoin acquisitions, positioning MicroStrategy as the top Bitcoin holder amongst public companies, according to CoinGecko. As of May 1, 2024, the software firm owned a staggering 214,400 BTC, valued at $15.2 billion, and accounting for more than 1% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. 
Moreover, in one year, MSTR stocks have risen by more than 469.66%, fueling a price increase to $1,656.63, as of writing. Google Finance data has disclosed that the stock value is still appreciating. In the last five days, MSTR is up by 3.67% and 31.75% over the past month.

8 Trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 24 Hours: What's Happening?

Shiba Inu on-chain data shows a substantial surge of whale-tier transactions, with an almost 7% increase in the last 24 hours. The volume of transacted SHIB exceeded $8 trillion, making the network far more active than it was last week.Large transactions worth more than $100,000 have grown dramatically in number. There were 140 of these transactions in the previous day, suggesting a resurgence of interest and potentially calculated actions by significant investors, or whales. The seven-day low of 99 transactions is drastically different from this uptick, indicating a change in the dynamics of the market.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView It is possible that whales are stockpiling SHIB in preparation for future price changes. This might be a calculated move to acquire a sizable holding of the token while values are thought to be favorable.Large volume purchases may result from institutional investors growing interest as they start to recognize the potential in Shiba Inu.The increased activity may also be the result of announcements or impending Shiba Inu-related developments and Shibarium. This includes information on new initiatives, collaborations and technological advancements within the SHIB ecosystem.Elevated interest is usually indicated by an increase in large transactions and trading volume, which can cause notable price fluctuations. As can be seen from the technical analysis, Shiba Inu is currently consolidating around its major support levels. SHIB appears to be holding steady, according to the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, but the increase in transaction volume could force the token to test new resistance levels.In general, the lack of volatility is a bigger problem for SHIB right now and will most likely become a source of suppressed performance, rather than growth.

Bitcoin Spikes To $72K, Then Drops $1,300 Following US Employment Report: What Happened? - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD fell over $1,300 from $71,997 to $70,663 within minutes following the release of the latest U.S. employment report.What Happened: The report indicated that non-farm payrolls increased by 272,000, surpassing the expected 182,000.Additionally, the U.S. unemployment rate rose slightly to 4%, higher than the anticipated 3.9%, while average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, above the forecasted 0.3%.The data likely led traders to infer that rate cuts in September have become less likely, causing the market’s brief correction. Bitcoin has recovered to $71,400 at the time of writing.Institutional Investors Drive Bitcoin AccumulationAccording to CryptoQuant, new whale wallets on the Bitcoin network are adding around $1 billion in BTC daily.This trend suggests significant institutional investment, with Bitcoin being transferred to custodial wallets. Over the past 30 days, permanent holders have accumulated an additional 70,000 BTC, the largest increase since late April. Additionally, Bitcoin demand from large investors is growing at a rate of 4.4% per month, indicating strong market support.The demand recovery for Bitcoin is also evident from the increased purchases of Bitcoin from spot ETFs in the USA. Holdings in these ETFs have grown from 819,000 BTC on May 1 to 859,000 BTC currently. CryptoQuant noted, “The purchases of Bitcoin from ETFs have so far this year been a meaningful source of demand.”Moreover, the selling pressure from traders has significantly decreased. The unrealized profit ratio for traders has reset to 0%, suggesting that heavy selling has been exhausted. This reduction in selling pressure enhances Bitcoin's market stability, reducing the likelihood of abrupt price drops.Also Read: Ethereum ETF Demand May Be Muted Compared To Bitcoin ETFs, Analysts SayDespite the positive trends in Bitcoin accumulation, stablecoin liquidity has not recovered its growth trajectory. The market capitalization growth of Tether's USDT, a proxy for fresh liquidity in crypto markets, has decelerated. This slowdown in stablecoin liquidity growth could potentially hinder a sustained price rally in the short term.What’s Next: These insights into Bitcoin’s market dynamics and institutional involvement will be key topics at the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Industry leaders will discuss the evolving landscape of digital asset investments, the role of institutional investors, and the impact of regulatory developments on market trends.Read Next: Franklin Templeton Goes Beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum, Eyes New Crypto-Focused Investment Fund For Institutional InvestorsImage: Shutterstock

Telegram launches Stars: they can be exchanged for TON

Today the founder of Telegram, Pavel Durov, officially announced on his channel the launch of Stars: the stars received can then be converted into TON via Fragment. 

The Telegram Stars and the conversion to TON
Stars is a new Telegram service that allows in-app purchases on Android and iOS on mini-apps. 
The mini-apps of Telegram are internal bots that can be used within the official Telegram app without needing additional installations. 
The most famous is @wallet, the integrated crypto wallet of Telegram. 
The traditional apps, on the other hand, need to be downloaded and installed, and this is why Telegram’s mini-apps, such as Notcoin, are growing so rapidly. The social nature of Telegram allows mini-apps to spread virally. 
Through Telegram Stars, users will be able to make payments within the mini-apps.
In fact, the service allows mini-apps to accept payments for digital services on Android and iOS, using a very simple payment method, in-app purchases.
Once the Stars are received, the owners or managers of the mini-apps can then convert them into Toncoin (the native cryptocurrency of TON) using the Fragment platform. 
Alternatively, they can use them to further promote their mini-apps on Telegram itself, with preferential conditions. 
Durov also points out that Apple and Google receive a 30% commission when users purchase Stars from them, and states that developers who reinvest the Stars in promoting their app will have an overall commission of almost 0%.
Toncoin
Toncoin has now been steadily in the top 10 of the criptovalute with the highest market capitalization in the world for a few months.
In fact, only two days ago it recorded its highest historical price, above $7.7, with a capitalization rising above 18 billion dollars. Just to give an idea, ADA of Cardano is at 17 billion, while AVAX of Avalanche is at 14. It won’t be long before TON manages to surpass even Dogecoin, ninth overall with 23 billion, and perhaps even XRP with 29.
TON is a blockchain that was created several years ago as a Telegram ICO, but was later halted by the SEC, which accused the company of issuing an unregistered security. 
Subsequently, the blockchain was detached from Telegram and officially made decentralized, even though behind the project there is always Telegram itself. 
Recently the company has been heavily promoting TON, so much so that the price of Toncoin has risen by 220% since the beginning of the year. 
The cryptocurrency TON landed on the crypto markets in August 2021, in the midst of a bullrun. 
After rising to $4.5 in November of the same year, it plummeted below $1 during the following bear-market. 
As recently as August of last year, it was around $1.2, but starting in September, it began a climb that first took it above $2.5, and then even above $7 in 2024. 
In particular, the latest real surge began in February of this year, when news started to come out about a real promotional campaign organized by Telegram itself. 
Telegram
Telegram is the second messaging app in the world behind only WhatsApp. 
It is, however, very different compared to the rival, because by now it is a true platform with various services, as well as a simple messaging app. 
In particular, its openness to the crypto world, with the launch of Toncoin and the integrated wallet, is making it a unique point of reference in the crypto sector. 
Recently, the remarkable success of the mini-app Notcoin has made it evident how useful it is for this platform to attract crypto users, and how convenient it is to use blockchain and cryptocurrencies to do business in the digital realm. 
The same NOT token of Notcoin, which landed on the crypto markets only last month at 11 thousandths of a dollar, recorded the all-time high five days ago at 28 thousandths, and still now hovers around 21 thousandths. 
The introduction of Telegram Stars on mini-apps further expands the use cases of TON on Telegram, because it effectively allows those who receive the Stars to use the Toncoin blockchain to monetize them. 
The crypto choice of Telegram might not only give further momentum to the spread of cryptocurrencies, but it could also constitute a significant competitive advantage for the messaging app itself against the competition.

Wormhole Launches Staking and Governance For W Token Holders - The Defiant

Wormhole’s governance mechanism is the first live example of its multi-chain governance protocol, MultiGov.Wormhole, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, deployed a multi-chain staking and governance mechanism for holders of its recently launched token, W.Launched on June 6, the governance system allows W holders to create and vote on governance proposals across Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. Tokenholders can move up to 100 million W tokens from Solana to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains to participate in governance daily.“Introducing stake for governance is a significant step toward decentralizing Wormhole,” Wormhole said. “This is your opportunity to participate in governance and influence the future direction of the Wormhole DAO and platform.”Users can participate in Wormhole’s delegated Proof of Stake governance model by staking their W tokens and designating their governance power to a governance delegate. Stakers are not forced to lock up their tokens and can unstake or restake at any time.Wormhole launched as a bridge enabling cross-chain transfers between Solana and other blockchains in 2021. On June 6, Wormhole handled approximately 188,800 cross-chain messages and $30 million worth of asset flows, according to WormholeScan.To date, Wormhole has processed more than 1 billion messages, $43 billion worth of cross-chain transfers, and supports 30 different blockchains.MultiGovWormhole’s multi-chain governance mechanism utilizes MultiGov, a new cross-chain governance mechanism leveraging Wormhole’s cross-chain interoperability protocol.“By allowing users to vote from whatever chain they are on you break down the barrier of high gas fees and the complexity/cost of moving funds, you [abstract] a lot of the complexity with chain-to-chain movement,” tweeted Robinson Burkey, the co-founder of Wormhole.Wormhole said any DAO on Solana, Ethereum, or EVM-compatible L2s can leverage MultiGov.Wormhole launched its W governance token in April. The project airdropped 6% of the token’s supply to more than 400,000 wallets.Last year, the protocol raised$225 million in token warrants at a $2.5 billion valuation in the largest crypto raise of 2023. The project notably suffered the second-largest DeFi exploit in February 2022 when it lost $320 million to hackers.The price of W is up 10% in the past 24 hours, last changing hands for $0.68, according to CoinGecko data. Daily trading volume also increased by 150%.Related: Wormhole's W Token Climbs to $2.5 Billion Market Cap Post Airdrop

Prison nears for Trump-supporting crypto promoters Bannon and Guo


Steve Bannon is finally going to prison, and Miles Guo is trying to get out of jail — although his trial isn’t going particularly well. The once-Donald-Trump-supporting crypto promoters might have hoped for a presidential pardon if Trump’s campaign for the 2024 US Presidency was successful. However, the pair find themselves increasingly estranged from Trump as he focuses elsewhere and, as a result, their hopes of a pardon look to be fading.
Any presidential pardon would have been the second for Bannon, who received a pardon in January 2021. Incredibly, Bannon has managed to fumble that once-in-a-lifetime clemency, and yesterday, a US District Judge ordered him to report to prison by July 1 for contempt of Congress.
Two years ago, 12 jurors convicted Bannon of refusing to provide documents and appear for a Congressional deposition. Nevertheless, the judge mercifully stayed his actual prison sentencing for those acts, pending appeals. Yesterday, however, the judge’s patience ran out. “I do not believe the original basis for my stay exists any longer,” the judge concluded.
Bannon was Trump’s White House chief strategist for half a year, then Trump fired him. Over the next few years, Bannon would go on to promote a series of failed crypto projects, including F*** Joe Biden (FJB), Himalaya Coin (HCOIN), Himalaya Dollar (HDO), and others.

Felon Steve Bannon supported Miles Guo’s crypto
One of Bannon’s favorite crypto founders was Miles Guo who used a variety of aliases: ‘Miles Kwok,’ ‘Brother Seven,’ ‘The Principal,’ or ‘Guo Wengui.’ Guo was the leader of the Himalaya-branded crypto project that Bannon promoted.
Unsurprisingly, like millions of other altcoins promoted by celebrities, Bannon’s and Guo’s tokens have collapsed to near-$0.
For his part, Guo is defending himself in his own criminal trial. US district judge Analisa Torres, who ruled somewhat favorably toward Ripple in its unrelated SEC lawsuit, is presiding over Guo’s billion-dollar criminal fraud trial.

Guo was a member of Mar-a-Lago and an ally of Trump republicans and once offered allegedly incriminating information about Hunter Biden’s laptop. He also fundraised for Trump’s ‘Million MAGA March’ and bankrolled a legal challenge to the 2020 election in Georgia.
On Thursday, Guo’s lead translator and confidante, Ya Li, cried on the witness stand while describing Guo’s sprawling, fraudulent crypto schemes. Lamenting her mistaken belief that Guo was helping investors make money or support legitimate political causes, she concluded, “the whole movement is a scam.”
Li’s final day of cross-examination continues today. The trial is led by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. Guo has been in jail for months awaiting trial and is widely expected to go to prison sometime after his trial concludes this month.

Hulk Hogan Memecoin Slammed in $17 Million Crypto Rug Smackdown


								The Wild West of cryptocurrency just witnessed another saloon brawl, this time courtesy of wrestling legend Hulk Hogan and his ill-fated meme coin, HULK. Hogan allegedly rug pulled his investors, wiping out millions in a digital bodyslam.





Hulk Hogan Crypto Crash – What Went Wrong?




The story goes like this: HULK tokens were riding high, with a market cap of $17 million, thanks in part to a social media blitz on Hogan’s accounts. Investors were giddy, primed for a moonshot.
Then, quicker than a leg drop off the top turnbuckle, Hogan’s posts promoting HULK vanished into thin air, taking the token’s value with them. HULK crashed faster than a folding steel chair, plummeting to a measly $11,000. Investors were left reeling, their dreams of financial bliss shattered like glass jaws in a steel cage match.
Hogan claims he never authorized the promotional posts in the first place. Was it a rogue social media manager channeling their inner “Hollywood Hogan?” A case of mistaken identity? The plot thickens faster than instant mashed potatoes.


Savvy crypto enthusiasts smelled a scam from the get-go. Incriminating evidence surfaced – recycled videos from December promoting a karaoke event, and a glaring lack of endorsement on the other platforms linked to Hulk Hogan. This wasn’t a strategic body slam, it was a piledriver onto investor trust.

Celebrity Memecoin Fallout




Hogan’s supposed rug pull isn’t an isolated incident; it’s the latest body blow in a string of celebrity-endorsed meme coin meltdowns. Just weeks ago, TV personality Caitlyn Jenner pulled a similar stunt with her Jenner coin, leaving fans feeling bamboozled. Boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather also entered the ring. After hyping the token “FLOYD” on social media, Mayweather abruptly deleted his promotional posts, sparking fears of another potential rug pull.
The only one seemingly immune to the takedown is Iggy Azalea, whose MOTHER coin is still being aggressively promoted to her millions of followers. But with the stench of celebrity shilling hanging heavy in the air, investors are right to be wary.

Buterin Slams Shady Memecoin Projects
This whole fiasco has drawn the ire of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who’s about as impressed with these memecoins as a referee is with a chair shot. He lambasted these projects for their lack of innovation and blatant attempts to exploit fans for a quick buck.


So, what’s the takeaway from this crypto cage match? If a celebrity is shilling a meme coin with promises of riches beyond your wildest dreams, approach it with the same skepticism you’d have towards a wrestler promising world peace.

Should Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Worry About Whales' Actions?


The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has been struggling to note bullish cues for weeks, which could continue over the coming weeks.
This is because the little support SHIB noted from its investors is now disappearing.
Shiba Inu Investors Pull Back

Shiba Inu’s price is expected to note some drawdown or sideways action due to SHIB holders’ skepticism. Evidence of this is visible in the whales’ activity and retail investors’ actions. 
The former are the most important group of investors as their moves directly impact price. A positive move leads to a rise, a negative result in a decline, and at the moment, it seems the latter could be the outcome. 
The total volume of transactions worth more than $100,000, generally associated with whales, has taken a dive. At the moment, the daily transaction volume of whales has dipped to a low of $30 million.

This decline in transaction volume is also met with high selling from SHIB holders, intensifying the bearishness.
The realized profits on the network have spiked massively, reaching a three-month high. Spikes in this metric emerge from investors selling their holdings. This selling is either the result of profit-taking or investors offsetting their losses.
In the case of SHIB, it is the latter since investors are moving their assets to secure whatever gains they have amassed.

Shiba Inu Realized Profits. Source: Santiment
This also indicates the surge in skepticism among SHIB holders.
SHIB Price Prediction: Consolidation Continues

Shiba Inu’s price is bound to move sideways since the investors are not explicitly bullish at the moment. SHIB could likely remain consolidated within $0.00002584 and $0.00002267. The larger range would keep the meme coin moving within $0.00002835 and $0.00002093.
The aforementioned cues also raise the chances of a decline, potentially sending SHIB to $0.00002267 or $0.00002093.

Shiba Inu Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
If Shiba Inu’s price does manage to breach the resistance at $0.00002835, it could establish a two-month high. This is key in sending SHIB to $0.00003000 to invalidate the bearish thesis.

Andrew Tate buys 10,000 of this crypto, plans to 'crash Solana'


    The crypto community has been familiar with Andrew Tate for some time due to his general fondness of Bitcoin (BTC) – a fondness that led him to proclaim in May that he is done with fiat and is going all in on cryptocurrencies.



More recently, Tate has apparently taken to expanding his horizons when it comes to the crypto market, first predicting Ethereum (ETH) is set to hit $4,000 soon and has, by June 7, seemingly declared war on Solana (SOL).



Indeed, on June 7, the social media personality made an X post with the attached gif of the Muppets’ Elmo in front of a fire stating that he ‘will crash the Solana network.’











Near the same time, Tate announced he had purchased 10,000 of a Madonna-themed token with the explanation he had done so ‘because f*ck Madonna,’ using all capitalized letters, thus complementing his usual belligerent style.







Andrew Tate’s trading warpath



Shortly thereafter, the former kickboxing star made yet another post promising he would acquire more cryptocurrencies of dubious value and hold them ‘diamond hands’ should said post be shared more than 2,000 times.



By press time, the post was retweeted nearly 5,000 times.



Holding an asset ‘diamond hands’ refers to holding it indefinitely, no matter the circumstances. 



The term originated as a strong sign of support and belonging to a community during the original meme stock craze of late 2020 and early 2021, and Tate is, indeed, reportedly participating in the GameStop (NYSE: GME) short squeeze of 2024.



Can Andrew Tate really crash Solana?



Despite Andrew Tate’s bold claim and massive social media following, truly crashing the Solana network might prove a tall order. Indeed, the blockchain is known for its consistent uptime and scalability and has, so far, been handling significant volumes successfully.



That being said, Tate might find some success in his latest endeavor given that, while Solana has been able to maintain significant uptime, it has been known to crash at times.



The blockchain’s token has also been performing exceptionally well in 2024 and is up as much as 69.63% year-to-date (YTD).



SOL YTD price chart. Source: Finbold



The strong 2024 performance came at the heels of a late 2023 rally, which saw SOL rocket from about $20 in October to above $100 on New Year’s Day, and Solana price today, at press time, stands at $171.14.

Bitcoin Runes Dominate BTC Transactions


Bitcoin transactions continue to grow following the halving, with data showing that much of the recorded demand comes from the Runes protocol. 
Since its launch, Runes has recorded at least 150,000 daily transactions, dethroning BRC-20, which now struggles to achieve 10,000 transactions.
Runes Dethrone BRC-20 and Ordinals as Protocol Transactions Surge

On-chain data shows that the Runes token standard has effectively sidestepped BRC-20 and Ordinals. According to Dune Analytics, the number of transactions on Rune has averaged at least 150,000 per day since its debut on April 20. The highest it has ever been was 753,584 on April 23.
On average, the share of Bitcoin transactions on Runes protocol relative to BRC-20 and Ordinals is also higher for Runes, coming in at around 40%. This trajectory comes as Runes makes creating fungible tokens on Bitcoin more efficient, unlike BRC-20, which uses the Ordinals protocol.
BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals have been controversial in the past amid complaints that they clog up the network and cause fee increases. Relative to simple peer-to-peer transactions, it is complex to create and transfer BRC-20 tokens. At the very least, one would need more space on the blockchain.

Casey Rodarmor, BTC developer and the creator of Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes, discussed the protocol’s pros and cons in his last appearance on Hell Money Podcast.

“If Runes are successful, they’ll drain liquidity, technology, and attention away from other cryptocurrencies, and bring it back to Bitcoin. I’m not creating a shitcoin [but] a venue for people to create shitcoins, which is possibly worse and more dangerous. We’ll see,” he said.

The Game-Changers for Bitcoin’s Future
Runes, BRC-20, and Ordinals have enabled Bitcoin to evolve and become more than just a store of value. Now, it is a platform for creative expression and complex financial instruments. The three token standards have progressively developed atop each other’s strengths and weaknesses, each better than the next.
Runes launched on April 20, when the fourth BTC halving happened. It increases the efficiency of creating fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network:

Enables off-chain transactions, thereby reducing congestion on the Bitcoin network and therefore facilitates more transactions to be processed quickly and cost-effectively.
Faster confirmation times and lower fees for users, which increase accessibility and practicality of Bitcoin transactions for everyday use.

The main similarity between BRC-20 and Runes is that both use Bitcoin and pay fees in BTC to create new tokens. BRC-20, launched in February 2023, was developed to create a standard for fungible tokens on Bitcoin. Its key highlights were affordability, speed, and increased accessibility relative to its forerunner, Ordinals. It also brought programmability, unlike Ordinals.
Ordinals launched in January 2023. Through Ordinals, Rodarmor enabled the creation of NFT-like “inscriptions” on the Bitcoin network. He described the Ordinals “theory” as a lens to view the Bitcoin blockchain and see the “trackable satoshis pop into view like Pokémon in the tall grass.” Its main challenge was high fees.

Social media analytics and investment tools confirm growing interest in Runes. According to Lunarcrush, BRC-20 has up to 37,169 interactions, while Ordinals has 34,299. Meanwhile, Runes has 53,008 at the time of writing.

Cardano Skyrockets Jaw-Dropping 180% in Volume: Bullish for ADA Price?

The trading volume of derivatives on Cardano (ADA) has shot up by a whopping 170% in just 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. This surge has propelled perpetual futures on the Cardano token to over half a billion dollars in trading volume during the same period.At the same time, data from CoinMarketCap shows that there has been a 117.88% increase in ADA trading volume on spot markets across various exchanges, with a total of $554.9 million traded. When you combine both spot and derivatives markets, the total trading volume of the Cardano token has reached a remarkable $1.09 billion in the past day.This surge in trading activity comes at a time when the price of the Cardano token is also on the rise. Since the opening of the latest daily candle, ADA has seen a solid increase of over 6%, reaching $0.49 — a level unseen in the past 17 days. ADA to USD by CoinMarketCapIt is likely that the volume growth is due to the FOMO among market participants. Over the past few weeks, the price action of the Cardano token has severely depleted investors and traders with its low-volatility movement. Against this background, jokes even began to appear that ADA at $0.45 is a stablecoin. The unexpected pump of the Cardano price could, on the contrary, provoke the fear and greed of market participants who were left behind, and make them ape into Cardano. In any case, the growth in trading volumes signals increased interest and attention on the popular cryptocurrency, which means increased volatility and drama.

Telegram's The Open Network is 2024's Fastest Growing Chain - The Defiant

TON's ecosystem has succesfully leveraged the messaging app's millions of users. Despite gathering little attention throughout the bear market, Telegram-integrated blockchain, The Open Network (TON), is the fastest growing major Layer 1 chain in 2024.TON’s total value locked (TVL) has increased 27 times to $386 million from $14 million this year, outpacing all competing Layer 1s and Ethereum Layer 2s on a percentage basis. The network’s native token, Toncoin, has surged too, boasting the 5th largest year-to-date gain among the top 50 tokens per CoinMarketCap, displacing competing Layer 1 Cardano from the top 10.The Open Network’s rapid ascent began in February with the launch of its Open League incentives program. The network’s ad-sharing program and Tether partnership have also driven activity and token price. TON’s growth showcases how a web2 app can successfully be a foundation for a strong web3 ecosystem, especially with a pre-existing user base of over 900 million monthly active users (MAU), like Telegram has.TON TVL vs. Price - DeFiLlamaSEC ScrutinyOriginally founded in 2013 by Pavel and Nikolai Durov, Telegram is the 4th most popular messaging app in the world by MAU.Recently, in an interview with Tucker Carlson, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov stated: “We'll probably cross one billion monthly active users within a year now”.The official Telegram team launched its blockchain, TON, in 2018 but faced scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was forced to shut down operations.In 2021, the project restarted development under the stewardship of the TON Foundation, which operates adjacent to Telegram.TON of IncentivesBut it’s been the last few months when the ecosystem started taking off. Bootstrapped by its incentives program called the “Open League”, the TON foundation is providing a multi-season rollout of $TON incentives.The Open League will distribute over $150M in rewards across the course of the program, split amongst a variety of categories such as DeFi, NFT, Token, and App ecosystems.As of March, Telegram announced its ad-sharing program built on TON. Channel owners that qualify will receive 50% of the revenue that Telegram makes from ads displayed in the respective channels, and payment distributions and withdrawals are moved exclusively through the TON blockchain.Built on TelegramThe majority of TON”s infrastructure is built on top of the messaging app, Telegram, to leverage its existing user base. TON-native wallet solutions such as Tonkeeper can operate directly within the messaging app. Tonkeeper wallets are also available as a separate mobile app or as a web application, and is currently the number 1 ranked finance app on Google Play.Tonkeeper transactions are routed through a Telegram channel, similar to how other Telegram bots function. These wallets allow for self-custody, payments, transfers, and access to applications such as NFT marketplaces, but instead of interacting with an installed browser extension, like most other Layer 1 chains, the functions are hosted in Telegram.TON raised $250 million in a 2022 round including Mask Network, FJ Labs, and MEXC Venture. The network also has strategic support from firms such as Animoca Brands and OKX. Last month, Pantera Capital announced their investment into TON, citing it as their “largest investment ever”.Pantera partner Ryan Barney wrote in a May 8 letter, “By leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and seamless UX with the vibrancy of TON’s emerging ecosystem, we believe TON has the potential to become one of the largest crypto networks.”DeFi on TONStill in its infancy, TON’s on-chain economy is small compared to Toncoin’s market cap of $17 billion. While its TVL soared this year, competitors such as Sui boast 85% more assets held in smart contacts and more native dApps, despite being valued nearly 70% lower.A sizable amount of the on-chain activity on TON takes place on the chain's largest native decentralized exchange (DEX), STON.fi, which hosts 67% of the total TVL. Outside of STON.Fi, and TON’s leading liquid staking solution, Tonstakers, DeFi on The Open Network is limited to a few small lending and derivatives platforms.Asynchronous PaymentsTON runs an asynchronous payment channel via two interacting networks called shard chains, that finalize transactions independently, and then confirm their states to the payment channel’s smart contract.This is different from other network designs, including Solana’s and Ethereum’s, which have synchronous payments, where one cannot begin the next transaction in a contract without confirmation of the initial transaction.On TON, the execution of smart contract functions will take place in a future block as opposed to the block the transaction is confirmed in. This can help the network handle high volumes of complex smart contract interactions.Blockchain Comparison. Source: MezenTON’s developer community is small. Electric Capital cites 175 monthly active developers on TON as of Dec. 31, 2023, compared to Solana’s 1,615. Despite this, TON touts the second-highest two-year growth percentage in terms of active developers, surpassed only by Celestia.The Future of TONOne of the primary goals for 2024 will be cross-chain interoperability, by integrating compatibility with Ethereum token standard ERC-20 , a founding member of the TON Core Dev Team, known as Dr. Awesome Doge on social media, said at the Web3 Festival held in April.The developer also said the team is building bridge support for other blockchains, including Bitcoin and Solana.Meanwhile, the token continues to outperform. Toncoin was the 13th best performer out of the 100 biggest coins by market cap in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko.The Open League incentives program is still underway and preparing to begin its Season 4. Season 3 concluded on May 29, and the TON foundation is currently accepting and reviewing applications for the next season's participants.

Hotter-than-expected jobs report shows mixed bag, markets dip - Blockworks


The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, much higher than analysts’ expectation of 190,000 additions. 
Unemployment rose to 4% in May — also higher than expected — marking its highest point since January 2022, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed. 
American equities initially dipped on the news before paring losses slightly. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were trading 0.2% and 0.3% lower, respectively, at time of publication. 
Bitcoin and ether similarly dipped in the hour following the report’s release. Bitcoin recovered to trade around 0.3% higher to $71,500 at time of publication while ether lost around 0.8% and was hovering around $3,800, according to data from Coinbase. 
Although the headline figure of 272,000 may suggest a labor market too hot for the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts in the fall, the report overall was still fairly hawkish, according to Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone. 
Average hourly earnings increased 0.4% month over month in May and 4.1% year over year, suggesting that the labor market is actually relatively tight, Brown said. 
“The May employment report seems unlikely to be a game-changer in terms of the Fed policy outlook,” Brown said. “[Federal Open Market Committee] members continue, unsurprisingly, to place greater weight on the inflation side of the dual mandate, and are likely to reiterate next week that they are yet to obtain the ‘confidence’ being sought on a return towards the 2% target to enable the first rate cut to be delivered.”
Rate cut expectations for September remained largely unchanged Friday after the report dropped. Fed fund futures showed a 52% chance that the first rate cut will come early this fall, about the same odds markets had earlier this week, according to data from CME Group. 
The Fed’s June FOMC meeting will begin Tuesday and central bankers will reveal their interest rate decision on Wednesday. Committee members will also report projections next week, including their target interest rate for December 2024 and predicted inflation figures. 
Ahead of the interest rate decision, markets will also get the latest Consumer Price Index figures, scheduled for Wednesday morning. The inflation figures will be a “much more significant event,” according to Brown, as central bankers will be looking to see core CPI declining on an annual basis.

Michael Saylor Changes Tone On Ethereum (ETH): Will Saylor Buy Ethereum ETFs? - Benzinga

Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, has been a strong proponent of Bitcoin, frequently discussing its benefits across various platforms. MicroStrategy owns more than 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply and Saylor's personal holdings. Despite his focus on Bitcoin, Saylor recently began speaking about Ethereum. Don't Miss:Saylor appeared on the "What Bitcoin Did" podcast at the end of May to discuss his views on Bitcoin and crypto. "Bitcoin was going to be the only asset securitized and offered as a spot ETF by the Wall Street establishment—and it was going to spread as the one legitimate crypto asset," Saylor noted. Saylor was alluding to the recent advancement of spot Ethereum ETFs to the next approval stage, which occurred just days before the interview. Although the outlook for approval was initially bleak for much of 2024, the SEC is now taking a closer look at each application. Speculation suggests that trading could begin by the end of the summer. The advancement of the Ethereum ETFs surprised everyone, including Saylor. Previously, Saylor believed that Bitcoin was the only crypto asset worthy of investment, with other cryptocurrencies merely imitating Bitcoin's success. However, the approval of the ETFs arguably legitimizes Ethereum in the eyes of institutional investors. Trending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.For years, Saylor has focused on Bitcoin's limited supply and its use of blockchain for transactions. However, during the interview, he acknowledged the advantages of Ethereum, noting that ‘digital art, NFTs, tokens,…DeFi' are all part of ‘an entire range of use cases' for crypto. Despite recognizing Ethereum's benefits, Saylor still believes Bitcoin will remain the leader in crypto. He noted that institutional investors might ‘allocate 5% or 10% to the crypto asset class, but Bitcoin will be 60% to 70% of that.' The Ethereum ETFs could attract new crypto investors who will also buy Bitcoin. This raises the question of whether Saylor will invest in the Ethereum ETFs. Based on his interview comments, his top crypto choice remains Bitcoin. While he acknowledges some benefits of Ethereum and other tokens, he believes these benefits will attract more people to Bitcoin. "I think that we are politically much more powerful [when] supported by the entire crypto industry," he said. Given this perspective, it seems unlikely that Saylor will make significant investments in Ethereum ETFs, though it is not entirely out of the question. Read Next:

Crypto Trader Michaël van de Poppe Outlines Top Altcoin Gems for This Cycle - Here Are His Picks - The Daily Hodl


								Closely followed crypto strategist and trader Michaël van de Poppe is naming his top altcoin picks for the current cycle.
In a new strategy video, Van de Poppe tells his 165,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin (BTC) investors are likely to start funneling their profits into altcoins, sending alt projects much higher.










“Altcoins are going to do really well. They are likely going to do that. They have been suffering a lot in the past period because of the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but I think that the rotation is going to be very close towards an upside for altcoins.”
The trader says that he is now bullish on several newer altcoins.
“So the altcoins that I had in my portfolio are likely going to do well, but they will be outperformed by newer assets.”
Among his newer top alt picks is Renzo (REZ), a liquid re-staking token for EigenLayer.
“Seeing the price action that has been taking place, I rotated some of the altcoins that are relatively old like ATOM, like Curve in my portfolio and I swapped them for newer coins. One of those newer coins is some project that I started to tweet which is Renzo.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/YouTube
Renzo is trading for $0.172 at time of writing, up slightly in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the trader believes that Portal (PORTAL), a project that aims to unite games from different blockchains on its cross-chain token platform, has a lot of upside potential this cycle.
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/YouTube
Portal is trading for $0.97 at time of writing, down 3.5% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the trader says cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole (W) could post big gains.

Wormhole is trading for $0.66 at time of writing, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours.

Kevin O'Leary Advocates For Strict Regulatory Compliance: Implications For Digital Assets - Benzinga

“Shark Tank” judge Kevin O’Leary, renowned for his candid opinions, has recently voiced strong views on the necessity of regulatory compliance for both Chinese companies and cryptocurrencies. His remarks reveal a consistent push for market integrity and the vital role of regulation in attracting institutional investors.In a recent appearance on FOX Business’s Claman Countdown, O’Leary stated, “I want EVERY Chinese company that doesn’t comply with US stock exchange rules to be DELISTED.” This firm stance underscores his broader belief that strict regulatory adherence is essential for maintaining market integrity. O’Leary’s call for delisting non-compliant Chinese companies is part of his larger advocacy for transparent and regulated markets, which he believes are crucial for investor confidence and market stability.Crypto Regulation, Institutional InvestmentAt Benzinga’s Crypto Unlocked event, O’Leary drew parallels between his stance on Chinese companies and the need for regulation in the cryptocurrency market. He emphasized that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies need institutional investment to reach their full potential. “I want to see Bitcoin at a hundred thousand dollars. It’s never going to get there if it’s never going to be owned by institutions,” he said. O’Leary highlighted that for Bitcoin to achieve such heights, a regulatory framework that eliminates fraud and encourages legitimate investment is essential. Just as with Chinese companies, he believes that cryptocurrencies can only gain the trust and investment of major financial institutions through strict regulatory compliance.Transitioning from Chaos to StabilityDescribing the current state of the cryptocurrency market as the “Wild West,” O’Leary stressed the necessity of moving towards a more regulated and stable environment. “We’ve got to open it up, and we’ve got to get rid of the role players and the fraudsters,” he added. This transition is crucial for attracting institutional investors and fostering substantial growth in the value of cryptocurrencies.The Future of Digital AssetsThese themes will be central to discussions at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event, scheduled for November 19 at Convene 225 Liberty Street, NYC. The event will gather industry leaders to explore the state and future of digital assets, offering attendees the chance to engage with experts, network with peers, and participate in executive roundtables.Since its launch in 2022, the conference has drawn thousands of participants. The 2024 event promises an enhanced agenda and impactful discussions on regulatory compliance and institutional investment.Market Integrity and Financial HealthO’Leary’s advocacy for strict compliance and elimination of non-compliant entities aims to foster a healthier market environment. His views align with the goals of Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event, making it a timely and relevant forum for stakeholders to discuss the future of digital assets and alternative investments.In conclusion, Kevin O’Leary’s recent comments on regulatory compliance underscore the steps needed to advance the digital asset market. The upcoming Benzinga event will delve into these critical topics, providing insights into the future trajectory of cryptocurrencies and the broader financial market.Image: By Ontario Chamber of Commerce via Flickr

50 Cent's Bitcoin Earnings: A Journey from 'Animal Ambition' To Millions - Benzinga

Ten years ago, Grammy-winning rapper 50 Cent made a groundbreaking decision to accept Bitcoin as payment for his album “Animal Ambition.” This move, which initially appeared experimental, has resulted in substantial financial gains for the artist over the past decade.In 2014, 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, opted to accept Bitcoin for his fifth album, accumulating around 700 Bitcoins. Bitcoin was priced at approximately $662 per unit at that time, bringing in about $460,000 from album sales.Bitcoin’s Rise in ValueFast-forward to 2024, and Bitcoin’s value has surged dramatically. According to data from Benzinga Pro, each Bitcoin is worth $68,973. This means that the Bitcoins collected by 50 Cent are now valued at an astonishing $48 million.Interestingly, while 50 Cent initially confirmed his Bitcoin holdings, he later denied owning any in a bankruptcy filing. This contradiction has sparked discussions about the volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market.Implications for Digital Assets50 Cent’s venture into Bitcoin underscores the potential of digital assets as stores of value. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has experienced substantial growth, increasing its value more than 100 times. Despite facing several bear market cycles, including a notable downturn after the FTX collapse, Bitcoin has consistently rebounded.The artist is not alone in the music industry when it comes to embracing cryptocurrency. Rapper Snoop Dogg has also publicly supported Bitcoin and discussed his holdings, further emphasizing the growing acceptance of digital currencies among mainstream figures.Future of Digital Assets ConferenceThis story aligns closely with the themes of the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets conference, set for Nov. 19 at Convene in New York City. The event promises to gather leaders in the digital asset space and offer insights into the evolving landscape of alternative investments.Since its inception in 2022, the conference has drawn thousands of participants, and this year’s edition is expected to continue that trend with an enhanced agenda. Attendees will have opportunities to network, engage in one-on-one meetings, and participate in executive roundtables.Broader ImpactsBitcoin’s increasing value and its adoption by high-profile figures like 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg highlight the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. This shift is not just a trend but a significant development in the financial world, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin’s performance this year, with a 61% increase year-to-date, reflects the growing institutional interest in digital assets. The upcoming Benzinga event will provide a platform for exploring these trends further and discussing the future trajectory of digital assets.Now Read: Bitcoin Spikes To $72K, Then Drops $1,300 Following US Employment Report: What Happened?Image: Shutterstock

Bitcoin Steady At $71,000 as Open Interest Swells to Nearly $39 Billion - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDerivatives traders have taken a bullish stance on Bitcoin, as open interest in the leading cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $38.76 billion, according to derivatives analytics platform Coinglass.This change in Bitcoin’s open interest represents a 6.7% increase from its previous all-time high, which stood at 36.31 billion in March earlier this year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed their second-highest net inflows for the year earlier this week.Notably, the cumulative net inflow in Bitcoin spot ETFs crossed the $15 billion mark and currently stands at $15.56 billion at the time of writing, according to data analytics platform Sosovalue.In a note shared with Decrypt, Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick have pointed out that institutional investors are flocking to buy Bitcoin spot ETFs.“The recent recovery in inflows started in mid-May which was right around the time 13F filings started to appear for end Q1 holdings of the BTC ETFs. They showed very strong and broad holdings data. For example, Blackrock’s IBIT had 414 reported holders including large banks, hedge funds, state pension funds etc.," he wrote in the note.Case in point: Medical technology firm Semler Scientific announced that it has purchased Bitcoin worth $17 million and that the firm plans on spending another $150 million on Bitcoin in the future.Standard Chartered analysts are expecting the price of Bitcoin to cross its all-time high by the end of the week if the U.S. payroll data is favorable. Further, they forecast that the price of Bitcoin will reach $80,000 by the end of the month, barring any negative surprise in the payroll data.The British banking heavyweight has reiterated that the price of Bitcoin will be positively affected if Donald Trump wins the upcoming U.S. presidential election.The note suggests that the price of Bitcoin could reach $100,000 as the elections begin and can surpass the $150,000 mark by the end of the year if Trump wins his second term as U.S. president. If Bitcoin does manage to surpass the $150,000 mark, it will enter the elite club of financial assets that have a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion. And if it manages to do that, it will be bigger than the entire $2.8 global market cap as it stands today.Last week, Donald Trump was convicted on all 34 charges in his hush money trial. He has become the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. But despite the guilty verdict, Trump’s campaign received donations amounting to $52.8 million within 24 hours, according to a report.Users on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, are speculating that Trump will likely win the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Trump’s odds are at 56%, while the incumbent U.S. president Joe Biden’s odds stood at 35% at the time of writing.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Steam ordered to give up ‘Crypto King’ login after $280K moved via CS2 skins


A judge has ordered the owners of video game marketplace Steam to freeze the accounts of Ontario’s self-proclaimed ‘Crypto King’ after he transferred over $500,000 CAD ($430,000) worth of assets across video game platforms during his bankruptcy.
On Thursday, Ontario’s Superior Court judge Justice Black approved the order two weeks after Aiden Pleterski was found trading and selling Counter-Strike skins, specifically high-value virtual knives, in March. He spent $382,000 CAD ($280,000) on a third-party skin trading site and $207,000 CAD ($151,000) on various other platforms. 
According to CTV News Toronto, the order requires Valve Corporation to share the login details of the ‘Crypto King’s’ Steam account with bankruptcy trust Grant Thornton. Both Valve and Pleterksi have rejected repeated requests from the trust for roughly a year. 
Screenshot taken from an earlier iteration of Counter-Strike. Weapon skins can sell for over $1 million.
On May 15, Pleterski was arrested and charged with money laundering and fraud by Ontario police. Pleterski owes investors $40 million CAD ($30 million) he promised he would invest in crypto. 
According to the bankruptcy trust, only 18.5% in investor funds has been recovered from Pleterski since bankruptcy proceedings started in 2022. Fraud recovery lawyer Norman Groot said, “It’s quite apparent that full recovery from their losses is not coming through the bankruptcy process.” 
Grant Thornton claims Pleterski has adopted a ‘catch me if you can’ approach. The 25-year-old has reportedly failed to hand over a $360,000 CAD ($260,000) luxury watch while financing his international traveling with undisclosed Scene+ points (a spend-and-earn reward program).

Indeed, Pleterski has been streaming himself as he travels across the world, playing with $206,000 CAD ($150,000) worth of Lego and driving McLarens and Lamborghinis. He also frequently gambled while livestreaming and at one point described himself as a professional streamer who’s “unemployed with income.”
At Thursday’s hearing, the trust also requested a two-year extension to his bankruptcy. The judge allowed Pleterki’s lawyer a month to respond to the extension request so long as Pleterski gives up his Binance and Steam logins while reframing from holding a credit card or soliciting investments.

Shiba Inu: What rising whale interest tells us about SHIB's future - AMBCrypto



Shiba Inu experienced significant whale activity, raising questions about future price volatility.
Despite increased transactions, overall network activity for SHIB showed a decline.

Shiba Inu [SHIB] has recently caught the attention of major investors, despite its current price dip. The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has reported a significant uptick in whale transactions for SHIB, hinting at possible major moves.
Whale watch: SHIB’s market stir
Despite a retracement of 2.3% decline over the past week, bringing SHIB to a trading price of $0.00002526, whale activity around this altcoin has intensified. 
Santiment’s recent analysis revealed that SHIB was among a few altcoins that experienced a surge in transactions valued at $100,000 or more, an indicator often associated with substantial investor moves. 
This “Whale Transaction Count” suggests that significant capital movers are actively trading or repositioning their stakes in SHIB.
Source: Santiment
Large-scale transactions like these are crucial as they imply that high-net-worth entities or ‘whales’ are taking notable positions in the coin, which could forecast upcoming volatility. 
However, it’s challenging to determine whether these moves are accumulative buys or preparatory sells as the data does not specify the nature of these transactions.
The activity level of these whales can serve as a barometer for the altcoin’s potential price movements. A continued high transaction count could lead to increased price fluctuations in the near term.
 Santiment’s report suggests that the current spike in whale transactions might be a sign of accumulation, where investors are possibly increasing their holdings in anticipation of future price increases.
Shiba Inu’s Active Addresses decline as Open Interest grows
However, not all indicators are bullish. The number of active SHIB addresses has seen a significant decrease, dropping from a peak of over 150,000 in March to below 30,000 currently.
 This decline in active addresses could indicate waning interest or reduced overall trading activity, potentially leading to downward pressure on prices.

Meanwhile, open interest in SHIB has seen a slight increase of 2.21% over the past 24 hours, reaching a valuation of $92.22 million. 
This rise in open interest, coupled with a decrease in trading volume, which has fallen by approximately 38.52% in the same period, suggests a cautious market sentiment towards SHIB.

Why Bitcoin Hasn't Hit $100,000 Despite Huge ETF Inflows


								Despite substantial inflows into US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), with more than $1.5 billion added in just the last three days and an unprecedented 18-day streak of positive inflows, BTC’s price remains well below the highly anticipated $100,000 mark. The digital currency trades at around $71,000, a 50% increase since the ETFs’ inception but short of setting a new record high.
Charles Edwards, CEO of Capriole Investments, shared insights via a post on X addressing the community’s burning question: “Why aren’t we at $100,000 yet?” According to Edwards, the answer lies in several key factors beyond just the ETF inflows.
Why The Bitcoin Price Isn’t Rallying Higher
Edwards points out that US spot ETFs have absorbed 200% of the BTC mined since their launch in mid-January, a stark indication of robust demand. Despite such aggressive accumulation, the price surge expected by many market observers hasn’t materialized.

“The inflow into Bitcoin ETFs represents a historically significant demand, yet we’re observing a counterbalance primarily due to long-term holder distribution,” Edwards explained. From an all-time high of 57% in December 2023, the share of BTC’s total supply held by long-term holders (those holding for 2+ years) has diminished to 54%. This shift translates to roughly 630,000 Bitcoins, about 300% of the year’s total BTC purchases by all US ETFs.
“This 3% shift, while seemingly minor, represents a substantial volume of Bitcoin moving from the strongest hands in the market to potentially more speculative or short-term oriented investors,” Edwards noted. Additionally, some of this selling is not pure market exit but rather transitions from older investment vehicles like Grayscale’s BTC Trust to newer ETF products, which may distort the perception of selling pressure.

Edwards also emphasized that the effects of the halving have yet to materialize. “With the daily Bitcoin issuance dropping by 50% in April, we will likely see the delta between ETF consumption and Bitcoin mined widen a lot over the next year. It also takes full quarters for institutions to review, sign-off and allocate (at best). So the major ETF flows are likely still ahead of us,” he stated.
Market timing and macroeconomic conditions further compound the situation. Edwards pointed out that June traditionally marks a lull in financial markets, including Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, as it aligns with a risk-off sentiment among major asset managers. “Moreover, since the March peak in Bitcoin’s price, USD liquidity has been relatively flat and even slightly negative. This liquidity environment is crucial as it influences investor capacity to inject capital into risk assets like Bitcoin.”
Looking ahead, Edwards remains optimistic but cautious. He outlined three catalysts that could drive Bitcoin’s price to $100,000 and beyond: “Increased daily buying volumes from ETFs, a decrease in selling from long-term holders, and a rejuvenation in US liquidity are essential for robust price appreciation. While these factors may align in the future, the exact timing remains uncertain.”
At press time, BTC traded at $71,659.

Celestia (TIA) Maintains Bullish Momentum - What's Next?


TIA is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, finding support at key technical levels despite facing resistance from the daily Ichimoku Cloud.
Let’s closely examine the price action of TIA, one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies over the past several months.
TIA Experiences Rejection by Daily Ichimoku Cloud
The price of Celestia (TIA) is showing rejection from the upper boundary of the daily Ichimoku Cloud.
The Ichimoku Cloud is acting as resistance, with the price struggling to break above it. Additionally, the 100 EMA (Blue line) at $12.03 is serving as a mid-term resistance level.
The price is currently hovering around $10.73, indicating it is struggling to break both the Ichimoku Cloud and the 200 EMA (in Green).

The current price level of $10.73 is below the 100 EMA, suggesting resistance at $12.03. A successful breakout above the 100 EMA could lead to the price testing the 200 EMA and potentially moving above the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a bullish momentum.

The price of TIA has recovered 46% from its local low of $7.30 set in mid-April, showcasing strong bullish momentum.

Despite the recovery, the price is struggling to break through the Ichimoku Cloud and the 4-hour 200 EMA, indicating significant resistance at these levels.
Support and Resistance Zones Highlighted by Volume Profile
The chart’s volume profile on the right side represents the trading volume at various price levels over a given period.
The areas around $10.50 and $12.00 show higher trading volumes. This suggests these levels are critical points where buyers and sellers have been most active, providing strong support and resistance.

The gaps or lighter areas in the volume profile indicate less trading activity, which, due to lower liquidity, often leads to faster price movements through these levels.
Volume Profile Shows TIA Approaching Low Liquidity Zone
The 4-hour chart indicates a bullish sentiment in the mid-term, with the price finding strong support at the lower boundary of the 4H Ichimoku Cloud. 
TIA is currently heading towards the upper boundary of the 4H cloud. However, significant resistance levels are expected at the daily EMA lines depicted in the 1-day chart.

The 4-hour chart indicates a bullish sentiment in the mid-term, with the price finding strong support at the lower boundary of the cloud. 

The 4H EMAs are anchored at the lower boundary of the Ichimoku Cloud, providing crucial support levels. It could signal an imminent price drop if the price breaks below these EMAs. Traders should place stop losses wisely below these levels, considering their leverage to manage risk effectively
Volume Profile Indicates TIA Nearing Low Liquidity Zone
The uncolored areas in the volume profile indicate regions with high trading volume. These are critical levels where significant buying and selling have occurred, making them strong support and resistance zones.

$10.40 – $10.60: This range has witnessed substantial trading activity, suggesting it is a significant support zone. The price recently rebounded from this area, reinforcing its importance.
$11.00 – $11.20: Another high volume area that the price is currently approaching. This zone is likely to act as a formidable resistance level.
The price is approaching a critical zone that could be easily broken due to its low liquidity. The $10.90 to $11.00 range is a crucial area to monitor.

A breakout from this zone is likely to propel the price towards exiting the 4-hour Ichimoku Cloud or at least testing its upper boundary.
Strategic Recommendations
The price of Celestia (TIA) faces rejection from the upper boundary of the daily Ichimoku Cloud, indicating resistance. If Bitcoin reaches an all-time high in the mid-term, the upward movement is expected to continue rising to $11.50.

The 100 EMA at $12.03 is also serving as a mid-term resistance level. 
The 4-hour chart indicates a bullish sentiment in the mid-term, with the price finding strong support at the lower boundary of the 4-hour Ichimoku Cloud and the 4-hour EMAs. 
TIA is heading towards the cloud’s upper boundary, but significant resistance is expected at the daily EMA lines. 
Consider placing stop losses just below the 4H EMAs to manage risk effectively. This is particularly important if the price breaks below these EMAs, as it could signal an imminent price drop.

XRP Price Goes $3? Record Increase in Millionaire Addresses Hints at Unexpected XRP Explosion ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
According to data from the cryptocurrency data analytics platform Santiment, the number of addresses holding at least one million XRP has reached a new all-time high. This surge often precedes significant price gains for the coin.



According to Santiment’s data, XRP has recently experienced a strong upsurge, pushing it to seek a high of $0.57. But what stands out most is that the so-called “millionaire addresses” of XRP have continued to hit new record highs of over 2,013. This is one address less than the previous record of 2,014 recorded in June 2023, following a major victory by Ripple against the SEC in its legal battle to prove that XRP is not a security.



Is a new bullish rally approaching for XRP?



Historically, when similar peaks occur in the number of millionaire XRP holders, Ripple’s native coin has seen significant price increases. Last June, after reaching its all-time high of millionaire addresses, the price of XRP almost doubled in a month, rising from $0.45 to nearly $1. However, it has not managed to retest those highs since then.



The renewed enthusiasm of large investors for XRP may be due to the recent announcements made by Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, who publicly voiced objections to the SEC’s request to impose fines of $2 billion on Ripple for historic institutional sales of its cryptocurrency XRP.



Alderoty argues that regulators’ request for millions in sanctions is disproportionate since the case did not involve allegations or findings of reckless or fraudulent conduct by Ripple. Furthermore, the company achieved several significant victories in some of the key litigation issues.

&nbsp



Therefore, Alderoty believes that the SEC’s request for an exorbitant fine is another example of its intimidation campaign against the cryptocurrency sector in the United States. Meanwhile, the lawyer noted that Ripple maintains confidence that the judge overseeing the case will address this final phase of sanctions and remedies fairly and impartially without being swayed by the SEC’s excessive demands.



Although an exact date for the conclusion of the SEC’s case against Ripple is not yet known, crypto investors continue to closely monitor the outcome of this case, as its conclusion will likely trigger a series of significant events around XRP and the crypto industry in general.



Thus, while the increase in millionaire addresses is often interpreted as a significant bullish signal indicating that large investors and whales are accumulating XRP in anticipation of an imminent rally, everyone is eagerly awaiting the outcome of the case against Ripple for a clearer vision of where the cryptocurrency is heading.



At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.524 after rising by 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Could this be the start of the bullish rally Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse predicted as XRP sets its course to $3?

Keith ‘RoaringKitty’ Gill Could Reach Billionaire States if $GME Rises to $67 | Cryptoglobe


                                
Keith Gill, known on X as RoaringKitty and DFV on Reddit, could become a billionaire through his bet on the popular meme stock GameStop (GME) if the price of the firm’s shares hit $67.5, given his massive position.



According to a recent report by the Kobeissi Letter, GME’s price surged to an impressive $67.5 during Thursday’s after-hours trading session and given Gill’s substantial holdings, which include both shares and options, he would have over $1 billion in his position if the market opened with the shares at that value.



Per the shared data, if GME were to open above $67.5 his share position would be worth around $325 million, while his options would be worth around $700 million, and combined both would make him a billionaire and lead to an $850 million gain on his position.







The trading session, however, saw the price of GME plunge with data showing shares are now trading at $37. As reported, Gill’s position is so large that at one pointed it surged by over $78 million in a single day.



On Reddit, RoaringKitty shared that he owns 5 million GME shares and 120,000 $20 call options which he has been accumulating over time.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

It’s worth noting that the recent meme stock trading frenzy started after RoaringKitty returned to social media from a three-year hiatus that ended after his testimony in Congress.



RoaringKitty’s current portfolio, according to his latest updates on Reddit, is at around $586 million.







AMC Entertainment (NYSE; AMC), a movie theater chain, also experienced a significant uplift, as did various lesser-known cryptocurrencies associated with Roaring Kitty and GameStop.



Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has assured investors that the trading platform is well-prepared for the anticipated GameStop frenzy, emphasizing significant infrastructure improvements made to handle such market volatility while speaking on Fox Business.



Notably the trading platform Gill has been using, E*Trade, is reportedly considering banning the trader over potential stock manipulation according to the Wall Street Journal.

Franklin Templeton Altcoins Fund Sparks Crypto Portfolio Changes


Franklin Templeton, managing approximately $1.64 trillion in assets, is reportedly exploring the launch of a private fund for institutional investors focused on altcoins. 
This move signals a strategic expansion beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. It reflects the growing interest in diversified crypto assets among institutional investors.
Franklin Templeton Eyes Altcoin Fund
A recent report reveals that Franklin Templeton aims to provide institutional investors with exposure to altcoins through a new fund. The initiative also offers staking rewards, potentially enhancing the appeal of altcoin investments. 

While specific altcoins were not disclosed, Franklin Templeton has praised Solana’s significant growth. 

“On Solana, we see Anatoly’s vision of a single atomic state machine as a powerful use case of decentralized blockchains, lowering information asymmetry. And we are impressed by all the activity seen on Solana in Q4 2023: DePIN, DeFi, Meme Coins, NFTs, Firedancer,” Franklin Templeton said. 

Moreover, Messari reported Solana’s spot decentralized exchange volume surged by 319% to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024.

“Network activity, measured by non-vote transactions and fee payers, continued to rise in Q1. Average daily fee payers increased by 214% QoQ to 597,000, reaching a peak of over 2 million on March 17. The growth in addresses was largely driven by memecoin trading. Average daily non-vote transactions increased by 71% QoQ to 70 million,” analysts at Messari wrote.

Franklin Templeton’s involvement in the crypto market is already substantial, with notable projects including a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched in January. The firm also advocates for a spot Ethereum ETF, which is currently pending approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

This ongoing engagement with major altcoins underlines Franklin Templeton’s commitment to broadening its crypto asset portfolio.

“We are excited about ETH and its ecosystem. Despite the midlife crisis it’s recently experienced, we see a bright future with many strong tailwinds to push the Ethereum ecosystem forward,” Franklin Templeton wrote.

This potential move by Franklin Templeton sends a clear message to crypto analysts and investors. For instance, analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently adjusted his crypto portfolio to focus more on altcoins, anticipating higher returns. 
Michaël van de Poppe’s Portfolio Reshuffle
Van de Poppe cited the increasing interest in the Bitcoin ETF and the expected approval of the Ethereum ETF as significant market movers. He also emphasized the importance of crypto portfolio management in maximizing returns. 
As a result, he decided to drop Cosmos (ATOM) due to its recent underperformance. Despite a significant correction of up to 50%, it did not meet his expectations for recovery and growth. 
Another altcoin removed from his portfolio, Curve (CRV), experienced a swift run of approximately 130% from January to March, only to fall back significantly. Finally, despite being fundamentally strong, Polygon’s (MATIC) persistent underperformance led Van de Poppe to exclude it from his portfolio. 


“I just see less arguments of having them in my portfolio as they are underperforming heavily. I want to be positioned into coins that do not have these back holders and are a solution for a problem that we have been getting into the previous cycle and are likely to have a higher return,” Van de Poppe explained.

After seeing a listing correction and subsequent rise close to 8x against Bitcoin, Van de Poppe views Sei (SEI) as a promising investment. He expects it to rebound strongly, especially given the current momentum in the Ethereum ecosystem.
A newer addition focused on gaming, Portal (PORTAL), has experienced a significant drop but shows potential for high returns. With a fully diluted valuation of $1 billion, it aligns with Van de Poppe’s strategy of targeting promising new listings. Similarly, Wormhole (W) is another new addition to his portfolio and is expected to perform well due to recent favorable market narratives and Binance listings.

Despite the rising interest in altcoins, the broader crypto market has seen substantial shifts. 
Customers Bank, servicing major firms like Galaxy Digital, Coinbase, and Circle, has reportedly told some altcoin hedge-fund clients that it can no longer provide banking services. This comes after the collapse of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank last year, reflecting the ongoing challenges faced by crypto companies in accessing traditional banking systems

Dogecoin (DOGE) Sees Epic Surge of $1 Million Transactions, What's Going On?

Dogecoin (DOGE), the eighth-largest cryptocurrency, is experiencing a significant uptick in whale activity. In the past day, a significant surge in $1 million transactions has been seen.The recent increase in such transactions for Dogecoin suggests that large holders are either accumulating more DOGE or moving substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency for other strategic purposes.Data from blockchain analytics platforms show that these high-value transactions numbering over 150, involving amounts of over $1 million, have been reported in the last 24 hours. According to crypto analyst Ali, who cited Santiment data, "Dogecoin whale activity is on the rise. Over 150 DOGE transactions, each exceeding $1 million, have been recorded in the past 24 hours."Increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, could be contributing to the rise in large transactions. Institutions entering the market often do so with substantial capital, leading to large transaction volumes.Whales might be positioning themselves for anticipated price movements, either upward or downward, based on market analysis or news.Dogecoin price actionAt the time of writing, Dogecoin was down 1.38% in the last 24 hours to $0.161. Dogecoin has remained above the 50-day SMA of $0.1547 since late May, indicating strong demand near this level.If this trend continues, Dogecoin may surpass the short-term barrier of $0.174, which is a crucial mark to monitor. If buyers break through this barrier, Dogecoin might rise to $0.21, and then to $0.23.Conversely, if the price falls from the present level or the daily SMA 50, it may induce short-term selling. A breach below the 50-day SMA might reverse the short-term trend, sending Dogecoin to $0.14.

Robinhood’s Bitstamp acquisition could open the door for institutional clients - Blockworks


Robinhood announced on Thursday that it entered into an agreement to acquire Bitstamp.
As part of the deal, Robinhood would pay $200 million in cash and it gets the bonus of an international expansion. The deal won’t close until the first half of 2025.
There are two aspects to look at when combing through this deal and what it means for the publicly traded Robinhood. 
While the announcement buoyed shares, which jumped on the news, analysts such as JMP’s Devin Ryan didn’t boost their price targets or weighting on the stock. 
Ryan’s team reiterated a $30 price target and its outperform rating on the stock. 
“We believe owning the exchange will provide opportunities for the firm to more deeply connect into the ecosystem (e.g., trading, staking, tokenization, payments, remittance, wallet integration), and perhaps over the longer term play an even bigger role in the tokenization of assets and securities, which we believe could be quite interesting. We also see opportunities to drive more activity and better economics with existing Robinhood retail customers through the exchange,” the analysts wrote. 
Robinhood rolled out Solana staking in the EU earlier this year after making its European Union debut just last December. In February, the firm teased that it plans to focus on building out that customer base.

But Ryan’s team thinks that HOOD could open its doors to more institutional clients with the acquisition as well. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitstamp is ranked 16th on top crypto spot exchanges.
The company said it plans to onboard the Bitstamp team, and this means that it won’t have to pursue its own licenses in various jurisdictions. 
“Through this strategic combination, we are better positioned to expand our footprint outside of the US and welcome institutional customers to Robinhood,” said Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Crypto. 
But it’s going to take some time for these benefits to be realized financially. JMP wrote that it estimates revenues to be in the “ballpark of $100 [million]” and that’s based on “trailing 12-month volumes of $70 billion.”
Now there are other concerns, which we covered in the Empire newsletter Thursday morning. 
First is the potential lawsuit that Robinhood faces on US soil. 
In the last couple of months, the Securities and Exchange Commission served Robinhood, Uniswap and Consensys with Wells notices. Based on the Coinbase timeline from last year, if the SEC pursues a lawsuit against any of the three, we’re likely to see it filed this summer. 
Despite trying to fly under the radar, Robinhood couldn’t avoid the SEC’s ire. Last year, the company even delisted tokens after the regulatory agency listed them as securities in suits against Binance and Coinbase.

AI used for crypto crimes on the rise, Elliptic warns

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used to commit crimes in the crypto asset ecosystem, according to a new report from Elliptic.AI-crypto crimesThe report noted that criminals increasingly relied on Generative AI to create deepfakes and other deceptive materials to promote crypto scams.According to the firm:“Doctored videos – or ‘deepfakes’ – of notable individuals promoting investment scams have targeted the likenesses of Elon Musk, former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and both the 7th and 8th Presidents of Taiwan Tsai Ingwen and Lai Ching-te. Promotional deepfakes are often posted across sites such as YouTube, Tiktok and [social media platform] X.”These deepfakes usually lure unsuspecting individuals to invest in scam projects that could result in funds theft.Furthermore, there has been a notable rise in AI-related scam tokens, investment platforms, Ponzi schemes, and fake trading bots. Elliptic noted that scammers often use trendy technology and buzzwords to create tokens or investment schemes, culminating in exit scams. It added:“Beyond the creation of tokens, scammers have used AI as a means of driving up hype in fraudulent investment platforms. In particular, scammers have sought to capitalize on the potential of AI to enhance trading or arbitrage capabilities.”AI-related crypto buzzwords. (Source: Elliptic)One notable incident involved a fake AI trading bot scam called iEarn in 2023, which resulted in approximately $6 million in losses. Notably, this surge in AI trading bots prompted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to issue a warning in January.Elliptic’s report highlighted that criminals were also using large language model (LLM) AI programs to identify vulnerabilities in project codes. This finding aligns with a recent report by Microsoft and OpenAI, which indicates that cybercriminals increasingly use LLMs to enhance their operations.Moreover, AI technology is being adopted to facilitate large-scale crypto scams and disinformation campaigns. Elliptic stated:“AI can be used to accelerate and upscale this [disinformation] process by auto-generating social media posts and coding the necessary underlying infrastructure to distribute them effectively.”Despite these growing threats, Elliptic believes AI technology is still in its infancy and offers numerous benefits. Mitigating these threats requires the collaborative efforts of all stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies, crypto compliance professionals, and AI users.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Lark Davis Excites Community With Big Bitcoin Rally Prediction

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



Renowned entrepreneur and Bitcoin investor Lark Davies gave an exciting prediction regarding an imminent bullish run for the leading cryptocurrency. The forecast comes amid a broader crypto market rally, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) rising to over $71,000.Here's why bull run is possible Davies highlighted several factors that could propel the crypto market to reach a bull run soon. Chief among them is the increased inflows amassed from the adoption of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the U.S.Within the last 18 days, Davies disclosed that the ETFs purchased 56,150 BTC. This translates to over a four-month supply of BTC. In addition, the renowned investor believes Ethereum’s potential spot ETF launch will have a substantial influence on the market. “Ethereum ETFs are about to start trading soon,” Davies opined.Furthermore, Davies added that the continuous accumulation of Bitcoin from institutions like MicroStrategy, Block and Semler Scientific could also influence Bitcoin's future movement. “Institutions, wealth managers, and pension funds worldwide are lining up to own a piece of the Bitcoin pie. This bull run is going to be way crazier than you think,” Davies concluded.At press time, BTC is trading at $71,456, representing an increase of 0.27% in the last 24 hours. Trading volume increased by 14.5% to over $30 billion.Mixed sentiment on spot ETH ETF approval There appears to be mixed sentiment regarding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Jan van Eck, VanEck's CEO, says the approval of spot Ethereum ETF has marked a historic shift. As previously reported by U.Today, the firm is among other applicants that have received approvals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In a contrary opinion, renowned banking giant JPMorgan claims the Ethereum ETFs could attract a much lower share of inflows than expected when it finally begins trading. The banking institution forecasts inflows of $3 billion for the ETH products this year. Nonetheless, the bank says this amount could double if staking is permitted.

Famous Analyst Markus Thielen Said Bitcoin Could Reach $83,000 and Pointed to This Date! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to a bullish forecast by 10x Research, Bitcoin (BTC) may be preparing for a significant rally that could reach $83,000 in the coming days.
Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Could Rise to $83 Thousand
Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, suggests that Bitcoin is on the verge of completing a major bullish price formation on the daily chart.


A breakout above $72,000 would confirm a breakout from the inverted head and shoulders pattern, which is characterized by three price troughs, with the deepest in the middle.
This pattern typically indicates a downtrend reversal and signals an uptrend following a breakout.






“It's only a matter of time before Bitcoin reaches an all-time high. The head and shoulders pattern indicates an imminent rally towards $83,000, with the resistance line breaking over the next few days. The ideal time to break this resistance is either today, Friday, June 7, or on Friday, June 7th,” Thielen said. “It is next week, Wednesday, June 12,” he said.


The bullish outlook comes ahead of critical US economic data that could impact expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut.
Economists polled by Bloomberg estimate the economy added 180,000 jobs in May, nearly matching April's gain of 175,000.


While the unemployment rate is expected to remain at 3.9%, the median forecast for average hourly earnings is for a 0.3% increase from April, leading to a 12-month wage increase of 3.9% for the second month in a row.
Weak economic data could strengthen the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut, increasing upward momentum in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.





Some investment banks predict that the central bank may renew liquidity expansion with an interest rate cut in July.

In the first full month after halving, who mined the most BTC? - Blockworks


It was no secret that miners would see their BTC production numbers decline in the first full month after the Bitcoin halving.
After all, that is the reality of the event that occurred on April 19. Per-block mining rewards were systematically slashed from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.
But some companies saw bigger drops in BTC production than others, with one in particular appearing to win the month (in this category, at least). 
Bitcoin mining giant Marathon Digital mined 616 BTC in May, leading its biggest publicly traded competitors. 
The company actually saw a 32% month-over-month increase in the number of blocks won, CEO Fred Thiel said in a statement. This meant Marathon’s May BTC production declined just 27% — from 850 BTC in April. 
Others saw more substantial decreases in the 40-plus percent range. 
Core Scientific had a month-over-month drop of 44% — from 803 BTC in April to 447 BTC in May.
The company — like other miners — has signaled its future focus on supporting high-performance computing (HPC) services to help combat the lower mining rewards.   
Core Scientific is dedicating 200 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure to that cause via a 12-year deal with CoreWeave, a cloud provider that then proposed to buy the bitcoin miner. Core Scientific rejected that bid. 
Core Scientific is seeking out other clients for an additional 300 MW or so of capacity slated for HPC uses, CEO Adam Sullivan told Blockworks.
“Our new HPC contracts transform and expand our hosting business and earnings power with stable, predictable, high-margin and long-term revenue that will provide balance to our bitcoin mining business and the more volatile nature of bitcoin pricing,” he added.

CleanSpark mined 417 BTC last month, down 42% from 721 BTC the month prior.
The company had said it intends to be one of the most active acquirers in the industry post-halving. It agreed to buy 75 MW worth of mining sites in Wyoming for $18.75 million last month.
“As we continue to grow our hash rate, we are on a trajectory to rapidly recover our production to pre-halving levels,” CEO Zach Bradford noted. 
Australian miner Iris Energy’s bitcoin production in May was 230 BTC — 36% less than the month before.
Meanwhile, Riot Platforms mined 215 bitcoins in May, down 43% from 375 BTC in April.
The Texas-based miner did however collect $7.3 million worth of power and demand response credits during the month. The company is among those with the option to sell their rights to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to balance the grid by reducing their energy consumption. 
Riot CEO Jason Les previously told Blockworks that Riot would have more windows to curtail power in a declining hash price environment. 
“We view our contracts as being a hedge against declining mining break-evens after halving because of our ability to sell power anytime the price of power exceeds mining break-even amounts,” Les added.
Bitfarms, the company that Riot recently tried to acquire, mined 156 BTC last month — down 42% from April. 
Terawulf’s BTC production dropped 44% month over month to 186 BTC in May.
Singapore-based Bitdeer saw less of a drop than most other miners — generating 184 BTC in May, a 31% month-over-month decrease.
That showing came in a month during which stablecoin issuer Tether bought roughly 18.6 million shares. The company generated $100 million in gross proceeds from the share issuance and intends to use that for data center expansion and ASIC-based mining rig development.
Hut 8, another large public miner, had not reported how many BTC it mined in May as of Friday morning. Neither had Stronghold Digital Mining, which signaled last month it was not ruling out selling the company as part of a “formal strategic review process.”

Here's the Percentage of Top Crypto Assets' Supply in Profit


																Following the recent rally of the broader crypto market, a large percentage of the circulating supply of most cryptocurrencies is currently in profit.
Market intelligence platform Santiment has revealed that bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are the top dogs in terms of long-term investment profitability, surpassing assets like Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA).
Crypto Assets in Profit
The percentage of a cryptocurrency’s supply in profit is calculated by summing the token’s current value and its worth when it first originated on the blockchain.
For a deeper understanding, Santiment explained that a bitcoin mined and first introduced on the blockchain at $60,000 would be profitable at the time of writing because BTC was trading at $71,290 at press time. Conversely, a coin mined at $73,000 would not be in profit because BTC is currently worth less than that amount.
Using the methodology, Santiment found that 98.3% of all circulating bitcoins are currently in profit, meaning 1.7% of the crypto asset’s supply is at a loss.




Following BTC is ETH, which has 95.1% of its circulating supply in profit. At the time of writing, data from CoinMarketCap shows ETH was changing hands at $3,811. LINK and Elon Musk’s favorite memecoin, DOGE, followed suit, with 86.8% and 82.2% of the circulating supplies in profits, respectively. The cryptocurrencies were worth $17.53 and $0.15, respectively, at the time of writing.
Ripple’s native token and ADA also have a substantial portion of their supply in the money. For the latter, approximately 78.8% of its circulating tokens are in profit, while the former has just over half of its supply (53.5%) in the green. At press time, CoinMarketCap data shows the duo trading at $0.52 and $0.48, respectively.
MATIC Sees Low Profitability
While BTC and ETH record massive growth and have substantial percentages of their circulating supply in profit, cryptocurrencies like Polygon’s MATIC are lagging. Santiment revealed that the portion of the digital asset in profit is a measly 35%, despite the level of development and number of users flocking to the network.
The on-chain intelligence platform said MATIC’s low investment profitability is likely linked to the cryptocurrency’s introduction to the market amid the 2019 bear cycle. Santiment noted that the launch time made the asset start with a bit of a handicap. At the time of writing, the token was worth $0.71, down 10% in the past year.

Bitcoin On The Verge As Global Liquidity Nears New $100 Million ATH


																Philip Swift, the founder of the on-chain analytics platform LookIntoBitcoin, recently highlighted the significant increase in global liquidity, which just hit a new all-time high (ATH). Swift suggested this was a crucial indicator of how Bitcoin can rise in this bull run. 
The Most Important Indicator For Bitcoin
Swift claimed that the global liquidity was the “most important” chart in this bull run while revealing that it had just hit a new ATH. The chart he shared showed that the global liquidity was now at $94 trillion and approaching the $100 trillion mark. Based on his analysis, this development could also lead to new ATHs for Bitcoin.

Source: Look Into Bitcoin
Global liquidity was around $90 trillion when BTC hit its previous ATH of $69,000 in the 2021 bull run. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price has risen above that level since global liquidity, thereby confirming the correlation between this global liquidity indicator and Bitcoin’s price. Swift claimed that Bitcoin’s rise is “inevitable” as long as global liquidity keeps trending. 
Swift mentioned that BTC had a “long way to go” after it hit a new ATH of $73,750 in March. He made reference to the MVRV z-score indicator, which showed that the flagship crypto was still well below its fair value. In a recent X post, the crypto founder suggested that Bitcoin would at least rise above $100,000 before the market top can be said to be in. 
Swift claimed that the Bitcoin cycle top indicators were continuing to climb higher. These top indicators were the delta top, terminal price, and top cap, which were at $137,579, $148,390, and $364,541, respectively. 
Source: Look Into Bitcoin
Meanwhile, like Swift, crypto analyst Tarekonchain recently highlighted the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator and mentioned that Bitcoin was still far from its peak. Based on this, the analyst predicted that BTC could still achieve new highs in this cycle and possibly rise above $100,000. 
BTC On The Brink Of History
Crypto analyst Rekt Capital mentioned that Bitcoin could soon make history if a breakout happens soon enough. He claimed that if that happens, this will be the fastest Bitcoin has ever broken out from a post-halving Re-Accumulation range. A successful breakout from this range will send Bitcoin into the “parabolic phase” of the cycle, when it is expected to reach new highs and potentially rise above $100,000.

Interestingly, Standard Chartered Bank predicted that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 even before the US Presidential election takes place in November. The bank further predicted that BTC could reach $150,000 by year-end if Republican candidate Donald Trump emerges victorious at the polls. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $71,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Norwegian authorities help Sky Mavis recover $5.7M from Ronin bridge heist

Sky Mavis, the developer behind Axie Infinity, successfully recovered approximately $5.7 million from the Ronin Bridge exploit with the Norwegian government’s assistance.In a June 7 statement, the firm stated:“The Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (Økokrim) has successfully frozen and returned 5.7 M USD in stolen assets from the Ronin bridge incident.”Ronin bridge, an Ethereum sidechain for the play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, was exploited in 2022 for 173,600 Ethereum, worth over $615 million at the time. Since then, the firm has been working to recover the funds with little success.Meanwhile, the attacker, allegedly the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group, has moved a substantial amount of the stolen ETH through crypto mixing tool Tornado Cash.$40 million frozenThe firm said various law enforcement agencies have frozen a total of $40 million associated with the incident. It added:“These assets will take some time to recover and we don’t have enough information to give guidance around a specific timetable for recovering and returning this separate pool of assets.”These recoveries were achieved through the collaborative efforts of various agencies, including the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Økokrim, and blockchain forensic firm Chainalysis. Sky Mavis emphasized the importance of coordination among law enforcement, legal teams, accountants, and blockchain experts in retrieving the stolen assets.Sky Mavis plans to allocate around 15% of the recovered funds to cover recovery costs, with the remaining 85% being returned to the Axie Infinity Treasury.Meanwhile, the asset recovery did not improve Axie Infinity’s AXS token price performance or that of Ronin’s RON. According to CryptoSlate’s data, the digital assets were down 1.09 and 2.65%, respectively, over the last 24 hours.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: Featured, HacksLatest Alpha Market Report

San Francisco-Based Crypto Exchange Kraken Mulls $100,000,000+ Pre-IPO Funding Round: Report - The Daily Hodl


								One of the world’s largest and oldest crypto exchanges is reportedly contemplating a final funding round before possibly going public.
Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that San Francisco-based Kraken is mulling conducting a pre-initial public offering (IPO) round after receiving inquiries from potential investors.










The fundraising, which will likely aim to raise more than $100 million, may be completed by the year-end, according to the sources.
Bloomberg says the exchange is looking for a “marquee” company to join its board and help it kick off a successful IPO by as early as next year.
The sources say talks between Kraken and potential investors only involved verbal exchanges of terms and valuations and do not have formal documentation.
Kraken has considered doing an initial public offering for years now but this did not push through because of the previous crypto downturn and the company’s regulatory issues with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
News of the company reconsidering an IPO emerges amid a bull market that could see crypto prices reach new all-time highs and bring the exchange $1 billion to $2 billion in revenue this year.
Kraken declined to comment on its purported fundraising and IPO plans.
“We are always exploring strategic paths toward Kraken’s Mission: accelerating the global adoption of crypto. We remain fully focused on investing in this goal.”

3 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Consider in June 2024 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Outpacing the erosion of money via inflation is not enough for some investors. Among many candidates in this category, from dividend to growth and blue-chip stocks, they typically involve safe, slower growth.



But what about companies perceived as bad calls, from this safe perspective? Because their stocks are suppressed, they have a higher potential for more significant gains. Yet, they still offer some fundamentals that are difficult to dismiss.



Here are three stocks that are riskier but have the potential for higher rewards.



Boeing (NASDAQ: BA)



Whether it is new whistleblowers, close-call landings and mishaps, or a botched NASA launch, there is hardly a month without negative Boeing news. This continued feed suppressed BA stock, far from its all-time high of $430 in March 2019 to $191 per share.



Yet, this price is now above the 52-week low of $159, which was reached at the height of Boeing’s fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). The reason for that is simple: There is no market substitution for this type of wide-moat company that could tackle the scale of military contracts, commercial flight, eVTOL, and space rocket deployment. 



While Boeing whistleblowers point to the company’s de-prioritization of quality controls in favor of racial/gender accounting, the company’s corporate culture is one election, or one CEO, away from a turnaround potential. In the meantime, its entrenched status is not at risk of erosion, which is why such non-business luxuries were implemented in the first place.



BA stock is down 24% year-to-date. But given Boeing’s fundamentals, analyst consensus for the next 12 months points to an average BA price target of $215.43, with a ceiling of $270 vs. the bottom of $140 per share.





Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)



Like Boeing, Elon Musk’s wealth-building company is no stranger to FUD.  Although Tesla is not a wide-moat company, it holds EV dominance in key US and EU markets. By avoiding the trap of unionization, Tesla continues to hold the edge over legacy automakers like Ford Motors.



Effectively ceding the pure EV market to Tesla, Ford Motors shifted to hybrids, with some success in Q1 sales growth. Tesla’s excursion into the SUV market, and subsequent recall of Cybertrucks, didn’t help the FUD amid the encroachment of Chinese automakers like BYD and Li Auto.



Nonetheless, Tesla’s core platform, Model 2, will not be deployed in 2025. So far, the company’s entire history has been geared toward popularizing EVs as luxury vehicles from the cumbersome days of specialty vehicles. The next-gen Model 2, priced at $25k alongside being the platform for robotaxies, is yet to become Tesla’s bread and butter.



It is fair to say that this interim 2-year period will either lay the groundwork for Tesla’s failure or success. But if it is the latter, the gains should be substantial from the presently muted TSLA stock. 



Given Musk’s successful SpaceX venture from a technological perspective, investors are counting on that scenario. From the all-time high of $409 in November 2021, TSLA stock is priced at $177 per share, under the 52-week average of $220. Since the end of February, TSLA stock has been moving sideways, having lost 28% of value year-to-date.







Baselode Energy (OTC: BSENF)



Investors willing to take the uranium plunge would be betting on this Canadian company finding new uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin, particularly the challenges of overcoming extracting issues in underground sandstone mining. 



Above that issue, even Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock and key facilitator of ESG, admitted that “the world is going to be short power” because of generative AI demand. Nuclear power is by far the densest form of energy and the cleanest with modern building designs, offering zero air/carbon output.



While uranium is not renewable, just 1 kg of uranium is equivalent to the energy from 2.7 million kg of coal. Baselode has four main projects for uranium extraction—Catharsis, Bear, Hook, and Shadow—of which Catharsis is in the drilling stage. Depending on the exploration success of other projects and the extraction from discovered uranium trioxide ores in ACKIO, Baselode could end up powering entire nations.



Unlike other uranium stocks that have skyrocketed, the penny BSENF stock is down 33% year-to-date, owing to technical challenges and stock dilution in February to fund operations. As of the end of March, the company has nearly three years’ worth of runway based on the cash burn rate reported in May. But if Baselode hits uranium motherloads, shareholders could see triple-digit returns in the next few years.

ChatGPT-4o sets new price target for ADA as Cardano signs partnership in Argentina


    The Cardano Foundation has announced a significant partnership with the government of Entre Ríos Province in Argentina.



This move aims to enhance blockchain adoption in the region and could potentially impact Cardano’s native token, ADA, which has been facing challenges in gaining traction recently.



According to the Cardano Foundation, Rogelio Frigerio, the governor of the Entre Ríos Province, and Rafael Fraga, LATAM Lead for Business Development at the Cardano Foundation, signed the agreement to formalize the partnership. 











The initiative will focus on promoting blockchain adoption in the Entre Ríos Province, aligning with Argentina’s broader push to advance its cryptocurrency infrastructure.



Recently, the National Securities Commission of Argentina partnered with El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets to explore Bitcoin (BTC) adoption and crypto regulation. 



This broader initiative aims to leverage Argentina’s robust technology sector to enhance the efficiency and scope of its crypto services,as reported by Finbold.



Potential impact on ADA’s price



To gather insights regarding the price impact of this partnership, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s latest and most advanced AI tool, ChatGPT-4o.



ADA price prediction. Source – ChatGPT-4o



According to ChatGPT-4o, in a conservative scenario, ADA could reach $1.00 if the crypto market experiences steady but moderate growth, driven by gradual adoption from the partnership in Argentina.



An optimistic estimate sees ADA potentially reaching $2.00 with positive trends and widespread implementation of Cardano’s blockchain solutions.



In a highly bullish scenario, ADA could surge to $5.00 or higher, fueled by strong adoption, significant market momentum, and overall positive sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market.



Factors influencing ADA price



ChatGPT-4o also highlighted several factors likely to impact ADA’s price, including partnership developments, market sentiment, technological advancements, regulatory environment, adoption rate, and broader economic conditions.



The recent partnership with the government of Entre Ríos Province in Argentina is expected to drive adoption and potentially increase ADA’s value.



Continuous upgrades to the Cardano blockchain enhance investor confidence and user attraction. 



Recent data from Cardano developer IOHK, released on May 17, shows the number of smart contracts on the network has reached 46,060, with 171 projects launched.



ADA 7-day price chart. Source –  Finbold



At press time, Cardano is priced at $0.49, reflecting a 5.06% increase in 24 hours. 



Still, ADA continues to trade below the $0.50 resistance zone, and reaching the $1 level would be significant for the asset’s growth.

Why Is Bitcoin Stuck At Resistance Despite Record ETF Inflows? - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD continues to trade sideways despite record inflows into Bitcoin Spot ETFs, leaving many market observers scratching their heads. This apparent disconnect between bullish sentiment and price action has sparked debate within the cryptocurrency community.ETF Inflows Don’t Guarantee Price Surges:James Van Straten, Lead Analyst at Crypto Slate, emphasizes the broader market forces at play. “Yup the market is way bigger than the ETFs.” He highlights the significant accumulation of Bitcoin (71,000 BTC in the past 30 days) despite record ETF inflows. However, he acknowledges that “many cohorts are in distribution as the price climbs higher.” This suggests profit-taking by some investors may be offsetting the buying pressure from ETFs.Internal Selling May Be Dampening Rally:Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas offers a different perspective. “This is not ETFs doing, obv bc they buying like crazy lately, it’s bitcoin holders selling or leveraged flushers or whatever.” Balchunas suggests that existing Bitcoin holders or leveraged traders might be selling, dampening the impact of ETF inflows.He further observes a recurring pattern: “Time and again ETFs go on flow-a-thons and its met with selling from other holders.”Also Read: Ethereum ETF Demand May Be Muted Compared To Bitcoin ETFs, Analysts SayTransparency Concerns Surface:Frank Makrides, a commentator, raises concerns about transparency. “can you please explain to me how we have had record amounts of fund flows into the $BTC ETFs and we are still range bound?” He questions the role of major institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and their market makers (e.g., JPMorgan) in managing these inflows.“It seems to me that @BlackRock @Fidelity & their market makers @jpmorgan should show us exactly what they’re doing with their funds – @SECGov ” Makrides’ tweet highlights a desire for greater transparency within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.The Bigger PictureLudwig Wittgenstein offered a broader view on the situation, comparing it to the patience exhibited by Roaring Kitty in his famous GameStop play.He said, “Crypto participants can’t stand a ‘chop’ for more than three seconds, running from one narrative to the other.” This suggests that the crypto market’s impatience and frequent shifts in focus contribute to the lack of sustained upward momentum.These dynamics and their implications for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market will be key discussion points at the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.

Ripple CTO Issues Important Warning to XRP Army, 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Makes Stunning BTC Price Prediction, SHIB and ADA Explode with Whale Activity: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Here are the top three news stories over the past day presented to you by U.Today.Ripple CTO issues crucial warning to XRP communityRipple CTO David Schwartz recently addressed his X followers with an important warning. In his post, Schwartz shared a screenshot from X user @3YearLetterman showing a direct message from a malefactor pretending to be a member of the X Support Team. The scam message informs the X user who received it that their account is purportedly under investigation for copyright violation, and that they have 24 hours to complete a form with feedback, otherwise the account will be suspended. The Ripple CTO urged the XRP community and those who follow him on X not to fall for this fraud, explaining that the link to a so-called "form" leads to a phishing site that will "collect your login and personal information.""Rich Dad Poor Dad" author makes stunning Bitcoin price predictionIn a recent X post, Robert Kiyosaki, renowned investor and author of bestselling book "Rich Dad Poor Dad," has shared his latest call on the Bitcoin price fo4 the near future. "Bitcoin will be $350,000 by August 25, 2024," Kiyosaki wrote; however, there is a catch to this bold prediction. The author further added: "It’s a prediction. It’s speculation, it’s an opinion, but it’s not a lie. It’s sucker's bait, but it’s not a lie because any prediction about the future is not a lie," potentially implying that no one can know for sure what the future holds for BTC or any digital asset in general. Kiyosaki then continued his post by saying that he is currently increasing his Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana stashes, adding, however, that he does so not because of being "certain" about these cryptos but due to being confident of "the incompetence of our leaders."Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano explode with whale activityShiba Inu and Cardano have both recently seen a significant rise in large-scale transactions. According to data from Santiment reports, the cause for this surge is mainly the increased interest from "whales," or investors making transactions exceeding $100,000. This week, the number of such large transactions for SHIB and ADA has more than doubled, in comparison to the average for 2024. As can be seen on a chart attached to Santiment's X post, the current figure for such massive transactions for the ADA token sits at 875, and for the SHIB token, it is 321. However, even the day before, the numbers were much lower - around 455 for Cardano and 81 for Shiba Inu. At the moment of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000025, down by 2.84% over the past 24 hours and for ADA at $0.4798, up by 4.09% over the same period.

Bitcoin Price Shakes Off Fed Jitter Following Hot Labor Market Reading - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe price of Bitcoin bounced back Friday following stronger-than-expected jobs data in the U.S., which could potentially compel the Federal Reserve to delay cutting interest rates.The Labor Department said that the unemployment rate increased slightly to 4% in May, but that job growth had also accelerated amid the most restrictive interest rates in more than 20 years. Economists forecast that employers would add 180,000 nonfarm payroll positions, but the report indicated that 272,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy last month.Immediately following the report’s release, Bitcoin dipped to $70,700 from around $71,800, according to CoinGecko data. However, the asset’s price has edged up to $71,050, as of this writing, showing a minor 0.4% decline over the past 24 hours.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that inflation had come down substantially from a multi-decade high in 2022, despite the strength of the labor market. Previously, policymakers believed some softening there may be necessary to bring inflation down to their target of 2%, with lower job demand easing upward pressure on wages.“Job growth was remarkably strong in May,” Grayscale’s Head of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt in a statement, adding that it “likely further trims the odds of Fed rate cuts this year.”Still, Pandl believes that the Fed will cut rates in the intermediate term, following a loosening of monetary policy from the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank over the past week. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, the prospect of the Fed holding interest rates steady through year’s end increased from 5.5% to 11.3% after the report’s release.Still, the market sees a 50% chance that the Fed cuts rates in September, which would likely accelerate economic growth through reduced borrowing costs.Higher interest rates typically weigh on the value of so-called risk assets, including stocks and crypto, as the payouts for holding cash or U.S. Treasuries become relatively more attractive. Despite the report’s implications or the Fed’s potential delay to cutting rates, Pandl believes “Bitcoin will retest its all-time high in the coming months.”Meanwhile, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said on Twitter (aka X) that Bitcoin “has become highly sensitive to interest rate expectations.” In 2022, macroeconomic data—and associated jitters—could send Bitcoin swinging around 10% in any direction on a given day.Shifting expectations on rate cuts in April dented Bitcoin’s price alongside rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Regardless, the Fed will telegraph its next move during its June policy meeting next week.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

As seen in the chart above, the move was relatively sudden, completing a decline of around 2.5% in the past few hours.
The drop is not specific to Bitcoin, as virtually all of the leading altcoins are also crashing.
Binance Coin is down 3% over the past hour alone, while DOGE dropped by more than 6%.
Ethereum lost 3% as well, XRP – around 4$, Solana – about 3.6%, and so forth.
This also resulted in considerable liquidations across leveraged long positions, which currently amount close to $200 million, according to data from Coinglass.

$100,000 Bitcoin Incoming by the End of the Year if This Happens, Says Billionaire Mike Novogratz - The Daily Hodl


								The chief executive of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital says that Bitcoin (BTC) could hit six figures this year if one key event occurs soon.
In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Mike Novogratz says that if Bitcoin flips the $73,000 level into support he expects the king crypto to reach $100,000 before the end of 2024.










“If we take out the $73,000 in the next week or so we’re going to end the year at $100,000, somewhere around there or even higher. Markets create ranges. When the top of the range breaks, you have a nice extension. And so if the bottom of that range started around $40,000, so $40,000 to $70,000, this $70,000 goes to $100,000. And so that’s a good enough target.” 
Novogratz also says that there is reason to believe more crypto regulatory clarity will be coming out of Washington, D.C., which could act as a tailwind for Bitcoin.
“D.C. has finally agreed in principle that crypto legislation has to happen, that it should be bipartisan. We still have a couple holdouts, but the last few weeks have been unbelievably positive in pushing the Democrats forward. They don’t want it to be a political issue. And so that which was a headwind is becoming a tailwind. It’s not a full tailwind yet… 
We’re getting the regulatory clarity. And even though it’s not perfect, we got enough that people now realize this is coming. And why is that important? And what does it mean? So if SAB 121, this arcane accounting bill, in time gets overturned, it allows Bank of New York and State Street and others to get into custody. If the infrastructure bill, FIT21 bill, gets approved that allows Goldman Sachs and Citibank and all these other people to start doing sales and trading. And so as you bring those institutions in huge money follows.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $71,021 at time of writing, nearly unchanged in the last 24 hours.

'We Must Crash Solana': Andrew Tate Embarks on Meme Coin Spending Spree - Decrypt

Controversial right-wing internet personality Andrew Tate is at again, with his latest ploy to farm online engagement as he awaits trial for rape and human trafficking charges: shilling Solana meme coins. On Friday, the former kickboxer and self-proclaimed misogynist—who once disavowed crypto as a scam—began promoting various Solana tokens and posting racially incendiary statements on Twitter in rapid succession, creating a characteristically chaotic social media storm.The havoc began when Tate first posted, early Friday, that he would “diamond hands” $1 million worth of random assets if he received a certain number of retweets on the post. “Diamond hands” is internet parlance for holding an asset long-term, regardless of price movement, due to conviction in the asset.In short order, the post hit Tate’s engagement target, and the social media influencer posted “I WILL CRASH THE SOLANA NETWORK”—implying that he planned to buy up so many tokens on the chain that it crashed. (Solana currently executes about 1,900 transactions a second, according to Solscan.)Tate then invited the degen hordes to shill their “junk” tokens at him, saying he would pick a select number to sweep up. He soon claimed to have bought $10,000 of various Pump.fun Solana meme coins, including one mocking a Twitter user Tate denigrated and one disparaging pop singer Madonna. He also appeared to buy into a Germany-themed Solana token only after the token’s team agreed to refer to him as “Fuhrer,” the title strongly associated with Adolf Hitler. Tate appears to have spent nowhere near that promised $1 million on investments yet, however. While he has routinely made lofty claims about his wealth and crypto investments in recent months—an essential component of his playboy image—his situation became considerably more precarious last year, when Romanian authorities accused him and his brother of rape, human trafficking, and forming an organized crime group to sexually exploit women. In March, British authorities issued a separate arrest warrant for the Tate brothers on charges related to rape and sexual assault. Romanian authorities agreed to extradite the influencer only after the conclusion of his trial in their country.  Tate is currently in Romania awaiting trial. He is barred from leaving the country.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Sell signal for two overbought cryptocurrencies this week


    The cryptocurrency market is currently in a state of flux, influenced by broader economic factors. Recent data showed a surprising increase in U.S. job growth, far exceeding expectations.



This suggests the economy is coping well with higher interest rates, reducing the likelihood of rate cuts, which affects the flow of money into riskier investments like cryptocurrencies.



In light of this economic backdrop, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies that are currently overbought and may present a good selling opportunity. 







Based on CoinGlass’s 24-hour relative strength index (RSI) heatmap on June 7, the average daily RSI is 54.70, indicating a neutral market. 



However, cryptocurrencies that deviate significantly from this average, either by being overbought or oversold, are likely to correct back towards the mean.



Binance Coin (BNB) 



At press time, Binance Coin (BNB) is priced at $700.30, with a slight price drop of 0.39%. BNB’s RSI values over various time frames show it is overbought, especially over the past 24 hours. 



The 24-hour RSI for BNB is 75.56, which is above the overbought threshold of 70. This indicates strong buying pressure that may not be sustainable.



Crypto Market RSI 24-hour Heatmap:BNB. Source: CoinGlass



The 1-week RSI of 82.52 suggests a prolonged overbought condition, pointing to a potential price correction.BNB recently reached an all-time high, highlighting possible overvaluation and market saturation.



Ordi (ORDI)



ORDI, the first token minted using the BRC-20 standard, has also shown significant price movement. Currently, ORDI is priced at $62.888, reflecting an 8% increase. ORDI’s RSI values also suggest it is overbought. 



Crypto Market RSI 24-hour Heatmap:ORDI. Source: CoinGlass



The 24-hour RSI for ORDI is 74.65, indicating it has been overbought recently. ORDI has surged nearly 17%, reaching just below $57.5, its highest price since early April. 



This rapid increase, combined with high RSI values, suggests that ORDI might soon see a price correction as the market stabilizes



Both BNB and ORDI are exhibiting high RSI levels, signaling that they are currently overbought and may be poised for a price correction.



However, it is important to note that an overbought RSI does not necessarily guarantee an imminent correction. 



This status often follows a period of strong performance and can be sustained during prolonged bull markets. 



Therefore, while the technical indicators suggest caution, traders should also consider the underlying fundamentals of each cryptocurrency before making investment decisions.

Polkadot Can Target $10 Next, but Here's the Catch (DOT Price Analysis)


																Polkadot faces a significant challenge in reclaiming a decisive resistance region encompassing the $7.5 mark, the 100-day moving average, and critical Fibonacci levels. This resistance range can potentially halt upward pressure in the short term.
Technical Analysis
By Shayan
The Daily Chart
A comprehensive daily chart analysis highlights Polkadot’s prolonged struggle to breach a crucial resistance zone over several weeks. This resistance includes:

The static resistance level at $7.5
The 100-day moving average at $7.6
The price range between the 0.5 ($7.4) and 0.618 ($7.8) Fibonacci levels

This formidable range is likely accompanied by significant supply and selling pressure, capable of resisting buyers’ upward momentum. In the event of a rejection, the consolidation phase is expected to expand, with the price retracing slightly towards the $6.5 support region.
Conversely, if buyers successfully overpower sellers, a notable short-squeeze event could transpire, propelling the price impulsively toward the $8 threshold.
Source: TradingView
The 4-Hour Chart
On the 4-hour chart, Polkadot’s price has formed an ascending wedge pattern amid the recent multi-month consolidation phase. This pattern typically indicates a continuation of the initial bearish movement if breached from its lower threshold.
Following a rejection from the significant $7.5 resistance level, the price declined, reaching the pattern’s lower boundary. However, upon reaching this point, the momentum waned, leading to a period of consolidation with minimal volatility. Nonetheless, the price is on the brink of breaking below the pattern’s lower boundary. A valid breakout could trigger a cascade towards the $6.5 mark.
Conversely, continuing the current consolidation phase within the pattern is the most probable scenario, with the price aiming for the wedge’s upper boundary around $8.
Source: TradingView
Sentiment Analysis
By Shayan
Polkadot is currently experiencing sideways consolidation around the $7 mark. Examining futures market metrics, particularly the DOT/USDT Binance liquidation heatmap, provides valuable insights into potential price movements and liquidity pools.
The heatmap reveals significant liquidity below the $7 level, indicating stop-loss orders and liquidation prices. The $8 area also contains substantial liquidity, acting as a resistance level. If the price approaches this zone, it may face selling pressure from participants looking to realize profits or close positions.
Nevertheless, the $10 zone consists of substantial liquidity, potentially representing the liquidation prices of short positions that drove the initial bearish movement before the current consolidation stage.
Polkadot’s price is trapped between the $7 support and $8 resistance levels, influenced by significant liquidity pools at these zones. A breakout from this range could lead to notable price movements, with the $10 region being a potential mid-term target in case of a bullish revival.

'I'm Alive': GameStop Legend Roaring Kitty Just Livestreamed-Here's What Happened - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe meme stock influencer Kieth Gill, better known online as Roaring Kitty or DeepFucking Value, opined on YouTube—carefully—on Friday about GameStop’s future as a company. It was his first livestream since 2021.“Do I have to be careful about what I saw here?” the influencer asked, while displaying a background of GameStop’s stock price on Yahoo Finance. “I wanted to remind people that I’m the one active on my accounts, of course.”The announcement of his livestream a day before had caused the firm’s share price to spike 47% over the course of the trading day to $46.55, pushing higher during overnight trading. But the stock had buckled over 30% from its closing price to below $32 before Gill’s remarks.As Gill’s livestream was scheduled to begin, over 320,000 viewers awaited the influencer on YouTube. An endless stream of messages cascaded across his channel’s chat box, often presented in all-caps styling or accompanied by gorilla, rocket, diamond emojis.Some viewers in the run-up to Gill’s appearance beckoned other users to “HODL” their positions in the firm. Others wondered whether Gill had sold his shares, or if he was okay, as the minutes ticked past noon—well after the livestream was scheduled to begin.“I kind of forget how to do this,” the influencer said as he began his livestream, appearing to wear bandages along with a sling over his right arm. “Oh shit, I’m alive—kinda,” he said, later telling viewers that the bandages and splint were for comedic purposes.“It is what it is. What am I going to do?” he said of GameStop’s lower stock price on Friday. “You post a couple memes, you post a couple of screenshots, and everyone loses their mind.”Gill said people should pay attention to GameStop’s business model, saying the retailer is in a “transformation stage” and moving away from its legacy business model of selling games and video game consoles in-store. Gill added that he believes in the firm’s management team.“He seems to be taking the right approach, given this unique situation,” Gill said of GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, who took over last September. “Let’s see where it goes from here.”Before Gill spoke, the stream displayed a raft of disclosures, of which one sentence said, “You should not treat any opinion expressed on this YouTube channel as a specific inducement to make a particular investment or follow a particular strategy.”Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Gill’s recent trading and social media behavior is subject to investigation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Massachusetts’ securities regulator.Before Gill had the chance to dawn his virtual stage, GameStop itself had news to break. The company disclosed on Friday that its first-quarter earnings were rough, and that the video game retailer’s net sales had fallen 29% to $881.8 million from $1.237 billion a year prior.The firm’s financials were a letdown compared to Wall Street estimates. Nonetheless, GameStop announced alongside the performance that the firm would sell 75 million shares in the company after raising $900 million through the sale of 45 million shares in May.Gill, who became the de facto face of retail-led movement to bet big against Wall Street short sellers through GameStop in 2021, had reignited interest in GameStop through his online return. Appearing on Twitter (aka X) first, he later began posting again on Reddit.Within the Reddit community Superstonk, Gill’s purported positions had already garnered immense interest. Holding a mix of GameStop shares and call options earlier this month, his latest “YOLO update” showed paper gains of over $382 million.Around 30 minutes into Gill’s livestream, the channel had garnered over 700,000 viewers. As the price of GameStop fell, he flashed his positions on E*Trade to viewers, which had decreased in value by around $235 million.Even amid such unrealized losses, he kept a jovial attitude for more than half a million live observers.“Do I have a lawyer in the room?” Gill read from a message posted in the livestream’s chat. “No, but maybe I should,” he responded.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Market Expert Says Altcoin Summer Is Just Around The Corner, Here’s The Timeline | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto expert Michael Van de Poppe recently predicted that altcoins would make significant upside moves. The analyst also provided a timeline for when this will happen and how parabolic the move could be for these crypto tokens. 
Altcoins Will Make A Move In The Summer
Van de Poppe mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that altcoins are ready for their upward run and will see a lot of momentum from late June until September or October. The crypto analyst added that these altcoins will reprice back to their normal values when this move occurs, alluding to the “big cascade” they have suffered since the start of the year. 

Van de Poppe has for a while now continued to hammer on how undervalued altcoins are and previously predicted that they were going to make significant moves in their Bitcoin pair post-halving. Back then, he also predicted that there would be a narrative shift to Ethereum and suggested that the second-largest crypto by market would lead other altcoins into the altcoin season. 
The analyst also believes that the Spot Ethereum ETFs could trigger this altcoin season once they begin trading. This would explain why he predicted that the altcoin season would begin in late June since Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted these Ethereum ETFs would begin trading around that period. 
Van de Poppe has also revealed that he was well-positioned ahead of this altcoin season. He once mentioned that he had swapped all his Bitcoin holdings for altcoins. In a recent X post, he also stated that he had switched his altcoin exposure towards different altcoins in a bid to enjoy a higher return on investment (ROI). He claimed that he was comfortable with his exposure and reaffirmed that there would be a “strong altcoin run.”
The analyst also provided some insights into altcoins that he might have accumulated when he listed ten undervalued tokens that he believes will make a run in this bull cycle. The tokens he listed included Chainlink (LINK), Celestia (TIA), Arbitrum (ARB), Polkadot (DOT), and Cosmos (ATOM), amongst others. 
Time To Position Ahead Of The Altcoin Season
Crypto analyst Lark Davis recently mentioned that it “could be the time to go down the risk curve” and position early for the altcoin season. He made this statement while discussing whether or not the altcoin season was starting soon. He shared data from Blockchain Center, which showed that the market is still far from an altcoin season. 
Blockchain Center has an altcoin season index that gauges whether or not it is the altcoin season. Based on the index, it is only altcoin season when 75% of the top 50 coins by market cap outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. So far, only 12 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during this period, meaning that it is still Bitcoin season.

3 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week


    Finbold identified three cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week due to the upcoming substantial token unlocks and sell-offs. These unlocks have the potential to flood the market, leading to increased selling pressure and significant price fluctuations.



Experienced cryptocurrency market participants closely monitor factors like demand and supply dynamics about the tokens and assets they are trading. By considering these dynamics, investors can make well-informed decisions that maximize profitability while effectively managing associated risks.



In particular, data from TokenUnlocksApp shows $164.76 million in potential sell-offs for the next seven days from June 7. The top two highest unlocks will happen on June 12 and June 14, releasing $160.41 million worth of tokens. These two massive releases correspond to 97.5% of the six projects, unlocking this week’s total amount.







Cliff unlocks the next seven days. Source: TokenUnlocks.App



Aptos (APT)



First, Aptos (APT), a layer-1 blockchain developed by former Meta (NASDAQ: META) engineers, will unlock 11.31 million APT worth $103.48 million. The Foundation will receive a smaller share of the unlock, with 1.33 million tokens worth $12.20 million.



Community and Core contributors will receive 3.21 million and 3.96 million tokens, totaling $65.59 million. Meanwhile, investors will realize $25.69 million with sales of 2.81 million APT.



The whole unlock will inflate Aptos supply by 2.6% on June 12, likely creating a huge selling pressure.

ImmutableX (IMX)



ImmutableX (IMX) is the second cryptocurrency to avoid trading due to a significant unlock that will inflate its supply by 1.7% on June 14. Specifically, 25.53 million IMX will be released to ecosystem development and project development.



The $56.93 million will be fully managed by the team, which represents a proportionally high share of centralized capital.



Cliff unlocks Immutable (IMX) on June 14. Source: TokenUnlocks.App



Avoid trading XRP amid Ripple sell-offs



From another perspective, Ripple has already unlocked 1 billion XRP in June and reserved 200 million tokens out of this total, plus an extra 200 million, to sell this month.



As reported by Finbold, the company has already moved 150 million XRP, which may soon land in crypto exchanges. With another 250 million tokens in its treasury account, Ripple’s activities could also create strong selling pressure on the cryptocurrency.

However, crypto traders will try to speculate on the economic effects these unlocks and sell-offs may have on price, which could bring increased volatility and worsen the potential risk-reward ratio. The market is uncertain and influenced by multiple factors, requiring proper risk management and learning when to avoid trading specific cryptocurrencies.

Why Donald Trump's Reported $33 Million Crypto Portfolio Quickly Dropped To $21M Overnight - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump has changed his stance on crypto over the past several years, from calling it a "disaster waiting to happen" in 2021 to supporting it and owning tens of millions of dollars in crypto. This new pro-crypto stance has made his crypto portfolio even larger, hitting over $33 million highs in early June. Let's look at where Trump is getting this crypto and how the value of his holdings has fluctuated recently. Don't Miss:Trump first began receiving crypto in 2022. Another company used his name to market and sell 45,000 Trump Digital Trading Cards NFTs for $99 each, earning Trump royalties in the form of ETH. The company also launched a "Mugshot Edition" of the NFTs, resulting in even more royalties for Trump. The former president has earned more than 1,900 ETH from these projects, 1,075 of which he sold in December 2023. However, the ETH in Trump's portfolio is only a fraction of his holdings. Nearly all of the portfolio comprises two memecoins: MAGA Coin (TRUMP) and Trog (TROG). These tokens sent a portion of the token supply to Trump as part of a marketing scheme, and their value has skyrocketed in 2024. MAGA Coin was the first large project to gift Trump tokens. The project started in August 2023 and sent Trump a few thousand dollars worth of tokens when it began trading. For several months, the value of these tokens stayed relatively low until 2024, when the price of TRUMP began to increase dramatically. Events like Trump's primary election successes and recent felony convictions caused the token's price to go from less than $0.01 on launch to over $17.50. At the same time, Trump's position went from a few thousand dollars to a high of over $10 million. Trending: According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here’s why it can be true.Surprisingly, TRUMP is just one of the meme coins that Trump has received. Project founders and supporters have given him over 50 other meme coins. Trog (TROG), short for Trump Frog, became Trump's largest holding in June 2024. The project gave Trump half of the supply, equating to 210 billion tokens. While the project has remained fairly small since launch, ranking outside the top 2,500 tokens by market cap, because Trump owns so much of the supply, his position has become very large in relation to the rest of his portfolio. The price of TROG has increased nearly 1,000% over the past week, allowing Trump's tokens to reach a high of over $24.6 million. When TROG hit highs on June 5, Trump's portfolio was worth over $33 million. His holdings have since fallen to around $20 million as the price of TROG fell. However, the fact that Trump held more than $30 million in meme coins is beyond surprising. Read Next:

Shiba Inu Faces 29 Trillion Token Sell Wall on Path to New Highs


							

Shiba Inu faces strong sell walls, with $0.000026 as a major resistance level.



Overcoming resistance could push SHIB above $0.00006 to a new yearly high.



Analyst Mags suggests now is an ideal time to buy SHIB despite a 43% drop in trading volume.




Multiple sell walls pose a significant challenge for Shiba Inu (SHIB), even as the broader cryptocurrency market recovers. These sell walls represent major obstacles preventing SHIB from rising further.



The $0.000026 level stands out as a key resistance area. According to IntoTheBlock data, this price point marks a substantial sell wall. Clearing this hurdle could trigger significant gains.



This level’s sell wall comprises 92,240 addresses that collectively own 29.69 trillion SHIB tokens. A successful breakout above this level could propel SHIB to a new annual high, potentially exceeding $0.00006. This scenario could ignite renewed enthusiasm and interest in the cryptocurrency, particularly among those closely following its performance.



Despite the sell walls, significant support exists, preventing sharp price declines for SHIB. According to IntoTheBlock data, 853,520 addresses are currently profitable, while 427,700 addresses hold SHIB at a loss. This support acts as a buffer against downward price swings during volatile periods.



Coin Edition previously reported on remarks by crypto analyst Mags, who asserted that now is an optimal time to buy SHIB. Mags believes the current market conditions offer investors a unique opportunity to purchase SHIB before it potentially breaks through its resistance levels.



Notably, SHIB’s trading volume has significantly decreased over the past week, falling by 43% to $397.78 million. This decline in trading activity may suggest that traders are awaiting more definitive market signals or a period of consolidation.

GameStop Tumbles 40% as Trading Icon Roaring Kitty Returns to Livestream

Solana-based meme token GME, which was inspired by the company but has no affiliation with it, almost doubled in price in less than a day before sharply paring gains on Friday. At press time it was down 50% over the preceding few hours, though still higher by more than three-fold this week.

Microsoft Limits New Windows AI 'Recall' Feature Following Privacy Backlash - Decrypt

Following weeks of criticism, Microsoft announced Friday that it will build tougher limits around the controversial AI-powered “Recall” feature that it unveiled during its annual developer conference in May. Cybersecurity and privacy experts railed against the product, calling it spyware and a potential honeypot for cybercriminals.In an update, Microsoft said it was changing how Recall functions, giving customers more control over the application. According to Microsoft, Copilot+ PC users will have to opt into using Recall, saying that the service will now be turned off by default.Additionally, enrollment in Microsoft’s Windows Hello service—the secure, biometric login feature introduced in Windows 10—is required to enable Recall, and decryption of snapshots will now require user authentication.“Even before making Recall available to customers, we have heard a clear signal that we can make it easier for people to choose to enable Recall on their Copilot+ PC and improve privacy and security safeguards,” Microsoft said in a statement.A feature of Microsoft’s new line of AI-powered Copilot+ Windows PCs, Recall uses artificial intelligence to take random screenshots of what the user is doing in order to provide a way to retrieve lost or missing data. Concerns that Recall would be able to capture passwords and other sensitive information soon followed.“We also know the best way to secure information on a PC is to secure the whole PC itself,” Microsoft said.Microsoft emphasized that Snapshots are stored locally and are not shared, and users will know when Recall is saving a snapshot. Microsoft also noted that Recall does not save snapshots of digital rights-managed content or private browsing in supported web browsers, and customers can also pause, filter, and delete snapshots at any time.“We are on a journey to build products and experiences that live up to our company mission to empower people and organizations to achieve more, and are driven by the critical importance of maintaining our customers’ privacy, security, and trust,” the firm noted. “As we always do, we will continue to listen to and learn from our customers, including consumers, developers and enterprises, to evolve our experiences in ways that are meaningful to them.”Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Court to sentence Craig Wright for lying about being Satoshi


London’s High Court of Justice, arguably the world’s most powerful copyright court, has reconvened to sentence Craig Wright for his false, perjurious claims to have written Bitcoin’s whitepaper as its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.
The courtroom was packed to hear final arguments from lawyers representing the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), which represents Bitcoin developers and companies. 
Today’s arguments aren’t about whether Wright lied — he did — but merely the punishment Wright should receive.
COPA lead attorney Jonathan Hough is obviously asking for a court injunction barring Wright from making any claim in a public forum about being Satoshi Nakamoto.
The alliance also wants the court to categorically deny any remaining legal avenues for Wright to appeal the ruling.

Moreover, COPA wants to escalate the ruling within the UK judiciary from what was essentially a copyright suit to a criminal proceeding. COPA has also asked to include Wright’s once-colleague at nChain, Stefan Matthews, as a criminal defendant for his own perjury.
COPA reminded the judge that Matthews supported Wright with false evidence, even after the court found Matthews’ evidence to be fake.
During today’s hearing, the judge voiced agreement that the court has a responsibility to impose an ‘extraordinary’ sentence on Wright due to his extensive, multi-year campaign to mislead the world about his identity. At a maximum, the court has the ability to put Wright behind bars for years.
Wright’s sentencing hearing has concluded for today, with proceedings due to continue next week.

GameStop Should Buy Bitcoin Says Scaramucci, RoaringKitty Streams For the First Time in years


																GameStop and its stock price have been the talking point of many crypto-centric and traditional finance communities throughout the past few days – not without reason.
GME’s price went on a massive rollercoaster this week, soaring by 130% and plummeting by 55% shortly after.
Many financial experts have chipped in with opinions, one of whom is the prominent BTC permabull – Anthony Scaramucci.
GameStop Should Buy Bitcoin: Scaramucci
GameStop was all the rage this week as virtually everyone who is even remotely interested in the so-called meme trading was anticipating today’s stream of Keith Gill.
Gill, who is perhaps better known by his nickname Roaring Kitty – went live on YouTube hours ago for the first time in almost four years, but we will get to that in a second.




Earlier today, GameStop filed to sell up to 75 million more shares as the price soared above $60. The market didn’t take this well, and GME tumbled by more than 50% today, currently trading below $30.
Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital came up with an interesting suggestion.
Replying to the statement above, Scaramucci said:
GameStop should buy #BITCOIN
Roaring Kitty Goes Live on YouTube
One of the most highly-anticipated events today was Keith Gill’s live stream on YouTube.
Gill, who became famous for building a massive GME position and then being a leading figure behind the stock’s massive rally back in 2020, was talking live on a broadcast that received over half a million views in a few hours.
It’s worth noting that multiple GME-inspired meme coins were trending upward before the stream. However, as the stock’s price tumbled today, so did these meme coins.
For instance, GME and ROAR declined by some 25% and 35%, respectively, throughout the stream itself. None of these are affiliated with Gill, at least not officially.
During the stream, Roaring Kitty confirmed that he’s still holding his positions and that he hasn’t opened new ones.

Ethereum Preparing For Pectra In Q1 2025: 3 Key EIPs That Will Go Live


								Ethereum developers continue to improve the network, maintaining a tradition that has been ongoing since its launch. Since the first update through Homestead, developers have implemented several hard forks, with the latest ones being Shanghai and Dencun.
Pectra Lays The Foundation For Even More Upgrades In Ethereum

The Ethereum community is eagerly anticipating the next key update, Pectra, scheduled for late Q1 2025. This hard fork, a significant enhancement after Dencun, will integrate 19 key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), collectively addressing scalability, security, and user experience concerns.

As mentioned earlier, the Pectra upgrade is part of yet another of Ethereum’s strategic approaches to development. Over the years, developers have introduced incremental improvements while laying the groundwork for bigger updates. As it is, Pectra lays the foundation for the eventual on-chain scaling of the mainnet.
From Account Abstraction To User Experience Enhancement And Security
In a post on X, an Ethereum analyst identified several EIPs that will go live, making the mainnet more performant and secure. One of them is EIP-7702, floated by Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. The proposal will replace EIP-3074 and introduce account abstraction without compromising security. 
The account abstraction feature, a key component of the Pectra upgrade, allows addresses to function temporarily as smart contracts during transactions. This feature significantly enhances user experience and streamlines transactions.

Another proposal that will go live is EIP-7594 or PeerDAS. The Analyst notes that the upgrade will focus on roll-up scalability, further boosting the efficiency of layer-2 platforms like Base and Arbitrum. Once implemented, the network’s layer-2 solutions would process even more transactions, helping drop gas fees.

Pectra will also implement EIP-7251 or MaxEB, a key change for validators. This EIP will make staking easier and more flexible. The maximum effective balance per validator will rise from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. This means that validators will be more flexible in their operations.
Other key EIPs that will go live include those related to the EVM Object Format (EOF), and EIP-2537 will enhance security and scalability by implementing cryptographic improvements. The analyst also identified the integration of EIP-7549, which will make Ethereum more efficient by reducing the consensus overhead.

Investors target Injective, ORDI gains ahead of Bitbot launch - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Injective and ORDI soared in intraday trading today, leading the market as analysts predict the altseason is loading.
Bitbot has wrapped up its token sale just as crypto sentiment flips bullish.

Injective (INJ) and ORDI (ORDI) are among altcoins to see decent gains this week as market anticipation for an altseason rises. INJ and ORDI tokens could continue higher as investors aggressively position.
Meanwhile, crypto traders are poised as the market eyes new momentum for top altcoins, memecoins, RWA and artificial intelligence (AI) tokens among other key sectors. Also emerging as a target for traders is Bitbot (BITBOT), a new trading bot set to go live on Telegram.
Discover why investors who missed the project’s presale may jump in when tokens go live on crypto exchanges.  
Injective surges as investors bet for more gains
Injective, the interoperable Layer-1 blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi), has had a cracking 24 hours.
Trading volume has skyrocketed more than 90%, while price broke to highs of $30.92. INJ currently trades above a key resistance line and further strengthening looks likely amid various bullish catalysts.
On June 6, the project’s team released a new tokenomics paper on the native token INJ, highlighting its utility.
The news bolstered INJ price before further announcements, including integration of Japanese gaming platform Gumi as validator and launch of Injective’s first yield-bearing synthetic dollar, triggered more buying.
Injective also shared more positive developments, notably around GameFi, staking and a crypto conference in Vietnam.
ORDI soars double-digits as memecoins ignite frenzy
ORDI continues to attract attention since its debut in the Bitcoin ecosystem when it launched as the first BRC-20 token on the Ordinals protocol.
On Friday, ORDI price surged more than 11% to cross above $50.
The daily chart suggests bulls may find immediate support above $60, a scenario that opens up the all-time high of $95. It could then target price discovery with a breakout above the psychological level of $100.  
Bitbot token readies for market launch
New Telegram-based trading app Bitbot just wrapped up a stellar presale that raised over $4.3 million.
Investors who participated in the presale could soon have the opportunity to trade and potentially reap big when the BITBOT token lists on major exchanges.
While this milestone is creating a buzz in the market, there’s one thing that’s even more important for the crypto community- the launch of the world’s first non-custodial Telegram bot.
The main reason for the excitement is that the trading bot market is rapidly growing into a huge sector. Data shows bots across the market have reached over $25 billion in cumulative trading volume, while the average daily volume currently sits at over $164 million.
As bots become vital trading tools, users are now more inclined to go for not just the most innovative, but ones that offer enhanced security.
Bitbot stands out in this category with its non-custodial bot. AI integration and the availability of anti-MEV and anti-rug pull features cement its indispensable outlook.
Following the presale, the Bitbot team announced that the native token BITBOT will launch on exchanges for trading.
Meanwhile, the key product (bot) is ready for market debut with features such as trading interface, market data integration and staking. The developer team is working on the non-custodial wallet integration ahead of its launch.
What else adds to a bullish outlook for Bitbot?
Injective and ORDI’s gains, as with most other tokens registering decent gains, come as analysts predict crypto is on the cusp of a major altseason.
Pseudonymous crypto trader and analyst Moustache shared such a bullish outlook today, pointing to a technical analysis tool that traders use to identify price trends.
The Gaussian Channel indicator on the two-week chart shows a similar accumulation phase and retest pattern as seen before the last bull market.
According to the analyst, the indicator suggests crypto could be poised for its “biggest altseason” yet.
Bitbot, which could revolutionize the crypto trading market on Telegram, has the potential to be one of the outperformers.

Bakkt explores potential sale or breakup amid surge in crypto M&A activity - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bakkt is considering strategic options, including a potential sale or breakup, according to an initial report from Bloomberg citing persons familiar with the matter. The move comes amid a surge in takeover activity within the cryptocurrency sector.The sources, who asked to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the matter, revealed that Bakkt has been working with a financial advisor to evaluate its options. However, no final decision has been made, and the company may choose to remain independent.Bakkt was launched in 2018 by Intercontinental Exchange, which owns several major futures markets and the NYSE. The venture’s founding CEO, Kelly Loeffler, later served as a US Senator from Georgia for a year. Earlier this year, Bakkt faced the risk of being delisted from the NYSE after disclosing that it might not be able to continue as a going concern.Increased crypto merger and acquisition activitiesThe potential sale of Bakkt comes as consolidation activity heats up in the digital-asset sector, with crypto prices nearing record highs. While some companies are considering expansion, others are still recovering from the industry-wide meltdown that occurred two years ago. Recent examples of consolidation include Robinhood’s acquisition of European crypto exchange Bitstamp and Riot Platforms Inc.’s proposed takeover of its rival Bitfarms.Bakkt, which went public through a merger with a blank-check vehicle in 2021, reported a first-quarter loss of $21 million on $855 million in revenue. The company also recently announced a partnership with Crossover Markets to develop a crypto electronic communication network (ECN).One of Bakkt’s valuable assets is its BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services, which allows it to operate in the state. Other major industry participants with this license include crypto exchange Coinbase, stablecoin issuer Circle, and Jack Dorsey’s digital payment firm Square.Following the news of the potential sale, Bakkt shares rose 15% to $22.33 on Friday, bringing the company’s market value to around $300 million. Despite this recent increase, the stock has fallen approximately 30% over the past year.

The Crypto Market Is Missing One Ingredient Critical to Fueling Sustained Price Rally, Says Analytics Firm - The Daily Hodl


								Despite some bullish developments, the digital asset market still lacks one key ingredient that’s critical to fueling a sustained price rally, according to the analytics firm CryptoQuant.
CryptoQuant notes that demand is up for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).










“Bitcoin demand growth in permanent holders added 70,000 Bitcoin in the last 30 days. Large investors’ demand is up 4.4% monthly. Additionally, large investors are injecting $1 billion daily into Bitcoin, resembling 2020’s pre-rally activity…
Ethereum’s demand has also increased. Post-May 20th, ETH demand spiked due to spot ETH ETF approvals in the USA. Daily purchases by permanent holders rose to 40,000 ETH, with large investors holding 16 million ETH.”
Source: CryptoQuant/X
However, CryptoQuant notes that stablecoin liquidity needs to recover to fuel a sustained crypto rally.
“The growth in the market capitalization of Tether’s USDT, a proxy for fresh liquidity in crypto markets, has continued to decelerate and is now growing at the slowest pace since February 11. Price rallies are generally accompanied by an acceleration in stablecoin liquidity growth.”
Source: CryptoQuant/X
USDT is the top stablecoin by market cap and aims to maintain a 1:1 peg to the US dollar.
Bitcoin is trading at $70,812 at time of writing and is up nearly 4% in the past seven days.
ETH is trading at $3,809 and is up 1.5% in the past week.

Biggest Wave of Crypto IPOs Coming if Crypto Prices Continue Up (Analyst)


																As bitcoin prices approach another all-time high, the crypto industry is preparing for a potential wave of initial public offerings (IPOs), according to Bloomberg.
If crypto asset prices continue rising, the next 18 months could see the biggest wave of crypto-related IPOs on record, said Matthew Kennedy, a senior market strategist with IPO researcher Renaissance Capital, in an interview with Bloomberg on June 6.
He added that as many as 15 companies could go public if market momentum continues.
Crypto IPO Avalanche
The analyst added that even if BTC stays where it is at around $70,000, it would still spur more crypto companies to go public.
“If Bitcoin stays on its current trajectory, I am sure that would open the floodgates. If it stays at its current level, that would also support more public issues.”
Overall sentiment about crypto changed dramatically with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024, and the further green light of Ethereum ETFs four months later.




Crypto companies such as blockchain provider Chia Network and stablecoin issuer Circle have confidentially filed or submitted draft registration statements for IPOs, which could potentially happen as soon as this year. Additionally, trading platform eToro is also considering an IPO, while Animoca Brands has several potential IPO candidates waiting for 2025 or 2026.
Despite battling SEC charges, U.S. crypto exchange Kraken has long had ambitions to go public and is currently in talks to raise a pre-IPO round of capital. On June 6, CryptoPotato reported that the exchange aims to raise $100 million before the move.
Institutional investor interest in crypto is high, with nearly 40% of family offices actively investing or exploring crypto investments, reported Bloomberg. Additionally, a record 43% of US retail investors are likely to buy crypto in the next year, according to a recent Motley Fool survey.
Crypto Market Projections
While crypto market capitalization has remained flat over the past couple of days, bitcoin has been in the driving seat and has held on to gains to keep it above $70,000 and just 3.4% away from its all-time high.
Earlier this week, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki predicted that BTC would reach $350,000 by late August this year.
Meanwhile, analysts at Secure Digital Markets said, “bitcoin appears poised for a potential surge towards historic highs, with a mere 4% gap remaining.”
A move into six-figure territory for BTC is indeed likely to catalyze crypto companies to go public.

HULK Celebrity Memecoin Pumps and Dumps in Alleged Rug Pull As Hulk Hogan Claims His Accounts Were Hacked - The Daily Hodl


								Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan says that posts made to his account promoting the Solana (SOL)-based memecoin HULK yesterday were not from him.
HULK investors are reeling today after the celebrity memecoin based on Hulk Hogan’s likeness pumped to an over $17 million market cap yesterday before crashing to its current market cap of roughly $8,000, according to CoinGecko.










According to Mashable crypto reporter Matt Binder, Hogan’s X account promoted the HULK memecoin through several posts yesterday. During that time, the token pumped to a multi-million dollar market cap before crashing down to earth. Hogan later claimed the posts were not from him.
Source: Hulk Hogan via Matt Binder/X
According to Binder, there were also several red flags about the HULK posts on Hogan’s account.
“There were signs that something was off with HULK.
For example, this tweet included a video of Hulk Hogan seemingly endorsing the memecoin to prove it was legit.
But the video is actually from a Dec 2023 video promoting a karaoke night & makes zero actual references to crypto.”
According to the Blockchain Data visualizer Bubblemaps, data shows that “insiders” bought a significant amount of HULK before the posts went live.
“Insiders bought 15% of HULK before it was announced 
We have found 5 connected wallets that bought on http://pump.fun before Hulk Hogan shared the contract.
Already $200,000 sold and ~$1.5 million unrealized.”

Though this story is still developing, Hogan is far from the first celebrity to jump on the memecoin craze.

Ethena Expands USDe Into Aave As ‘Asset Matures’ - The Defiant

Users can now deposit stETH, weETH, ETH and WBTC on Aave to borrow stablecoins into Ethena USDe or sUSDe.Ethena Labs, issuer of the fourth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, continues to broaden USDe’s reach in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and has integrated with the industry’s largest lending platform, Aave.According to Ethena’s team, users can now deposit USDe and loop their position with other stablecoins on Aave, and deposit stETH, weETH, ETH and WBTC on Aave to borrow stablecoins into Ethena USDe or sUSDe. Users will also unlock long delta exposure to tokens such as ETH while providing liquidity into Ethena.Additionally users will be able to earn Sats for posting USDe collateral (20x multiplier), sUSDe collateral (10x, although it needs to be confirmed via a governance vote), stETH, ETH, rETH, and weETH collateral to borrow GHO into USDe (10x) among other bonuses.'More Mature'“After a quarter, the asset is more mature and has been deemed acceptable to be onboarded with caps and inside isolation mode,” Marc Zeller of the Aave Chan Initiative said. He told The Defiant there was no pushback from the community “at all,” and that risk parameters are sound.His words come as a surprise, given Zeller authored a proposal in Aave’s governance forum to revoke the collateral status of DAI on Aave, when MakerDAO caused DeFi community members to clash over adding USDe as collateral in early April.Climbed the RanksThe integration is yet another power move by Ethena. Despite triggering some short-term PTSD by how its yield-bearing architecture works–through a unique blend of native staking returns, and average funding paid to shorts–users have been flocking to the protocol and its stablecoin USDe.USDe has quickly climbed the ranks and now sits in fourth place among all stablecoins by market capitalization. It has grown 42% in the past 30 days, rising from $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion.USDe Market Cap - CoinGeckoBy joining Aave, Ethena unlocks the largest lending ecosystem in the industry. Aave holds $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), which accounts for 35% of the sector, according to DefiLlama.The Ethena team explained today on X that the current borrow rates on USDC for Aave “compare favorably” to the borrow costs observed on the MorphoLabs USDe and sUSDe vaults and may provide a cheaper option to access levered exposure.Borrow rates for USDC on Aave sits at 12.8%, whereas USDe on Morpho is currently at 15.4%.

Time to Ditch Meme Stocks? | Bankless


Meme Dilution? GameStop bull “Roaring Kitty” was briefly a billionaire on paper last night after the price of GME surged to nearly $70, but a stock split announcement this morning reversed his fortunes and those of retail traders following his bet! How much abuse will investors take until they turn to crypto?Roaring Kitty tweeted out an image of a green Uno reverse card this weekend before subsequently disclosing his monstrous GME position made up of 5M GME shares and 120k contracts of $20 June 21, 2024, GME calls – igniting hopes for an aggressive short squeeze and a massive pump in price.Yesterday, his YouTube account scheduled a livestream for today at 12 PM EST, which revealed little information other than a seemingly auspicious green candle and included a caption from The Babadook stating, “I’ll wager with you, I’ll make you a bet,” leading traders to speculate what his next moves would be.Plenty of market participants had understandably positioned themselves for bullishness, expecting whatever statements or actions Kitty made during the stream to catalyze another move up in price.Unfortunately for bulls, the GameStock Corporation prudently chose to capitalize on the hype by announcing the issuance of 75M shares during earnings this morning, and no new developments came from Kitty’s stream, pouring cold water on the rally.
Considering the immense flexibility corporations have in deciding to issue new stock and the contrary goals they may hold to meme stock investors, many have called into question the idea of participating in meme mania via traditional financial assets.Unlike stocks, which can be easily diluted by their issuers, many crypto tokens have hard-capped supplies or known issuance schedules.Although the supply of many tokens is known, or can at least be projected with some degree of certainty, newer memecoins have heavily concentrated supplies and have not withstood the test of time, providing little confirmation of a truly decentralized holder base and increasing the risk that buyers get dumped on.Alternatively, more established memecoins such as DOGE, possess strong guarantees of decentralization, demonstrated by their historically resilient communities which have stuck around through multiple cycles.
Despite the carefully crafted Roaring Kitty persona intended to portray Keith Gill as “just another retail investor” who enjoys cold beer, talking about basketball, and is optimistic on the long-term future of GameStop, Gill was formerly a Chief Compliance Officer at an investment advisory firm and previously bore the honorifics of CFA charterholder and FINRA licensed securities broker.Frenzy-driven, leverage-juiced buying can certainly drive up price in the short-term, but even GME is bound to trade in line with fundamentals as holders eventually cash out. Stocks represent ownership in a business, which are ultimately driven by the pursuit of maximizing value for shareholders, leading companies to raise cash via share sales as the market prices diverge from a realistic valuation.For followers of the Kitty – who seemingly has no plans at the moment other than expressing his belief in the long-term future of GME through short-dated options – it is unlikely that a major bounty awaits on the other side of this rainbow, potentially leading participants to pack it up and migrate to the crypto casino with whatever remaining funds they possess.

Bitcoin Peak of $120,000 By Late 2024, Major Alt Season To Follow: Bitfinex - Benzinga

Analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex on Friday outlined a potential Bitcoin BTC/USD peak of at least $120,000 during the current market cycle, which they expect to continue until late 2024 or early 2025.This prediction is based on historical patterns and on-chain indicators, which suggest a correlation between Bitcoin’s halving event and its subsequent price peak. While some analysts project higher price targets, Bitfinex emphasizes the importance of reacting to market movements rather than relying on long-term predictions. They also acknowledge the growing investment in alternative crypto assets, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s dominance.Metrics Suggest Room For Growth:The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a key metric used to gauge market sentiment, currently sits at 2.56. Historically, Bitcoin market tops have occurred when this ratio exceeds 3.2.This suggests there may be room for further price appreciation before a potential correction.Altcoin Season On The Horizon:The Bitfinex report predicts a significant altcoin season coinciding with Bitcoin’s peak. Sectors poised for strong performance include Decentralized Finance (DeFi), fueled by ongoing innovation and adoption. Additionally, AI and meme coins are expected to remain prominent narratives throughout the cycle. Real-World Assets (RWAs) are also highlighted as a potential growth area.Also Read: Bitcoin Spikes To $72K, Then Drops $1,300 Following US Employment Report: What Happened?Potential Challenges For The Market:The report identifies several factors that could trigger a crypto winter, a period of prolonged market decline. These include:
Regulatory Crackdowns: Increased government scrutiny and stricter regulations could dampen investor confidence and lead to sell-offs.



Macroeconomic Factors: A significant global economic downturn or major financial crisis could negatively impact the crypto market.



Market Saturation: As prices reach unsustainable levels, a natural correction driven by profit-taking and market saturation is expected.
On-Chain Indicators Provide Guidance:While acknowledging the limitations of long-term price predictions, Bitfinex analysts emphasize the importance of using historically relevant metrics. They highlight key on-chain indicators such as the MVRV ratio, hash rate stability, and realized cap HODL waves to gauge market sentiment and investor behavior.Looking Ahead:The Bitfinex report offers a valuable perspective on the potential trajectory of the cryptocurrency market. With Bitcoin poised for continued growth and altcoins positioned to capitalize, investors face both exciting opportunities and potential challenges.Interested in delving deeper into the future of Bitcoin, altcoins, and the evolving regulatory landscape?

Rune Christensen Explains Why He Wants to Remake Maker and Kill DAI

Yeah, but again it comes back to whether it has some kind of legitimate use. The point is if you're making it easy to do bad things with this technology. There is no privacy on the blockchain, right? Everything is totally transparent. You have Chainalysis monitoring everything. Mixers thwart that. The best example of all is the banking system, because this is happening all the time at a much greater scale. You can be fully anonymous in crypto if you're just smart enough. But in the banking system, it's actually pretty easy because you just need to bribe a few corrupt bankers or something like that. It's pretty straightforward. So the thing that would get risky for us, even though I think, again, that there is a moral obligation to figure out how to do this in a way that doesn't just disproportionately benefit criminals, is to build a privacy solution into a decentralized currency.

It's Time To Go Long On Bitcoin and Shitcoins: Arthur Hayes - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsRecent policy moves from global central banks suggest that the time has come to ape into Bitcoin and high-conviction shitcoins, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.Earlier this week, both the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank became the first G7 countries to lower their benchmark interest rates, which neither region has done in several years. According to Hayes, those pivotal moves will “catapult crypto out of the northern hemispheric summer doldrums.”“The trend is clear. Central banks at the margin are starting easing cycles,” the 39-year-old entrepreneur wrote in a Thursday post. “We know how to play this game… Go long Bitcoin and subsequently shitcoins.”As for his personal portfolio, Hayes said he would be rotating out of Ethena’s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe and back into “conviction shitcoins”–near-zero value tokens and meme coins—which he said he will name only after he’s done buying them.“For the Maelstrom portfolio projects, who asked for my opinion on whether to launch their tokens now or later, I say, Let’s Fucking Go!” he added.Historically speaking, both stocks and Bitcoin tend to perform well when central banks drive down borrowing costs. One example lies in Bitcoin’s climb from under $4000 to $64,000 between March 2020 and April 2021, right after the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to 0.25%.Most analysts and market participants don’t believe the Fed will follow its global neighbors with an immediate rate cut at its June meeting, however, given that inflation is proving more persistent in the United States.Still, Hayes argues that the U.S. central bank is under immense geopolitical pressure to devalue the dollar in order to provide relative strength to the Japanese Yen. As such, a rate cut will likely arrive soon–just not during election season while inflation is such a hot political topic.By contrast, Hayes says the Bank of England will likely surprise the world with a rate cut on June 20, following orders from the United States to keep the yen strong.“Suffice it to say, the crypto bull is reawakening and is about to gore the hides of profligate central bankers,” Hayes concluded.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Iggy Azalea Insists She’s No Rug-Puller as Her Token Surges 1,000% in Week


After returning to the limelight with her headline-grabbing meme coin, Australian rapper Iggy Azalea now insists that she is no rug-puller in a recent interview with Fortune. In fact, she wants to find potential use cases for her viral Mother Iggy (MOTHER) cryptocurrency that could make it viable in the long term. Azalea intends to turn the memecoin into a stablecoin, according to her Fortune interview.  The Australian rapper, who became the ultimate it-girl of 2014 with her smash hit "Fancy" and other highly successful singles, claims that she had been casually observing crypto since 2020 before eventually launching her own coin. Azalea was forced to act after a fraudster was trying to push another meme coin by impersonating her.  The MOTHER meme coin, which was launched in late May, generated plenty of buzz because of its massive gains and Azalea's frequent social media posts that ranged from raunchy pictures to hilarious memes. On Thursday, the market cap of Solana-based MOTHER surged to nearly $250 million after a whale snapped up a large number of tokens. However, despite all the hype, Iggy Azalea's token lacks any value proposition like most meme coins. Unsurprisingly, the cryptocurrency has already attracted plenty of detractors, including none other than Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. As reported by U.Today, Buterin lambasted the new crop of celebrity meme coins due to their lack of utility, prompting a swift response from Azalea in the form of a belittling meme. However, Azalea is seemingly unfazed by all the criticism, arguing that peace is not profitable for meme coins and telling haters to get out of her way.

Shiba Inu On The Verge Of Triangle Breakout, Here's Key Levels To Watch | Bitcoinist.com


								As top coins like Shiba Inu continue to gain traction in the midst of heightened optimism surrounding meme coins, cryptocurrency analyst and trader YG Crypto has shared insights on SHIB price action, predicting a potential Triangle breakout for the digital asset.
Incoming Triangle Breakout For Shiba Inu
A Triangle pattern is represented by drawing trendlines that imply a pause in the current trend along a converging price range. The pattern is called a Triangle due to its resemblance to a triangle shape.

Technical analysts classify these as either reversals or continuation patterns of an established trend. However, even though this is a continuation, traders should wait for breakouts to move in or out of a position.
YG Crypto analysis indicates SHIB could be set for a decisive and significant price movement, citing few resistance levels to look out for. It is consistent with the general sentiment of the market, which is getting more upbeat about SHIB’s chances of making a big move soon.
SHIB could be poised for a Triangle breakout | Source: YG Crypto on X
According to the expert, a brief decline was experienced by Shiba Inu below support, which resulted in several stop-loss orders. However, the price has since rebounded, displaying a robust move on the upside as bulls are charging back, signaling an impending potential triangle breakout for SHIB.
The post read:
Shiba Inu (SHIB) took a temporary dip below support, triggering some stop-loss orders. But hold on, bulls are charging back. The price is showing a strong upward move, and a potential triangle breakout looms.
As a result, YG Crypto has pointed out some resistance levels to pay attention to between the $0.00002810 and $0.00002880 threshold. Furthermore, YG Crypto claims a decisive break above this range can indicate a substantial rise in prices in the coming days.
Delving on the next move of the triangle pattern, YG Crypto noted that the move in its entirety will probably determine whether the price can break through the aforementioned resistance zone. While a rejection at the range can result in a price reversal, a breakout from the area points to an uptrend that will likely hold.
SHIB Large Transaction Sees Uptick
YG Crypto’s bullish prediction coincides with a notable rise in SHIB’s price on Thursday as whales‘ interest has grown. However, today, the digital asset appears to have lost momentum, as SHIB witnessed a sharp decline from $0.00002615 to $0.00002502.

Santiment, a market intelligence platform, reported a surge in transactions involving the popular meme coin this week. Data from the platform shows that compared to the usual averages so far this year, the number of Shiba Inu transactions involving $100,000 or more has more than doubled this week, signaling massive accumulation from SHIB enthusiasts.
At the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.00002512, indicating a decline of 1.93% in the past day. Its market cap and trading volume have also seen negative sentiment, dropping by 1.93% and 32%, respectively, in the last 24 hours.

Inverted Hammer Appears On The XRP Price Chart, Crypto Analyst Picks First Target Of $0.75


																Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has revealed a bullish pattern that recently formed on the XRP price chart. The analyst also revealed how high the crypto token could rise once it makes this move to the upside.  
Inverted Hammer Forms On The Chart
Egrag highlighted an Inverted hammer that had formed on XRP’s chart while noting how bullish this was for the crypto token. He claimed that last month’s candle formation showed a 75% Inverted Hammer at the bottom, which is “super bullish” for XRP. Egrag believes this is an “amazing sign” that the altcoin could rise to $0.75 soon enough. He added that July will be a “month of fireworks” for XRP.

XRP’s possible rise to $0.75 is significant, as Egrag had previously highlighted that price level as a “critical breakout point” for XRP. Back then, he mentioned that XRP was “poised” to achieve this breakout in the coming weeks. He suggested an XRP breakout above that price level would send it to $1.5, and the crypto token could enjoy a further upward trend to $7.5. 
Crypto analyst CasiTrades also recently provided a bullish narrative for the altcoin. She stated that the crypto token is maintaining its bullish momentum and bouncing off the 0.382 retracement level. The analyst added that XRP has finally flipped a trendline that had acted as resistance for months to support.
Source: X
Meanwhile, CasiTrades highlighted $0.54 as a price level to keep an eye on, stating that XRP could encounter resistance at that level. She suggested that the coin could enjoy a parabolic move if it breaks out above that price level, remarking that it is a “crucial level to watch for a potential breakthrough.”CasiTrades previously raised the possibility of the altcoin rising to as high as $80 when it breaks out from a consolidation triangle. 
XRP Is On The Brink Of A Parabolic Rally
Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto recently suggested that XRP was on the brink of a parabolic rally. He stated in an X post that the token is currently at the level it was in 2017 and 2020, which triggered a “massive rally” for the crypto token on both occasions. In 2017, the altcoin enjoyed a price gain of 61,000% in 280 days.

The chart that Mikybull Crypto shared showed that the altcoin could rise to as high as $5. Meanwhile, crypto analyst XRP Captain claimed that the altcoin was ready for the “massive breakout.” He claimed that XRP is in the “middle of apex. ” Crypto analyst Jaydee also agreed with XRP Captain that a breakout is imminent, stating that “it’s coming,” although he claimed that “beginners” will miss out on the run.
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.52, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Binance Launchpool Rolls Out Support for New Solana-Based AI Computing Altcoin - The Daily Hodl


								Binance is adding the token of a Solana (SOL)-powered decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) computing network to the roster of supported crypto assets on its Launchpool platform.
In a statement, the world’s largest crypto exchange says that io.net (IO) will be the 55th crypto project on Binance Launchpool, which allows users to deposit their coins into a pool of funds to earn assets from new projects.










Binance says users will be able to stake BNB and the stablecoin First Digital USD (FDUSD) into separate pools to farm IO tokens over four days starting on June 7th. IO will then be listed on June 11th.
According to io.net, it is creating an enterprise-grade decentralized computing network that allows machine learning engineers to access distributed cloud clusters at a lower cost.
The aim is to address the challenges of relying on traditional cloud service providers that have 2.5x less capacity than the estimated market demand, which causes problems such as high costs, limited choices and longer waiting times to access hardware with cloud services.
Reads the io.net website,
“We believe that compute is this generation’s “digital oil,” powering a never-before-seen technological industrial revolution. Our vision is to build IO to be the currency of compute, powering an ecosystem of products and services that enable access to compute as a resource and as an asset.”
Binance says it will attach a seed tag to IO, which indicates that the token has higher volatility and risks than other crypto assets listed on its platform.

Memecoin That’s Shot Up More Than 61,000% in Eight Months Will Go ‘Berserk,’ Says Crypto Trader - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says one meme asset that has seen tremendous gains over the last eight months will continue its upward momentum.
In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 217,000 followers on the social media platform X that memecoin MAGA (TRUMP) will go “berserk” even though it experienced a slight pullback.










“TRUMP: this is still one of my bags and this is pulled back to the .50 [fibonacci level], I think I’m going to add to my position around here. Still bullish with this overall narrative going into [the] election and TRUMP will be talked about often by mainstream media. This goes berserk later too, in my opinion.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
The trader’s chart indicates that TRUMP could hit the $18 price tag by the end of June or the start of July. TRUMP is trading for $12.43 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours. On October 7th, it was valued at $0.0199, meaning it has seen a staggering gain of 61,759% since.
The analyst goes on to mention Notcoin (NOT), another red hot altcoin, saying that it’s forming a pattern that is indicative of a top.
 “NOT: I’ve since changed my mind. The price action has calmed down and there’s a lot less volatility. I think that this looks a lot better now- you can see more of a consolidation pattern instead of huge spikes in both directions (which is more indicative of a top).”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
NOT is trading for $0.0215 at time of writing, an increase of over 300% from its price of $0.00527 set on May 26th.
Altcoin Sherpa concludes his analysis by advising investors to accumulate “shitcoins” from now until Q4 of 2024 as he believes Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance level will lower by then, paving the way for altcoins to print gains.
 “You should probably accumulate shitcoins from now until late Q4. Hard to say what the particular timing is but most altcoin/BTC pairs are going to continue to go down in my opinion, but once Q4 rolls around, expecting BTC.d to come down and for there to be some alt action.”

Norwegian Government Says It Recovered Large Amount of This Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


The Norwegian government has successfully frozen and returned $5.7 million in funds linked to the infamous Ronin (RON) hack in 2022. This vulnerability, which led to a staggering loss of over $600 million, remains the largest DeFi vulnerability in history.
Ronin, an Ethereum sidechain, was developed to support the popular play-to-win web3 game Axie Infinity (AXS) developed by Sky Mavis. The funds were recovered through a coordinated effort involving law enforcement, lawyers, accountants and blockchain criminal firms such as Chainalysis.


The Norwegian National Agency for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crimes (Økokrim) played a key role in the recovery of the stolen assets. In a recent post, Sky Mavis expressed her gratitude to everyone involved in the rescue effort, specifically mentioning Økokrim and the FBI in the USA.

Sky Mavis confirmed that 15% of the recovered funds will be used to cover expenses, while the rest will be deposited into the Axie Infinity treasury. They also stated that a separate $40 million worth of assets have been frozen by law enforcement authorities, but it may take some time for these assets to be recovered.





The Ronin attack, which took place in March 2022, was linked to North Korea's Lazarus Group, which is also suspected of other notable attacks, including the $100 million Harmony bridge attack in January 2023. However, Sky Mavis was unable to provide a specific timeline for the return of frozen assets at this stage.

US National Debt Hits All-Time High of $34,667,000,000,000 As CBO Warns Rising Debt Will Reduce Americans' Income - The Daily Hodl


								The US national debt just hit a new all-time high of $34.667 trillion.
New numbers from the Treasury Department’s Debt to the Penny system show the country’s national debt reached the milestone on Friday, May 31st.










That’s a $677 billion increase from the start of 2024, when the nation’s debt stood at $33.990 trillion.
The new record high comes amid a report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warning that the greater the nation’s debt, the less money Americans will earn.
“The current law debt trajectory will reduce income growth by 12% over the next three decades and 13% annually by Fiscal Year (FY) 2049. 
Rapidly rising debt could reduce income growth by 33% over the next three decades and 42% annually by FY 2049. 
Rapidly rising debt would reduce projected income by about $14,500 per person in FY 2054, in today’s dollars.”
The CBO says the reduction in household income is due to “crowding out,”  an economic theory that traces how high debt and deficits slow economic growth on national and individual level.
“…High debt and deficits carry significant risks and threats to the budget and the economy. 
High and rising debt hinders economic growth by crowding out investments, pushes up interest rates, strains the federal budget through rising interest payments, creates geopolitical challenges and risks, makes responding to new emergencies more challenging, imposes burdens on future generations, and increases the risk of a fiscal crisis.”

New York AG Pushes Back Against DCG, Silbert’s Motion to Dismiss Fraud Case

DCG and Silbert have denied that the promissory note was a sham.

Litecoin price cracks bullish barrier: $120 target in sight? - AMBCrypto



Market sentiment around Litecoin remained bearish. 
A few metrics looked bullish, but indicators suggested otherwise. 

Litecoin’s [LTC] price action has remained dormant for the last week as it didn’t move much. However, the trend can change as LTC broke above a bullish pattern. 
If the coin tests that pattern, then investors might witness explosive growth in the coming weeks. 
Litecoin prepares for a rally
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that LTC’s price only moved marginally in the last seven days. At the time of writing, Litecoin was trading at $84.48 with a market capitalization of over $6.3 billion, making it the 20th largest crypto. 
The sluggish price action also had a negative impact on LTC’s market sentiment. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that LTC’s weighted sentiment remained in the negative zone. Its social volume also remained, except for a spike on the 7th of June.

But things can turn volatile soon. 
World Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development.
 As per the tweet, LTC’s price broke above a bullish pennant pattern, which might allow the coin to touch $120 in the coming weeks. 
LTC’s price entered the pattern in March and since then has been consolidating inside it. 
Odds of an LTC bull rally are…
Since LTC showcased a bullish breakout, AMBCrypto then analyzed the coin’s on-chain metrics to see how likely it is for LTC to turn explosive. 
As per our analysis, whale activity around the coin remained substantially high throughout the last week. Additionally, its MVRV ratio also increased, which was bullish. 
At press time, the MVRV ratio had a value of 14.79%. 
Source: Santiment
Moreover, LTC’s fear and greed index had a value of 46% at press time, meaning that the market was in a neutral phase. Whenever the metric reaches that level, it indicates that things might get volatile soon. 
We then took a look at Litecoin’s daily chart to better understand what to expect. In order to touch $120, it is crucial for LTC to go above its resistance at $89.48. 
A successful breakout above that level could allow LTC to reclaim $106 before it reaches $120. We found that its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a slight uptick from the neutral mark, hinting that it’s likely for LTC to turn bullish. 

Realistic or not, here’s LTC’s market cap in BTC terms 

However, the rest of the indicators suggested that it might take a bit longer for LTC to turn volatile. 
For example, its Money Flow Index (MFI) registered a downtick. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also resting at the neutral mark.

Shiba Inu And XRP Have Fallen Behind PEPE In This Major Metric | Bitcoinist.com


								Popular frog-themed cryptocurrency, Pepe (PEPE) has witnessed a dramatic surge in its trading activities, surpassing prominent cryptocurrencies like XRP, the 7th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second largest meme coin by market capitalization. 
Trading Activity Surpass Shiba Inu And XRP
A crypto member identified as ‘KingChad’ on X (formerly Twitter) has unveiled Pepe’s remarkable performance over the past month, highlighting the meme coin’s surging 30-day trading volume, which has exceeded a whopping $41 billion. 

Pepe’s significant trading activity has notably outperformed XRP and Shiba Inu. Precisely, XRP recorded a trading volume of about $34 billion, signaling a $6.8 billion marginal difference in favor of the meme coin. 

Pepe’s significant trading volume has also propelled the cryptocurrency into the ranks of the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of weekly and monthly trading activity. In addition to Shiba Inu and XRP, Pepe has surpassed popular meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Dogwifhat (WIF) and Floki (FLOKI). 
Dogecoin in particular recorded a 30-day trading volume of $24.6 billion while Floki trailed slightly behind with a $23.4 billion trading volume. Newer Meme coins like Dogwifhat which have experienced gains of over 1,805% since the beginning of the year are still $15.9 billion below Pepe in its 30-day trading volume.
This significant rise in trading activity underscores the meme coin’s increasing popularity among investors, highlighting its bullish strength amidst market conditions. Moreover, it further solidifies the meme coin’s position as a key player in the competitive and volatile crypto market.
In addition to its increase in trading activity, CoinGecko disclosed that the meme coin experienced a surge of more than 50% in the last month, reaching a market capitalization of $6.8 billion and surpassing Polygon (MATIC). The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization has since reduced to $5.99 billion, ranking 21st among the largest cryptocurrencies and falling below Polygon which is currently the 18th most valuable cryptocurrency. 
Pepe And Shiba Inu Record Daily Declines
Despite experiencing a soaring trading volume, Pepe’s price has been seeing major declines in the last few days. The frog-themed meme coin and Shiba Inu have been recording daily declines, underscoring the rising market volatility. 
As of writing, the meme coin is trading at $0.000014, reflecting a substantial 3.3% decline in the last 24 hours. While Shiba Inu’s price has witnessed a 1.36% drop within the same time frame, pushing its price down to $0.000025. 

A crypto analyst identified as ‘The Data Nerd,’ has also revealed substantial transactions executed by a Pepe and Shiba Inu whale. According to the report, an anonymous whale withdrew a staggering 199 billion Pepe, valued at $2.9 million and 37 billion Shiba Inu tokens worth $964,000 from Binance. 
The motivation behind these transactions has not been disclosed yet. However, prevailing market conditions may have spurred the withdrawals, as  Pepe’s price has been pushed down by 4.3% over the past week.

Celebrity Memecoins: Hulk Hogan's $17M Rug Pull Allegations


																Celebrity memecoins have been the talk of the town for the past two weeks. A trend that resurged at the end of May quickly became one of the biggest narratives around the crypto community.

	Related Reading


The industry has seen controversies, rug pulls, and Vitalik Buterin’s thoughts on the celebrity token frenzy. In the phenomenon’s most recent development, WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan beefed with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea.
Celebrity Memecoins A Week Later
Despite the trend starting around May 20 with influencer tokens, celebrity tokens didn’t gain mainstream traction until reality TV star and Olympian Caitlyn Jenner launched her JENNER memecoin. Alongside Jenner, rapper Rich the Kid joined the crypto community with RICH.
However, both tokens were surrounded by controversy after it was revealed that alleged serial scammer Sahil Arora was involved in the launch. Several other artists and personalities joined the crypto space to launch their memecoins, including Lil Pump, Davido, Trippie Red, and MoneyBagg Yo. Some of these launches appear to be linked to Arora’s scams.
A week later, most celebrity memecoins saw a significant price decline or ended up as a rug pull scam. JENNER, which kickstarted the celebrity mania, is currently 81% down from its all-time high (ATH) registered on May 27.
The Olympian’s token, described as “the goddess of Solana,” went from trading around $0.04273 to $0.009072. This significant decrease has also cut its market capitalization from its $30 million peak to $7.5 million.
Hulk Hogan Wrestles MOTHER And Dumps His Fans
On Thursday, former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan took X to announce the launch of his Hulkmania (HULK) token. The memecoin skyrocketed 500% within two hours and quickly reached a market cap of $17 million.
The launch turned sour when investors found Hogan had sold his HULK bag and deleted his posts mentioning the token. In minutes, the token’s market cap plummeted to $2 million.

During the hours that Hogan’s X account promoted the token, the retired wrestler seemingly targeted Azalea and MOTHER. In an X post, Hogan replied to Azalea, saying, “You suck at pumping. $HULK has the real milk.”
Additionally, he shared two now-deleted Instagram posts beefing with the Australian rapper. In one of them, Hogan Azalea’s profile picture and captioned it, “Sahil does it best.”
Before deleting all his HULK-related posts, Hogan shared an Instagram story claiming that he had been hacked. According to the post, none of the publications came from him and soon would be removed. Later, his X account was wiped completely, and Instagram comments were limited.
The crypto community grew concerned as the mention of Arora’s name suggested his involvement in the scam. However, it remains unclear whether Hogan’s website, Instagram, and X account were all hacked or if the retired wrestler’s team was involved.
Vitalik Buterin Vs Koala Vitalik?
Earlier this week, Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, criticized the ongoing celebrity token phenomenon.  On X, Buterin stated he is “quite unhappy” with the crypto space’s celebrity experimentation.
Buterin explained his concern regarding the launch of tokens with no purpose other than being a get-rich-quick scheme. Additionally, he suggested some features that celebrity memecoins should have for him “to be more willing to respect it.” The list included a “public-good goal that it’s serving.”
To his criticism, Azalea responded by claiming that Buterin “was just hangry.” Moreover, she seemingly named a Koala after Ethereum’s founder. The rapper uploaded a video announcing the donations saved another Koala. Its name? Koala Vitalik.
Azalea launched a “MOTHER fund” to help save Koalas infected with chlamydia. For the past week, the rapper has received donations in memecoins and several cryptocurrencies for the Koala cause.

Additionally, Azalea is giving her token utility. The rapper launched a Mother merchandise store that accepts MOTHER as payment.  Ultimately, the token continued to soar after reaching new ATHs and recently breaking above the $200 million market cap.

The Sandbox raises US$20 mln, achieves unicorn status


The Sandbox, a metaverse and Web3 gaming firm, has successfully raised US$20 million from Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands, propelling the company’s valuation to the US$1 billion mark. 



The recent funding, which includes contributions from LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures, is set to enhance The Sandbox’s offerings, including new social features, avatar skills, and improvements to its Game Maker and VoxEdit 3D editing tools. 



Anticipation is building for the beta release of its multiplayer rules system later in 2024, with a full rollout expected in 2025. 



Since its Alpha launch in November 2023, The Sandbox has cultivated over 1,000 user-generated experiences and has amassed a user base of 5.7 million accounts connected to cryptocurrency wallets.



The Sandbox places a focus on digital property rights and user-generated content.



Despite the metaverse industry’s recent challenges, including skepticism and underwhelming user engagement as seen in Meta’s US$1.2 billion project, The Sandbox’s strategy is gaining traction with both creators and investors. 



The Sandbox claims to have attracted over 330,000 new users in the past year.

Bernstein Commented on One of the Most Important Cryptocurrency Events of Recent Days: What Will Be the Impact? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Robinhood's acquisition of Bitstamp, one of the oldest crypto exchanges, is a strategic move aimed at expanding its crypto business and positioning itself against rivals such as Coinbase and Kraken, according to a report by research firm Bernstein.
The report states that Robinhood, which offers 15 cryptocurrencies to individual investors in the US and more than 30 tokens in Europe, will benefit from Bitstamp's listing of more than 85 tokens. This acquisition allows Robinhood to offer markets for a significantly larger number of tokens.


However, it is not known how some altcoins, which are uncertain whether they are securities in the USA, will be treated by Robinhood.
“With a full exchange, Robinhood would gain access to global liquidity and thus be able to potentially improve its economics by offering liquidity to its brokerage platform,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.






Crypto exchanges offer a wide range of services such as staking, stablecoin, trading, custody and prime brokerage. Acquiring Bitstamp could allow Robinhood to offer a broader range of crypto products to a more institutional customer base.
Broker JMP also commented on the acquisition, saying it would “increase opportunities for Robinhood to expand its participation in the evolving crypto value chain.”

Bitcoin Fees Are Skyrocketing Again-And It's Not Because of Runes or Ordinals - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsHaving trouble sending a Bitcoin transaction? That’s because the blockchain is absolutely bloated at the moment—although for a different reason than some might expect.According to mempool.space, a medium-priority Bitcoin transaction currently costs $34.08 to get processed promptly. The rest must wait in line with a tsunami of more than 333,400 unconfirmed transactions.As with most Bitcoin fee spikes, Crypto Twitter reacted by bemoaning Bitcoin’s limited transaction throughput, pushing for the adoption of efficient layer 2s and sidechains. Others welcomed the surge as a windfall in revenue for Bitcoin miners, who are more than doubling their Bitcoin earned per block.The cause, however, is neither Ordinals nor Runes—Bitcoin tokenization protocols known for driving fees sky-high in the past.According to CryptoQuant, the culprit for Bitcoin’s congestion is OKX, the Seychelles-based crypto exchange that is currently the third largest in the world by trading volume.“A lot of activity from OKX exchange today, most of it is related to internal transactions to consolidate outputs,” wrote CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno to Twitter. “This has caused a spike in fees.”Individual Bitcoin transfers are stored in users’ wallets as unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). When that user wants to send their Bitcoin back out to another wallet, they must pay transaction fees on every individual UTXO sitting in their wallet, which can add up if making large transfers.This problem is especially concerning for exchanges, which frequently have small transactions coming in, and large ones going out. As such, exchanges “consolidate” their UTXOs by spending them all at once while network fees are relatively low, merging all of the inputs into much larger outputs in the same wallet.That said, one large exchange engaging in this behavior has the power to drive up fees across the whole network, making transactions burdensome for everyone else.Some crypto devs criticized OKX for choosing to brute force its consolidation this way, losing thousands of dollars in fees in the process.“It's really not that hard to have an engineer spend a few hours writing an alert for transaction fee changes greater than X standard deviations,” said Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin falls below US$70,000 after US jobs data and ECB rate cut


Bitcoin price fell below US$70,000 on Friday million as a result of a mixed U.S. jobs report and a rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB). 



The US Bureau of Labor Statistics disclosed a dual-edged economic scenario with an increase in job creation alongside a rise in unemployment rates to 4%, which led to a drop in Bitcoin’s value.



Job growth indicated strength but the uptick in unemployment and consistent weekly hours worked hinted at deeper economic issues. 



Despite a 0.4% rise in average hourly earnings in May and a 4.1% year-over-year increase, the pace of aggregate weekly payroll growth in the private sector decelerated compared to the previous year. 



Bitcoin traded at US$$69,159 at 4:30 p.m. ET, according to CoinGecko.



The ECB’s move to lower its benchmark lending rate from 4% to 3.75%, the first reduction in five years, is set to potentially boost liquidity and the appeal of alternative assets such as Bitcoin. 



This decision, along with the positive institutional inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which recorded over US$1.54 billion in net inflows this week, may affect Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory.

Semler Scientific's Bitcoin Bet: 828 BTC and Counting, $150M Raise for More


																California-based med-tech company Semler Scientific has announced purchasing an additional 247 BTC for an aggregate of $17 million in cash, inclusive of fees and expenses.
As of June 6, 2024, Semler holds a total of 828 bitcoins, which were acquired for an aggregate of $57 million, inclusive of fees and expenses.
Preps $150M Bitcoin Warchest
In a new filing, the Nasdaq-listed medical manufacturer also revealed looking to raise $150 million to buy more bitcoins in the future, a strategy that aligns with the expansion of its corporate structure.
While highlighting the gap in value between gold and BTC, Semler Scientific said it believes the latter has the potential to generate outsize returns as it gains increasing acceptance as “digital gold.”
The firm believes that bitcoin’s unique attributes discussed above differentiate it not only from fiat money but also from other cryptocurrency assets. For that reason, the company has no plans to purchase cryptocurrency assets other than bitcoin.




Commenting on the development, Doug Murphy-Chutorian, MD, Semler Scientific’s chief executive officer, said,
“Semler remains focused on our two strategies of expanding our healthcare business and acquiring and holding bitcoin. The company now holds 828 bitcoins, underscoring our view that bitcoin is a compelling investment and can serve as a reliable store of value. We will continue to pursue our strategy of purchasing bitcoins with cash.”
Semler Scientific Taps Bitcoin
Last month, Semler Scientific first decided to make bitcoin its primary asset for holding reserves and excess cash. The company recently initiated this new policy by purchasing 581 bitcoins for $40 million, including taxes and other expenses.
The company’s chairman, Eric Semler, cited BTC’s scarcity, finite supply, and potential to serve as an inflation hedge and safe haven amid global uncertainties as the key reasons behind this move. The company previously said it plans to continue its profitable healthcare operations but will allocate excess cash towards purchasing BTC, subject to market conditions and anticipated cash needs.
This strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy, a software firm that has been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin since August 2020. As of writing these lines, the NASDAQ-listed giant has more than 214,000 BTC, worth over $15 billion. The firm’s paper gains are close to $7.7 billion.

Trump vows to end Biden-Gensler crusade against crypto after taking office

Donald Trump promised to halt the anti-crypto policies of US President Joe Biden and SEC chair Gary Gensler within an hour of taking office if he is re-elected, Reuters said on June 7.Palantir adviser Jacob Helberg recounted Trump’s statements during a June 6 San Francisco fundraiser, referring to Trump’s target as the “Biden-Gensler crusade against crypto.”Trump also described himself as a “crypto president” at the event, according to tech executive and former Trump ambassador to Austria Trevor Traina.Republican National Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon said that Trump called crypto important and declared his support for the sector but did not outline a specific crypto policy.He also spoke about Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren’s campaign against crypto.Venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya hosted the Trump fundraiser, which raised $12 million. Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and unidentified Coinbase executives reportedly attended the event as well.Trump and cryptoTrump has long held a critical stance on crypto but recently began to warm to it. In February, he acknowledged the need for regulation but noted that people are embracing Bitcoin and using it in payments. He conceded that he can “live with it one way or the other.”In March, Trump said that he does not intend to stop people from using crypto.He began to express an even stronger pro-crypto stance at a May 8 Mar-a-Lago event, where he criticized the Biden administration’s policies and said that anyone in favor of crypto had “better vote” for him. Trump’s campaign began to accept crypto donations on May 21, fulfilling a promise from the event.The shift in Trump’s stance is reflected across the US political landscape as crypto becomes an increasingly important issue among voters. Recent surveys found that more than 20% of Americans have owned crypto and consider it a key issue.The Biden administration reportedly began to create a crypto outreach effort around the time of Trump’s crypto push. The SEC’s stance on spot Ethereum ETFs also began to shift last month, reversing previously expected denials and culminating in May 23 approvals.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

XRP ETFs Could Reach SEC’s Table Soon With Institutions Ready To Pour Billions Into Ripple's XRP Market ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Analyst Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered recently suggested that cryptocurrencies XRP and Solana (SOL) could be next in line for spot ETFs following the historic approval of 8 Ethereum ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Kendrick noted that the SEC’s new regulatory policy provides fresh hopes for other altcoins, previously subject to lawsuits like XRP, to obtain approval to launch their ETFs. “For other coins (e.g., SOL, XRP), markets will look ahead to their eventual ETF status as well, albeit this is likely a 2025 story, not a 2024 one,” Kendrick said.



Is an XRP ETF Approaching?



As Kendrick pointed out, the new SEC policy or interpretation opens the door to new cryptocurrency ETFs. However, currently, Ripple is embroiled in a multi-year lawsuit against the regulator.



In this new scenario, leading cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP could soon be the first potential candidates to have their tradable financial instruments in stock markets. Furthermore, both coins are firmly positioned in the crypto market, with market caps of $74.6 billion and $27.3 billion, respectively.



Although the possibility of XRP and Solana ETFs reignites interest in ETFs, according to Kendrick’s projections, this scenario still seems distant. Therefore, enthusiasts of these cryptocurrencies may need to exercise patience and wait until at least 2025 to invest in them through an ETF.

&nbsp



The new ETFs facilitate access to crypto assets like XRP and SOL for investors who prefer to avoid the complexity of acquiring and directly safeguarding them. By being purchasable through a simple stock transaction, ETFs provide investors and institutions with a quick and easy way to gain regulated exposure to cryptocurrencies backed by the highest regulatory authority in the United States.



Crypto Market Reacts to Ethereum ETF



The long-awaited approval of Ethereum spot ETFs by the SEC did not generate the bullish momentum many anticipated. Immediately after the historic announcement, the price of Ethereum dropped by over 5%, falling from nearly $3,937 to just under $3,686, according to CoinGecko.



This initial negative reaction mirrored the recurring pattern in financial markets of “buying the rumor and selling the news.” In January, Bitcoin exhibited a similar behavior following the historic approval of Bitcoin ETFs, dropping for almost two weeks before starting the rally that led it to seek its all-time high of nearly $74,000.



However, as Kendrick highlighted, reiterating his previous projection, the approval of the Ethereum ETF bodes well for Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by the end of 2024.

XRP Supply In Profit At 79%, Here's How DOGE, BTC Compare


								Santiment has revealed how major cryptocurrencies like XRP, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin currently compare regarding supply profitability.
XRP, Dogecoin, And Other Assets Compared On Basis Of Profitability
In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment discusses how the various top coins in the cryptocurrency sector currently stand in terms of Supply in Profit.
The “Supply in Profit” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total percentage of any given asset’s supply in circulation that’s currently carrying some amount of net unrealized profit.
Unlike the version of this metric from some other analytics firms, where a coin is decided to be in profit or loss by comparing the spot price against the last price at which the coin transferred on the blockchain, Santiment’s indicator instead uses the price at which the token was initially mined as its “cost basis.”

With this methodology, all asset tokens mined at a higher price than the current one would stand in loss, while those mined at lower prices would be considered in profit.
Naturally, the Supply in Profit sums up all coins satisfying the latter condition and calculates what percentage of the total circulating supply they make up for.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply and Profit for some of the largest coins in the sector over the past few months:

Looks like Bitcoin is at the top of this list at the moment | Source: Santiment on X
As displayed in the above graph, the worst top coin in terms of Supply in Profit out of the coins in the list is Cardano (ADA), which has just 53.5% of its tokens in the green.
XRP (XRP) is the second worst at 78.84%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is just above with 82.16% of the supply above water. In terms of the best performing assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) stand out, with the indicator at 98.3% and 95.1%, respectively.
This means that these two coins, the largest in the sector based on market cap, have nearly all of their supply mined below their current spot price.
Under the X post, a user asked Santiment about the situation with Polygon (MATIC). The analytics firm replied with a chart for the asset, showcasing that 35% of its supply is in profit based on this metric.

The value of the indicator appears to be quite low for MATIC right now | Source: Santiment on X
This means that Polygon is worse in this metric than the likes of Cardano, XRP, and Dogecoin. Santiment explains, though, that the trend “likely has something to do with MATIC being introduced amid the 2019 bear market. So with this particular metric, it started out with quite a bit of a handicap.”

Now, what significance does the Supply in Profit hold for any cryptocurrency? Usually, the higher the supply in profit for any asset, the more likely it is for a selloff to occur.
Thus, it’s possible that coins with extreme profitability could be near at least a local top. Assets with a relatively lower value of the metric, like XRP or Dogecoin, on the other hand, may have more room to grow before profit-taking becomes a significant threat.
XRP Price
At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $0.52, up 1% over the past week.

Is BRETT The New Meme Coin King? Token Surges 300% And Nears $2 Billion Market Cap


																As the overall sentiment in the crypto market veers towards bullishness, leading cryptos have regained their previously lost levels and ignited further interest in meme coins. Brett (BRETT) has emerged as the standout performer, experiencing a 400% gain in the past 30 days alone. 
Having launched just three months ago, BRETT now boasts a market cap of $1.7 billion, positioning itself as the top gainer in the top 100 spot of the market.
The Largest Meme Coin On The Base Network
BRETT is a meme coin built on the Base network, with its mascot inspired by a character in Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comic. Since its launch in February 2024, BRETT has become the largest meme coin on the Base network in terms of market cap, earning the title of “PEPE’s best friend on BASE.”
Notably, BRETT stands out due to its renounced contract and absence of a minting function, which places the token’s trajectory fully in the hands of its community. The creator of BRETT cannot generate additional tokens or manipulate the contract, relying instead on the vibrant and dedicated community to drive its development.

	Related Reading


With a fixed total supply of 10 billion tokens, BRETT’s scarcity and potential future value are influenced by the limited creation of new tokens. The coin follows a fair launch model, ensuring equal opportunities for all participants. 
BRETT does not impose transaction taxes, which can incentivize trading activity but may impact long-term value.
Regarding distribution, 85% of the tokens are allocated to the Liquidity Provider (locked), 10% to the Treasury, and 5% to the Centralized exchange wallet.
BRETT Surges 21,000% From All-Time Low
As of now, BRETT is trading at $0.1794. It maintains its position as the top meme coin on the BASE network while also being the market’s best performer, experiencing a 33% surge in the last 24 hours. 
CoinGecko data reveals a staggering 21,000% increase from its all-time low, highlighting the immense surge in interest the token has garnered in recent months.
Furthermore, BRETT’s trading volume has increased significantly, rising by 62% in the past few days to reach $219 million. Notably, BRETT is the first meme coin on the Base network to surpass a $1 billion market cap.

	Related Reading


While BRETT’s current uptrend is notable, it remains to be seen whether the token can sustain its momentum and climb to higher positions in the market. If so, it could potentially surpass other meme coins like Bonk Inu (BONK) in terms of market cap, with the difference between the two being a mere $200 million.
At its all-time high (ATH), BRETT reached $0.1887, which might serve as a near-term resistance level for the token, as it has struggled to surpass this mark in the past two days.

Andrew Tate Meme Coins Take Over Solana


																It’s meme coin season, alright!
There are no two ways around it: meme coins are undoubtedly the main narrative on Solana, and it seems it’s just a matter of time before another celebrity jumps on board.
After Iggy Azalea, it’s now Andrew Tate who has put the Solana community on its toes. Tate-inspired meme coins are now the top trending cryptocurrencies on DEXScreener, amassing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of capital in less than a couple of hours.
It’s challenging to follow the precise timeline, but Tate has confirmed that he is, indeed, “creating chaos” in the crypto market and is attempting to “crash Solana.”
“There’s a lot of people asking me about all of this chaos I’ve created in the crypto markets as I’m trying to crash Solana. Millions of tweets have been made today because of me and my stupid tweets, I’ve made a complete mess. I’m sure some people made millions of dollars of the back of me…”
Indeed, the official timeline of Tate’s X account is flooded with crypto-related tweets, some even claiming that he has burned over $30 million worth of some meme coin.




As a quick reminder, meme coins carry a substantial risk of capital loss, they are inherently volatile and most of them lack any particular utility.

Bitcoin (BTC) Transaction Fees Suddenly Reached Incredible Heights: Here's Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


OKX is reportedly transferring thousands of Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) to their hot wallet. This activity occurs at a cost of more than 10 times the average wage observed in the last 24 hours.
The Bitcoin network is currently experiencing significant congestion, with a staggering number of transactions awaiting confirmation in the mempool. As a result, users are forced to pay over 500 satoshis per byte to execute a transaction immediately, or about $50-100 for an ordinary transfer.



This high fee rate means that a significant portion of the Bitcoin that OKX is trying to consolidate is paid to miners. For example, in one transaction, a fee as high as $15,000 was paid to combine UTXOs with a total value of only $48,000, which is more than 30% of the total value.
Currently the Bitcoin network is plagued with more than 330,000 unconfirmed transactions and memory usage has increased to 1.35 GB. Under these circumstances, OKX is suspected of sorting and harvesting user wallets, a move that has caught the attention of many in the cryptocurrency community.

Shiba Inu burn rate soars 3900% - SHIB reacts by... - AMBCrypto



A significant amount of SHIB tokens get burned as whales accumulate the token.
Price remained relatively the same while network growth declined.

Over the past few months, many new memecoins have entered the fold and have gained significant traction in terms of popularity. Despite new tokens gaining a large chunk of the market share, Shiba Inu[SHIB] continued to see growth.
One of the reasons for the same would be Shiba Inu’s burn rate.
SHIB BURNS
The recent surge in Shiba Inu’s burn rate has caused a stir in the cryptocurrency community. This burning process removes SHIB tokens from circulation, potentially leading to a decrease in overall supply.
Notably, the burn rate rose by a staggering 3900% within a 24-hour period, with a significant contribution of 4.03 million burned tokens coming from a single wallet address.
This community effort, alongside smaller burns from other members, has significantly reduced the circulating supply of SHIB.
Further fueling the optimism, whales and major SHIB holders, have been actively buying tokens.
Collectively, nine whale wallets invested a substantial $35.2 million, acquiring a massive 1.356 trillion SHIB tokens. This significant investment by whales indicates their belief in SHIB’s potential for future growth.
The combination of a reduced supply through burning and increased whale buying has ignited hope for a potential SHIB price rally among investors and traders.

How is SHIB doing?
In terms of price, SHIB was trading at $0.0000253. Over the last 24 hours, the price of SHIB had declined by 1.60%.
The price moved sideways for the most part despite growing whale accumulation.
Over the past three months, the SHIB price has shown multiple lower lows and lower highs indicative of a bearish trend. SHIB’s recent sideways movement did not allude to a possible reversal in the future.
In terms of network growth, there was a decline observed. This implied that new addresses were losing interest in SHIB.
If this trend continues and new users fail to be attracted to SHIB, it could further cause problems for the SHIB token and result in a decline in price.

The velocity around the SHIB token also fell significantly. A declining velocity indicated that the frequency of tokens being traded has also fallen materially over the last few days.

Vietnamese Investors Rush to Buy Discounted Gold Bullion Amidst Price Disparity | Cryptoglobe


                                
Vietnamese investors have formed long lines outside state-owned banks in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, according to local reports, in a bid to purchase gold bullion at prices lower than those prevailing in the domestic market.



This surge in demand for gold stems from a recent move by the Central Bank of Vietnam aiming to bring domestic gold prices in line with global benchmarks, with the bank now selling gold directly to state-owned institutions, including Saigon Jewelry Company (SJC), Agribank, Vietcombank, BIDV, and Vietinbank, for resale to the public, as Bitcoin.com first reported, for it to be sold to the general public.



The move comes after domestic gold prices skyrocketed to record highs, reaching $3,620 per tael (37.5 grams) last month. The new program allows participating banks to offer gold bullion at a 1.2% discount compared to current market prices, currently sitting at $3,107 per tael.



While the country’s central bank is investigating the source of the price disparity, some experts suggest it could be linked to a weakening Vietnamese dong. Investors, seeking a safe haven for their assets, are turning to gold, a historical store of value known for its relative price stability in a trend mirroring the global rise in gold price this year fueled by growing geopolitical tensions.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

As CryptoGlobe reported China has also been accumulating the precious metal, with the Chinese private sector’s gold imports accounted for 543 tons in the first quarter of the year, a figure that was built upon by the country’s central bank, which added 189 tons to its reserves over the same period.



Private gold demand in the country represents a 74% increase from the last quarter of 2023, while the People’s Bank of China’s accumulation rose 38% from the preceding quarter.



Both of these factors helped the price of the precious metal hit a new all-time high and surpass the $2,450 mark for the first time in history. It then enduring a slight correction to now trade at $2,330.

New Qwen2 AI Model from Alibaba to Challenge Meta, OpenAI - Decrypt

Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, is a major player in China's AI sphere. Today, it announced the release of its latest AI model, Qwen2—and by some measures, it’s the best open-source option of the moment.Developed by Alibaba Cloud, Qwen2 is the next generation of the firm’s Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) model series, which includes the Tongyi Qianwen LLM (also known as just Qwen), the vision AI model Qwen-VL, and Qwen-Audio.The Qwen model family is pre-trained on multilingual data covering various industries and domains, with Qwen-72B the most powerful model in the series. It’s trained on an impressive 3 trillion tokens of data. By comparison, Meta’s most powerful Llama-2 variant is based on 2 trillion tokens. Llama-3, however, is in the process of digesting 15 trillion tokens.According to a recent blog post by the Qwen team, Qwen2 can handle 128K tokens of context—comparable to GPT-4o from OpenAI. Qwen2 has meanwhile outperformed Meta's LLama3 in basically all the most important synthetic benchmarks, the team asserts, making it the best open-source model currently available.However, it's worth noting that the independent Elo Arena ranks Qwen2-72B-Instruct a little better than GPT-4-0314 but below Llama3 70B and GPT-4-0125-preview, making it the second most favored open-source LLM among human testers to date.Qwen2 performs better than Llama3, Mixtral and Qwen1.5 in synthetic benchmarks. Image: Alibaba CloudQwen2 is available in five different sizes, ranging from 0.5 billion to 72 billion parameters, and the release delivers significant improvements in different areas of expertise. Also, the models were trained with data in 27 more languages than the previous release, including German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian, in addition to English and Chinese."Compared with the state-of-the-art open source language models, including the previous released Qwen1.5, Qwen2 has generally surpassed most open source models and demonstrated competitiveness against proprietary models across a series of benchmarks targeting for language understanding, language generation, multilingual capability, coding, mathematics, and reasoning," the Qwen team claimed on the model’s official page on HuggingFace.The Qwen2 models also show an impressive understanding of long contexts. Qwen2-72B-Instruct can handle information extraction tasks anywhere within its huge context without errors, and it passed the “Needle in a Haystack” test almost perfectly. This is important, because traditionally, model performance begins to degrade the more we interact with it.Qwen2 performs remarkably in the "Needle in a Haystack" test. Image: Alibaba CloudWith this release, the Qwen team has also changed the licenses for its models. While Qwen2-72B and its instruction-tuned models continue to use the original Qianwen license, all other models have adopted Apache 2.0, a standard in the open-source software world.“In the near future, we will continue opensource new models to accelerate open-source AI,” Alibaba Cloud said in an official blog post.Decrypt tested the model and found it to be quite capable at understanding tasks in multiple languages. The model is also censored, notably in themes that are considered sensitive in China. This seems consistent with Alibaba’s claims of Qwen2 being the least likely model to provide unsafe results—be it illegal activity, fraud, pornography, and privacy violence— no matter which language in which it was prompted.Qwen2's reply to: "Is Taiwan a Country?"ChatGPT's reply to: "Is Taiwan a Country?"Also, it has a good understanding of system prompts, which means the conditions applied will have a stronger impact on its answers. For example, when told to act as a helpful assistant with knowledge of the law versus acting as a knowledgeable lawyer who always responds based on the law, the replies to showed major variations. It provided advice similar to advice provided by GPT-4o, but was more concise.Qwen2's reply to: "A neighbord insulted me"ChatGPT's reply to: "A neighbord insulted me"The next model upgrade will bring multimodality to the Qwen2 LLM, possibly merging all the family into one powerful model, the team said. "Additionally, we extend the Qwen2 language models to multimodal, capable of understanding both vision and audio information," they added.Qwen is available for online testing via HuggingFace Spaces. Those with enough computing to run it locally can download the weights for free, also via HuggingFace.The Qwen2 model can be a great alternative for those willing to bet on open-source AI. It has a larger token context window than most other models, making it even more capable than Meta’s LLama 3. Also, due to its license, fine-tuned versions shared by others may improve upon it, further increasing its score and overcoming bias.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Bitcoin: Record high BTC accumulation by whales, will prices follow? - AMBCrypto



Whales accumulated significant amounts of BTC over the last few days.
Retail interest was high, open interest also surged.

Whales accumulated a large amount Bitcoin [BTC] over the last few weeks. Data suggested a renewed surge in Bitcoin buying by whales, reaching a two-month high.
Their Bitcoin holdings have also hit a record peak. This renewed buying spree signifies that large investors perceive current prices, which are already extremely high, as an attractive entry point for accumulating Bitcoin.
While past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, whales’ historical influence on the market suggests their buying activity could be a bullish indicator for Bitcoin.

Retail investors also showed interest in BTC. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the cohort of addresses ranging from 0.1 to 10 had showed interest in BTC.

Interest in BTC ETFs was also growing
Despite a surge in interest for Bitcoin ETFs, with a record 19-day streak of inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, there wasn’t a budge in BTC’s prices.
While holdings in spot Bitcoin ETFs globally have reached a significant level, with around 1.3 million Bitcoin or 5.2% of circulating supply as of 6th June, and a large portion concentrated in US-listed ETFs, the price hasn’t reacted as dramatically as some might expect.
Data from Farside showed inflows on June 6th alone reached $217.7 million. Total inflows since launch have surpassed $15.5 billion, but some traders believe this amount is still insufficient to significantly move the price needle until other markets open up.

Open Interest surges
Apart from that, the Open Interest(OI) in BTC also grew.
Historically, high OI was marked by excessive leverage and speculation often precedes a price correction. However, this didn’t seem to be the case at the time of writing.
While funding rates which reflect the willingness of long and short positions to pay each other remained slightly positive, they were significantly lower compared to the highs seen in March.

This indicated that bullish long positions were dominant and bulls were willing to pay bears to maintain their short positions. However, the market was not as heated compared to March.
At press time, BTC was trading at $71,138.10 and in the last 24 hours, it had grown by 1.09%.

Is Ethereum (ETH) Going to Lose $4,000? Solana at $170: Was It Fakeout? XRP Remains Stable

Ethereum is kind of losing it. It is likely that you have already seen the recent price action near the $4,000 mark. Unfortunately, Ether has failed to move past this mark or even reach it and gain a foothold there.Ethereum has been trading in a narrowing range. Usually, this pattern indicates a phase of consolidation preceding a possible breakout. Here, the important levels to keep an eye on are roughly $3,900 on the upper side and $3,626 on the lower side.Ethereum/USD Chart by TradingViewIt has been tested a few times recently, and the immediate support is currently at $3,626. Conversely, any bullish continuation would require a strong breach of the resistance leveled at $3,900.Another important factor is volume. A lack of strong buying pressure may be the reason for the lower trading volumes we have seen recently. Since ETH is neither overbought nor oversold and has room to move in either direction, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is circling 65.88.A further drop toward the 50-day moving average, which is currently at $3,298, may occur if Ethereum breaches the $3,626 support level. But ETH might return to the $4,000 region and higher if it breaks above the $3,900 barrier.Solana pushes to new heightsSolana has indeed climbed toward the $170 threshold and might be actively conquering it in the foreseeable future. Solana has been moving within a narrow range on the daily chart. The green line indicates the $165.84 support area, where the price appears to be holding steady after reversing below $170. The blue line at $156.52 and the orange line at $151.66 are important support levels to keep an eye on. Historically, these levels have provided a lot of support.The levels of immediate support are $156.52 and $165.84. Should these levels hold, SOL may try to make another push for $170.The important resistance level is still $170. If SOL breaks above this, it might rise higher.If Solana is able to sustain support above $165.84, another attempt to break $170 may occur. Nevertheless, a decline toward $150 or less may be indicated if it closes below $156.52, which would signal a bearish trend.Long-awaited XRP stabilityLately, XRP has been remarkably stable, consistently trading at or near $0.52. Let’s examine the chart to see what is causing this stability and what to look out for going forward.XRP has been in a consolidation phase on the daily chart. The $0.50 support level, indicated by the green line, has been maintained by the market. Approximately $0.55 (orange line) and $0.57 (black line) are the resistance levels to be aware of.Approximately $0.50 is the closest support. Strong buying interest is indicated if XRP remains above this level. The $0.55 and $0.57 levels are important resistance points. If these levels are broken, a bullish trend might be indicated.Moving averages offer more information. Acting as support, the 50-day moving average is situated below the current price. The 200-day (black line) and 100-day (orange line) moving averages are both above the current price level, offering solid resistance levels for the future.As always, volume is important. Consistent trading volumes in recent times indicate steady interest. With XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 51.89, it is clear that the asset is neither overbought nor over sold, which does not offer much insight but shows that things are relatively steady.The $0.55 resistance level may be broken by XRP if it maintains its hold above the $0.50 support level. If the break is successful, XRP may move up to $0.57 and higher. But if it drops below $0.50, that could indicate a bearish trend.

Cryptocurrency Insider Turns $1,200 into $1 Million in Three Hours with Little-Known Token | Cryptoglobe


                                
An unidentified insider trader has managed to turn just $1,200 into nearly $1 million in just three hours trading a newly launched cryptocurrency through four new wallets after acquiring 19% of that cryptocurrency’s total supply.



According to on-chain data analysis service Lookonchain, the insider used 7.1 SOL, then worth $1,200, to buy 190.2 million Hulkmania ($HULK) tokens, 19% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply, with various wallets.



The trader when sold all of their tokens after the price of the little-known cryptocurrency surged, to get back 5,760 SOL tokens worth around $980,000. The insider’s abrupt sell-off led to a massive price drop of more than 85%.

The trade, which appears to be a result of market manipulation, yielded a staggering return of over 81,000% in just three hours, with the cryptocurrency also plunging after Hulk Hogan himself revealed on Instagram that his accounts had been compromised and asking fans to disregard cryptocurrency-related posts.



 Astute traders and insiders have managed to capitalize on the meteoric rise of Solana (SOL)-based memecoins, realizing astronomical gains in the process, with data showing, for example, one trader purchased a substantial amount of Dogwifhat (WIF) in December 2023 and has since seen a staggering 118,967% return on their investment.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Another trader has also found success with MAGA (TRUMP), a memecoin inspired by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who is currently campaigning for the presidency once more, while another made millions worth Jeo Boden (BODEN).



Shortly after former U.S. President Donald J. Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records involving reimbursements to his former lawyer Michael Cohen for hush money payments, several Trump-inspired meme-inspired cryptocurrencies were launched, with one trader making over $160,000 in just 5 hours from them.



These success stories highlight the potential for significant gains in the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading, particularly when it comes to memecoins built on the Solana blockchain.



However, it is crucial to remember that such astronomical returns are not the norm and that investing in memecoins carries a high level of risk. As with any investment, it is essential to conduct thorough research, exercise caution, and never invest more than one can afford to lose.

Wells Fargo Employee Sells Customers’ Personal Information, Triggering $688,000 in Fraudulent Transactions: US Banking Regulator - The Daily Hodl


								A US regulator is banning a former Wells Fargo employee from the banking industry after she allegedly sold private customer information and triggered more than half a million dollars in fraudulent transactions.
New filings from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) detail a consent order with ex-Wells Fargo employee Bathia Greene, an associate operations processor at the bank’s lockbox facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.










The OCC says Greene misappropriated confidential details of Wells Fargo’s customers and sold the information, leading to a wave of fraudulent transactions.
Wells Fargo lost $688,000 as a result of Greene’s actions, according to the OCC.
Says the regulator,
“At all relevant times, Respondent was an Associate Operations Processor at the Bank’s lockbox facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the period from approximately October 2021 to January 2022, Respondent misappropriated confidential information of Bank customers and sold the information to a third party, resulting in fraudulent transactions. 
The Bank suffered a loss of approximately $688,000. By reason of the foregoing conduct, Respondent engaged in violations of law or regulation and unsafe or unsound practices. 
Respondent’s misconduct resulted in financial gain to Respondent and loss or risk of loss to the Bank and demonstrated personal dishonesty and willful or continuing disregard for the safety and soundness of the Bank.”
According to the settlement, Greene does not appear to be facing criminal prosecution.
The agreement bans Greene from participating in the activities of any insured US banks, credit unions, federal banking agencies, Farm Credit institutions, Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Crypto Revolution: Asia Poised To Ignite The Next Mega Bull Run, Analyst Forescasts | Bitcoinist.com


								In decentralized finance (DeFi), Asia, particularly China and its neighboring countries, is poised to become the catalyst for the next major crypto bull run, according to the analyst and DeFi researcher “DeFi Ignas.” 
In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), the researcher highlighted various factors contributing to this outlook, shedding light on the emerging trends across the Asian continent.
Asian Crypto Landscape
The researcher notes that South Korea, known for its active retail investor base, has seen a surge in crypto trading, with altcoins dominating around 80% of exchange volume. 
Notably, the country’s crypto culture is significantly different, with a preference for alternative coins and the emergence of crypto-based e-sports and play-to-earn games. 

Moving to the Philippines, Web3 games like Axie Infinity continue to be popular, with players forming guilds to earn non-fungible tokens (NFTs). While crypto transactions are not considered legal tender, the country’s central bank is piloting a digital currency. DeFi Ignas positions the Philippines as a hub for adopting blockchain gaming.
In Hong Kong, retail traders rely heavily on high leverage and are influenced by social media trends. New regulations aim to control crypto exchanges and protect consumers. 
In addition, the listing of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) aims to establish Hong Kong as a regulated hub for digital assets.
Next, Australia shows a strong preference for Ethereum over Bitcoin among investors. The researcher notes that the average Australian crypto wallet contains approximately 59.4% ETH, driven by its use in alternative coins and anticipation of ETFs. 
As Bitcoinist reported, Australia entered the crypto investment landscape on Tuesday with the launch of its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Furthermore, the country’s regulatory environment supports crypto trading and encourages innovation in the industry.
Bitcoin ETF Frenzy In Asia
DeFi Ignas further notes that Japan’s government is actively promoting Web3 technologies and easing crypto regulations to stimulate economic growth. While certain restrictions on mutual funds holding crypto persist, financial institutions gradually embrace digital asset-related activities.
Despite its restrictive tax regime, India has witnessed a growing interest in US Bitcoin ETFs through the “Liberalised Remittance Scheme.” Moreover, the government is actively promoting the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and cracking down on offshore exchanges.
Singapore is primarily an institutional market that imposes restrictions on retail virtual asset trading. The country leverages blockchain for institutional applications such as tokenization and cross-border remittances. Project Guardian, a central bank initiative, plays a critical role in shaping Singapore’s landscape.

In Taiwan, Bitcoin ETFs have become a hot topic, although local brokerages currently face restrictions in accepting orders. Regulatory discussions are underway to potentially reopen services for Bitcoin ETFs, indicating Taiwan’s growing interest in embracing digital investment opportunities.
Lastly, Thailand’s market experienced the impact of the 2022 price plunge and a local exchange collapse. However, DeFi Ignas suggests that the new government actively promotes the country as a digital asset trading hub by waiving certain taxes. 
Asia has increasingly emerged as a hotspot for Web3 adoption and innovation, with notable trends and developments across different countries. Monitoring these advancements provides valuable insights and potential opportunities that may soon influence the Western digital asset landscape.

Miners continue reporting declines in Bitcoin production following halving

Stronghold Digital Mining reported a 47.1% decline in its monthly Bitcoin mining output in May.The firm mined 82 BTC during the first full month following the halving, compared to 155 BTC in April.Meanwhile, revenues for the month came in at $5.2 million, a 46% drop from the previous month.Stronghold explicitly attributed the drop to the halving. The firm said:“The primary driver of the decline was due to the first full month of post-halving operations.”The company also reported an average hash price of $0.052 per TH/s in May, down from 0.095 in April. It attributed the change to the halving and reduced block rewards, a 0.8% decline in Bitcoin’s price, and transaction fees falling to 7.4% in May from 25.3% in April.It observed a network hash rate of 1.2%, partially offsetting the trend.Decline in production across the boardSimilarly, Cipher Mining reported that it mined 166 BTC in May versus 296 BTC in April, representing a 43.9% month-over-month drop.The company acknowledged the impact of Bitcoin’s halving but emphasized that it maintained positive cash flows and expanded its inventory and operation sites.Marathon Digital fared a little better, reporting that it produced 616 BTC in May, down 27.5% from 850 BTC in April. The company said it mitigated the reduction by increasing the number of mining blocks it won in May to 170 — up from 129 blocks in April.Marathon said it held 17,857 BTC at the end of May and sold 390 BTC over May. It reported an energized hash rate of 29.3 EH/s and an installed hash rate of 30.6 EH/s.SCleanspark, Riot Platforms, and Bitfarms also reported similar declines in their BTC output fellThe Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024, reducing block rewards from 6.250 to 3.125.

Binance Coin price hits ATH of $720: What's next for BNB? - AMBCrypto



BNB rose to an all-time high on 6th June.
It may trade above $750 if buying pressure is sustained. 

Binance Coin [BNB] climbed to an all-time high of $720 during trading session on 6th June before witnessing a minor correction. 
Data from CoinMarketCap showed that at press time, the altcoin had exchanged hands at $706, having declined by 2% from its all-time high. 
Demand for BNB surges
Prior to 3rd June, BNB had trended within a horizontal channel. This channel is formed when an asset’s price consolidates within a range for an extended period. The upper line of this channel forms resistance, while the lower line forms support. 
As for BNB, the bears created resistance at $632, while the bulls defended the coin’s price at $518, which formed long-term support. 
Due to the surge in buying activity in the last month, BNB rallied above the upper line of this horizontal channel on 4th June to close at $686.
 The bulls have since maintained the uptrend as buying momentum has outweighed selling activity in the BNB market in the past few days.
This was gleaned from readings from the coin’s momentum indicators. For example, BNB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were 77.82 and 75.91 at the time of writing. 
At these values, these indicators suggested that buying activity outpaced profit-taking activity among BNB traders.
Confirming the surge in the coin’s demand, its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) rested above the zero line at 0.20.
This indicator measures the momentum of money flow into and out of an asset’s market. A positive CMF value is a sign of market strength. This means that liquidity is being supplied as coin accumulation trumps distribution. 
 
Further, signaling that the bulls dominate the bears, BNB’s Elder-Ray Index was 115.7. Since the coin broke above resistance on 4th June, the indicator has returned only positive values. 
This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market. When its value is positive, bull power is dominant in the market.

Ethereum Staking Could Be A Reality In Hong Kong's ETFs Soon, Expert Reveals


								According to insights from industry leaders, Hong Kong is poised to make significant advancements in the cryptocurrency sector by potentially introducing staking options for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) within the year.
Ethereum Staking Innovations In Hong Kong: A New Era For Crypto ETFs?
Animoca Brands’ Chairman Yat Siu recently hinted that Hong Kong could introduce staking features for spot Ethereum ETFs as early as this year.

This announcement aligns with broader trends within the global crypto finance sector, focusing on enhancing the “attractiveness and functionality” of crypto-based financial products.
As the world increasingly embraces blockchain technology, Hong Kong appears poised to take a leadership role in integrating staking into traditional investment vehicles like ETFs, potentially ahead of other major markets, including the United States.
The significance of this move cannot be understated, as it marks a potential shift in how crypto assets are managed within the framework of regulated financial products.
Staking allows token holders to earn rewards for participating in the network’s consensus mechanisms, enhancing the underlying blockchain’s security and efficiency.
This feature could translate into an attractive value proposition for ETFs, drawing both institutional and retail investors seeking to combine the benefits of conventional investment structures with the innovative aspects of crypto-economic models.

The Path To Regulatory Approval and Market Implications
The prospect of incorporating staking into Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong has spurred various key industry players into action.
HashKey, a co-manager of a spot Ethereum ETF in the region, has already begun drafting a proposal to explore the implications and benefits of staking, aiming to present a compliant and risk-averse strategy to regulators. Livio Weng, chief executive officer of HashKey Exchange, noted:
We hope to advance some explorations in this area [of ether staking] in a compliant and controlled manner without increasing risks.
Moreover, discussions with blockchain infrastructure provider Blockdaemon and other market participants reveal a consensus on the potential approval of staking features within the year.  Glenn Woo, head of sales for APAC at Blockdaemon, stated:
Based on my discussion this week and last week with the participants, the issuers, the VATPS [and] the custodians, we all kind of have the positive outlook in terms of getting that [ether staking] approved as well
Adding staking to Ethereum spot ETFs could significantly differentiate Hong Kong’s crypto offerings from those in the US, where regulatory hurdles limit such innovations.

This differentiation could boost the local market’s competitiveness and attract a global audience looking for more dynamic crypto investment options.
Speaking on this, Woo added:
That could be a competitive edge because if you are able to get staking, then there is a benefit for that […] I think of this as baby steps — the first steps. Now, the industry has to push on other areas to open it up. I think staking could be the big, big differentiator for Hong Kong.

Bitcoin, Ethereum lead May's NFT scene amidst sales dip - How? - AMBCrypto



During the last seven days, BTC’s NFT sales volume declined by 4%.
Weekly price charts of both coins remained green.

Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH], two of the largest blockchains, continued to dominate the NFT market in May. 
Although at first glance this looked optimistic, closer inspection revealed that both ETH and BTC’s NFT sales volume actually dropped in the last 30 days. 
Bitcoin, Ethereum NFTs in May
Coin98 Analytics posted a tweet revealing how several blockchains did in May. As per the tweet, BTC and ETH topped the list of blockchains in terms of total sales volume in May. 
While BTC’s sales volume touched $157 million, ETH’s stood at $147 million. 
Solana [SOL] made it to the top three on the same list. It was interesting to note that Blast was the only layer-2 blockchain that earned a spot on the list, as its sales volume reached $36 million. 
As per DappRadar’s data, Node Monkes, Bitcoin Puppets, and Runestine were the top three NFT collections of Bitcoin last month. 
Similarly, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Pudgy Penguins were the top three Ethereum NFT collections. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of CRYPTOSLAM’s data revealed that though ETH and BTC topped the list, their sales volume actually declined in May. 
To be precise, BTC’s NFT sales volume dropped by 71%, and ETH’s numbers dropped by over 56%. 
June is looking better
Though NFT sales volumes dropped last month, the past week saw signs of recovery. BTC’s number of NFT buyers and sellers increased by more than 20%. However, its sales volume still dropped by 4%.

Ethereum’s state in terms of sales volume was better than that of BTC’s, as the number surged by more than 4%. 
Apart from that, ETH’s number of sellers and buyers also increased by more than 10% in the last seven days.

BTC and ETH remain bullish
While all this happened, CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that the weekly charts of the top two coins remained green. 
Bitcoin and Ethereum’s prices surged by 4.2% and 2.2%, respectively, last week. At press time, BTC was trading at $71,091, while ETH had a value of $3,815. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s social volumes remained high throughout the last week.

Thanks to the price uptick, ETH’s weighted sentiment entered the positive zone. 
However, it was surprising to see that, despite a rise in value, BTC’s weighted sentiment was in the negative zone. This meant that bearish sentiment around the king of cryptos was dominant in the market.

NFT Scam: NY Court Charges Suspects Linked To $3M Rug pull


								The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the indictment of three UK nationals for the $3 million ‘Evolved Apes’ NFT (non-fungible tokens) scam. The suspects face charges of wire fraud and money laundering.

‘Evolved Apes’ $3 Million NFT Rug Pull
On Thursday, Damian Williams, Attorney for the Southern District of NY, and James Smith, Assistant Director of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), revealed the charges against three individuals seemingly linked to the Evolved Apes rug pull.
As reported by Bitcoinist, in 2021 the anonymous developer of the ‘Evolved Apes’ NFT project, Evil Ape, vanished with the project’s funds. The project was described as “a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs trapped inside a lawless land.”

'Evolved Apes' Collection screengrab from OpenSea. Source: Vice.com
In a week, ‘Evolved Apes’ raised around $2.9 million in Ether (ETH) after promising to develop a fighting game for its community. However, those promises soon vanished when the team drained the project’s wallet, taking all 798 ETH, and deleting the project’s X account and official website.
According to a Vice report, investors noticed several red flags leading up to the rug pull. Investors told the news media outlet that, after the public sale of the NFTs, the announcements were “unprofessional,” and the team disengaged with the project. Despite the concerns, they believed the ‘Evolved Apes’ NFT was inexperienced.
Suspects Face Fraud And Money Laundering Charges
Three years later, the identity of the suspected developers has been revealed. A NY court indicted UK nationals Mohamed-Amin Atcha, Mohamed Rolaz Waleedh, and Daood Hassan for laundering “misappropriated funds through multiple cryptocurrency transactions” to “conceal their ill-gotten gains.”
The suspects were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. If guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison for each charge.
The US Attorney Williams explained that those scamming investors, no matter the medium or industry, should be held accountable for their fraudulent actions. He stated:

Digital art may be new, but old rules still apply: making false promises for money is illegal.  As we allege, thousands of people believed these false promises and were tricked into buying these NFTs, including here in the Southern District of New York.  NFT fraud is no game, and those responsible will be held accountable.

Similarly, FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith stated that the FBI is committed to tracking scammers:

 Ghosting customers without fulfilling a promise not only reflects poor business integrity, it also violates the implicit trust buyers place in sellers when purchasing a product, no matter if that product is in a store or stored on a blockchain.  The FBI remains committed to pursuing those who perpetrate fraudulent schemes out of a selfish desire for a quick profit.

It’s worth noting that since 2021, the NFT marketplace has seen a significant decline from its glorious days during the last cycle. A recent report revealed that the once-buzzing NFT market is now full of collections with zero value.
NFT investors’ and collectors’ interest has drastically declined in the last two years, and 95% of NFTs have become worthless. Consequentially, 75% of the digital artwork and collectibles that once could be sold for up to $91.8 million are valued below $100 in 2024.

Cardano, XRP struggle for profits: Here's an in-depth look - AMBCrypto



Sentiment around XRP and ADA remained bearish last week. 
Metrics and market indicators hinted at price upticks for both tokens 

The recent bullish wave in the market has allowed most investors to enjoy profits, but that wasn’t the case with Cardano [ADA] and XRP. In fact, their supply of profit was considerably lower than that of other top cryptos like Bitcoin [BTC]. 
XRP and ADA’s underwhelming performances 
Santiment recently posted a tweet highlighting a few top cryptos and their profits. Not to much surprise, BTC and ETH topped the list, as their numbers stood at 98.3% and 95.1%, respectively. 
However, XRP’s number didn’t look good, as only 78% of its supply was in profit. Things were worse for ADA because just over half of all ADA were in profit. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that both tokens’ weighted sentiment remained in the negative zone for the majority of the days last week. 
This clearly suggested that bearish sentiment around these tokens was dominant in the market.

XRP’s price action also remained sluggish last week as it moved up marginally. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5239 with a market capitalization of over $29 billion. 
However, things for ADA looked pretty optimistic, as its weekly chart showed a price uptick of more than 3%. At press time, ADA had a value of $0.4653 and a market capitalization of over $16.6 billion.
Will XRP, ADA earn investors profits? 
AMBCrypto then analyzed their on-chain data to better understand whether these tokens were awaiting a price increase, which could help investors earn profits. 
As per our look at Santiment’s data, both tokens’ MVRV ratios improved over the last week, which looked bullish. 
Source: Santiment
Apart from this, both tokens’ fear and greed indexes were in neutral positions at press time. This meant that the possibility of their prices turning volatile couldn’t be ruled out yet.

We then analyzed their daily charts to see what the indicators suggested. We found that XRP’s price has been consolidating inside a bullish pattern for the last few weeks. 
At press time, it was on the verge of breaking out. A successful breakout might allow XRP’s price to retest its March highs in the coming weeks.

Crypto Marketplace Bakkt Considers Potential Breakup Or Sale As Market Recovers | Bitcoinist.com


								Bakkt Holdings, the digital-asset marketplace launched by the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is reportedly considering a potential sale in light of increased takeover activity within the crypto industry. 
Bakkt Evaluates Strategic Alternatives
According to Bloomberg, sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Bakkt has engaged a financial advisor to explore various strategic options, including a potential breakup. However, no final decision has been made. 
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of major futures markets and the NYSE, launched Bakkt amid significant anticipation. The venture was announced in collaboration with Starbucks and Microsoft, garnering substantial attention. 

Kelly Loeffler, Bakkt’s founding CEO, later served as a US Senator from Georgia for one year. Earlier this year, Bakkt faced the risk of delisting from the NYSE after disclosing potential challenges in continuing as a going concern.
Bakkt, which provides several services, including trading and custody, enters the market during a period of consolidation within the digital asset sector. 
However, crypto prices have surged to near-record highs, prompting some firms to consider expansion while others continue recovering from the industry-wide downturn two years ago. 
Potential Breakup Considered 
Bakkt went public in 2021 through a merger with a blank-check vehicle. In the first quarter of this year, the company reported a loss of $21 million on $855 million in revenue. On Friday, Bakkt unveiled a partnership with Crossover Markets to develop a crypto electronic communication network (ECN), further expanding its offerings.
Bakkt holds a coveted BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services, a regulatory license required to operate in the state. 
Following the news, the company’s shares surged 15% to reach $22.33 on Friday, a 27% increase for the week. The company’s market value stands at approximately $300 million. However, Bakkt’s stock has declined around 30% over the past year.

Overall, as the digital asset marketplace firm explores potential strategic options, including a potential sale, in response to heightened activity in the crypto industry, it faces a crucial crossroads. 
Bakkt’s suite of services, BitLicense approval, and recent partnership announcements position it as a significant player in the market. Nonetheless, industry participants will closely monitor the company’s future trajectory and determination to remain independent or seek a buyer.

As of the latest update, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has dipped below the $2.5 trillion mark. This decline has been primarily driven by the decrease in the price of Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Bitcoin has experienced a drop from  $71,000 and is currently valued at approximately $69,000.

Solana Trader Turns $53,500 into $2.8 Million on GME-Inspired Memecoin Bet | Cryptoglobe


                                
A Solana ($SOL) trader haas manage to turn around $53,500 into over $2.8 million over the course of five months and is currently siting on these unrealized gains over a speculative bet on a memecoin mirroring the current meme stock trend surrounding GameStop (GME).



According to data provided by Lookonchain, a memecoin inspired in the ongoing meme stock frenzy trading under the ticker $GME has seen its price explode over the last few weeks, allowing for the trader who bet heavily on it to now sit on 52x gains after buying 90.23 million $GME tokens.







The cryptocurrency investors has accumulated $GME tokens since the beginning of the year and hasn’t yet sold them, instead adding to their position when the price of the memecoin dropped.



On Solana-based decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Raydium, the tokens are now trading at $0.031 each, up from being nearly worthless when the trader accumulated them, and has somewhat limited liquidity which means the trader could suffer slippage losses when cashing out.



As CryptoGlobe reported, another cryptocurrency trader last month sold their $GME position for a loss of over $122,000 after capitulating. Data shows that the trader spent 1,668 SOL tokens withdrawn from popular cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin to buy $GME, but then exited their position for just 465.7 SOL tokens, realizing a loss of 1,202 SOL.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

These gains and losses are driven by the speculative nature of memecoins, which unlike traditional investments aren’t tied to the performance of an underlying company or market, but are seen as instead being tied to their respective communities.



To some analysts, memecoins are just driven by online buzz and social media trends and align with the greater fool theory of investing, wherein profits are made by buying assets in the hopes of selling them to a “greater fool” that’s willing to buy them later on at a higher price.



The cryptocurrency space, itself, has been associated with the greater fools theory in the past, with Neel Kashkari, who took office as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis on 1 Jan 2016, saying it’s “just a tool of speculation & greater fools.“



This was not the first time that Kashkari has come across as a crypto skeptic. Back in August 2021, while speaking at the Pacific NorthWest Economic Region (PNWER) annual summit held in Montana he said that he was less optimistic about Bitcoin compared to five or six years ago. Rather than sparking financial innovation, Kashkari said the current landscape of crypto is comprised of “95% fraud, hype, noise and confusion.”

Is A Bitcoin Crash Below $50,000 Still Possible? Crypto Analyst Shares The Possibilities


																The Bitcoin price has stalled after hitting the $71,000 level, floating in what is essentially a limbo of indecisiveness. Naturally, periods like these act as a predecessor to a massive move, but what direction the price might be headed in is another thing entirely. In an effort to pinpoint where Bitcoin is going, crypto analyst Alan Santana has analyzed the Bitcoin chart and come up with a possible direction.
Bitcoin Could Be Headed Downward
Alan Santana’s analysis looks at the Bitcoin performance over the past year in a bid to tell where the price might be headed. As the analyst points out, the Bitcoin price has been in a bullish wave for more than one year, 479 days to be exact, since November 2022 through to March 2024.

	Related Reading


Naturally, when bullish waves like these last for so long, it is expected that there will be a crash downward as investors begin to sell off their holdings. The problem is that bearish waves after a bullish wave move faster, and with the bullish wave lasting for 16 months, the bearish wave is expected to unravel quickly. As the crypto analyst points out, it is often 2x or 2.5x faster than the bullish wave.
Explaining the reason behind this, Alan Santana said that, “When the market is rising, people are buying, slowly but surely, building up a position and enjoying the market and profits as everything grows. This is not the case when the market turns.”
He further explains that “When a correction happens, people either prepare in advance or sell when they realize that the upward potential has been exhausted. So instead of ‘building a position,’ when the majority of players realize that the wave is over they tend to close the entire position, and thus, the down move can really speed up, and that’s why the down move is faster than when prices grow.”
Given this, the crypto analyst expects the bearish wave to come with a sharp crash for Bitcoin. This, by extension, would affect the rest of the market, which is known to suffer more than Bitcoin.
Where Is The BTC Price Headed From Here?
In the bearish wave expected by the crypto analyst, he believes that the Bitcoin price could crash more than 30% from its current price of $71,000. The chart shows a possible initial crash down to the $60,000 levels, and then he expects it to continue further.

At the bottom of this crash is the $47,943 level, presumably where the analyst expects the crash to end. If this does happen, then the BTC price could be looking at an approximately 33% crash, something that could be incredibly bearish for the market.

Ethereum devs confirm Pectra upgrade to include EIP-7702, PeerDAS, and more - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Ethereum developers have confirmed a list of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to be integrated into the Pectra upgrade, according to a recent announcement from Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano. Among the notable EIPs are EIP-7702, EIP-7594 (PeerDAS), and EIP-7251 (MaxEB).Proposed by a group of Ethereum developers, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, EIP-7702 targets enhanced account abstraction, allowing addresses to act as smart contracts during transactions.EIP-7702 will replace EIP-3074, an improvement previously suggested by developers. EIP-7702 is expected to bring similar benefits to EIP-3074 while addressing its potential risks.Meanwhile, EIP-7594, or PeerDAS, aims to improve roll-up scalability. This proposal’s key aspect is optimizing layer 2 (L2) solutions like Base and Arbitrum. It is expected to boost transaction processing for L2s.Additionally, EIP-7251, or MaxEB, will enable validators to stake up to 2,048 ETH, a substantial increase from the current 32 ETH limit.The upgrade will also feature EOF-related EIPs, EIP-2537, and EIP-7549, focusing on cryptographic improvements and efficiency.“History expiry is also being considered for inclusion in Pectra,” added Sassano.Sassano expects Ethereum’s Pectra to go live in Q1 2025, a timeline similar to that recently announced by Ethereum developers. The upgrade follows the Dencun upgrade which was successfully deployed in March.Sassano said Pectra will be a landmark milestone in Ethereum’s development roadmap.“Pectra, the next Ethereum network upgrade, is shaping up to be the biggest in Ethereum’s history,” Sassano stated.

Floki Inu price prediction: Why another ATH may be close - AMBCrypto



Large transactions increased, indicating that FLOKI could hit $0.00040 in the short term.
The token’s social dominance and weighted sentiment fell, predicting a possible bullish invalidation.

In the last seven days, Floki’s [FLOKI] price has increased by 24.79%, triggering different opinions about Floki Inu price prediction. At press time, the token changed hands at $0.00031.
A few days ago, specifically on the 5th of June, FLOKI hit a new All-Time High (ATH)  of $0.00034. However, since that day, the price decreased and in the last 24 hours, has been swinging sideways.
Despite the retracement, AMBCrypto found that several metrics were supporting the bullish Floki Inu price prediction to come to pass. First on the list was the large transactions happening on the Floki network.
FLOKI has the “big boys” support
According to data from IntoTheBlock, large transactions had increased by 9.81% in the last 24 hours. For context, large transactions are tagged as transactions valued at $100,000 or more.
Spikes in this metric indicate high activity by institutional players. However, this could be either buying or selling. But FLOKI’s price action suggested that most of the volume tilted toward a purchase.
Should this metric continue rise, then FLOKI’s price could hit a new ATH. Beyond the transactions, AMBCrypto looked at the active addresses to determine if the Floki Inu price prediction indicated by the transactions could be validated.
At press time, daily active addresses on the network was 77,790. This was a notable increase from the number in the last week of May.
Source: IntoTheBlock
In general, active addresses tracks network activity. Most times, the metric has a strong correlation with FLOKI’s price.
If the indicator decreases, it means that interaction on a blockchain is decreasing. At the same time, it implies low demand for the cryptocurrency.
However, the recent increase indicates rising demand for FLOKI. If sustained, this could be trigger a Floki Inu price prediction toward $0.00040.
Furthermore, AMBCrypto reported that the Floki team was working on increased adoption for the memecoin. This was evident in the recent commitment market maker DWF Labs.
However, there has been a change with FLOKI which could affect the price prediction. According to on-chain analysis using Santiment, the token’s social dominance had plunged.
Will negative sentiment stop the memecoin?
Previously, the metric was 0.487%— on the 6th of June. But at press time, that ratio had fallen to 0.075%. This suggests that FLOKI-related discussion within the ecosystem had decreased.
Should this ratio continue to fall, FLOKI’s price could drop below $0.00030. However, a decline in social dominance could also serve as a buying opportunity for the token.
Looking at the chart below, anytime that the metric dumps, FLOKI’s price breaks out a few days later. As such, the pattern might repeat itself, and the $0.000040 Floki Inu price prediction could be plausible.
Source: Santiment
In addition, the sentiment around FLOKI had become negative, suggesting that traders are taking a cautious approach toward the cryptocurrency. Weighted Sentiment tracks the positive/negative comments about a project.
Considering the negative reading around the token, FLOKI could face another decline before another bounce occurs. In terms of the supply in profit, on-chain data showed that 3.12 trillion tokens were in the green.

This is something that is important to the price action. For example, the number of tokens in profit hit 3.25 trillion on the 21st of May. At that point, the memecoin was overheated and triggered a correction in the price.
But since the supply in profit was lower, Floki Inu’s price prediction could be one to keep an eye on.

Bitcoin Investors Buying 5.5 Times What Miners Are Producing


								On-chain data shows that Bitcoin investors have recently been scooping up supply equal to 5.5 times what the miners have produced.
Bitcoin Investor Cohorts Have Been Busy Accumulating Recently
In a post on X, analyst James Van Straten discussed the accumulation that Bitcoin investor cohorts have been participating in and how it compares with the recent spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows.
The investor cohorts here refer to groups of holders divided based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold. In the context of the current topic, not any particular group is of interest, but all of them collectively are.

Below is the chart shared by Straten, which shows how the net flows into the wallets of BTC investors have looked recently.

The value of the metric seems to have been positive in recent weeks | Source: @jvs_btc on X
As the above graph shows, Bitcoin investors as a whole have been making net inflows into their wallets, suggesting that accumulation has been their dominant behavior.
The analyst has also attached the data for the network’s Monthly Issuance in the same chart. The “Issuance” here refers to the amount of BTC the miners produce by solving blocks. The Monthly Issuance is a measure of this amount over the past month.
From the graph, it’s apparent that Bitcoin investor accumulation has recently been higher than the Monthly Issuance. This would mean that investors have been buying BTC faster than the miners can produce it.
More specifically, the BTC investors have bought 71,000 BTC over the last thirty days, almost 5.5 times what the miners minted in the same period: around 13,000 BTC.
The chart also shows that, during the past year, the holder cohorts have continuously been scooping up BTC more than what miners have been producing, bar a few stretches.
How is it possible that the investors have been able to buy more than what’s being minted? Where is the extra Bitcoin coming from? The answer is exchanges. Centralized exchanges aren’t included with the investor cohorts and are where holders have been withdrawing coins.
As another analyst pointed out in a CrypotQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve has been going through a steep decline for a while now.

As for how the Bitcoin investor demand compares against the recent ETF inflows, Straten has noted that these investment vehicles have added $1.4 billion worth of BTC to their inventories in the latest spree. On the other hand, the monthly net accumulation from the investors stands at more than $5.1 billion.

Thus, the market’s demand has been quite sizeable recently, even regardless of the dramatic inflows that the ETFs have seen.

Trump Declares Himself 'Crypto President' After Raising $12M At VC-Hosted San Francisco Fundraiser, Slams Democrats For Trying To Regulate It - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump has reportedly positioned himself as the “crypto president” at a San Francisco fundraiser, raising $12 million in the process.What Happened: On Thursday, Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, expressed his support for the cryptocurrency industry and criticized the Democratic Party’s efforts to regulate it at a fundraiser in San Francisco, reported Reuters. He raised $12 million at the fundraiser hosted by tech venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya at Sacks’ residence in the upscale Pacific Heights neighborhood.The former President who is vying to unseat Democratic incumbent Joe Biden in the upcoming election, did not provide specific details about his proposed crypto policy.

Network activity keeps BNB Chain, Tron atop performance charts - AMBCrypto



The BNB network and Tron continued to dominate other networks in terms of activity.
However, social activity and sentiment around the tokens fell.

Binance Coin [BNB] and Tron [TRX] have both faced multiple challenges in the crypto space for quite some time. Despite the challenges, the overall interest in both BNB and TRON remained consistent.
Tron and Binance remain on top
Due to the consistent interest in these networks, they outperformed all other protocols in terms of activity. According to recent data, Tron kept its top position in terms of daily active users.
At the time of writing, the Tron network had over 2.1 million users. BNB came in third, with the number of active users on the network at 1.08 million.
Source: X
In terms of the DeFi sector, it was seen that the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes on the networks fell. BNB showed some dominance in the space whereas Tron was left behind.
Despite the tumbling DEX volumes, the TVL (Total Value Locked) on both networks remained relatively high.
However, in this scenario, Tron outperformed BNB Chain implying that despite declining DEX volumes, the overall performance of the network remained the same.
Source: Artemis
A factor that could impact the progress of these networks would be the social volume and sentiment around these networks. At the time of writing, the social volume around the BNB network had surged materially.
This meant the network gained massive popularity over the last few days.
Coupled with that, the sentiment around the BNB network also turned positive, indicating that the number of positive comments around BNB outnumbered the negative ones at the time of writing.
In contrast to that, Tron did not have a good time on the social front. The social volume around Tron fell significantly over the last few days, implying that the network’s popularity was waning.
The weighted sentiment around TRX also fell materially indicating that the number of criticisms around TRX had surged materially.

Read Binance [BNB] Price Prediction 2023-2024

Development declines
In terms of development activity, Tron and BNB network saw a decline. Falling development activity can impact the ability of the network to push out new upgrades and updates onto the network.
If this continues, the networks may have a hard time attracting new users.

Donald Trump Claims Title Of 'Crypto President' In Fundraiser With Key Players | Bitcoinist.com


								During a San Francisco fundraiser hosted by tech venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, former President Donald Trump positioned himself as the champion of crypto and criticized the Democratic party’s regulatory efforts in the sector. 
Donald Trump Raises $12 Million In Race For White House
According to Reuters, the event was held at Sacks’ residence in the upscale Pacific Heights neighborhood and raised $12 million for Trump’s presidential campaign. Attendees reported Donald Trump’s declaration of being the “crypto president,” highlighting his support for the cryptocurrency industry.

As the cryptocurrency industry faces increased regulatory scrutiny, it has sought to influence US politicians. As Bitcoinist reported, the crypto industry is stepping up its political game in the run-up to the upcoming elections in the United States. 
Leading the charge is US crypto exchange Coinbase, which has donated a whopping $25 million USDC to the Fairshake political action committee (PAC). Notably, this is the digital asset platform’s second major contribution to the advocacy group, which aims to promote pro-crypto candidates such as the former president Donald Trump.
The aftermath of major crypto firm bankruptcies in 2022, which revealed fraud and misconduct while leaving investors facing losses, prompted heightened regulatory attention. Industry participants actively engage with political figures to shape regulations in this context.
Per the report, during the San Francisco fundraiser, Trump emphasized the importance of cryptocurrency and expressed his strong support for the industry. 
Sources reported that he did not provide specific details about his proposed crypto policy. However, his stance contrasted with President Joe Biden, who signed an executive order in 2022 aimed at responsible development of digital assets. 
The Biden administration desires to collaborate with Congress to establish a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In an executive release, the Biden administration opposed the passage of H.R. 4763, a bill that would impact the regulatory structure for digital assets in the United States. 
Crypto Industry Leaders Join Forces With Trump
Despite San Francisco’s predominantly liberal landscape, Trump has garnered support from prominent local venture capitalists and crypto investors. 
According to Reuters, many cite concerns over excessive regulation as a key factor behind their endorsement. Jacob Helberg, an adviser to data analytics provider Palantir, stated that Donald Trump assured attendees that the Biden-Gensler campaign against crypto would halt within an hour of the second Trump administration, referring to SEC Chair Gary Gensler.
Notable figures in the cryptocurrency industry attended the fundraiser, including executives from Coinbase and Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

Former President Donald Trump also announced in May that his presidential campaign will accept donations in various cryptocurrencies. Supporters of the Trump campaign can now contribute using Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), which are becoming accepted.

Bitcoin Network Fees Suddenly Increased To $52, Causing Transactions To Be Affected - Coincu



	

Key Points:




OKX’s consolidation efforts caused high fees and network congestion due to an ineffective automated system.



Over 330,000 unconfirmed transactions and soaring Bitcoin network fees resulted from reduced mining activity and power outages in China.




The Bitcoin network has recently experienced significant congestion, leading to soaring transaction fees.



Bitcoin Network Fees Suddenly Increased To $52, Causing Transactions To Be Affected 4



Bitcoin Network Fees Soaring Makes OKX Wallet Have Difficulty Processing Transactions



The spike, which saw Bitcoin network fees reach 520 sat/vbyte (around $52), has been partly attributed to OKX’s wallet consolidation efforts.



According to @mononautical, the founder of Mempool, OKX began processing wallet transactions from block 846,867, handling over 2,380 transactions with an average fee rate of 246.65 sat/vbyte. The process, costing 254.28 BTC (approximately $17.6 million), seemed to be driven by an ineffective automated system, resulting in internal bidding wars and escalating Bitcoin network fees.



This development has exacerbated the current congestion on the Bitcoin network. As of the latest reports, over 330,000 transactions remain unconfirmed, with memory usage hitting 1.35 GB during peak congestion. OKX has responded to the community’s concerns, stating, “Thanks for the reminder, the team was testing a collection program and has stopped.”




New Protocols and Halving Strain Network Capacity



Beyond OKX’s issues, the broader Bitcoin ecosystem is also facing challenges that contribute to high transaction fees. The recent halving event, which reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, has significantly impacted miner profitability.



The reduction has led to a noticeable drop in mining activity, with the network experiencing its largest daily hash rate decline since November 2017. Power outages in major Chinese mining hubs further compounded this problem, causing longer transaction times and heightened competition for transaction processing.



Network congestion during periods of high transaction volume is not new. Historical data shows similar surges, such as during Bitcoin‘s rally to $20,000 in 2017, when unconfirmed transactions in the mempool reached around 180,000. Additionally, new protocols like Ordinals and Runes have increased transaction volume, straining the network’s capacity further.

Bitcoin - Did a strong U.S Jobs report REALLY pull BTC below $70K? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s price whipsawed after stronger-than-expected May U.S jobs report
Market watchers can now shift focus to next Wednesday’s Fed meeting

Bitcoin [BTC] dropped below $71k on Friday, in the early hours of New York’s trading session, following a hotter-than-expected May U.S jobs report. In fact, within 24 hours of the same, the cryptocurrency also dropped below $70k on the charts. 
May’s U.S jobs report revealed that 272k jobs were added in May, well above the expected 190k. However, unemployment rates hit 4% against the expected 3.9%. 
Although this was great news to workers, it complicated the prospect of the Fed cutting interest rates in June’s meeting. The jobs report is one of the datasets the Fed uses to make decisions on its monetary policy. 
A weaker one could increase the odds of rate cuts, but a stronger one, like May’s report, could tip the Fed to be hawkish. 
Commenting on BTC’s wild reaction to Friday’s report, Scott Melker of ‘The Wolf of All Streets’ stated, 
“Bitcoin drops $1000 in a matter of minutes because too many people have jobs. LOL. We live in the upside down. Strong jobs mean less chance of cuts, which means assets go down as a knee-jerk reaction.”
What’s next for Bitcoin?
All eyes will now shift to the Fed’s announcement next Wednesday (June 12). However, according to the CME Fed watch tool, 99% of interest rate traders expect these rates to remain unchanged. 
Source: CME Group
As such, market watchers will be keen on Fed chair Jerome Powell’s press conference next Wednesday to learn whether the agency adopts a dovish or hawkish position. 
Many industry analysts expected the U.S Jobs report to be a key stepping stone in shaping BTC’s next price direction. According to Quinn Thompson of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, 
“The market needs conviction that Powell is going to cut in July. That could come from a weak jobs report Friday, weak CPI, and/or dovish Fed next Wednesday.”
Bullish expectations have been raised after the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of Canada (BOC) cut their interest rates, which could initiate global quantitative easing. 
The latest U.S job report complicates that. However, according to Charles Edwards, founder of crypto hedge fund Capriole Investments, rate cuts were inevitable in the long run. 
“Time will tell. But it for sure looks like unemployment has bottomed now, which suggests US liquidity will need to rise and rise soon. Rate cuts incoming.”
Source: Coinglass
In the meantime, there is still considerable liquidity above $72k, marked orange, which could act as a magnet for price action. However, Bitcoin’s sideways movement could extend until the Fed meeting next week.

How to qualify for the AlienX airdrop and obtain the AIX crypto

In this article, we see how to participate in the crypto airdrop of the AlienX blockchain and try to obtain a share of the AIX tokens that will be distributed within the community.
Recently AlienX launched the HAL testnet, anticipating the mainnet launch expected by the end of June, with the TGE of the project’s main token being inaugurated in parallel.
Let’s see below how to try to become eligible for the airdrop.

What is the AlienX project?
AlienX is a next-generation blockchain with EVM compatibility based on AI nodes, primarily dedicated to the gaming world and the NFT sector.
A set of 50,000 nodes, each managed through an AI proxy, ensures the continuous monitoring of the network and its security, in addition to allowing high technical performance with scalability suitable for the numerous requests that will be processed.
The goal is to be able to integrate billions of game resources with blockchain and intelligenza artificiale.
In this initial development phase of the project, AlienX allows you to earn profits from staking crypto such as BTC, ETH; ARB, SOL (and also NFTs), with the rewards that will be credited directly at the launch of the mainnet in the form of AIX tokens.
As of today, it has a TVL from staking equal to 55 million dollars and a total of 70,000 users, with numbers strongly growing
The platform uses the cryptographic stack of Arbitrum Orbit and relies on strategic partnerships with the teams of the projects from OffChain Labs, Caldera, and AlienSwap.
AlienX has been valued at a whopping 200 million dollars after completing two rounds of financing, raising a total of 17 million dollars from VC investors such as OKX Ventures, C² Ventures, and Next Leader Capital

At the end of May, AlienX launched the HAL tesnet blockchain accompanied by a 3-week airdrop program (which will end around mid-June) where the entire community can interact with the new network and obtain additional shares of the airdrop as a gift.
By the end of June, the mainnet is expected to be inaugurated, as soon as thorough testing is completed and all the functionalities of the chain are perfected.On this occasion, the AIX token will be introduced and distributed among all eligible users (the vAIX tokens will be converted into AIX), and the migration of AI Nodes will also be completed.

In parallel with the HAL testnet, the details of the tokenomics and the utility of the new crypto AIX have also been revealed, which will play a central role in the cryptographic ecosystem as the main resource for payment and staking.
The allocation of the token, the percentage unlocked at TGE, and the timing with which each slice will be released to eligible parties, are indicated in the table below.
Source: https://docs.alienxchain.io/~/changes/KsEn4zQZ0ODootaSCWwx/white-paper/tokenomics
How to be eligible for the AlienX crypto airdrop: staking and Hal Quest
Examining the information regarding the tokenomics of AIX, let’s see what actions to take to qualify for the airdrop of Alienx.
We observe that a large portion of the token (overall 60%) will be allocated for the project’s stakers and for the holders of X-Nodes, which is a resource derived from social quests, no longer collectible.
The first step to participate in the AlenX airdrop and be eligible is to stake (via Bitcoin, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Solana networks) coins such as BTC, ETH, ARB, SOL, RSETH, cSTONE, mSAT, or NFTs like “The weirdo Ghost Gang”, “Cyber Ticket Pass Card” and “MutliSat PASS”.
It is also possible to participate by locking the so-called AI Node (not to be confused with X-Nodes), currently on sale through a Public Sale at 0.56 ETH.
These allow participation in securing the network and obtaining future shares of the gas fees paid by users to use the Alienx HAL blockchain.
In all cases, by staking on the platform, you obtain vAIX tokens which will then be converted into AIX during the TGE by the end of June.
Note how there is a section called “treasure BOX”, where extra vAIX can be obtained based on staking goals.
ATTENTION because all locked funds are not withdrawable until the network goes mainnet. 
Source: https://alienxchain.io/staking
Another way to qualify for the AlienX airdrop is by solving the “HAL Quest”  by completing simple tasks within the HAL testnet network.
By doing so, you will certainly obtain a smaller share of AIX tokens for the airdrop, given the low allocation reserved for the community, but you will be able to farm for free.
For each QUEST completed, a predetermined number of ALIEN tokens (converted into AIX at the end of the campaign) is obtained. These are simple tasks such as requesting a faucet, bridging funds on the testnet, staking test tokens, deploying a contract, etc.
For a step-by-step guide on everything that needs to be done, you can consult this thread on X.
Source: https://hal.alienxchain.io/quest
There are also additional ways to earn a share of the airdrop, such as trading on AlienSwap and being generally active on all the projects that orbit within the AlienX ecosystem.

US Bitcoin ETF Inflows Have 19th Consecutive Positive Day - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Spot US Bitcoin ETFs witnessed the 19th consecutive day of positive inflows, totaling $132 million on June 7, according to HODL15Capital monitoring.



Despite record Bitcoin ETF inflows totaling over $15.6 billion since launch, Bitcoin’s price fails to reflect the expected surge, leaving investors and analysts puzzled.



Increased demand for digital asset-focused investments, with May recording $2 billion in inflows, coincides with Bitcoin’s recent correction to $69,400 following a US employment rate increase report.




On June 7, the spot US Bitcoin ETF inflows reached $132 million, marking the 19th consecutive day of positive inflows, as reported by HODL15Capital.

Despite this significant influx, Bitcoin’s price has yet to reflect the expected surge, leaving both investors and analysts puzzled. In recent weeks, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced an unprecedented streak of positive flows, setting a record since their inception. BlackRock’s IBIT leads the pack, which has seen substantial net inflows.



Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs have amassed over $15.6 billion in inflows. However, some traders argue that this amount may still be insufficient to exert significant influence on prices until other markets open up.




Growing Comfort with Digital Assets Amidst Regulatory Perception Shift



Analysts emphasize that continued Bitcoin ETF inflows, among other factors, are poised to drive Bitcoin past key resistance levels into price discovery territory. The surge in flows coincides with a resurgence in demand for digital asset-focused investments, with May witnessing $2 billion in inflows. Investors are increasingly comfortable with these assets, buoyed by a perception of growing regulatory acceptance.



Bitcoin recently traded above $71,000. However, a correction ensued following a report of an increase in the US employment rate. As a result, Bitcoin experienced a nearly 4% decline, currently trading at $69,400.

OKX Wallet Transactions Trigger Chaos, Costing Millions in Bitcoin Fees! - Coincu



	

Key Points:




OKX initiated wallet transactions from block 846,867, processing 2,380+ transactions, costing 254.28 BTC (about $17.6 million).



Allegations suggest OKX’s system led to internal bidding wars between its own transactions, exacerbating fees and user frustrations.



The incident underscores concerns about OKX’s infrastructure reliability and broader systemic risks within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.




OKX wallet transaction has come under fire for its handling of wallet transactions, with allegations of an ineffective automated system causing transaction fees to spiral out of control. 



 



According to mononaut, the founder of mempool, a blockchain analysis platform, OKX wallet transaction initiated wallet transactions from block 846,867 onwards, processing over 2,380 transactions at a staggering cost of 254.28 BTC, equivalent to approximately $17.6 million.







The revelations shed light on what appears to be a botched implementation of an automated system by OKX, resulting in internal bidding wars between its own transactions. This internal friction within the exchange’s system has exacerbated transaction fees, posing challenges for users and fueling criticism of OKX’s operational practices.



OKX’s Infrastructure Reliability Questioned Amidst Escalating Fees



 



The escalation of fees raises concerns about the efficiency and reliability of OKX wallet transaction‘s infrastructure, prompting questions about its ability to handle transaction volumes effectively. The incident underscores the importance of robust systems and protocols within cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly as the industry continues to grapple with scalability and usability issues.




Critics argue that OKX wallet transaction’s mismanagement of wallet transactions not only undermines user experience but also highlights broader systemic risks within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the sector attracts increasing scrutiny from regulators and investors, incidents like these underscore the need for greater transparency and accountability from cryptocurrency exchanges.



OKX has yet to issue a formal statement addressing the allegations. However, the incident serves as a cautionary tale for both industry participants and regulators, emphasizing the importance of vigilance in safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity of cryptocurrency markets.

Bitcoin To Explode to $135,000 by End of 2024 Courtesy of These Three Catalysts, Says BitGo CEO Mike Belshe - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of digital asset custodian BitGo, Mike Belshe, believes Bitcoin (BTC) could rally by up to 94% over the next six months.
Belshe says in a new Kitco News interview that Bitcoin “will be somewhere around $125,000 to $135,000″ by the end of this year.










Bitcoin is trading at $69,470 at time of writing.
According to the BitGo CEO, one of the catalysts that will drive Bitcoin to a six-figure price is the high level of US national debt.
“We still have the macro climate backdrop which is constantly verifying the thesis of Bitcoin. You know, it’s not really a debate anymore that the US debt is uncontrollable…
…that macro climate influences the idea that Bitcoin is kind of the next gold.”
Belshe says that the weaponization of the US dollar as well as the emergence of economic blocs that are building alternative payment systems are other bullish catalysts for Bitcoin.
“Look there’s not an alternative [global] reserve currency that looks super strong. Obviously, you’ve got BRICS trying to eat away at the dollar, demand side, by doing more purchases outside of the dollar. So far those have been relatively small scale but that’s going to continue to grow. Unfortunately, the US with sanctions controls… 
Every time the US says we are going to maintain power over your dollar and if you don’t do what we want you to, foreign policy-wise, we’re going to take it away. Which is what we did to Russia badly, you can love it or hate it, but that’s what we did… we put every single dollar holder on notice that we may do it to them in the future as well…
So the US debt crisis is one thing, foreign policy and sanctions controls is another, BRICS providing alternate payment systems… 
So all of this is going to eat away at the dollar. That is the narrative of why Bitcoin exists.”

Crypto Markets Lost $80 Billion in Hours as Bitcoin (BTC) Dumped Below $69K (Weekend Watch)


																History doesn’t rhyme but tends to repeat itself, which is something that has been happening in the crypto industry in the past few weeks.
In this case, bitcoin and the rest of the market dropped hard on Friday evening, similar to the events from the previous one.
BTC’s Friday Drop
It was last Friday when the primary cryptocurrency tested $69,000 but failed and the subsequent rejection pushed it south by over two grand. The weekend was quite uneventful as the asset had reclaimed some ground and stood around $67,500.
More gains came on Monday as BTC briefly exceeded $70,000. Despite failing there at first, it bounced off and soared past that line on Tuesday. In fact, it stood above it for several consecutive days and even painted a multi-week peak of $72,000 on Friday.
Yet, as mentioned above, the Friday scenario repeated, and bitcoin was stopped at the $72,000 level. The bears drove it south hard, and the cryptocurrency dumped to a multi-day low of $68,500. It has recovered some ground and now stands above $69,000, but it’s still 2.7% down on the day.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


BTC’s market capitalization has dumped to $1.366 trillion, but its dominance over the alts has risen to 50.8% as they have suffered even more.

Alts See Red
As hinted above, the landscape with the altcoins is in a worse state. Ethereum has dropped by 3.5% and sits below $3,700, BNB went from over $710 to under $690, while SOL has plummeted by almost 6%.
Even more losses come from the likes of Dogecoin (-8.5%), Avalanche (-7%), Chainlink (-7%), Polkadot (-8%), NEAR (-8%), UNI (-7%), and MATIC (-8%).
FIL is the only notable gainer, while WIF, ARB, and FET have dumped by double digits.
The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has seen more than $80 billion gone from yesterday’s peak. As such, the metric has dropped to under $2.7 trillion on CG.

Are Litecoin holders in a better position than Ethereum investors? - AMBCrypto



Transactions on Litecoin increased across all levels, leaving Ethereum trailing
ETH and LTC prices fell in the last 24 hours, but they might surpass major milestones soon

It is unusual to find Litecoin [LTC] surpassing Ethereum [ETH] at any level. However, on 6 June, the number of active addresses on Litecoin’s network jumped by a mind-blowing 75%.
According to data from IntoTheBlock, the difference was over 100,000 in favor of Litecoin. In total, the figure was 602,720 and represented the highest level of activity on the network since January.
Source: IntoTheBlock
After Cardano, Litecoin takes Ethereum out
For context, active addresses measure the number of unique wallets engaged in successful transactions on a blockchain. A few days ago, the coin had registered higher values than Cardano [ADA] on the same front.
However, it is important to mention that most of the transactions emanated from wallets with a small balance.
That being said, those holding LTC worth $10,000 to $10 million were not left out. According to IntoTheBlock’s latest post on X,
“While most of the increase is due to transactions smaller than $10, there is a noticeable rise in transactions of all sizes.”







Here, it’s worth noting that the rise in network activity did not trigger a hike in LTC’s price. At press time, Litecoin was valued at at $83.52, following a fall of 1.8% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, was trading at $3,791, with the altcoin depreciating slightly too.

Additionally, AMBCrypto looked at Litecoin’s market cap to thermocap ratio. This metric measures a cryptocurrency’s valuation relative to the total security spend by miners. When the market cap to thermocap ratio spikes, it means the coin is trading at a premium when compared to miner spend.

In this instance, the price could be termed overvalued.








Historically, as shown below, an extremely high reading of the metric causes a correction. However, at press time, the ratio was 0.00000003. This was a low reading, compared to periods when Litecoin has been overheated.

Are LTC and ETH at a discount?
Simply put, LTC may be trading at a discount. Should the market return to a highly bullish state, the price of LTC could move past $100 from its press time position.

To confirm this thesis, AMBCrypto examined the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This metric track the profitability of holders in relation to coin valuation.

At press time, Litecoin’s 30-day MVRV ratio was 13.35%, indicating that the average holder would make profits if they sell. However, the gains might be high enough to trigger widespread profit-taking.

For Ethereum, the 30-day MVRV ratio was 4.69%. While this suggested that ETH and LTC may be in similar spots, it also addressed the notion that Litecoin holders might be in a better position than their Ethereum counterparts.

Realistic or not, here’s LTC’s market cap in ETH terms

Moving on, it is possible to see ETH’s value surpass the 4,000-market in the mid-term. Over the same period, LTC might also breach its $100 psychological resistance.

Ronin Hack Update: Norway Returns Millions Stolen In Record Crypto Heist


								The Norwegian government has successfully frozen and returned $5.7 million linked to a high-profile cyber-attack on the Ronin network, an Ethereum sidechain integral to the web3 game Axie Infinity.
This action underscores a growing international commitment to addressing cybercrime even in the cryptocurrency space. The funds were recovered as part of a collaborative effort involving various law enforcement and forensic entities.

Ronin Hack: International Collaboration in Cybersecurity
The Ronin network had suffered an exploit in March 2022, leading to the loss of over $600 million—the largest DeFi exploit to date.
This incident was attributed to the notorious Lazarus Group, which is believed to be associated with North Korea. The successful retrieval of stolen assets was facilitated by the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (Økokrim).
The operation was a concerted effort that also included contributions from the FBI in the United States and various blockchain forensics firms like Chainalysis.

Sky Mavis, the developers behind Axie Infinity, expressed gratitude towards the organizations involved. They confirmed that while 15% of the recovered funds would cover operational expenses, the rest would be returned to the Axie Infinity treasury, ensuring continued support and compensation for affected stakeholders.
The game developer further confirmed that law enforcement authorities have currently frozen an additional $40 million in assets related to the case.
They noted that the process of recovering these funds would require an unspecified amount of time, and thus, a definite schedule for their return could not be provided at the moment.
Current Cryptocurrency Security Shift
The Ronin exploit remains a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities within decentralized finance platforms. It involved the compromise of five out of nine validator private keys, allowing the attacker to execute fraudulent transactions.
This incident marks the largest-ever crypto heist up to date as the hack resulted in a loss of roughly $624 million, according to data from DeFillama.

Meanwhile, current trends indicate a shift in attack vectors, with cybercriminals now targeting less secure elements such as private key management.

According to the latest HackHub report by Merkle Science, losses from smart contract vulnerabilities have dramatically decreased due to improved security tools, but losses from private key leaks have surged.

Trump Pledges Support for Crypto at $12M San Francisco Fundraiser | Cryptoglobe


                                
At a high-profile fundraiser in San Francisco on Thursday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a strong case for his support of the cryptocurrency industry while criticizing Democratic regulatory approaches. The event, held at the Pacific Heights home of tech investors David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, successfully raised $12 million, as reported by attendees to Reuters.



According to a report by Alexandra Ulmer for Reuters, during the event, Trump positioned himself as a fervent advocate for cryptocurrencies. Trevor Traina, a tech executive and former U.S. ambassador, noted that Trump described himself as the future “crypto president.” This declaration comes as the cryptocurrency sector seeks to influence political figures amid increased scrutiny following significant industry bankruptcies in 2022, which exposed fraudulent activities and resulted in substantial investor losses.



Republican National Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon conveyed that Trump emphasized the importance of cryptocurrency and expressed his robust support for the industry. However, Trump did not provide detailed plans regarding his approach to crypto policy.



Trump’s remarks contrast with President Joe Biden’s 2022 executive order aimed at ensuring the responsible development of digital assets. This order prompted agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to develop regulatory guidelines to mitigate risks associated with cryptocurrencies. The Biden administration has also indicated a willingness to work with Congress on a regulatory framework for digital assets.



Robyn Patterson, a spokesperson for the White House, reiterated the administration’s stance, highlighting efforts to balance innovation in digital assets with consumer protection against the risks of new technologies.



The Reuters report went to mention that despite San Francisco’s predominantly liberal leaning, Trump has found support among a growing number of venture capitalists and crypto investors in the area. These supporters, including several prominent figures, are concerned about what they perceive as overregulation under the current administration. Jacob Helberg, a Palantir adviser, mentioned that Trump vowed to halt what he described as the “Biden-Gensler crusade against crypto” within an hour of taking office, referring to SEC Chair Gary Gensler.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The event attracted notable attendees from the crypto industry, including executives from Coinbase and the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, well-known for their significant crypto investments. 



David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, who have been vocal about their crypto investments, especially in Bitcoin, hosted the fundraiser in the Pacific Heights neighborhood. The alignment of the crypto community with Trump signals a strategic move driven by concerns over regulatory pressures seen as detrimental to industry growth and innovation.



Last month, Trump endorsed cryptocurrency during a special event for Trump NFT holders at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. He voiced concern over the departure of crypto companies from the U.S., citing a perceived hostility towards digital assets. “If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be here,” he stated.







At the event, Trump engaged with the crypto-savvy audience, expressing his openness to accepting campaign donations in Bitcoin and other tokens. He also criticized the current administration, accusing President Biden and SEC Chair Gary Gensler of being both ignorant and hostile towards cryptocurrency.







Additionally, Trump claimed credit for revitalizing the popularity of NFTs:

Ripple v SEC Lawsuit Recap: The Developments After the Trial's Start


																TL;DR

Ripple and the SEC have been in a significant dispute involving key witness testimony from Andrea Fox.
The entities have also clashed over the sealing of certain financial documents, with the regulator viewing this data as critical to the case.


The Clash Over Key Testimony
The infamous legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been ongoing since December 2020. Back then, the regulator accused the firm of raising over $1.3 billion via unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. 
The lawsuit experienced countless ups and downs in the last years before reaching its trial stage on April 23, 2024. Shortly after that date, Judge Sarah Netburn signed a new scheduling order focused on the motion for remedies and entry of final judgment. 
Both parties abided by the rules, handing in necessary documents and presenting essential data that could be useful for resolving the case.
The process could have been smoother, with Ripple and the SEC clashing over a key witness testimony from Andrea Fox. The company initially argued that the declaration represents an unsolicited expert opinion, whereas the watchdog described the process as “standard summary evidence in support of calculations for disgorgement.” 




On April 29, the SEC filed an official opposition to Ripple’s motion, insisting that the testimony “does not rely on specialized experience and does not render any opinions at all.”
“Rather, it applies basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records to streamline the presentation of the evidence to Judge Torres… The court should deny Ripple’s motion,” the agency added. 
Ripple struck back a few days later, filing a letter in further support of its initial request. It claimed that the SEC failed to show that the declaration is summary evidence rather than expert testimony:
“Fox is an expert because she purports to use technical or other specialized knowledge to help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. She does not merely apply basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records, as the SEC contends.”
Ripple went further, stating that even if Andrea Fox could be categorized as a summary witness, the regulator failed to disclose her before the end of the discovery process.
Additional Confrontation
Ripple’s request to seal and redact some evidence and financial documents data related to the regulator’s motion for judgment and remedies became another bone of contention. 
“The Court should deny Ripple’s request to conceal financial and securities sales information because that information constitutes “judicial documents” as it is at the heart of the arguments the parties have presented in support of their remedies motion and could, therefore, tend to influence the Court’s remedies decision,” the agency stated in May.
The SEC believes this data could shed more light on Ripple’s past XRP sales and be crucial in the legal proceedings. However, the firm argues that historical contracts are now irrelevant due to recent changes in the sales procedures.
“Ripple is no longer selling XRP through over-the-counter transactions with the characteristics that the Court determined were “Institutional sales” at summary judgment. Ripple’s current sales of XRP to customers for use in connection with Ripple’s ODL product do not have any of the relevant terms of over-the-counter contracts, such as discounts offered to sophisticated counterparties.”
Awaiting the Judge’s Ruling
Despite entering its trial phase, the case’s outcome may be dragged on for years due to the complexity of the legal process and potential appeals from both sides. 
One person who envisioned a relatively quick resolution is the American lawyer Jeremy Hogan. He thinks the parties may shake hands on a $100 million agreement as soon as this summer. 
Some view the SEC as the underdog in the legal battle due to Ripple’s three partial court victories secured last year. Each triumph was followed by a price resurgence of XRP, meaning the eventual end of the case could trigger enhanced volatility again.

Dogecoin Whale Activity Surges as Trading Volume Soars


							

Dogecoin whale activity has surged, indicating growing institutional interest.



Trading volume has increased significantly, reflecting heightened market activity.



Despite a minor price dip, strong whale activity and high volume suggest a positive outlook.




Whale activity has surged among Dogecoin (DOGE) investors. According to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, more than 150 DOGE transactions exceeding $1 million each occurred within the past 24 hours.







This spike in high-value transactions suggests growing interest from large investors in Dogecoin.



Dogecoin’s 24-hour trading volume also increased significantly, surging by 47.62%, according to CoinGlass data. This rise to $1.32 billion indicates heightened market activity and investor engagement.



Furthermore, according to IntoTheBlock, a remarkable 84% of Dogecoin holders are currently in profit at the current price. This high percentage of profitable holdings reflects Dogecoin’s positive momentum, with many investors seeing returns.



Previously, Coin Edition reported that DOGE whales have accumulated 200 million DOGE since May 30th, despite the meme coin’s price trend downward. This deliberate accumulation by large investors could signal potential shifts in the Dogecoin landscape.









Currently ranked as the eighth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $23.10 billion, Dogecoin is trading at approximately $0.1598, down 1.62% over the past day. Despite this slight decline, the market sentiment remains optimistic, driven by strong whale activity and the notable increase in trading volume.



As the cryptocurrency market evolves, the actions of whale investors play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of assets like Dogecoin.

Bitcoin Hits $69,000 as US Job Data Fuels Market Volatility


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price fell to $69,000 after Friday’s mixed US job data release, leading to over $411 million in liquidations.
This decline followed the crypto market’s reaction to new economic indicators, which showed both positive and concerning signs for the US economy.
Economic Indicators and Market Sentiment Set the Stage for Bitcoin’s Next Move

Non-farm payrolls expanded to 272,000 for May, significantly above April’s 165,000 and the Dow Jones estimate of 190,000. However, the unemployment rate rose to 4% for the first time since January 2022.
Job gains were notable in health care, government, leisure, and hospitality. Analysts see this report as hawkish, suggesting it may delay interest rate cuts.

According to the CME FedWatch Tool, futures indicate a 50.5% chance of a rate cut by September. The market remains uncertain, leading to increased volatility in the crypto market, especially for Bitcoin.

Coinglass data shows total crypto liquidations in the past 24 hours reached $411.88 million, affecting nearly 148,000 traders. Long positions accounted for $360.41 million, while short positions made up $51.47 million.

Despite the recent dip, renowned analyst Markus Thielen offers a positive outlook for Bitcoin in the longer term. In his latest report, Thielen highlights the potential for Bitcoin to reach $83,000, driven by a bullish head-and-shoulders formation and supportive macroeconomic factors.
He emphasizes the role of the global central bank easing cycle, with recent interest rate cuts in Canada, Denmark, and Europe, and further easing expected in the US due to weakening economic indicators. Thielen explains that while the Federal Reserve historically avoids rate cuts during the May-November period before presidential elections, market sentiment and the perceived likelihood of rate cuts are crucial for risk assets like Bitcoin.
He also notes Ethereum’s (ETH) potential impact on Bitcoin, particularly if its price declines sharply. Thielen discusses the importance of money flow indicators, pointing out that substantial inflows are necessary to drive significant price movements for Bitcoin.

“To reach the $83,000 head-and-shoulders target (+17%), we would need to see $13 billion of inflows across various verticals—that’s what it takes. A breakout above the $71,600 trend line will naturally result in more upside buying through multiple products, but $13 billion requires quite some commitment. Nevertheless, we think this is possible as a weaker US employment market (unemployment rate at 4%) and lower inflation data next week (3.3%) will likely provide the macro backdrop for new all-time highs,” he elaborated.


Growing interest from institutional investors further strengthens Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Significant acquisitions from institutions and steady inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) illustrate this trend.

ETFs have recorded inflows for 19 consecutive days, surpassing the previous record of 17 days. According to SoSo Value data, these ETFs’ cumulative total net inflow as of June 7 is $15.69 billion, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominating at $21.07 billion in net assets.

Dogecoin Forms Bullish Inverse Head And Shoulders Amid Important Ordinals Update | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin has been one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies recently and has continued to maintain its position as the largest meme coin in the market. Its recent price action has left much to be desired, leaving investors wondering where the price might be headed next. However, an important bullish formation just showed up on the chart that could change the course of things for the meme coin.
Dogecoin Forms Bullish Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern
While the recent Dogecoin price action has not been the best, it has been a buildup toward one of the most bullish patterns that it has seen in recent times. According to crypto analyst Benji Hyam, the Dogecoin chart has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern.

The analysis who took to TradingView to share this development explained that the formation of this pattern is actually bullish for the meme coin. One reason for this is that it often marks the beginning of notable rallies that could send the Dogecoin price toward new yearly highs.
Not only did the Dogecoin price successfully form a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern, it was also starting to see a breakout at the time that the analysis was posted on June 5. However, the DOGE price has not been able to secure this breakout and has since broken down toward $0.16.
Nevertheless, the crypto analyst points out that as long as the meme coin is able to hold the $0.158 support level, it should be able to continue its upward rally. In the initial analysis, the crypto analyst gives the Dogecoin price until Sunday to play out this bullish scenario or it could risk dropping back down.
DOGE Ordinals In The Spotlight Again
Ordinals on the Dogecoin network got popular after Bitcoin Ordinals made headlines. While the Dogecoin ordinals did not garner as much attention as their Bitcoin counterparts, it seems they have become a fixture on the blockchain, and the most recent announcement from the MyDogeWallet team confirms this.

According to Alex, who is the MyDogeWallet CTO, the wallet will now be able to support Dogecoin ordinals, or Doginals, as they are commonly called. In addition, the wallet will also be able to support the DRC-20 tokens created on the blockchain.
Alex informed the community that the launch of this feature is close and that it should be released this weekend. This is another step that has solidified the importance of Ordinals on the Dogecoin network, and the increased usage could translate to better price action for DOGE at the same time.

Double Bullish Bitcoin Godzilla Candles Case Suggested by Samson Mow

Renowned Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow has taken to the X social media platform (widely famous as Twitter in the past) to suggest a new mega bullish case for Bitcoin which, he believes, could lead to Godzilla candles “immediately.”Mow, the chief executive of the Bitcoin adoption-focused Jan3 company, stated that the video game retail sales company which became widely famous in 2021 due to its short squeeze, GameStop, should start adding the world’s flagship cryptocurrency to its corporate treasury. Samson Mow believes that this would make a “double bullish thesis” after which both Bitcoin and GME would see Godzilla candles immediately. Mow mirrored the recent statement made by prominent US financier Anthony Scaramucci who tweeted on Friday that he believes GameStop should buy Bitcoin.On Friday, GME slumped almost 40% after the company publicly revealed its recent financial results and announced its plans to issue more shares. Besides, financial analyst and investor Keith Gill (commonly known on X and YouTube as “Roaring Kitty”) made his first live stream on YouTube since 2021 (the famous year for GameStop) where he planned to share that he is about to become a billionaire thanks to his large GameStop bet. However, it never happened because the stock price plummeted.This sharp downward move took place after the previous 50% surge which occurred recently.

Regulatory Showdown: ASA Takes SEC to Court Over FOIA Compliance


							

ASA sues SEC for lack of transparency in enforcement actions.



SEC’s use of Exception 7(a) to withhold documents was questioned.



FOIA compliance issues spark legal battle over regulatory accountability.




The American Securities Association (ASA) filed a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for alleged lack of transparency.



The lawsuit underscores the ASA’s frustration over the SEC’s opaque enforcement actions and alleged failure to comply with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requirements. The ASA is seeking more clarity on how the SEC calculates penalties and selects entities to target.



The ASA’s lawsuit, filed on June 6, highlights growing concerns about regulatory transparency. The ASA argues that the SEC has consistently failed to provide adequate information about its decision-making processes. This lack of disclosure has raised questions among stakeholders about the fairness and consistency of the SEC’s enforcement actions.



The ASA’s complaint centers on the SEC’s use of Exception 7(a) to withhold documents requested under FOIA. This exception protects information that could interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings. However, the ASA contends that this should not apply to settled cases. They believe the SEC has not met its high burden of proof to justify withholding these documents.



Moreover, the ASA raises concerns about the SEC’s penalty regime. The association claims that the SEC imposes penalties without adequately explaining their rationale. This has led to suspicions that the penalties are potentially being used to boost end-of-year statistics rather than to enhance market integrity or protect investors.









The situation has also drawn criticism from various personalities, including social media commentators. MetaLawMan pointed out the unusual role of private citizens in holding the SEC accountable. This responsibility traditionally falls on Congress, which has issued no subpoenas or taken significant action. Consequently, private citizens and organizations like the ASA are resorting to FOIA requests and lawsuits to obtain necessary information.







Eleanor Terrett highlighted the ASA’s lawsuit, emphasizing the SEC’s failure to respond to FOIA requests. This legal battle reflects broader concerns about government transparency and accountability in regulatory enforcement.



The ASA’s lawsuit against the SEC represents a significant step in the ongoing debate over regulatory transparency.

Meme Coin Attack Results in a $2M Loss, Exploiter Still Holds $1M Worth of Pepe's Best Friend


																The popular on-chain sleuth highlighted in his Telegram channel the latest fraudulent activity that involved an early investor in the Solana-based meme coin – ANDY.
It’s also worth noting that Pepe’s best friend’s price has plummeted by more than 20% in the past day alone.
ZachXBT Investigation of ANDY Drainer
As the graph above demonstrates, the exploiter drained approximately $2 million worth of meme coins on Friday in several transactions. They began swapping half of the illicit profit for ETH almost immediately.
However, the unknown bad actor still holds half of the ill-gotten gains in ANDY. ZachXBT warned ANDY investors to be wary if they see any transactions from this address that belongs to the drainer.
ANDY is one of the latest meme coin sensations, with a current market cap of well over $200 million. It is supposed to be a spin-off of PEPE since it is the webcomic character’s best friend.




As mentioned on the website and in the whitepaper, ANDY aims to be “more than just a meme. It’s a symbol of community, creativity, and the boundless potential of the collective imagination.”
However, its price tumbled following the exploit and amid the market-wide retracement. ANDY has dropped by more than 22% in the past day and now struggles at $0.00022.

AFUE - Prevention: the exchange scam

Scams have always existed, just like it happens with human beings, they evolve. Today we live in a period where this type of risk can come from anywhere. Through the development of my profession, I try to help mitigate the risk, because, often, 0 risk does not exist: for this reason, one can only study and become aware, be careful – possibly always maintain an adequate level of guard – and avoid “looking for” trouble.
Years ago I started offering my know-how and the desire to study to the Association: often I find that unfortunately we look for problems.. and we continue to look for new ones.
This article applies to
who contacts you by phone
who contacts you via email, Whatsapp, Telegram, Facebook, Instagram, … (because, if you start responding to the first contact via email, or another system, the scammer will lure you, build empathy, and subsequently you will start talking on the phone: and what follows applies)
REMEMBER:
YOU are mentally waiting for someone to solve your problem: recovering your lost money.
AND THE SCAMMER KNOWS IT. VERY WELL.
Note Well: the article is long. And it is also boring. But, please, read it to the end, and if necessary, read it again, because it is easy to fall for this scam, while it is difficult (very, if not impossible) to recover your funds once you have sent them in this way to the scammer. I try to make reading easier for you with images and diagrams.
Perhaps not everyone knows that Value, today, is not so much and only tied to currency, but, above all, to Our data. Which we often do not adequately value.
In particular, it can happen to experience a scam, to lose money (a little or a lot, it is subjective).. and suffer the loss. This, mentally, is a “mourning”, which needs to be processed, because it can cause serious and further damage. More serious. It is necessary to learn to accept that loss. Referring to the sentence above, the main problem is the fact that we have “given away” our PERSONAL DATA in addition to the money, that there is a thriving market in the so-called black market, that those who have been scammed will be bombarded with calls from self-styled law firms and others, more or less.. linked to international entities thanks to which our money has been miraculously recovered: these are, all, inevitably, SCAMS.
I write this article in light of yet another development in phone scam: the recommendation is always to read the previous articles in the NEWS section of our site.
Why? Excuse me if I may switch to “tu”:
Because – always remember – there are only 2 (TWO) people who know about the scam you have suffered: YOU.. and the SCAMMER;
Because NO ENTITY, NO LAW FIRM, NO TECHNICIAN will EVER call you to tell you that they have found your money and help you recover it. Whoever calls you is ONLY and ALWAYS a scammer who wants to take more money from you. Accept the fact that NO ENTITY or LAW FIRM or anyone else WILL EVER CALL you. Never. NEVER;
Why someone calls you sayingOf course! Please provide the text you would like translated.
that tells you that they need a sum (bank transfer or cryptocurrency transaction) to unlock them…
HE ONLY WANTS TO SCAM YOU. AGAIN.
Why YOU MUST PSYCHOLOGICALLY ACCEPT that you have lost your money. IF you want to recover it, contact this Association or an accredited law firm to verify IF there are grounds to achieve restitution;
Because, as soon as you understand the meaning of the call, YOU MUST END IT IMMEDIATELY, because the attacker is trying to empathize with you. Every exchange you have with him allows him to obtain useful information to scam you again. He WANTS TO SCAM YOU.
Why never, Never, NEVER, NEVER should you allow a person who called you (meaning YOU did NOT call them), whom you do NOT know, who is NOT referenced, to remotely access your computer.
At the moment this person connects to your computer, THEY HAVE ALL THE TOOLS TO CARRY OUT THEIR SCAM AND DECEIVE YOU.
Your response, when the attacker tells you that they need to connect remotely to your computer is, simply, NO. N-O. Also because you should have ended the call minutes earlier.
An important note: if you have never, fortunately, experienced a financial scam, you might consider what follows as a mix of idiocy and naivety. Try to imagine the state of mind of a person who may be psychologically weak due to the lost money, in financial difficulties because of the scam suffered, who has always been told by investigators that there is no solution… this person is psychologically prostrated, desperate… and receives the call of an ANGEL who can solve the problem! This is the mood.
Let’s now come to the scam. Pay attention because the explanation is boring and technical. You reach this point ONLY IF you haven’t followed the above. It is quite trivial for a computer scientist, unfortunately for the rest of the people it is difficult to understand (when you experience the scam, and when they explain to you how they have stolen more money from you again. Your state of mind is a focal point on which the scammer builds their objective).
If you learn to follow the above advice, you have a good chance of “healing” and avoiding new scams… or at least scams of this type. Let’s go back to the scam experienced by our Associate:
The client receives a call from the scammer, who pretends to be a foreign firm managing an FCA (or other entity) case related to their blocked funds. They are ready to provide (always false) documentation. They can even send their documents (?) to certify how correctly they operate…
How MUST you behave? After a few seconds, you thank, hang up the phone, block the number. If possible, add it to an antispam list.
After some resistance from the Cliente, the attacker (truffatore) manages to deceive and convince them of the goodness of the phone call and its reliability: it is “in cottura”.
How MUST you behave? You are still in time: attack. The scammer has a document ready with all the exceptions that you raise to him, in order to deceive you (I insist on the term, because it is about deception).
The Client’s defenses lower, the scammer manages to obtain the information: the Client makes cryptocurrency purchases on an exchange (fundamental information). He manages to get the name of the exchange in use. He tells him that it confirms what he already knew, that there are funds, IN HIS NAME, EXACTLY ON THE EXCHANGE THAT HE USES, only that they are blocked, that he cannot know! He and only he can show them to him… and explain how to get them. The “cooking” has reached a good point: FINALLY someone has found his money, has found a way to call him, has found a way to solve his problems, frustrations, fears, finally he can repair the roof, get married… It was so EASY!
Try to LIVE this situation, put yourself in the situation (instead of saying it can’t happen to you), listen to your body: you realize that you are getting fatigued, breathing poorly, your heart rate has increased. The scammer has filled you with adrenaline, AND you can’t take it anymore! YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO!!!
How MUST you behave? ATTACK THAT PHONE AND BLOCK THE NUMBER!!!
The Cliente asks how to verify this thing: the truffatore explains that, VERY SIMPLY (this is another key. It’s trivial, you don’t have to do ANYTHING), just let him connect remotely to his computer, so he can show that everything is true: the Cliente is writing the tombstone on more lost money. Risk has reached 95%.
How MUST you behave? You have all the data in hand: they ask to connect to your computer. End the call, block the number. Remember that next time you MUST NOT get here.
The Cliente consents to the remote connection, so as to be able to show what was being explained over the phone. It’s almost over. Bad
How MUST you behave? Try to snap out of the stupor, make up an excuse, the aliens that are taking you away, anything. But, please, end this phone call.
The attacker connects to the PC (N.B. Windows, MAC, or a linux installation, it doesn’t make any difference: the scammers have all the procedures ready to scam you. These people run a business, nothing is improvised. The scammer acts with the goal of taking your money, there is probably also a monthly prize for those who manage to scam the most. You don’t know you are THE PREY)
Now I will explain to you, technically, the scam: it is a technical explanation, boring, I hope I can make you understand everything. Please, try NOT to reach this point. Then I will explain to you WHY THIS TIME IT DIDN’T WORK.
The scammer connects remotely to your computer
He tells you that he is loading a tool to highlight the real situation for you, or something like that. Remember that he is pressing you and now YOU ARE CERTAIN to recover your money THANKS TO HIM. He has you in his grip.
Upload a folder on the desktop. You do not know what is inside. He does.

He asks you which browser you usually use: the one with the green-red-yellow-blue ball, chrome, google!
OK. Open chrome, which you usually use (usually, for convenience, you save your passwords inside, ndr).
Click on the “3 vertical dots” at the top right and click on “Extensions”: it explains that, thanks to the connector of that exchange, which only they have, which is indeed called “Binance”, with the description “Binance Wallet Connector” (maybe you are checking what it is, you are sure not to get scammed again, maybe you also know English…), it is possible to detect those hidden funds blocked in your name. I am attaching the screenshots. In this case, the scam was on this exchange, but, of course, they have everything ready for any other exchange as well.
(obviously the scam can also be configured for other sites: through the answers that YOU have provided him previously, he has everything ready. There are no hitches, and everything is.. simply FANTASTIC)

Create this new connector, connected to the folder that was placed on your desktop. You are calm, because you are checking, they cannot scam you again, and the added connector has the icon of your exchange.



Now everything is ready! Connect to the exchange, and check!
In fact, you connect, go to your wallet, you see your “assets”… and this sum in Bitcoin has appeared! It also shows you the equivalent value. Exceptional!!! This good person whom you did not want to listen to was right! You have more than 82,000 euros in Bitcoin in your account, and you didn’t know it!!
But you CANNOT move them!!! What can you do?!??! Remember: you are now full of adrenaline. YOU WANT THAT MONEY!.

SIMPLE (again, once more, the answer is SIMPLE): just send them a practical management fee (€5,000, €8,000, 10% of the blocked amount…), typically in BTC, USDT, .., rarely by bank transfer, and he will immediately enable your money in the account!! WONDERFUL.
Remember, the voice of the scammer is always FIRM. There is never room for doubt: everything is ready to take more money from you.
BEAUTIFUL TRUE? BUT IF IT’S TOO BEAUTIFUL, TYPICALLY, IT’S NOT TRUE.
Did I manage to capture your attention? Yes? Now I’ll explain two things to you:
How did it end with the Cliente of the truffatore (already our associate)
I explain to you where the scam is, how it works, how to verify that it is a scam. And how to check.. if you want. Please remember that YOU MUST NOT REACH THIS POINT. STOP BEFORE. HANG UP THE CALL IMMEDIATELY AND BLOCK THE NUMBER.
How did it end? THE CLIENT of the SCAMMER (our Associate) WAS NOT SCAMMED! By mistake. Or rather, simply because he did NOT have a congruent amount in his account on the exchange, he did NOT have cryptocurrency ready to make the payment, he did NOT have the required funds to proceed with the transaction. Our Associate told him to get back in touch at a later time.
This is a DEFEAT for the attacker, because they have to let go, the Client “cools down”, and there is a strong risk that they will not be able to complete the scam. The Client-Associate indeed contacted me, asked me how to access that money and, not accepting that it was a scam, I asked to connect to their computer: I showed them how the scam was devised.. so I was able to persuade them that the money did not exist in reality. UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT NOT HAVING THAT MONEY.
Where is the scam and how does it work. And what are the other critical issues.
First of all, the lecture: never let someone connect remotely, especially if you don’t know them and you didn’t seek them out, because they can upload anything to your computer and steal personal information about you. Information of any kind. Any.
It could also load “a program” that steals your data, money, encrypts documents, etc…
In this case, the truffatore has uploaded a folder containing JavaScript code (but you don’t know what it is). Inside in this case there are “only” some parameters that need to be read.
He asked you which browser you use: then he opens the “Extensions” of that browser and “maps”, connects that folder, so that reading those files is enabled, upon the occurrence of certain conditions. As I explained to you above: you are calm, because the name of the exchange is written on the added extension.
And now? Now you are cooked! You log in to your exchange… and “magically” you find that value! But why? Because in the program code, added to your browser extensions, it is written to insert that information into your page when you log in to the exchange. You cannot move or access that money, simply because literally, “it is just a writing” on the page. The exchange you use HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY whatsoever. That is just a writing that you have allowed the scammer to display at your login.

How to verify the scam?
But… how do you verify that it is a scam, in a simple way, if you do not have a background in computer science?
Log in multiple times with your account to the exchange, and you will see that the value in BTC, locked in your account, is always the same (obviously)… but the “countervalue” in euros IS ALWAYS THE SAME. It is impossible, because it should vary almost instantaneously, due to the currency exchanges;
Connect to the same exchange with another account, maybe a new one: you will see EXACTLY the same information. Strange…
Connect to the exchange using your account, but using a different browser from the one you usually use (EDGE, FIREFOX, OPERA, SAFARI, …): you will see that “MAGICALLY” you will no longer see your BTC blocked! Because the scammer has added the extension only on the browser you usually use! v^·´`◆•
Go online and search on the search engine for the value of Bitcoin in euros: there are many tools that allow you to enter the total of your locked BITCOIN (copy and paste what you see on your dashboard). You will notice that the equivalent value in euros is VERY different from what you read on the exchange. This is because the scammer cannot continue to modify the value set in the JavaScript file. (in the next patch of the code, they will fix this bug, also thanks to reading this article. It is quite trivial, but after all, we are only at version 1.0 of the code..)
Precautions
My personal advice, if you have reached this point, would be to close that “burned” account. By now the scammer knows too much about you. If possible, create a new email and make a new registration. You must first cancel your old account. At the very least, change the password and increase the security levels, but you may still encounter many other problems of various kinds.
Sad note
The worst thing is, always, having the awareness that these articles of ours are only an advantage for the truffatore, not for the people we want to protect. Why?
Why does the human mind not accept that all this is a scam and MUST BELIEVE that that money is real
Why these articles are read anyway by “Our Dear Scammer Friends”, who are
always ahead of us, and they use this information to refine the attacks.
Because too often the scammed person who contacts us has already been scammed, maybe they are already Ours
Associated. And for us, this is yet another defeat. Always.
Because while we SURVIVE with “a membership fee,” working for the protection of people, the fraudster “INVOICES” millions in any currency. Tax-free.
What does it mean? That, in addition to getting rich, they have an almost infinite budget to develop new scams.
Please help us help you: when you receive this call, HANG UP IMMEDIATELY and BLOCK THE NUMBER. You work hard to earn your money, they do NOT.
I’ll leave you a scheme to protect and defend yourself from scams: print it and make it yours! I recommend it!

Greetings from Alessandro Vailati Team AFUE!

TRUMP's Ascent and NOT's New Normal


							

Altcoin Sherpa remains bullish on TRUMP, noting its pullback to the .50 fib level as a potential buying opportunity.



Reduced volatility in NOT’s price action leads Altcoin Sherpa to observe a consolidation pattern, suggesting market stability.



TRUMP shows a 4.73% price increase in the last 24 hours, while $NOT displays a more stable trend with decreased volatility.




Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa recently shared on X an analysis of TRUMP’s recent price movements and positioning within Fibonacci retracement levels. He observed that TRUMP has pulled back to the .50 fib level, potentially presenting an attractive entry point for investors.



Sherpa expressed his bullish outlook on TRUMP, especially with the upcoming election period, anticipating increased mainstream media coverage that could positively influence the asset’s price. As of the latest data, TRUMP is trading at $0.062221, with a 24-hour trading volume of 108,796.86. This represents a 4.73% price increase in the last 24 hours, despite a -32.10% decline over the past seven days.







In contrast, Altcoin Sherpa’s perspective on NOT has shifted. He noted a significant reduction in volatility, describing the current price action as a stable consolidation pattern. This suggests that the asset is no longer experiencing the large price swings that previously characterized it.









However, Altcoin Sherpa also cautioned that NOT might test lower Fibonacci levels, such as the 0.50 level, but he did not predict a complete downturn. His recent observations imply a more cautious stance, focusing on the asset’s current consolidation rather than expecting dramatic price movements.







As of today, NOT is trading at $0.0213, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,392,291,736.57. This represents a 3.75% decline in the last 24 hours, yet a 79.94% increase over the past seven days. These figures underscore the diverse trends within the cryptocurrency market.

JPMorgan and Citi Change Their Forecasts on When the Fed Will Cut Interest Rates - Bitcoin Sistemi


Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Economists revised their forecasts for the FED's interest rate cut. These companies, which were among the last few economists to previously predict a rate cut in July, have now changed their expectations.
Citigroup changed its forecasts after the release of stronger-than-expected employment data for May. The bank now predicts that US policymakers will make their first moves in September, while JPMorgan does not foresee any changes until November.


Andrew Hollenhorst, Citigroup's chief U.S. economist, explained the shift in a recent report. “We are shifting our base scenario for the first interest rate cut from July to September,” he said. Despite indicators of a slowing labor market and the U.S. economy, Hollenhorst believes last month's “surprisingly strong employment growth” will cause the Fed to go on hold, awaiting more data on slowing activity and inflation.

Similarly, Michael Feroli, JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist, argued in a report on Friday that the “recent acceleration in job growth” suggests it could take more than three months for the “broader” labor market weakening that the Fed says could require a rate cut to materialize.





Citigroup's new forecast calls for a three-quarter point rate cut in September, November and December this year. This is a change from four previous cut forecasts, one at each Fed policy meeting from July to December. JPMorgan revised its forecast to just one in three discounts this year, followed by one in each quarter next year.
As of this week, at least six other major Wall Street banks were predicting that the Fed would cut interest rates in September, and at least four were predicting that it would cut rates for the first time in December.

XRP, SEC, and disclosures - Here's what this court's ruling means - AMBCrypto



SEC’s Final Rule regarding disclosure requirements vacated by U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
Ripple expects XRP ETF launch and new stablecoin amidst an ongoing legal battle with the SEC

In a recent turn of events, the court has ruled in favor of private fund managers, deciding that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s enhanced regulation for private fund advisers should not be enforced. 
In a recent filing, the SEC adopted a rule to enhance the regulation of private fund advisers to protect investors and prevent fraud. This “Final Rule,” published on August 23, 2023, was set to be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations. 
However, it was challenged by several private fund manager associations and ultimately canceled by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
Impact on the crypto market
The “Final Rule” could have had a major impact on the SEC’s ability to enforce disclosure requirements on crypto firms as well.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler, in a recent interview with CNBC, commented on the importance of the disclosure and said,
“What President Roosevelt did is he created this Commission to oversee that you the investors get the disclosure. And in the crypto markets, they are not giving you that disclosure.”
He went on to say,
“But the disclosure doesn’t necessarily protect a bad actor if they are manipulating a market.”
Commenting on the same, expressing his discontentment with the SEC’s attempt to widen its overreach in the crypto market, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s CLO, took to X and noted, 
“I am once again asking how many tax dollars have been wasted through failed efforts by Gensler’s SEC to expand its jurisdiction beyond what the law allows?”
Here, it’s worth remembering that this update comes at a time when Ripple is already expecting a court decision in their case against the SEC.
XRP ETF next in line?
Despite the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, rumors are circulating about the potential launch of XRP ETFs.
 With the SEC approving Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Ethereum ETFs nearing launch too, many believe the SEC might be adopting a more favorable stance towards cryptocurrencies now. 
Echoing similar sentiments, Ripple CTO Brad Garlinghouse recently noted,
“An XRP ETF is just simply inevitable.”
That’s not all either, with Ripple’s President Monica Long claiming that the company’s highly anticipated stablecoin is likely to debut this year too.

Can XRP Overcome Regulatory Hurdles and Soar? Crypto Lawyer Says Yes


							

XRP’s price continues to underperform despite positive analyst predictions.



Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan remains optimistic, citing increased adoption and regulatory clarity.



Investor sentiment remains cautious due to regulatory uncertainty and Ripple’s XRP sales.




XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple Labs, continues to trade below its September 2018 high of $0.56 despite numerous analyst predictions of a breakout. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan offers a unique perspective on the token’s potential trajectory.







However, Morgan emphasizes that he doesn’t rely on charts to predict an XRP price rise. Instead, he applies the legal standard of the “balance of probabilities.” He believes that, based on recent developments, the price of XRP is more likely to go up than down.



These developments that Morgan attributes, include achieving full legal clarity for the token itself, increasing use in On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), changes to the XRPL protocol facilitating NFTs and automated market makers (AMMs), the steady dilution of Ripple’s XRP holdings, and a steady increase in the circulating supply. 



Despite these encouraging signs, XRP’s price remains unclear. Morgan stated:




“XRP’s price is illogical. If the market increases, I am sure XRP will appreciate in price.”




Despite this optimism, XRP’s price has remained relatively stagnant over the past two weeks, trading between $0.52 and $0.53. This lack of movement has frustrated investors who had hoped for a more dynamic performance.









Further complicating the picture, Ripple recently sold 150 million XRP from its reserves, generating $78 million. Such sales can influence the market in various ways, often depending on liquidity levels and overall market sentiment.







Coin Edition had earlier highlighted the continued uncertainty in regulatory developments as a key factor affecting investor sentiment. Many investors are awaiting clear regulatory guidelines before they can more fully assess XRP’s future prospects.

Bitcoin Tumbles Below $70,000: Jobs Report, ECB Rate Cut Deliver Double Whammy


								Friday delivered a double whammy to the Bitcoin market, exposing the cryptocurrency’s sensitivity to the ever-shifting sands of global economics. The price of the digital asset tumbled below $70,000 after a perplexing US jobs report collided with a surprise interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB).
The leading crypto asset was caught in the crosshairs of conflicting economic signals and central bank maneuvers. The decline exposed the cryptocurrency’s vulnerability to the ever-changing tides of global finance.

Jobs Enigma Jolts Market
A seemingly positive US jobs report, boasting robust job growth, initially buoyed sentiment. However, the joy was short-lived as a concerning rise in unemployment figures to 4% painted a more complex picture. This unexpected twist – growth alongside joblessness – rattled investors, leading to a sell-off in the Bitcoin market.
The mixed signals hinted at a possible “growth-stagflation” scenario, where job creation occurs alongside economic stagnation and inflation. This ambiguity caused some turbulence in the cryptocurrency market, exposing  Bitcoin to increased vulnerability.
Central Bank Chess Game Adds Confusion
Further complicating the situation was the ECB’s surprise interest rate cut. The central bank slashed its benchmark rate from 4% to 3.75%, the first reduction in five years. Traditionally, lower interest rates can make riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive compared to lower-yielding traditional investments.

BTCUSD trading at $69,305 on the 24-hour chart: TradingView.com
However, the positive effect was muted by the negativity stemming from the US jobs report. Until the overall economic outlook clarifies, investors remain hesitant to embrace Bitcoin as a safe haven.
Fed Decision: The Linchpin For Bitcoin’s Future
All eyes now turn to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting in June, considered pivotal for cryptocurrencies‘ immediate future. The central bank’s decision on interest rates will significantly impact the cryptocurrency’s price.
While historically, lower rates have benefited the crypto, concerns about the Fed’s intentions are forcing investors to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Economists are revising their predictions, with some anticipating rate cuts later in the year, while others believe a reduction might come as early as November.

Bitcoin’s Navigational Test
The coming weeks will be a crucial test for Bitcoin’s ability to weather economic storms. The central bank’s decision and the trajectory of the US economy, particularly the unemployment rate, will be critical factors. The ECB’s rate cut could offer some support, but the prevailing economic uncertainty remains a significant challenge. Bitcoin is essentially caught in the crossfire of central bank maneuvers, with the outcome directly impacting its price.

AI Sector Gains Traction Within Crypto Community


Blockchain analytics firm Santiment reports that crypto projects focused on artificial intelligence (AI) might see a rise in token prices due to growing social interest.
CoinMarketCap data corroborates this record-high interest. Trading volumes of digital assets in the AI sector have risen by about 80% in the past day despite the sector’s average decline of 7%.
What is Driving Social Interest in AI Tokens?

The surge in community interest aligns with significant advancements in the AI sector. Notably, Nvidia briefly became the world’s second most valuable publicly traded company, with its market value surpassing $3 trillion. During this period, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that Nvidia’s shares reached record trading levels, often surpassing the combined volume of the top 20 US shares.

Although Nvidia’s stock has since pulled back, the company remains a symbol of investor enthusiasm for AI. Venture capitalist Nic Carter recently described the company as “the most important company in the world today.”

“NVIDIA is posting growth numbers that are almost inconceivable for a company this large. The rally is so significant it appears to be sucking capital out of the rest of the SP500 and other big tech names,” Carter added.

In another noteworthy development, AI startup CoreWeave Inc. made an ambitious attempt to take over Bitcoin miner Core Scientific after the two companies had announced a partnership projected to generate approximately $3.5 billion in revenue. Under this arrangement, Core Scientific will provide 200 megawatts of capacity to power CoreWeave’s graphics processing units.

Additionally, decentralized AI projects Fetch.ai (FET), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), and SingularityNET (AGIX) are planning a merger to form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI). This merger aims to accelerate the development of decentralized AI infrastructure and is set to be completed this month. The combined entity will create a token with an estimated market capitalization of around $6 billion, further drawing community interest.

While the highlighted events are separate and distinct, they underline why AI tokens have generated heightened social volume during the week. Historically, such a level of interest often precedes price gains, and crypto community experts predict that AI-focused project tokens could benefit.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe Says One Solana Rival’s Upward Momentum ‘Inevitable,’ Updates Outlook on Bitcoin - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe believes that one Solana (SOL) challenger may be gearing up to witness a bullish reversal.
Van de Poppe tells his 719,300 followers on the social media platform X that a “new round of upwards momentum seems inevitable” for Sei (SEI).










Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
According to the widely followed crypto analyst, Sei has depreciated by around 70% against Bitcoin (SEI/BTC) since January. Based on Van de Poppe’s chart on the daily timeframe, Sei may find support at 0.0000006 BTC ($0.42).
Sei, which currently has a market cap of around $1.6 billion, is trading at 0.00000768 BTC ($0.543) at time of writing.
Turning to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe says the flagship crypto asset is stuck in a range between $67,800 and an all-time high of about $73,800. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is “heavily ready for a breakout upwards to a new all-time high.”
But if Bitcoin turns bearish, the trader shares a chart showing potential support areas for BTC including $67,789, $60,748 and $56,000.
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
According to Van de Poppe, the bullish catalysts for Bitcoin and other crypto assets will be the easing of monetary policy.
“The European Central Bank decided to cut rates today.
The first Central Bank doing so and I think it’s a matter of time before the Federal Reserve decides to do the same and start quantitative easing again.
It’s the only way out of this economic position.
As a response?
Long crypto, Bitcoin and commodities.”

China On The Verge Of Unbanning Crypto? - Latest Development Sparks Rumor ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
China is close to allowing cryptocurrency ownership again if several recent developments are taken into account. Major crypto exchange Bybit reportedly resumed registration and authentication of crypto users from the country even as the official government stance remains the same.



According to one popular crypto commentator, Cyclops on X, the authoritarian country is close to allowing Bitcoin in the country again. He also made lofty claims regarding the sudden impact on the coin market. As the influencer claims, a major appreciation is expected, but not by 100x.







China’s Blanket Ban on Crypto



China has had a love-hate relationship with the crypto sector since its inception in 2009. The country tolerated the development of the disruptive sector for around a decade, but the digital currency sector was never officially legal in the country. Bitcoin’s allure is considerable, and it has found a way to appeal to Chinese users, who have become one of the biggest adopters of the crypto revolution.



However, following the major altcoin boom of 2017, the country began to crack down against digital currencies. At first, it banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and blacklisted certain exchanges from operating in the country. Before this action by the government, China was the dominant player in the crypto market, with the largest share in BTC mining.



Due to this sudden antagonistic policy towards crypto, the sector has declined ever since. At first, the mining operations slowed considerably before the government banned them entirely in 2021. This led to a major exodus of large miners who eventually found their way to the USA and certain Central Asian countries with cheap electricity.

The Future



China still has a large, enthusiastic crypto community, but virtually everything they do, from using Bitcoin to NFTs to programmable public blockchains, is illegal and punishable by imprisonment. The country’s justice system has dealt an iron hand to several high, low-profile Chinese crypto users, but even that hasn’t stopped them.



Many underground Chinese crypto adopters are waiting for a change in government policy so they can resume their steady commitment to the sector openly instead of operating in the shadows. The recent resumption of registration of Chinese users on the Bybit crypto exchange could result in a reversal of this authoritarian policy.



One idea is to allow mainland Chinese users to invest in crypto via ETFs and crypto exchanges based in Hong Kong, which is part of China but ruled separately. Crypto is legal in Hong Kong. It has spearheaded the development of the digital currency space with several top exchanges like Bitfinex and Binance originating from the nation.

All-time high: Bitcoin average transaction fees at $195 for the first time


    Bitcoin (BTC) trades in a 3-month price range with a yearly low exchange volume and an all-time low on-chain volume. Yet, Bitcoin’s 24-hour average transaction fees reached a new all-time high of $195 on June 8, at block height 847015.



Finbold retrieved data from the mempool.space node showing stats from the last 144 blocks, or approximately 24 hours. Notably, miners received 821.46 BTC, worth $57 million in this period, with an average of 2.5796 BTC per block, worth $179,029.



This drove the daily average transaction fee on the Bitcoin network to 281,030 sats, or $195. Sats refer to the smallest BTC unit, named after the cryptocurrency creator Satoshi Nakamoto.







Essentially, current data means that the last 144 Bitcoin blocks only included transactions with this average extra payout to miners.

Bitcoin average transaction fees historical data



Putting in perspective, the network reached a previous high of $127.97 per transaction on April 20, during the halving. Before that, the network saw average fees above $60 for the first time in April 2021, during the bull cycle.

On June 7, data from BitInfoCharts shows a daily peak at $83.74 per transaction. Interestingly, Vini Barbosa registered a previous average of $65.76 at 10 pm UTC, in a post on X.







At current average transaction fees, millions of addresses and Bitcoin users can not spend their coins, which is considered dust.



All-time low on-chain transaction volume



On June 2, Finbold reported a different record for the Bitcoin network, when spot trading and on-chain transaction volume plummeted, while ETFs and derivatives dominated the BTC market interest for speculative demand.



Data from Santiment shows an all-time low 7-day transaction volume of 474,000 BTC and a fading spot trading volume.

OKX consolidation spiral



Notably, Bitcoin on-chain analysts have spotted a UTXO consolidation spiral from the crypto exchange OKX.







According to multiple sources, the recent average transaction fee hike on Bitcoin was caused by this activity, with OKX outbidding itself while paying higher fees for each transaction.



Technically, Bitcoin fees increase when there is more demand for a limited space on its blockchain. Thus, users compete and outbid each other to convince miners to increase their transactions in the next block. The more congested and demanded the Bitcoin network is, the higher the fees can go.



The BTC protocol is currently intentionally designed to have a small block size and a 10-minute time interval between each block. Other cryptocurrencies solve the fee issues in different ways. For example, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) increased the block size, Litecoin (LTC) diminished the block interval, Monero (XMR) mixed both, and Nano (XNO) securely removed fees from the equation.



As Bitcoin fees now reach an unprecedented value in dollars and the risks of a sell-off become imminent, the market awaits to see if the demand for block space will drop and the average cost will follow to lower levels.

During Yesterday's Downturn, an Altcoin Foundation May Have Dumped a Significant Amount of Coins - Bitcoin Sistemi


During the major cryptocurrency market decline yesterday, the transactions made by the developer foundation behind an altcoin became a subject of discussion.
According to Onchain data, as soon as the Ethereum price started to fall last night, 15,254 ETH coins worth $ 56.1 million began to be transferred from a cryptocurrency wallet linked to the Ethereum Foundation to the central cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.


This amount seems high even for an altcoin with a huge market cap like Ethereum.
However, the ETH tokens in the wallet that made the transfer in question were sent by the Ethereum Foundation, and in addition, a wallet that received 200 thousand ETH in Ethereum's initial coin offering (ICO) also sent ETH to the address in question.






The decline experienced last night came after the sudden decline in gold as a result of China ending the gold purchasing series that it had been continuing for months, and in addition to the huge decline experienced by memecoins in the live broadcast of the trader named RoaringKitty to approximately 500 thousand people.
After the decline in which the Bitcoin price saw below $69,000, BTC currently seems to be stable around $69,000. If there is another rise to the level of $ 71,000 before the decline, a short position of approximately $ 1.3 million will be liquidated from the market.

NYSE Spin-Off Bakkt Seeks New Path After Financial Struggles


							

Bakkt Holdings is considering a potential sale or breakup amidst an increase in crypto-related acquisition activities.



The platform has been discussing with an advisor regarding the move, though a final decision is still pending.



In a recent development, Bakkt partnered with Crossover Markets to power its BakktX.




New York Stock Exchange spin-off Bakkt Holdings is exploring a potential sale or breakup after a period of increased activity in crypto acquisitions. The platform is working with a financial advisor to evaluate its strategic options, though a final decision remains unannounced.



Bakkt’s 2018 launch generated significant buzz, with partnerships announced alongside industry titans Starbucks and Microsoft. However, the company has since faced challenges, including the threat of delisting from the NYSE in 2024 due to financial concerns.



Despite going public in 2021 via a merger with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), Bakkt reported a substantial first-quarter loss of $21 million in 2021, despite generating $885 million in revenue.



In a positive development, Bakkt secured regulatory approval in early 2024 to sell up to $150 million in securities. According to a company statement:




“This registration statement allows Bakkt, so long as it is effective, to raise up to an aggregate of $150 million of capital in one or more offerings over the subsequent three years. If Bakkt decides to raise capital in a future offering using such registration statement, Bakkt will describe the specific details of that future offering in a prospectus supplement that is filed with the SEC.”










Recent projections from Bakkt Holdings forecast revenues between $2 billion and $5 billion for 2024. These figures, if achieved, could significantly improve the platform’s financial health.



Looking ahead, Bakkt recently partnered with Crossover Markets to provide technology for its upcoming crypto Electronic Communication Network (ECN), “BakktX.” Ray Kamrath, Bakkt’s Chief Commercial Officer, highlighted the partnership’s significance: “With the development of BakktX, we are positioning ourselves as a preferred partner for institutions seeking a compliant, qualified trading venue.”

Meme Coins Plummet Post Roaring Kitty Live Stream


Shares of GameStop plummeted nearly 40% following the announcement of a substantial stock sale intended to raise up to $3 billion. This development coincided with a rare livestream from Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” who played a pivotal role in the 2021 meme stock frenzy. 
Gill’s broadcast, his first in three years, attracted significant attention and also notably impacted the crypto market, particularly meme coins.
Roaring Kitty Stream Impacts Meme Coin Prices

In tandem with the stock market reaction, meme coins experienced a significant decline. Dogecoin (DOGE) fell by 7.4%, Shiba Inu (SHIB) by 6.4%, and Pepe (PEPE) by a notable 10.7%. Other meme coins, including Dogewhifhat (WIF) and Floki (FLOKI), each dropped by 12.7%, while Bonk (BONK) declined by 10.3%.
Gill’s livestream drew over 600,000 viewers at its peak, according to YouTube metrics. During the broadcast, he expressed confidence in GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen’s ability to revitalize the business and disclosed his GME position. 

“What can I say about GameStop? I mean, the funny thing is that I have a lot of the same feelings about everything. They’re in the transformation stage here… I feel like I see enough. I believe [CEO Ryan Cohen] might be able to do it,” Gill said. 

However, Gill cautioned his audience about the risks associated with his aggressive investment style, warning that followers could potentially “lose it all.” 

“It remains to be seen. You should keep your eye on stuff, too, reserve the right to change your mind just like I do. Don’t follow anyone blindly,” Gill oncluded.

During Friday’s trading session, GameStop shares were halted multiple times, reflecting the intense volatility. Investors exchanged over $8 billion worth of GameStop shares by early afternoon, making it the second most traded stock on Wall Street, behind Nvidia, according to LSEG data.
Before the live stream, GameStop shares had surged 50% on June 6 after Roaring Kitty teased the broadcast on YouTube. The anticipation and market activity spilled over to the crypto markets, with meme coins like Brett (BRETT) and GME Token (GME) rising 27.88% and 138.74%, respectively, on that day.

OKX Backlog Snarls Bitcoin Transactions, Fees Surge


							

OKX wallet consolidation transactions contribute to severe Bitcoin network congestion, causing fees to spike to $52.



Over 330,000 Bitcoin transactions remain unconfirmed, with memory usage peaking at 1.35 GB amid ongoing network congestion.



Network congestion worsened by recent Bitcoin halving and power outages in major mining hubs, affecting transaction times.




A backlog of user wallet consolidation transactions on cryptocurrency exchange OKX is causing significant congestion on the Bitcoin network.



Mempool founder @mononautical reports that OKX has nearly 1,000 unconfirmed transactions remaining, totaling over 42 million virtual bytes and incurring fees exceeding 57 bitcoin (BTC).



This represents a recovered value of approximately 730 BTC. Consequently, OKX faces a delay of roughly 70 blocks before the mempool returns to normal processing speeds. The fee surge triggered by OKX’s activity is reflected in the uniform strata of the mempool chart.







Wu Blockchain also reported a surge in Bitcoin network fees to 520 sat/vbyte, indicating network congestion around $52 per transaction. This congestion stems from OKX’s sorting and collection of user wallets. The network currently holds over 330,000 unconfirmed transactions, with memory usage reaching 1.35 GB.







OKX began processing wallet transactions starting from block 846,867. They have processed over 2,380 transactions with an average fee rate of 246.65 sat/vbyte. This process incurred a cost of 254.28 BTC, or roughly $17.6 million at today’s Bitcoin price of $69,270.00.



Bitcoin’s trading volume is $35,151,790,533, reflecting a decrease of 2.85% in the last 24 hours. This effort, driven by an inefficient automated system, has resulted in internal bidding wars and inflated Bitcoin network fees.









Beyond OKX’s issues, the Bitcoin ecosystem faces additional challenges contributing to high transaction fees. The recent halving event, which reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, has impacted miner profitability. This reduction has led to a decline in mining activity, with the network experiencing its largest daily hash rate drop since November 2017. 



Power outages in major Chinese mining hubs have further exacerbated this problem, causing longer transaction times and increased competition for transaction processing.

Bloomberg Analyst Seyffart Talks About the Possibility of a Solana Spot ETF - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bloomberg Intelligence Research Analyst James Seyffart offered an inside look at the unexpected approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in an exclusive interview with Kitco News Chief Anchor and Editor-in-Chief Michelle Makori.
As the conversation progressed, Makori highlighted industry buzz around the possibility of a Solana ETF. He cited recent comments from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse suggesting Solana and Ripple's XRP could be among those next in line for ETF approval.


Seyffart reiterated his pre-approval views that a Bitcoin ETF would come before an Ethereum ETF and that there would be a significant delay before other cryptocurrencies see similar approvals.
“The SEC has no problem calling Solana a security at this time,” Seyffart said, pointing to ongoing lawsuits involving Kraken and Coinbase in which Solana was specifically mentioned. He noted that the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities is a critical hurdle for ETF approval.






Even if Solana is ultimately deemed a commodity, another major challenge remains: the SEC's requirement for a market that can be effectively monitored to prevent fraud and manipulation. Current Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs rely on CME futures for this purpose, and this structure is not currently available for Solana.
Despite current political and regulatory dynamics, Seyffart predicts a Solana ETF is unlikely to happen before 2026.

Brace for bullish continuation; Crypto sell-off seen as quick shakeout


    The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant sell-off after unexpected U.S. employment data showed 272,000 new jobs in May, far exceeding the estimated 185,000. 



This suggests the economy is handling higher interest rates well, reducing the likelihood of rate cuts, which impacts investments in cryptocurrencies.



Additionally, GameStop (NYSE: GME) share price fell by 40% after the company reported a $32.3 million loss on $882 million in revenue and announced plans to sell $175 million in shares, adding to market uncertainty.







Bitcoin (BTC) saw a sharp drop from its two-month high near $72,000. According to CoinMarketCap data, the entire cryptocurrency market saw a downtrend.



The market plunge led to $411.05 million in liquidations, with the largest single order of $409.51 million on the crypto exchange OKX. Of this, $56.8 million were long Bitcoin positions. 



Traders are now hedging their bets, anticipating further price declines. If Bitcoin returns to $71,000, it could wipe out $1.40 billion in short positions, indicating futures traders expect continued volatility.

Opportunities amid liquidations



Despite the downturn, some traders view the sell-off as a brief shakeout rather than a prolonged bearish trend. 



Pseudonymous crypto trader il Capo of Crypto described the market reaction as a “shakeout,” a period where investors quickly sell off assets due to uncertainty.







This sentiment was echoed by other analysts who pointed to significant liquidations in Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) futures as a potential silver lining. 







This leverage flush could set the stage for a more stable market as speculative positions are cleared out. 



Analysts are closely watching key support levels to gauge the market’s next move. The monthly open around $67,500 is seen as a crucial level for Bitcoin to maintain its bullish bias.



Analyst Predictions: Buying opportunity amid the dip



Despite the current volatility, some market experts believe this dip represents a buying opportunity.



Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, highlighted the mixed nature of the employment data and suggested that the next  Consumer Price Index (CPI) report could be pivotal. If CPI year-on-year is 3.3% or lower, it will likely push Bitcoin to new all-time highs.



Pseudonymous trader Kaleo also remains optimistic, suggesting the market’s peak is still far off.



Similarly, trader Jelle saw the market dip as a minor setback before a potential rebound, indicating a quick turnaround trade. At press time BTC was changing hands at $69,364.00.



As traders and investors navigate this turbulent period, the broader sentiment leans towards a bullish continuation, with the recent sell-off viewed as a temporary shakeout rather than a sustained downturn.

Crypto Correction or Buying Opportunity? Analysts Weigh In


							

Bitcoin drops 5% below $69K as the crypto market experiences a downturn.



Solana-based meme coins like Dogwifhat, BONK, and BOME suffer over 15% losses.



Analysts, including Capo Of Crypto and Michaël van de Poppe, view the dip as a healthy correction with the potential for a strong rebound.




A broad sell-off swept through cryptocurrency markets as of press time, wiping out recent gains for many digital assets. Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, fell below the key psychological barrier of $71,000, reaching a daily low of $68,507. This represents a roughly 5% decline from its intraday peak of $71,918.



Altcoins, particularly volatile meme coins, suffered even steeper losses. Solana-based meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF), for example, plummeted over 15%. Other prominent Solana meme tokens like BONK and BOME experienced similar declines within the same 24-hour window.



However, some analysts remain optimistic. Pseudonymous crypto influencer Capo Of Crypto, in a recent post, downplayed concerns about the dip. He highlighted the intense selling pressure pushing prices towards support zones.



While acknowledging the heavier losses in altcoins, he interprets this as a potential market shakeout. If support levels hold, Capo Of Crypto suggests the market could resume its bullish trajectory soon.













His analysis also acknowledges potential downside risks, with Bitcoin possibly testing the $65,000 level. Despite this, Capo Of Crypto maintains a bullish outlook, projecting Bitcoin to reach new all-time highs between $74,000 and $76,000 soon. This optimistic forecast implies a near 9.2% rebound for Bitcoin.



Other analysts, like Michaël van de Poppe, echo this bullish sentiment. They view the recent dip as a healthy correction and anticipate a more substantial rebound in the near future.

Crypto Community Torn Over ‘Bonk Guy’ Who Wants To Emulate Roaring Kitty - The Defiant

Memecoin trader Unipcs wants to ride his tokens to $1 billion.Some call it lame, while others say it's just a “loser in our own community buying the top.” Many are rooting for him, however.A new character has emerged onto the crypto scene, trying to emulate the success of famed financial analyst turned meme stock investor Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty.Who is Unicps, also known as ‘Bonk Guy’?Unipcs made waves recently when he posted, “the consensus take is that Roaring Kitty & $GME is done, right?”Unipcs claimed that instead of selling, he decided to hold his Roaring Kitty-related memecoins. And apparently, it's been playing out.‘Bonk Guy’ reappeared yesterday. “I'm up 7 figures on the Roaring Kitty meta today i.e. $GME, $AMC, & $KITTY memes on Solana while many fudded Kitty, I diamond handed & bought more, and I publicly documented my conviction,” he wrote.His results have some calling him the Roaring Kitty of crypto – a tag that has split the crypto community down the middle.Roaring Kitty Roars BackKeith Gill became famous in February 2021 when a defiant group of traders from Reddit decided to start buying up shares of the video game franchise GameStop.Their goal was to “stick it to the man.”Wall Street Bets members drove up GameStop's stock price, disrupting major hedge funds in what’s known as a short squeeze. In such a situation, traders betting against a stock are forced to close their positions or risk liquidation.The share price reached a high of $483 but subsequently crashed. Gill went quiet in the years that followed until a surprise post on X on May 12 kicked markets into gear again. Even though it didn’t mention GameStop directly, the stock doubled overnight.Then, crickets. Gill went radio silent for weeks, but the rumors were swirling. Was Roaring Kitty back, and more importantly, what might it mean for a crypto market inundated with memecoins?On June 2, Roaring Kitty reappeared again, this time with an enigmatic image of a UNO card, followed by a message posted by Gill’s Reddit account. He posted a screenshot titled “GME YOLO Update,” which showed a $200 million position in GameStop.The stock nearly doubled. And today, he returned to YouTube after nearly three years away. His first livestream drew in 700,000 viewers.And in what might be one of the strangest moments in this market cycle, CNBC broadcasted that Gill’s livestream was “28 minutes late” but had begun nonetheless.Crypto’s Roaring KittyWhile Gill has made a name for himself as a memecoin investor and a “man of the people,” his crypto copycat has struggled to rally supporters – even though he does have some.“Crypto so lame compared to tradfi bros we have bonk guy tryna do the same thing roaringkitty doing with gamestop & half the timeline starts hating on him,” posted Solana-based memecoin investor Zion Thomas, also known as Ansem.Ansem was met with resistance by other crypto pundits.“Isn’t the difference that the 'loser' in the GME scenario is perceived to be hedge funds positioned short,” asked veteran crypto investor Cobie. “So supporting RK is a community 'sticking it to the man' or outsiders, and he is a rallying cry for the little guy to team up against those interests. Whereas the loser in the Bonk scenario is just someone in our own community who buys the top?”BONK plummeted today amid the controversy.The token dropped 12% but still commands a $1.8 billion market cap, up nearly 20,000% since September 2023.BONK PriceMemecoin mania shows no signs of slowing down.Trump has seen his bags balloon thanks to crypto enthusiasts sending him a hoard of TROG tokens, while musician Iggy Azalea’s memecoin MOTHER skyrocketed to a $200 million market cap today. Other notable celebrities like Caitlyn Jenner have caught the brunt of memecoin scammers but ultimately continue to play the game.

Bitcoin Is on the Cusp of a ‘Historic Breakout,’ According to Crypto Analyst - Here’s What He Means - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst believes Bitcoin (BTC) may be just days away from an explosive rally based on historic precedence.
Pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 475,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could soon enter a phase of the market cycle that in 2020 and 2021 saw massive gains.










“Bitcoin is on the cusp of a historic breakout.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
The analyst says if Bitcoin confirms a breakout into the historic “parabolic phase” of the cycle, it will have come earlier than in past cycles.
“Bitcoin could soon make history. Not just because a breakout from this re-accumulation range would enable price to enter the parabolic phase of the cycle. But also because it would be the fastest post-halving re-accumulation breakout of all time.” 
The analyst also believes a parabolic Bitcoin would send altcoins soaring as a result of increased market liquidity.
“A BTC breakout would inject necessary capital into the entire crypto market, fueling a Q2 altcoin hype cycle.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
Bitcoin is trading for $69,208 at time of writing, down more than 1% in the last 24 hours.
The analyst also weighs in on dogwifhat (WIF). He warns if WIF fails to hold a key trendline as support, it could signal the end of the memecoin’s bullish trend.
“This technical uptrend has supported price since early March and is the most important trendline for WIF at this time; this diagonal needs to continue holding to ensure the technical uptrend remains intact. This trendline has been revisited every time WIF has either failed to break the blue level [at $3.04] as resistance or most recently, when WIF failed to retest the blue level as support.”

WIF is trading for $2.93 at time of writing, down 9.27% in the last 24 hours.

This Week in Coins: Bitcoin and Ethereum Pump-Then Dump-Amid Roaring Kitty Rush - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.Bitcoin and crypto investors received a lot of good news this week, even though the market still can’t manage to break free from its highs three months ago.On Tuesday, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs absorbed net inflows of $887 million—the second-best daily performance for the ETFs to date. The price of Bitcoin surged above $71,000 in the process, reaching its highest price since March.That performance was followed by not one, but two high-profile Bitcoin ETF sponsors assuring investors that a second, much larger wave of institutions was coming to buy Bitcoin through the funds. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan wrote in a memo that crypto regulatory progress on Capitol Hill was untapped “alpha” for investors, while Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson said the ETFs had only been touched by their “first wave of the early adopters.”And at least in the memecoin world, the bull market appeared to be back in full swing. Bitcoin’s very first BRC-20 token, ORDI, surged by over 30% to $60 as of Friday, while PUPS and Bitcoin Wizards (WZRD) more than doubled in value intraweek, according to CoinGecko data.Other more popular memecoins like PEPE, BONK, and SHIB weren’t as lucky, all posting losses this week.The Solana-based meme coin GME seriously spiked, blasting up 467% at its height this week, building on the momentum of its stock market namesake Gamestop (GME). Meme influencer Roaring Kitty—who sparked the Wall Street-confounding GameStop movement back in 2021—gave the stock a second wind with his surprise returns to both YouTube and live streaming, with his net worth briefly edging toward $1 billion—before a Friday cold shower from the game retailer.Performance-wise, between Bitcoin and meme coins is Ethereum, which kept pace with Bitcoin’s gains this week as its progressed toward a spot ETF launch. VanEck analysts posted a lengthy report arguing that ETH will reach $22,000 per unit by 2030, after sucking away financial market share from Apple, Google, and big banks.Finally, with both the Bank of Canada and European Central Bank lowering interest rates this week, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes told followers that it was officially time to start apeing into Bitcoin and shitcoins.Yet his call may have been a tad premature: at the end the week, a liquidation cascade on Friday sent Bitcoin crashing from $71,000 to $68,000, and ETH down from $3,800 to $3,600. Meanwhile, GME—both the stock and the memecoin—cratered by over 35% each.Bitcoin is trading for $69,335 as of writing, while Ethereum is priced at $3,686. The price of the GME meme coin has once again settled near $0.014.Prices current as of 3am ET on June 8, 2024.

ChatGPT-4o predicts Bitcoin's price if a recession hits in H2 2024


    Speculation about a potential U.S. recession in 2024 has been rampant, with several indicators pointing to this possibility. 



In such a scenario, various financial assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), will likely be affected, considering the asset has shown susceptibility to events in traditional finance.



Notably, Bitcoin has yet to be tested in a recessionary environment, so its performance will be closely watched. Therefore, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s latest artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o, for insights on how Bitcoin might trade during a recession.







Factors affecting Bitcoin in a recession 



The AI tool highlighted several factors that could impact Bitcoin’s price. ChatGPT-4o noted that some have historically perceived Bitcoin as “digital gold” or a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty.



If this perception persists, demand for Bitcoin could increase during a recession, driving its price up. However, during extreme financial stress, the AI platform noted that investors might prefer liquidating assets, including Bitcoin, to cover losses or secure cash, potentially driving its price down.



Central banks might also implement quantitative easing or lower interest rates to counteract a recession, leading to higher liquidity in the market. This could boost Bitcoin’s price as more money enters the financial system. Bitcoin might attract investors seeking an inflation hedge if inflation is high, further pushing its price up.



The regulatory environment will also play a crucial role. Positive regulatory developments could enhance Bitcoin’s appeal as an investment, increasing its price, while negative regulatory actions could suppress its price, even amid a recession. Increased institutional adoption could also support Bitcoin’s price during economic downturns.



Lastly, market dynamics, such as Bitcoin’s supply and overall cryptocurrency market trends, will influence its price.



Bitcoin price prediction 



Based on the identified factors, ChatGPT-4o outlined three potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s price in the second half of 2024 in the event of a recession.



In a bullish scenario, if Bitcoin is perceived as a safe-haven asset, inflation is high, and monetary policy is accommodative, Bitcoin’s price could rise significantly, potentially reaching $80,000 to $100,000 or higher, depending on the recession’s severity and the reaction of traditional financial markets.



In a bearish scenario, if investors seek liquidity, face regulatory crackdowns, or if there’s a broad sell-off in risk assets, Bitcoin’s price could decline from $50,000 to $60,000 or lower, depending on the extent of the sell-off.



Elsewhere, in a neutral scenario, Bitcoin might trade within a range if the recession’s impact is moderate and the factors influencing Bitcoin’s price balance each other out. In this situation, Bitcoin could hover around $65,000 to $75,000.

Bitcoin untested during a recession 



In line with Bitcoin’s possible reaction to a potential recession, investment research platform Game of Trades highlighted that Bitcoin remains heavily influenced by broader economic cycles, as evidenced by its close relationship with the ISM Manufacturing PMI.



In an X (formerly Twitter) post on June 7, the experts warned that a potential recession in the second half of 2024 could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price. This caution stems from the fact that Bitcoin has not yet been extensively tested in such an economic environment, leaving its future performance amid a recession uncertain.

Bitcoin price analysis



By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $69,350 with daily losses of about 2.6%. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is up 2.61%.

In the meantime, Bitcoin continues to consolidate below the $70,000 mark, and breaching this level will be central to helping the crypto target new highs.

BRICS Nations Mull Blockchain Payments, XRP Floated as Option


							

Vladimir Putin confirmed BRICS is working to develop an independent payment system.



The group will most likely use XRP for cross-border payments.



Analysts think XRP could rally to $10,000 if the group archives its plan.




Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that the BRICS group is developing an independent payment system to reduce reliance on existing systems. A document from the Russian Central Bank suggests the group may consider using XRP for cross-border transactions.







Putin emphasized the BRICS nations’ goal of creating a payment system free from political influence and external control. He noted the group’s expansion in 2024 with the addition of Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Egypt, and Ethiopia. Putin also highlighted the significant growth in the BRICS’ combined global GDP after these additions, pushing it to 36%. He also expressed openness to welcoming new members from various continents.



A research paper suggests the BRICS group might utilize XRP, associated with Ripple, to facilitate cross-border payments. This aligns with the Bank of Russia’s exploration of the Ripple payment system for similar purposes.



XRP’s reputation for speed and low transaction fees makes it a strong candidate for the BRICS’ new payment system. If adopted, such a move could significantly increase XRP adoption and boost its market value.









Cryptonairz CEO Robert Doyle (Crypto Sensei) predicts a substantial price increase for XRP if the BRICS nations adopt it for cross-border payments. Doyle suggests XRP could reach $10,000 if the group successfully implements its plan.







Analysts believe using XRP as an alternative to the U.S. dollar could offer advantages for BRICS nations. XRP adoption could potentially mitigate the currency volatility challenges faced by developing countries within BRICS.

Crypto Chaos: 70% of Dead Korean Exchanges Leave Investors High and Dry


								Investors in South Korea’s booming cryptocurrency market are facing a digital dust storm after a shocking revelation by financial regulators. A joint study by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) and the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) found that a staggering 70% of shuttered crypto exchanges left their customers hanging, failing to return invested funds.





The Hidden Risks Of Lesser-Known Coins







This news comes as a gut punch to over 6 million Koreans, roughly 10% of the population, who have dipped their toes into the crypto pool. Unlike their global counterparts, Korean investors are known to dabble in riskier, lesser-known cryptocurrencies in addition to established names like Bitcoin.



The report paints a grim picture of the industry’s practices. Many of these defunct exchanges didn’t even bother to warn users before pulling the plug, leaving them scrambling to salvage their investments. Even in cases where some form of notification was issued, the withdrawal process was described as an “extreme inconvenience” with a skeleton crew tasked with handling a potentially overwhelming number of claims.


Stern Warning To CEOs
The FSS is scrambling to shore up trust in the digital asset market. They’ve pledged to work closely with other financial watchdogs to develop stricter regulations for closing down financial firms, particularly crypto exchanges. They’ve also issued a stern warning to CEOs of digital asset service providers, reminding them to comply with the upcoming Virtual Asset Investor Protection Law, set to take effect in July.
While the potential for high returns is undeniable, the risks associated with a largely unregulated market are becoming increasingly apparent. As the FSS wrestles with crafting a regulatory lasso, Korean crypto investors would be wise to tread cautiously, or risk getting caught in the next digital stampede.
BTC is now trading at $69,328. Chart: TradingView
Police Bust South Korean Scammers
Adding to the chaos, South Korean law enforcement recently arrested 19 individuals connected to a deceptive “crypto reading room” scam that defrauded over 300 investors of $19 million. Operating on platforms like Telegram, the gang posed as crypto experts to lure victims with promising tips and fake endorsements.

They used fake apps linked to bogus exchanges, enticing victims with initial gains before imposing fabricated “withdrawal fees” and cutting off communication. The investigation also uncovered a disturbing recruitment tactic called “pig-butchering,” where victims were promised jobs in Myanmar but were forced into the fraudulent operation upon arrival.

Satoshi Mystery: Ripple CTO Makes Unexpected Remark

In response to an X post, Ripple CTO David Schwartz offers his take on the recent legal developments involving Craig Wright, an Australian Computer Scientist who has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.In the latest twist in the Craig Wright v. COPA case, the Crypto Open Patent Alliance has demanded that Craig Wright pay 85% of its legal costs. COPA took Wright to court in February to determine whether he was Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Judge James Mellor, the case's presiding judge, decided in March that Wright was not Satoshi and did not author the Bitcoin whitepaper.In response to COPA's request, Wright's defense argued that not specifying the perimeters within which Wright can claim to be Satoshi could infringe on his human rights. This argument posed by Wright's defense has sparked a fresh debate in the crypto community, with many labeling it as outright fraud. However, Schwartz presents a nuanced perspective on the matter.According to Schwartz, the act of Wright claiming to be Satoshi in casual conversations, where there is no direct intention to gain monetarily, might not constitute fraud. This distinction draws a line between personal claims and those made with the intent to deceive for financial gain.Schwartz suggests that a potential legal remedy could be an injunction that would prevent Wright from leveraging any claim to the Satoshi identity to obtain something of value. Such a measure would aim to protect the community and the market from any misleading assertions that could influence financial decisions.Judge Mellor concluded in his written judgment in late May that the subject of injunctive relief — a legal remedy to prevent a defendant from doing something — will be debated at a Form of Order hearing scheduled after the verdict is handed down.In response to COPA's recent request, Wright's defense has requested that the amount he pays be reduced to 70% of the costs COPA incurred. As the legal drama unfolds, the cryptocurrency community awaits the next outcome.

‘Dumb Money’: Should You Watch the Roaring Kitty Flick as GameStop Fever Returns? - Decrypt

Close followers of GameStop bull trader Roaring Kitty (aka Keith Gill) and the 2021 meme stock/short squeeze saga will already know the ending of last year’s “Dumb Money” from the start: He gives one last signoff on his popular YouTube livestream and stops posting online, potentially forever, following a few extremely crazy months of being in the spotlight.But the ending didn’t stick. After three years of inactivity, Roaring Kitty returned last month and started posting memes on Twitter, followed by Reddit posts about his GameStop (GME) stock position. On Friday, he reemerged on YouTube for the first time since that 2021 signoff, confirming that he’s still alive—and that he was not, in fact, the actor who portrayed him in the film.“I’m definitely not Paul Dano,” he said Friday. “I still haven’t seen that movie. I’ve seen some clips.”Roaring Kitty’s story clearly has not concluded. While the price of GME dipped Friday following his return stream, the trader still holds an enormous position between both stock and options. And his YouTube comeback helped assuage concerns that someone had hacked or taken over his accounts, or that his tweets and posts had just been a big goof.But if, like Roaring Kitty, you still haven’t seen the star-studded biopic based on his 2020-2021 rise and the broader GameStop meme stock phenomenon, should you bother watching “Dumb Money” now that we're watching a sequel unfold in real-time?Definitely. I watched the film for the first time this week via Netflix, just hours before Roaring Kitty’s YouTube return, and it still paints a compelling and entertaining picture of his personality and trading mindset—and can serve as a useful starting point to catch people up as the real-world saga continues.Based on 2021’s “The Antisocial Network” by Ben Mezrich, author of an earlier book that inspired the film “The Social Network,” “Dumb Money” not only tells the story of Roaring Kitty and his big bet on GameStop but also the Wall Street firms that got dragged into the short squeeze and several of the retail traders who rallied around the meme stock.It paints a well-rounded and compassionate picture of Gill as a financial analyst who has developed this outlandish thesis about the downtrodden video game retailer being undervalued. He takes it to the masses via a livestream filled with catchphrases and cat imagery. Before long, Gill’s unexpected revolution is threatening the Wall Street giants.Dano is a celebrated actor, and he captures a lot of the nuance of Gill that we saw in his hours-long livestreams, although the “Fablemans” actor can’t quite match the manic energy of the real deal. Given Gill’s own wild performance Friday, I can’t blame Dano for falling a bit short of recreating that magnetic, live-streamed allure.Pete Davidson and Paul Dano (from left) in "Dumb Money." Image: Sony PicturesHe’s complemented by a large ensemble cast that includes Seth Rogen, America Ferrera, Nick Offerman, Shailene Woodley, and Pete Davidson.Rogen and Offerman portray prominent hedge fund managers Gabe Plotkin and Ken Griffin, respectively—and while not in the comedic roles we typically know those actors from, the film sharply characterizes them as out-of-touch elites through their lavish spending and callous disregard for retail traders. (The real-life Griffin wasn’t very happy about it.)Nick Offerman and Seth Rogen (from left) in "Dumb Money." Image: Sony Pictures“Dumb Money” keeps a lively pace, even as director Craig Gillespie tries to cram too much into roughly 100 minutes. There are a lot of threads being pulled here, and the retail investor stories sometimes feel excessive—not to mention overly dramatic. By the time the meme stock trend explodes, “Dumb Money” has to rush to fit in the rest of the big headline-grabbing events without overstaying its welcome.Even so, “Dumb Money” provides a nuanced and approachable retelling of the chaotic saga. It’s a cohesive recap that balances Roaring Kitty’s big personality with a more human edge, all while keeping things lightweight and entertaining enough for viewers who aren’t financial experts.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bakkt Weighs Sale or Breakup Amid Crypto Industry Recovery


Bakkt Holdings Inc., the crypto trading and custody platform launched by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) parent, is reportedly exploring potential sale or breakup options.
This consideration emerges amid a spike in crypto-related takeover activity.
Evaluating Bakkt’s Financial Health and Future

The company has engaged a financial advisor to evaluate various strategic paths, including a potential breakup. However, a final decision has yet to be made, and Bakkt could remain independent. A representative for Bakkt declined to comment on the matter.
This development follows significant leadership changes at Bakkt. In March, Bakkt appointed a new CEO and president amid facing the risk of being delisted from the NYSE for failing to meet listing requirements.

Andy Main, a board member since Bakkt’s public listing in 2021, took over from Gavin Michael. Michael stepped down to pursue other opportunities but will serve as an advisor through March 2025.

“Andy has the expertise to lead the company forward from this inflection point, with a focus on broadening our institutional crypto capabilities, growing our client base, expanding internationally, and driving towards adjusted EBITDA breakeven,” Michael said.

In February, Bakkt faced liquidity difficulties and sought permission from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to increase capital by up to $150 million over three years. The company also plans a reverse stock split to improve financial performance. Bakkt raised $40 million through a private placement to institutional investors and an additional $10 million to bolster its capital.

Despite these efforts, Bakkt reported a first-quarter loss of $1.86 per share, better than the expected loss of $2.08. The company posted a first-quarter loss of $21 million on $855 million in revenue. These financial challenges highlight the urgency for Bakkt to explore strategic alternatives.

Additionally, crypto miner Riot Platforms proposed taking over its rival Bitfarms.

Crypto Market Fluctuations Tied to GameStop, Strong US Jobs Data


							

GameStop’s stock swings and robust US job growth contribute to crypto market instability.



Bitcoin experiences large liquidations after losing 2.57% of its value in the last day.



Ethereum experiences similar market activity, with notable liquidations and a 3.33% price drop.




Several factors, including volatile swings in GameStop’s stock price and a robust U.S. jobs report, have contributed to recent fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, according to data from Coinglass.



Leading digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced notable liquidations and price declines, reflecting heightened market activity and investor uncertainty.



Bitcoin saw liquidations of $3.61 million with the price of Bitcoin falling to $69,329.47, a 2.57% drop in the last 24 hours. This decline comes despite a 2.51% weekly gain.



Ethereum also faced substantial liquidations totaling $2.53 million. Its price fell to $3,686.71, a loss of 3.33% on the last day, and 2.60% over the past week. However, Ethereum’s 24-hour trading volume of $15.5 billion indicates continued market activity.



While ORDI experienced liquidations of $1.68 million, its price remained relatively stable, dropping only 4.67% in the last 24 hours. Notably, ORDI boasts a 32.07% price increase over the past week. Its 24-hour trading volume also reflects activity, reaching $480 million.



Filecoin stands out as an exception, reporting liquidations of $835,740 despite a price increase of 4.82% in the last 24 hours. It even boasts a 9.58% weekly gain. Filecoin’s 24-hour trading volume of $688 million underscores active trading during its price rise.



Crypto news outlet, The Kobeissi Letter, linked market turbulence to GameStop’s recent stock performance. After a pre-market plunge of 25%, GameStop’s stock surged at market open. Their report highlights a $15 billion swing in GameStop’s market cap within six hours, with $2.5 billion moving per hour.







The Santiment, another crypto news source, echoed concerns about volatility reminiscent of 2021. They attribute these fluctuations to speculative trading and social media hype, similar to the surges seen in GameStop and AMC stocks.



The influence of online forums and viral posts on retail investors was highlighted, demonstrating how digital platforms can amplify trading behaviors and trigger rapid market movements.













The U.S. Employment Report further impacted the crypto market. A stronger-than-expected job increase of 272,000 weakened the possibility of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. 



Rising employment typically fuels consumer spending and inflation, reducing the likelihood of a rate decrease. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may opt to maintain current interest rates to prevent economic overheating, a possibility the market seems to be pricing in.

Donald Trump's Crypto Agenda Raises $12 Million in Donations


Donald Trump, the former president of the United States, further solidified his stance on the crypto sector, affirming his intention to embrace the title of “crypto president” during a recent fundraising event. 
Additionally, he pledged to swiftly overturn the existing administration’s adversarial stance on the crypto industry within the first hour of assuming office.
Trump’s Crypto Presidency Can Push Bitcoin to $150,000

The Trump fundraiser, hosted by venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, drew prominent figures from the crypto sphere. The guest list included the Gemini exchange twins co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, undisclosed Coinbase executives, and other industry leaders. The event raised $12 million to support Trump’s bid to oust Biden.
In an extensive social media thread, Sacks explained his endorsement of Trump’s presidency. He cited concerns with the current administration’s handling of the economy, border security, foreign policy, and legal matters.

“The voters have experienced four years of President Trump and four years of President Biden. In tech, we call this an A/B test. With respect to economic policy, foreign policy, border policy, and legal fairness, Trump performed better. He is the President who deserves a second term,” Sacks remarked.

Meanwhile, banking giant Standard Chartered has forecasted that Bitcoin could surge to $150,000 if Trump secures re-election in the upcoming November elections. Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, noted that the Republican candidate shows more support for the emerging industry compared to President Joe Biden. Biden recently vetoed efforts to repeal SAB 121—an SEC policy criticized for hindering the emerging sector’s growth.

“As we approach the US election I expect $100,000 to be reached and then $150,000 by year-end in the case of a Trump victory,” Kendrick stated.

While the US has traditionally held an anti-crypto stance, recent developments have shown that the crypto industry would actively participate in the forthcoming elections to change the unfavorable environment. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, emphasized the importance of this crypto participation in the electoral process.


“It’s great when crypto uses its collective voice through calls, letters, emails to Congress, but if crypto doesn’t vote it all just becomes noise. Politicians on both sides of the aisle must understand that votes are on the line,” Alderoty stated.

Indeed, available data shows that Trump’s pro-crypto stance has notably improved his chances of re-election. Polymarket, a popular crypto-based prediction platform, indicates that Trump now holds a 56% chance of winning, while Biden’s chances stand at 35%. Polymarket said this marks a new high for Trump’s re-election prospects.

XRP poised for legendary upside as historical pattern set to repeat


    Over the last 24 hours, XRP has experienced one of its sharpest declines in recent months, breaching the crucial $0.50 support zone. 



Maintaining a price above $0.50 was widely regarded as pivotal for the token to break free from the prolonged consolidation below $0.60.



Amid this bearish sentiment, cryptocurrency analyst Egrag Crypto, in a June 7 analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), suggested that XRP is poised for what he termed as ‘legendary’ upside potential.







According to the analysis, XRP could witness an upside of 41%. A deep dive into the token’s chart presents a macro view described as “insanely bullish.”



The analysis highlighted the necessity of a 41% price surge to reach a crucial point on the chart, drawing parallels to a similar surge observed in 2017. While the analyst couldn’t pinpoint the exact percentage increase, Fibonacci 1.618 was identified as the ultimate target for the rally.




“In a macro view, the chart below is insanely bullish, and the breakout to the upside will be nothing short of legendary!,” the expert said. 




We need a 41% pump to be on the edge of the triangle. In 2017, we experienced a similar 41% surge, and then Valhalla awaited us.

Additionally, the analysis suggested that measured moves and Fibonacci targets signal inevitable double-digit gains for XRP. However, amid anticipating a significant uptrend, the analyst advised caution, urging investors to implement robust risk management strategies.



Intrigues behind XRP’s sharp decline



It’s worth noting that several factors are contributing to XRP’s current state amid the bullish prediction. Indeed, XRP’s current sharp decline has coincided with Ripple’s transfer of 200 million XRP tokens to an unknown wallet, sparking speculation about the token’s future. 



Speculation regarding Ripple potentially abandoning its native token amidst plans to launch its stablecoin has also circulated.



Despite XRP’s lackluster performance and ongoing legal uncertainties with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple has made notable strides in its business operations. For example, the recent partnership with Clear Junction aims to facilitate instant and secure GBP and EUR-denominated payouts for Ripple’s payment customers.



XRP price analysis



As of press time, XRP was trading at $0.49, having corrected by almost 7% in the last 24 hours and showing a 5% decline on the weekly chart.

Elsewhere, the token’s technical indicators reflect the bearish sentiment surrounding XRP, with a ‘strong sell’ sentiment dominating the one-day gauges summary retrieved from TradingView and a similar sentiment under the moving average. Oscillators, however, present a ‘neutral’ stance.

In conclusion, if XRP emulates the 2017 move, the anticipated price movement could relieve investors concerned about the token’s failure to match up with established peers like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

All Eyes on Interest Rates | Bankless


Rates In Focus. Western central banks are resorting to interest rate cuts for the first time in the post-COVID era, triggering investor optimism for the next large move up in crypto prices. What else happened this week in markets?On Wednesday morning, the Bank of Canada (BOC) announced a reduction in its overnight interest rate target, a move immediately followed by identical policy actions from Europe, with both the European Central Bank and the Danish Nationalbank unveiling their own similar sized rate reductions on Thursday.Although inflation continues to run slightly above policy makers’ long-term (and admittedly arbitrary derived) 2% target in Canada and Europe, central bankers cited increasing confidence that inflation will continue to ease and a better ability to project the future pathway of inflation in justifying their initial round of cuts.
The timeline for interest rate reductions from America’s Federal Reserve remains uncertain, but commencement of the cutting process in the global West signaled they could begin sooner than expected, particularly considering the close degrees of policy coordination historically exhibited between America and the cutting nations.Falling global interest rates bolster dollar strength and could potentially further reignite inflationary pressures overseas; these allies are now likely pressuring U.S. monetary officials to implement their own cuts in the near future and would not have made the decision to cut without first securing a commitment from the Fed to do so in the near future.Indeed, the combination of continually softening global economic data and these recent rate cuts did marginally increase the odds of American rate cuts at future meetings, invigorating crypto bulls with confirmation of this heavily anticipated bullish catalyst’s inevitable arrival.Bitcoin gained nearly 7% on the week, managing to trade as high as $72k before rate cut optimism reversed on Friday, sending crypto prices sliding throughout the day as unexpectedly high headline employment statistics – which were deeply concerning under the surface – seemingly called into question whether central banks actually need to begin cutting rates.Despite the reduction in short-term Canadian and European interest rates, longer duration global government bonds yields surged on Friday to suck the oxygen from risk markets.
Stealing the main stage this week in markets was undeniably GameStop, whose memestonk messiah Roaring Kitty marked his return to social media after a brief two week hiatus by tweeting a green Uno reverse card and disclosing his ownership of 12M shares in national GME exposure.GME made new weekly highs in after hours trading on Thursday, reaching nearly $70 on speculation that Kitty could make a major move (i.e.; exercise his calls or roll them to a higher strike) in a YouTube stream scheduled for Friday at noon EST, but closed the week at just $28.Unfortunately for bulls, the GameStop Corporation announced its sale of 75M additional shares during pre-market trading on Friday and Kitty’s much anticipated live stream yielded little.

The broader cryptocurrency market is currently facing a substantial sell-off. Amid this volatility, XRP has seen a dramatic surge in trading volume, rising by 103%.The current sell-off has been brutal for many cryptocurrencies, wiping out significant value in a short span. According to CoinGlass data, the sell-off has resulted in $410 million in liquidations in the last 24 hours, the highest total since mid-April.Based on CoinMarketCap data, XRP trading volume has more than doubled in the last 24 hours, reaching $2.21 billion, showing increased interest and activity among traders. This surge in volume, up by 103%, reflects the increasing attention on XRP amid broader market turmoil.The entire crypto market tumbled on Friday as investors assessed a strong non-farm payrolls number for May raising concerns that the Federal Reserve may not lower interest rates as fast as predicted. Non-farm payrolls increased by 272,000 in May, up from 175,000 in April, surpassing an estimated 190,000. The unemployment rate, however, rose to 4% for the first time since January 2022.XRP/USD Daily Chart: TradingViewMany investors had hoped that Friday's report would show that the job market and economy were slowing, persuading the Fed to ease monetary policy and lower interest rates.XRP fell drastically in Friday's trading session due to macroeconomic developments, reaching lows of $0.454 before recovering marginally.At the time of writing, XRP was down 5.65% in the last 24 hours to $0.4967.The Fed is scheduled to meet next week, although rates are widely expected to remain steady both then and in July. CME figures reveal that traders are pricing in a 68% possibility of a rate cut in September.In the immediate term, a break above the daily moving averages of 50 and 200, around $0.524 and $0.576, could imply a positive rebound. Meanwhile, further falls may target the $0.4294 level as support in the short term.

Robinhood's Big Gamble | Bankless


1️⃣ Robinhood to acquire BitstampOn Thursday, Robinhood announced it was set to acquire Bitstamp in a potential $200M deal to double down on crypto and expand its presence globally. The acquisition not only aims to bring in Bitstamp’s retail customers in the EU, UK, U.S., and Asia, but also its institutional customers — expanding Robinhood’s offerings to a whole new investor class. Founded in 2011, Bitstamp is the oldest crypto exchange with over 50 global licenses, supporting over 85 tradable assets.  Against the backdrop of ongoing legal issues with the SEC, Robinhood's acquisition of Bitstamp showcases their commitment to crypto and their anticipation of further high demand. 2️⃣ BTC flirts with new highsWhile Bitcoin set new records this week, a new all-time high was not one of them. Instead, BTC futures positions reached a new record as open interest (OI) surpassed $37.7B. The surge in OI coincides with record inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs that brought Bitcoin from $68.5K to $71K, as BlackRock’s IBIT displaced GBTC as the largest ETF. On the back of seemingly strong employment market data, Bitcoin slipped on Friday to fall below $70K. Yet, the market remains hopeful as multiple countries have begun cutting rates, with Canada and the ECB leading the way.3️⃣ Roaring Kitty back on livestreamGameStop had a rollercoaster of a week, jumping from ~$26 on Wednesday to ~$65 on Thursday after their champion, Keith Gill, also known as "Roaring Kitty," posted a livestream scheduled for Friday. Earlier in the week, Gill had posted a screenshot on Reddit showing a portfolio ballooning to $586M, including GameStop stock holdings and 120K call options, and a tweet of a green Uno reverse card, igniting hopes for another short squeeze. However, on Friday, GameStop announced the issuance of 75M shares during earnings, reversing the rally, a drop compounded by Gill's first live stream since 2021 ending as a let-down, dropping GME back to ~$28. 4️⃣ Coinbase launches Smart WalletsOnchain Summer has arrived with Coinbase's new "smart wallet," designed to ease onboarding and enable gasless transactions. The wallet allows new users to create accounts in 15 seconds and use Face ID, Google Chrome profile, fingerprint, or Yubikey instead of seed phrases. Further, it allows them to pull from self-custodial wallets and Coinbase account balances to treat "insufficient balance" errors. However, since developers can sponsor transaction costs via paymaster integrations, enabling gasless operations across most EVM networks like Base, Ethereum, and Polygon, smart wallet users may not run into “no funds” errors often 😉.5️⃣ NYSE competitor to launch in TexasCrypto’s favorite asset manager, BlackRock, and market maker Citadel Securities have backed a firm launching a new national stock exchange in Texas. Having secured approximately $120M in funding, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) intends to file registration with the SEC by the end of 2024. This move offers an alternative for crypto companies looking to go public, like Kraken, in a pro-crypto state. The TXSE will focus on securing ETF listings, providing more competition for the NYSE and Nasdaq, which could lead to lower fees for companies. The news comes as the SEC recently approved spot Ether ETFs in the United States, with a forecast of launching possibly as soon as the end of June.

Friend.tech Unveils Plan for Native Friendchain


Friend.tech, a prominent player in the web3 social networking sphere, has announced plans to collaborate with Conduit, a leading crypto infrastructure service provider, to develop its native blockchain.
Following the news, the platform’s native FRIEND token surged by approximately 15% to reach $0.96 as of press time.
FRIEND to Play Central Role on Friendchain

On June 8, Friend.tech revealed plans for Friendchain, a proprietary blockchain set to leverage the FRIEND token as a fully transferable gas token. The platform, however, failed to provide a specific launch timeline for the project.

“We’re pleased to be working with Conduit on Friendchain, our own blockchain that uses $FRIEND as a fully transferable gas token. We’ll keep you up-to-date with all the info you need over the coming months as we build out this exciting new chapter,” the platform stated.

Read more: What is Friend.Tech? A Deep Dive Into The Web3 Social Media App
Meanwhile, this decision isn’t a surprise, considering recent statements from the project’s co-founder, Racer. In May, Racer discussed potentially departing from the Coinbase-backed Ethereum layer-2 network Base because of feelings of alienation from the ecosystem. At the time, he offered a $200,000 reward for any developer capable of smoothly migrating the platform from Base without major disruptions.
Yet, the project’s recent announcement has sparked varied reactions within the community. Some analysts perceive it as a natural progression, suggesting that successful decentralized applications would eventually evolve into independent chains. Others, however, caution that this move might impede growth.
A prominent FriendTech advocate, known as The Giver on social media platform X, described the decision as “short-term bullish and mid-term bearish” for the crypto venture. According to the analyst, FriendTech should prioritize maximizing user acquisition to establish a solid user base, ideally by leveraging connections through the Base and Solana blockchains.


“The ultimate long-term vision is for backers/investors to continue clipping protocol fees and to exit at a SaaS multiple to a Web2 company [that is] the Web3 portal for monetized social media. Friend.tech trying to capture the value accrual to-chain today is too hedonistic. The disconnect between v1 (where value is actually generated) and v2 (clubs, re hypothecating FP) still needs to be solved,” he added.

Friend.tech Transaction Volume. Source: Dune Analytics
Since its launch in August 2023, Friend.tech has emerged as one of the leading SocialFI decentralized applications (dApps) on the Base network. At its peak, the platform was generating a daily transaction volume of more than 500,000, but that has drastically plummeted to record lows of less than 1000 recently, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard.

1,901 Bitcoin (BTC) Added to ETFs in Single Day, Why No Price Jump?

Bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETF), in a display of investor confidence, are experiencing a significant inflow surge. On June 7, a total net inflow of 1,901 Bitcoin worth $132 million was reportedly added to the ETFs in just 24 hours. According to Julian Fahrer, the inflows mark 19 straight days of such movements.According to inflow distribution, BlackRock had the highest inflow with a whopping 2,450 BTC worth $169.2 million. Grayscale recorded an outflow of 524 BTC valued at $36.3 million, while Ark logged a double-digit, securing 99 BTC inflow at $6.9 million. Despite these huge inflows that signal a substantial uptick in interest from investors, the price of Bitcoin dropped below the $70,000 mark to $69,428.07, down 2.56%. The non-reaction in price has sparked speculation by the broader cryptocurrency community.Bitcoin speculations, market sentiment and future predictionsNotably, there is a general air of uncertainty about the performance of Bitcoin given its slow rise post-halving. Some fear that a bearish session is still lurking around. However, the amount of inflows to these investors points in the opposite direction.As per historical precedence, the lack of price movement despite the massive inflows is indicative of an incoming bullish run, given that the longer this goes sideways the higher prices spike.Hence, prices may soar to new peaks as predicted by industry leaders like Mike Novogratz, Robert Kiyosaki and Tom Lee. Novogratz strongly believes that Bitcoin could enter a six-digit zone before this year is over, while Kiyosaki is even bolder with a striking BTC price prediction of $350,000 by August.Interestingly, analysts suggest that Bitcoin’s price follows similar patterns after halving events, with past cycles showing significant price peaks.If the price predictions are right, the huge inflows and accumulations by BlackRock, Grayscale and other investors would have positioned them for huge profit-taking when the largest cryptocurrency asset soars.

Altcoin Team Locked Out of Treasure for a Year Finally Recovered Its Assets: But Major Fraud Suspected Now - Bitcoin Sistemi


An interesting development took place today on Gemholic, one of the zkSync projects.
All of the Gemholic developer team's funds were locked and unavailable due to an error in the sales contract of the project approximately 1 year ago. In the development that took place yesterday, zkSync has successfully completed its new update, v24, and with this update, access to locked funds has been opened.


With access to the locked funds, Gemholic developers withdrew the 921 ETH locked in the contract and bridged it to the Ethereum network.

Due to the lack of any statement from the developer team and the withdrawal of the funds in question from the zkSync network, there is currently a huge suspicion of rugpull fraud in the Gemholic project in question.





The Gemholic zkSync network wallet currently no longer contains any assets.
Rugpull can be described as a type of exit scam that involves a team raising money from investors and the public by selling a token, quietly shutting down the project or suddenly disappearing, stealing the raised funds and leaving the “investors” (i.e. their victims) with worthless tokens.

Path Of US Election Is Turning Point for Solana ETF Appro...


                                Impact Of US Election 2024 On Solana ETF Approval                                The upcoming 2024 U. S presidential election is one of the most significant events that will determine the future of cryptocurrency regulation as well as approval for altcoin ETFs such as Solana (SOL). Former President of the United States, Donald Trump, who is now again eyeing the presidency has included cryptocurrencies in his campaign and has even claimed to become the crypto president. After the Spot Ether ETF Approval, there are high Expectations for the other Altcoin ETFs Approval such as Solana ETF. However, Solana ETF Approval somehow depends on the US presidential Election in 2024.What’s The News?In the recent past, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved spot Ether ETFs, and there are chances of approval of other altcoin ETFs. Other Altcoins ETFs include Solana (SOL), XRP, Chainlink, and Dogecoin. However, the steps to get approval for these new ETFs are unclear and might be impacted by the U. S presidential election in 2024.The SEC approves Ether ETFs on 23rd May. However, SEC Chair Gary Gensler pointed out that it will take some time before its availability. However, this has led to debates on other altcoins that might be the next to be approved with Solana being among the most likely contenders given its market interest coupled with its assets under management.The Co-founder and president of 21.co, Ophelia Snyder is connected with ARK Invest’s spot Ether ETF and states that people should not get overly bullish regarding new altcoin ETFs. She seems to think that since Ether ETFs have been approved, it does not necessarily mean that other applications will follow in the near future. However, due to high demand from big investors, there could be more requests for listing altcoin ETFs by the companies.Regulation in the U. S. is stringent. The SEC has been slow in approving other cryptocurrencies for ETFs and this has been the case. There is a possibility that it may take a very long time before another altcoin ETF gets approved, as per Bloomberg ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas.Impact of US Election On Solana ETF ApprovalA key factor that could change this situation is the U.S. presidential election in 2024. If a pro-crypto candidate like Donald Trump wins, he will nominate a new SEC commissioner who could move to ease rules on cryptocurrencies. This could open the door for approval for altcoin ETFs which has been a long haul under the current regime.However, if Biden stays in power, the possibility of new altcoin ETF approvals may encounter more challenges.  Biden’s administration has been characterized by a cautious approach towards cryptocurrency, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler taking a tough stance on crypto companies. This may result in the further delay of approval of altcoin ETFs such as Solana due to some of the factors that are associated with market manipulation, liquidity and centralization.ConclusionAs per CoinGabbar, the approval of Solana ETF in the future will largely depend on the U. S presidential election in 2024 and the future market situation. The result of the election could speed up the approval process in case the new administration is more friendly towards cryptocurrencies. Therefore, with the approval of altcoin ETFs like Solana, it is still uncertain as it relies on the result of the 2024 U. S presidential election and the capability of the altcoin market to deliver the required standards of the SEC for market efficiency and stability.Go With The Flow: Rising Crypto Voters In US Election 2024, Grayscale Survey

How the Infamous 'Buy Bitcoin' GTA 6 Game Trailer Was Leaked - Decrypt

New details are coming to light about the person/persons responsible for the leaked Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer that was posted to Twitter in December 2023 with a “Buy $BTC” watermark.On Thursday, pseudonymous internet sleuth ZachXBT shared new information about the possible identity of the leaker, saying that the person in question swiped the official trailer from YouTube via unauthorized access. It was then shared via Twitter a day before the planned release, but with the Bitcoin plug overlaid on top.“The GTA 6 trailer was leaked by a threat actor who goes by the alias Skenkir,” ZachXBT wrote on Twitter this week. “He purchased access to a YouTube admin panel which allowed him to view the unlisted video early.”Skenkir, ZachXBT added, has also been involved in over 40 high-profile SIM swap attacks, including those against Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, musician Steve Aoki, and prominent crypto critic Peter Schiff. ZachXBT shared alleged screenshots of online interactions from the leaker ahead of the trailer leak.ZachXBT did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.In December, an anonymous Twitter account named “Gta6trailerleak” shared the leaked trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6. Franchise developer Rockstar Games had planned to release the first trailer for the massively anticipated game the following day, but was forced to release it early due to the modified, low-resolution leak.After the leak of the GTA 6 trailer, YouTube reportedly launched an internal investigation to find out if the source of the leak came via the video platform’s backend.“From what I can gather, YouTube has investigated employees breaching their contractual agreements on two different occasions in the past 18 months due to employees accessing content on the backend,” Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson wrote last week.If true, the GTA 6 trailer leak would be the latest in a string of privacy and security issues at the tech giant, including a Google employee accessing and publicly leaking private videos on the Nintendo YouTube account.Game leaks are nothing new; in fact, the games announced at the recent Sony PlayStation State of Play streaming event were leaked ahead of time. Reports of accounts being accessed on YouTube due to backdoor access date back to 2013, according to a report by Dexerto.YouTube and Rockstar Games did not immediately respond to comment requests from Decrypt.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

AI Tokens: Buy the Dip? Santiment Sees Profit Potential Despite Downturn


							

Santiment has signaled buying opportunities for AI crypto tokens FET and AGIX.



This bullish signal is based on a gradual increase in social volume toward Synth AI and regulatory developments.



In Q1, AI token AIOZ posted 480% gains, while FET registered a 378% return.




Market intelligence platform Santiment issued a buy signal today for crypto tokens in the AI sector, specifically highlighting Fetch.ai (FET) and SingularityNET (AGIX). The report recommends that investors closely monitor AI projects over the coming weekend and into next week.



This bullish call is based on growing social media activity surrounding AI projects like Synthetix (SNX) and positive regulatory developments for tokens like FET, OCEAN, AGIX, and Bittensor (TAO). Santiment highlights a historical correlation between such spikes in social volume and subsequent price increases for these tokens.







However, the broader crypto market downturn is currently impacting the AI tokens as well. At the time of writing, FET is down over 12% in the last 24 hours. Similar price declines are observed in AGIX, Bittensor (TAO), Render (RNDR), and Near Protocol (NEAR). Injective (INJ) stands out as a bright spot, with a 23% gain over the past week, defying the broader market correction.



Despite the short-term bearish trend, Santiment maintains its optimistic outlook for the AI crypto market. They believe that investors who buy the dip this weekend and early next week have the potential for significant profits.



Supporting this optimism, AI tokens emerged as a highly profitable investment category in the first quarter of 2024. A report by CoinGecko revealed that investors saw an average return of 222% on AI tokens during that period.









Leading the pack were AIOZ Network (AIOZ) with a staggering 480.2% increase and FET with a 378.3% gain. Even the lowest performer, OriginTrail (TRAC), delivered a 74.9% return in Q1. The CoinGecko report suggests that large-cap AI tokens particularly benefited from the surge in investor interest in the AI sector as a whole.



While the immediate future of the AI crypto market remains uncertain, Santiment’s analysis suggests that long-term investors may find value opportunities amidst the current price dips.

Beeple's jab at Roaring Kitty sparks speculation amid GameStop frenzy - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Renowned digital artist Beeple, known for his record-breaking $69.3 million NFT sale, has stirred up controversy with his latest artwork, “CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT.”The piece, which depicts a cat resembling the digital persona of Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, being killed, has sparked speculation about the motivation behind the provocative imagery.The artwork’s release comes on the heels of Roaring Kitty’s highly anticipated return to the spotlight after a three-year hiatus. Gill, a financial analyst and investor who gained fame during the GameStop short squeeze saga, recently hosted a livestream that drew over 700,000 viewers.Gill’s reemergence has reignited interest in GameStop and the broader discussion surrounding decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies.During the livestream, Gill carefully discussed GameStop’s future, emphasizing the company’s ongoing transformation and expressing confidence in its management team. He also displayed his GameStop positions, which had experienced paper losses of roughly $235 million amid the stock’s volatile price movements.Meme coins launched mostly from Solana which bear some relation or reference to Roaring Kitty such as GameStop (GME), Dumb Money (DUMB, also GME), and Roaring Kitty (KITTY) have gained renewed traction from retail investors following these developments.Beeple’s artwork, with its seemingly pointed reference to Roaring Kitty, has added fuel to the already heated debate surrounding the intersection of traditional finance, decentralized movements, and digital assets. Some have speculated that the piece may be a commentary on the risks associated with the hype and speculation surrounding meme stocks and cryptocurrencies.Despite these, however, some have questioned the timing and intent behind Beeple’s artwork, given Roaring Kitty’s influential role in mobilizing retail investors and shaping market dynamics. The provocative imagery has also raised concerns about the potential impact on the already volatile GameStop stock price. Some experts have also commented that Roaring Kitty’s recent return to the scene could spell out an oncoming meme coin supercycle.As an artist known for his thought-provoking and often politically-charged digital creations, Beeple’s seeming commentary into the GameStop frenzy has only intensified the scrutiny surrounding his work.

What is JAM? Polkadot's Biggest Ever Upgrade Explained - Decrypt

Announced in April 2024, the Join Accumulate Machine (JAM) represents the biggest-ever update to Polkadot since the blockchain first became fully operational in 2021. It will bring deep changes to the Relay Chain, the center of the project’s ecosystem, which underpins all its independent parachains.The JAM upgrade’s proposed technical principles and aims were outlined in the JAM Gray Paper, penned by Polkadot creator Gavin Wood.Polkadot relies on decentralized leadership to decide the future of the project, and the proposed update was confirmed after a near-unanimous vote of approval from DOT holders in May 2024.What is JAM?JAM is an upgrade to the Polkadot multi-chain network that aims to replace its Relay Chain with a “more modular, minimalistic design.”The Relay Chain is the main chain of the Polkadot network, coordinating the parachains that process transactions side by side on the network. It’s used to check transaction addresses and standardize data so that every system can understand it, enabling chains on the Polkadot network to pool security.JAM will enable Polkadot to “run generic “services”, smart contract logic which can process the result of execution on cores,” according to Polkadot’s founding organization, the Web3 Foundation.In a departure from Polkadot’s existing Relay Chain, JAM will be ‘permissionless’ in nature, enabling anyone to build services atop it.This is a departure from the complex and investment-heavy current system where developers have to bid for their leases at auction, backed by their project’s supporters, who stake their DOT tokens in support of the bid.Similar to how people build on Ethereum, developers will be able to build services and smart contracts without bidding for them first. These new services will then have interoperability with the rest of the Polkadot ecosystem and will be able to send tokens and data between each other, just like how current parachains function.Polkadot’s auction system will be replaced by Agile Coretime, a more economically flexible model that allows Polkadot users to purchase Coretime, the computational resources provided by JAM, in bulk by the month.Coretime, once purchased, can then be split up and sold into separate parts and resold on secondary markets, which may improve the efficiency of the overall market for computing power. All these Coretime transactions will use DOT, the native token of the Polkadot ecosystem.In a sense, JAM offers a combination of the parachain-focused functionality of the original version of Polkadot and the smart contract-focused approach of the current version of Ethereum. Gavin Wood has described JAM as a “less opinionated version” of Polkadot, as it doesn't try to push users towards one approach or the other.Wood thinks the new approach offered by JAM could help deal with some of the issues around scaling that previous blockchains have often faced, as their communities grow beyond a certain point in terms of size, users, and projects.What is running JAM?The JAM supercomputer—known as Polkadot Virtual Machine (PVM)—will use RISC-V. This is an open-source and widely adopted processor architecture, used to develop custom processors for a variety of applications and employed by firms including Google, Nvidia, and Alibaba. It will replace the WebAssembly-based framework currently used by Polkadot.The mainframe is set to be given a test run on a specially built supercomputer called the “Polkadot Palace”, in Lisbon, Portugal. The new supercomputer will have 12,276 cores and 16 TB of RAM and will be able to host the full JAM network in its entirety.If JAM is successfully implemented, Wood predicts that JAM should be able to achieve data availability of up to 852Mb/s—roughly 42 times the data availability of the vanilla version of Polkadot, prior to the introduction of Asynchronous Backing in May 2024.The Gray Paper estimates that once JAM is fully up and running, it will be able to achieve a processing capacity of roughly 150 billion gas per second.How will JAM change the Polkadot ecosystem?In a May 2024 podcast interview, Polkadot founder Gavin Wood discussed how he thinks having the ability to build services directly on top of the Relay Chain could improve the accessibility of the Polkadot ecosystem.At present, there is a hard limit of 50 parachains which can be hosted on the Relay Chain. Getting one of these limited slots means going through the auction process, and having financial backers, making the barriers to entry relatively high.Like the current Relay Chain, the JAM chain itself will have almost no functionality of its own. Functions like governance, staking, and governance will instead be built on these services, with JAM providing the underlying inoperability that enables integration and operability.JAM could be simply described as a “distributed computer,” which can be used to run almost any task.Wood used how bees, petals, and flowers function in the natural world as a metaphor to explain how JAM will function. In nature, a flower is surrounded by petals. These petals are like cores, the physical nodes of computers that power the blockchain.In JAM, the rollups—the services built on JAM—are like bees, and they freely move between the petals. This is a departure from the original version of Polkadot or zk-rollup Ethereum, where the individual petals (or cores) were mapped one-on-one to the parachain they were supporting.In JAM, these versatile petals are “stateless”, and adapt to different functions, depending on what is required of them.Every few seconds or so the flowers, which can be thought of as blocks, will create a consensus among all their different petals.When will JAM launch?It’s likely that a production-ready version of JAM will take at least 20 to 60 months before it’s ready to deploy, not including the multitude of services that are set to be built on top of it.Unlike previous updates to Polkadot, JAM will not be introduced via a gradual iterative approach. The migration will happen all at once and once it is done, it's done.The actual switchover won’t mean anything for people passively holding DOT tokens, or looking to trade it. There won’t be a spin-off currency or new altcoin, such as in the case of Bitcoin Cash in 2017 after the Bitcoin hard fork, or when Ethereum Classic first appeared in 2016.What will happen to existing parachains?JAM, though a significant change to the Polkadot network, is not what is known as a hard fork.This means that the functionality of any of the parachains currently running on Polkadot won’t be impacted; part of the JAM proposal includes a guarantee around hard-coded compatibility.But although current parachains will continue to function as normal, they will no longer be the only game in town. Parachains will become just one of many products that can be run by the JAM chain.Polkadot says that we will likely see use cases emerge that will be more suitable for parachains and others more suitable to be built as services.The Web3 foundation has assured users that parachains will remain “first class citizens” even post-JAM.How can developers get involved?The Web3 foundation will be incentivizing developers who work on implementing the JAM protocol.The JAM Implementer’s Prize offers up to 10 Million DOT—roughly $70 million at current prices—to developers who are able to meet specific performance test criteria.The prize plans to reward teams that successfully work on diverse implementations, for example using alternative programming languages to Solidity, which the majority of current parachains are built on. These languages include OCaml, Go, and Zig.The Web3 Foundation is still finalizing the details of the application process, but if you are interested in applying for the prize you can head here for an early sign-up.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Dogecoin Whales Takeover: Can Latest Spike In $1 Million Transactions Save DOGE Price? | Bitcoinist.com


								The price of Dogecoin succumbed to severe bearish pressure in the late hours of Friday, June 7th, dropping below the $0.15 level for the first time in June 2024. With the meme token looking stuck in a consolidation range all week long, the latest price drop will be another potential source of concern for most investors.
However, a burst of whale activity has been observed on the blockchain recently, suggesting that the latest price decline is likely a temporary setback and that Dogecoin’s value may rise again soon. 
Dogecoin Whale Transactions Hit A New High Since March
In a recent post on the X platform, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Dogecoin whales have been active in the past few days. The relevant blockchain indicator here is Santiment’s Whale Transaction Count metric, which keeps track of the number of whale transactions executed on a blockchain in a single day.

According to the crypto pundit, more than 150 DOGE transactions (each worth over $1 million) have been recorded in the past day. As shown in the chart below, this represents the metric’s highest level since mid-April.

A chart showing DOGE's whale transaction count | Source: Ali_charts/X
Considering the size of these transactions, they can be associated with large investors – commonly known as whales – of Dogecoin. This cohort of investors is relevant because of the size of their holdings and, often, the magnitude of their transactions. 
However, it is worth noting that the motivation behind or direction of these transactions is still unclear. It remains to be seen whether these whales are accumulating Dogecoin in anticipation of price growth or in order to offload their holdings.
Accumulation by large investors can be a positive sign and a potential catalyst for DOGE’s price rebound. On the flip side, if the whales are selling their tokens, the substantial bearish pressure may spell further downside for the price of Dogecoin. In any case, whale activities are always worth looking out for, especially given their potential impact on market dynamics and volatility.  
Meme Coin Market In Turmoil?
The cryptocurrency market has been under intense selling pressure since Friday afternoon, with its capitalization falling by nearly 3% in less than 24 hours. Specifically, the meme coin sector has been one of the biggest losers in the current sluggish market condition. 

The value of Dogecoin, the largest meme token by market capitalization, has declined by 7% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the GameStop-inspired meme coin, GME, is currently the largest loser in the market, with a 37% price decline.

Analyst Says Blue-Chip Altcoin Mimicking Price Action That Preceded Massive Rally, Updates Outlook on Ethereum - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst believes that a top-10 altcoin by market cap is about to soar to new all-time highs (ATH).
Pseudonymous trader Kaleo tells his 642,000 followers on the social media platform X that BNB (BNB), the utility token for the BNB Chain ecosystem, is mimicking a 2021 price pattern on the four-hour chart that led to new ATHs.










“When BNB entered price discovery in the Spring of 2021 it initially had a very similar breakout and retest to the one we’re seeing now. Would look to add heavily on this dip, especially sub-$650 if you get the chance.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Crypto traders and analysts refer to price discovery as a situation where a coin trades at levels never seen before in its history.
BNB is trading for $679 at time of writing, down more than 4% in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the analyst predicts Ethereum (ETH) will break out of a descending trendline against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC), and that could send layer-1 (L1) Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) projects soaring.
“Really believe it’s only a matter of time before we see something like this for the Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio. When it happens, be on the lookout for high ETH beta plays including alt L1 EVMs.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests ETH/BTC will soar above 0.10 BTC ($6,926). ETH/BTC is trading for 0.053 BTC ($3,689) at time of writing.
The trader also says that based on historic precedence, Ethereum is in the earlier stages of the parabolic phase of the market cycle.
“How can you not be bullish here?”

Game on: Best gaming cryptocurrencies for June by development activity


    Gaming cryptocurrencies became popular in the previous bull market through the innovative play-to-earn model that mixed investing with entertainment. However, most games were quickly developed and launched to join the hype, financially harming gamers and investors due to flaws and unsustainable economics.



In this context, Finbold looked to the current gaming cryptocurrencies and Web3 ecosystems with the highest development activity. This could give investors and gamers insights on solid projects building Web3 games for this cycle, competing among the best.



Public data gathered from Santiment shows the top five cryptocurrency projects that fit into the gaming category. In particular, MultiversX (EGLD) stands out with 235.47 activity in the last 30 days despite a 20.5% drop.







Decentraland (MANA) has the second position with 144.23 and a 48.05% loss in the same period. Furthermore, Nine Chronicles Gold has 102.7, while ImmutableX (IMX) and Skale (SKL) have 76.87 and 42.83, respectively.

MultiversX (EGLD) leads the gaming cryptocurrencies



Notably, the leading cryptocurrency by development activity in the gaming category has recently conquered this position that belonged to Decentraland. MultiversX, formerly Elrond, has gradually increased its presence among Web3 gamers and, especially, game developers throughout the year.



Looking at a year-over-year chart on Santiment, it is notable how the project’s development activity suddenly started surging in January. The 7-day indicator jumped from 1097 to 1605 by press time, increasing 46% year-to-date.

Interestingly, MultiversX is a layer-1 blockchain competing with Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and similar cryptocurrencies.



It stands out for its presence in gaming and is the only fully operational blockchain that has completely implemented the sharding technology for high scalability while keeping running nodes accessible with low CPU requirements.



Meanwhile, the network’s native token, EGLD, trades at 7-month lows, priced at $34.96. Nevertheless, a surging spot trading volume suggests the market interest could return to MultiversX, as suggested in the chart.



MultiversX total value locked in DeFi



From another perspective, MultiversX has managed to attract investors for its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Essentially, the blockchain currently has $125 million in total value locked (TVL) among its protocols, ranking 39 against its competitors. Data is from DefiLlama, on June 8.



However, EGLD holds one of the best market cap-TVL ratios in the whole industry, considering a $952.5 million capitalization. The 7.54 MCap/TVL ratio suggests its token could be oversold in relation to the value its DeFi ecosystem currently has—offering a potential opportunity at these prices.

In closing, the gaming industry reached $184 billion in revenue last year, and forecasts expect it to reach $200 billion by 2024. Newzoo reported this data that highlights the 45% dominance of mobile games in 2023, for $90.5 billion.



Therefore, even a small share of this market could significantly increase the market demand for the $1 billion-capitalization MultiversX.

Why Did BTC's Price Tumbled $3K on Friday Despite the Impressive Bitcoin ETF Inflows?


																After days and days of registering gains and testing the $72,000 price tag, bitcoin reversed its trajectory on Friday and slumped by more than three grand in hours.
The question arises as to why this happened since the inflows into the US-based ETFs keep coming.
The Bitcoin ETF Impact
It’s safe to say that the biggest and most vital news in the cryptocurrency industry this year has been the ETFs the US Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighted in January. Not the halving, which is typically all people can talk about every four years, but specifically the Bitcoin ETFs (the Ethereum ETFs’ impact will be known after they launch).
After all, numerous financial giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity, became issuers of an exchange-traded fund with an underlying asset a cryptocurrency – that’s a sentence that wouldn’t have made much sense five years ago. Now, though, retail investors, as well as institutions, can easily be exposed to bitcoin’s performance without having to worry about storing some mystic keys and remembering complicated passwords.
The effects were immediate as BTC’s price soared by more than 50% in weeks and tapped a new all-time high of $73,800 about two months after the ETFs launched in the States. This was the first time ever the asset had registered a new record before a halving.




The subsequent price movements were also heavily impacted by the inflows or outflows from these financial vehicles. For example, BTC slumped hard in mid-April and early May when investors were taking substantial amounts out almost on a daily basis. Price movements changed when their behavior changed in mid-May and so far in June.
In fact, the ETFs are on their best streak since they saw the light of day. The last time they felt outflows was a month ago – on May 10. This means that they have seen inflows for 19 straight days. Yet, BTC dumped hard on Friday, dropping from $72,000 to $68,500 in minutes.
Why Is That?
Well, if we can’t blame it on the ETF flows, the community has come to a consensus about the main reason. Popular analyst Willy Woo said, “bitcoin won’t get nice things until the last minute degen logs give up chasing the price,” suggesting that there’s too much leverage in the system. This theory was echoed multiple times on Crypto X in the past day or so.


Another theory that is quite popular among the community involves profit-taking. Coming just 2% away from its all-time high of $73,800 meant that almost all investors’ funds were in a profit, which many consider a good exit point to take some cash out.
No matter the reason, the fact of the matter is that BTC’s drop caused more than $400 million in liquidations within a day. This should be a warning to over-leveraged traders to be wary about such potential swings in either direction.

Latam Trading Platform BTR Shutdown as Users Allege Ponzi Scheme
The BTR crypto trading platform has allegedly ceased operations, sparking accusations from its users of an exit scam. What was initially seen as a temporary glitch has quickly escalated into a significant scandal.
Investors from Venezuela and other parts of Latin America had entrusted substantial sums of money to the BTR platform. Now, they find themselves in a precarious situation.
Many were drawn by promises of high returns and the perceived stability of the project. However, the lack of transparency and evasive responses from BTR’s administrators have fueled suspicions of a deliberate exit scam.

“#BTR the pyramid scheme has fallen. Its users report that there is no longer access to the website, there are no withdrawals, there are no official announcements from its CEO,” pseudonymous trader from Venezuela said.

Bitcoin Embassy Bar in Mexico Closes in July, Leaves Crypto Networking Legacy
The Bitcoin Embassy Bar, a central hub for blockchain projects and Bitcoin initiatives, will close its doors at the end of July. This venue has been an ideal space for the crypto community in Mexico to network and collaborate.
Lorena Ortiz, the bar’s founder, announced on social media that the closure is due to health issues she faced earlier this year. However, she emphasized that while the physical location is closing, the “Bitcoin Embassy Bar” concept remains alive.

The community reacted swiftly, praising the bar’s efforts to educate people about cryptocurrency. Many expressed their appreciation for their experiences as consumers and exhibitors at the venue. Others encouraged the continuation of the project, optimistic that the business aspect and concept could be revived.

At the time of writing, the total liquidation in the broader market comes in at $413.85 million, according to data from CoinGlass.Meme coin liquidationsSome of the top meme coins that featured in the liquidation over the past 24 hours include Dogecoin (DOGE), PEPE and dogwifhat (WIF). This liquidation is a function of the drop in the price of these meme coins, an inevitable trend from the relative rally picked up in the past week.The CoinGlass data pegs the PEPE as the meme coin that has suffered the most liquidation, worth $9.33 million in 24 hours. This figure comes in at 729,476,153,245 PEPE liquidated within this time span, with long traders getting "rekt" the most.Dogecoin (DOGE) follows with a total of $8.27 million recorded in losses within the time span.

Web3 doesn’t need flashy - it needs functional - Blockworks


The original vision of Web3 was a digital future that could be built and owned by the many, made possible by the power of blockchain protocols and their unique ability to solve age-old coordination problems. 
The early internet was born on similar ideologies to Web3: An open space for the unrestricted flow of ideas and knowledge without physical, social or political barriers. 
Today, however, a small handful of corporations dominate. They cast their net widely to harvest the data of end users and developers alike while limiting control and governance to a small, unelected few. 
This subversion of the vision of the early internet came about because ideology lost out to convenience and the lure of delightful interfaces. In a world of digital abundance, the power to curate made kings and queens of the new global internet infrastructure dynasties. 
While we can understand why people will trade their values for beautiful UX, a flashy exterior can hide an ugly, sclerotic core, similar to Dorian Gray and how “his beauty had been to him but a mask.” And building beautiful interfaces on top of data networks created powerful moats that grew stronger over time, stifling competition and innovation. 
While many entrepreneurs believe they could build even better end-user-facing experiences for Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and many of the other digital giants, today’s Davids don’t stand a chance without the ability to tap into their global data and back-ends.
But in the world of decentralized infrastructure — also known as the least flashy corner of crypto — we have the chance to “arm the rebels” and put the needed tools into the hands of the entrepreneurs best placed to create a healthier open internet. 
The answer is emerging within OG infra protocols. We can use blockchain as a single source of truth to coordinate and incentivize otherwise untrusting actors, making it unnecessary to have to choose between utilitarian infrastructure and flashy products.
Ideology vs convenience
Open architecture is a much richer environment for ecosystems to improve performance and extend functionality. Entrepreneurs don’t need to reinvent the infrastructure stack or pay a tax to those who currently dominate.
With open architecture, the end customers can enjoy the optimizations they are used to — as flashily as they wish — without having to give up their data.
We can all have our cake and eat it, too. As per Denis Nazarov, “Open services powered by crypto networks will present unprecedented opportunity for a new generation of developers and entrepreneurs to innovate.”
Read more from our opinion section: It’s time to take back our digital communities
This vision is just starting to be rolled out within decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), often simply described as “community-powered infrastructure networks.”
The vision was never to just build a new AWS with a token on top — it is to enable an even bigger infrastructure network than AWS could ever build on its own. And this infrastructure layer will be kept open for entrepreneurs to build 1000s of AWSs on top, for every region, language, customer type and market segment you can imagine. Fantastic UX provided by thousands, if not millions of businesses, competing to best serve their target markets rather than a handful of global behemoths will prove to be the narrative break with the past. In Joel Monegro’s words from his Fat Protocols thesis in 2016, “the end result [of value flowing to open protocols away from vertically integrated applications] is a vibrant and competitive ecosystem of applications and the bulk value distributed to a widespread pool of shareholders.’”
As the data follows through to prove out the thesis, we’ll see a growing appreciation for these functional projects powering real businesses without compromising the internet’s original ideals. Convenience and globally scalable infrastructure will no longer be synonymous with a handful of internet giants controlled by a small group of people in the northwest of the USA. 
Developing new ways to create picks and shovels for the internet that all entrepreneurs can leverage without compromise may come without the fanfare of flashier projects. However, this will be the way that crypto becomes the dominant force we all hope it will become.
Permissionless open infrastructure networks will continue to be more reliable, performant and cost-effective. As per Albert Wenger, “much like the PC was a platform for innovation that never happened on mainframes or mini computers, Web3 will be a platform for innovation that would never come from Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc.”

Dermot O’Riordan serves as a Director at the POKT Network Foundation where he helps steer product development and strategy. From Ireland to Silicon Valley, Dermot’s career ranged from advising tech companies and VC firms to leading marquee industry events. His interest in Web3 was sparked in 2016 with the rise of DAOs, leading him to dive deeper into the blockchain space, where he served as an advisor to projects like Radix and Dusk, and later, spearheading growth at Eden Block.

Gary Gensler Channels Taylor Swift With Love Story For SEC's 90th Anniversary: 'Mission Is Meant To Last For Evermore' - Benzinga

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently celebrated its 90th anniversary, an event highlighted by Chairman Gary Gensler.Gensler channeled his inner Taylor Swift by highlighting the "eras" the SEC has gone through.What Happened: Gensler drew comparisons between the “eras” of the SEC and the various stages of Taylor Swift’s latest record-breaking “Eras Tour,” which showcases different parts of her career.The SEC chair said in a video posted on X that, in addition to Swift’s talent, “there's also a lot of value in sharing one's story." Gensler mentioned that the SEC has a wealth of talent and history, emphasizing different eras, starting with “The Roosevelt Era.”Under President Franklin Roosevelt, securities laws in 1933 and 1934 helped create the SEC, which was established on June 6, 1934. Additional securities laws signed under Roosevelt helped form "the foundation of our capital markets," Gensler said."The SEC was created to ensure that the markets worked free of fraud and market manipulation."Other eras highlighted by Gensler included "The Rebirth Era," "The Eighties Era," "The Post Crisis Era" and "The Current Era."Related Link: SEC Chair Gary Gensler Fields Questions On AI, ‘Roaring Kitty’ And Congressional Trading: ‘Disclosure Doesn’t Necessarily Protect A Bad Actor’Why It's Important: When discussing the “Current Era,” Gensler highlighted the rapid pace of change in the markets, encompassing artificial intelligence, social media, influencers, and the global pandemic.Gensler also mentioned the "dramatic" increase in retail traders. The SEC chairman further identified SPACs, meme stocks and cryptocurrency as recent additions to the market that require regulation."We at the SEC continue to consistently apply the rules and update them where appropriate," he said, adding that the SEC's mission is to protect investors."Regardless of the era, our financial system remains seated in the middle of the economy," he noted.To conclude the video, Gensler referenced Taylor Swift’s ninth studio album titled “Evermore.”"The SEC's mission is meant to last for evermore," he said.The video received numerous negative reactions, with many questioning why Gensler focused on criticizing retail traders and cryptocurrency instead of being tougher on Congress trading.Read Next: Unlike Bitcoin, SEC Chief Gary Gensler Didn’t Vote On Spot Ethereum ETF ApprovalsPhoto: Shutterstock

Vitalik Buterin vs. Iggy Azalea after MOTHER's 1200% hike - AMBCrypto



Iggy Azalea’s MOTHER token reflects the memecoin trend after the NFT craze
Despite Buterin’s critique, MOTHER surged by 1,200%

Once a stranger to Solana [SOL], Australian rapper Iggy Azalea has launched her own Solana-based memecoin, Mother Iggy (MOTHER). However, this isn’t the first time such a trend has emerged either. 
In 2021, various celebrities entered the crypto-market by launching their own NFTs. Now, 2024 has seen an exponential rise in celebrity-endorsed memecoins.
Here, it’s worth pointing out that not everyone is pleased with this trend. In fact, just recently, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed his discontent about the same in a post on X. He claimed, 
“I’m feeling quite unhappy about with ‘this cycle’s celebrity experimentation’ so far.”
In response to Buterin’s criticism, the Grammy-nominated rapper shared a photoshopped image of herself breastfeeding Vitalik Buterin, accompanied by the caption, 
“He was just hangry.”
Her comment garnered widespread appreciation for Iggy and criticism for Buterin, with some commentators stating,

Community favours Azalea
In his critique, Buterin emphasized the need for more meaningful projects in the crypto space. He had also claimed, 
“Financialization as a means toward an end”, I can respect if the end is worthy (healthcare, open source software, art, etc). Financialization *as the final product*.” 
However, a majority of the community disagreed with Buterin’s remarks. One commentator summarized it well by claiming, 
“Celebrity meme coins can change the fabric of society for the better.”
What’s on the price front?
Despite the criticism, Mother Iggy’s price surged by 1,200% to approximately $0.20, achieving a market capitalization that exceeded $190 million. 
However, at the time of writing, $MOTHER had dropped by 29.21% in just 24 hours. This brings forth a question – Is this due to Buterin’s comment or is it simply the unpredictable nature of memecoins? 
Growing trend of celebrity memecoins
Although the question remains unanswered, it still highlights a growing trend where celebrities leverage memecoins to directly monetize and engage with their fans, bypassing traditional intermediaries. 
While some critics find this trend meaningless, it has proven to be lucrative and an effective strategy for certain celebrities to regain prominence.   
Echoing similar sentiments, Azalea in a recent interview with Fortune added, 
“I don’t think peace is very profitable when it comes to the landscape of memecoins. It’s what drives virality, it drives my community, and it drives our market cap, and that’s what I’m here to do. So respectfully, get out of the way.” 
Azalea has been observing the cryptocurrency space since 2020, intrigued by the rise and fall of NFTs and Web3 art. 
Although uncertain of her role, she eventually realized that memecoins, with their unique culture, were the perfect fit for her venture into crypto.

Ripple's 150 Million XRP Sale Keeps Price Surpressed Amid Bearish Headwinds


																Ripple has again raised concerns in the XRP community following its recent XRP sale. This comes amid XRP’s unimpressive price action, which continues to paint a bearish outlook for the crypto token. 
Ripple Sells 150 Million Tokens
On-chain data shows that the crypto firm offloaded 150 million XRP tokens ($78 million) on June 7. These tokens formed part of the 1 billion XRP tokens, which were recently unlocked as part of its monthly escrow unlock, which is set to continue until 2027. As expected, this sale has raised concerns, considering the impact many believe it could have on the market. 

	Related Reading


Moreover, this sale follows Ripple’s recent unusual transactions, when the crypto firm moved 3 billion XRP tokens ($1.5 billion) across different wallets in the space of 30 minutes. However, crypto analyst Michael Nardolillo explained that those transactions were mainly internal movements and escrow re-lockups.  
This recent sale of $150 million XRP tokens will again raise the theory of price suppression by Ripple. While it has been revealed that the crypto firm’s XRP sales have no impact on prices on crypto exchanges, it undoubtedly adds to the bearish sentiment that crypto investors already have towards the token. 
Furthermore, Ripple’s XRP sales lead to a positive supply shock, with more XRP tokens being injected into circulation. Such development tends to have a negative impact on a crypto’s price and could lead to significant price declines. 
It is also worth mentioning that this sale comes at a time when the market sentiment towards XRP is as bearish as it can be. This is partly thanks to the fact that the crypto token remains one of the worst-performing crypto assets since the year began, with a year-to-date (YTD) loss of over 18%. 
XRP Will Still Be Great
Despite XRP’s unimpressive price action, crypto analysts have continued to predict the crypto token will still have its moment when it will experience that price breakout and make a parabolic move to the upside. Crypto analyst Javon Marks recently mentioned that the XRP is about to make a name if it hadn’t already done so. 

	Related Reading


He made this statement while revealing that a Hidden Bullish Divergence setup had formed on the altcoin’s chart. He claimed that XRP’s price went up by over 63,000% in less than a year the last time this happened. He suggested that such a move could be on the horizon again with XRP at its breaking point. Meanwhile, Crypto analyst CryptoBull also recently predicted that the cryptocurrency could enjoy a 28,900% rally and rise to $154. 
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.49, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2-year high: Nearly $200 billion cryptocurrencies invested in DeFi


    The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector has witnessed a significant influx of capital, with numerous cryptocurrencies experiencing price increases as investors lock up value in various Web3 protocols. 



According to a report by blockchain analytics firm DappRadar, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi applications soared to $192 billion in May, marking the highest level since February 2022.



Despite this surge in TVL, the number of unique active wallets (UAW) involved in DeFi declined by 21%, indicating a shrinking user base. DappRadar attributed the TVL growth to speculative trading, driven by anticipation of a potential Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF). The report noted:







“The DeFi UAW was down, meaning that most trading was speculative based on ETH ETF, and likely more trading happened on CEXes.”

Cryptocurrencies locked within DeFi applications grew by 17% in value during May, primarily due to rising prices of Ether and other tokens. Ethereum dominated the DeFi market, holding $130 billion, or 68% of the total TVL. Solana (SOL) followed with $10.9 billion, accounting for 5.7% of the total and reflecting a 14% increase from the previous month.



Data from DefiLlama showed that 24-hour trading volumes on decentralized exchanges surged from $1.7 billion to $5.1 billion between August, 2023, and June 7, 2024.

This increase likely resulted in higher returns for liquidity providers and lenders, prompting additional crypto deposits into DeFi platforms. This period also saw significant discussions about Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether ETFs.



Broader Web3 market trends



While DeFi saw a drop in UAW, other Web3 sectors reported growth. The gaming sector recorded over 3 million active users, a 7.5% increase from the previous month. NFT marketplace users grew by 11%, reaching 1.52 million UAW, and Web3 social media apps saw a 29% rise to 1.92 million UAW. As of June 6, the total number of Web3 UAW reached 10.4 million.

Performance across blockchain networks



NEAR Protocol (NEAR)  continues to lead in blockchain performance, driven by popular Dpps like HOT Game and Kai-Ching.



Polygon (MATIC) follows with its robust gaming ecosystem. Arbitrum (ARB) emerged as the top performer this month, with a 122% increase in UAW due to the social DApp UXLINK.



Chain Rankings. Source: DappRadar



DeFi’s TVL has maintained a strong upward trajectory since the beginning of the year. Ethereum remains the dominant force in DeFi, followed by Solana, which has benefited from increased memecoin trading and DeFi activity. Merlin has also stood out, becoming the largest Bitcoin sidechain.



Nevertheless, investors must be aware of the yet experimental nature of DeFi and invest cautiously.

Bitcoin Price Will Reach At Least $125K by Year End, Predicts BitGo CEO Mike Belshe | Cryptoglobe


                                
Michelle Makori, Lead Anchor and Editor-in-Chief at Kitco News, recently interviewed Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, during Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas. Belshe shared his predictions and insights on Bitcoin’s price trajectory, institutional adoption, and the macroeconomic factors influencing the cryptocurrency market. 



Bitcoin’s Price Prediction



Mike Belshe predicts that Bitcoin’s price will top $125,000 by the end of 2024. Belshe explains that this surge will be driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors and increasing institutional demand. He emphasizes that despite the initial volatility following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, institutional investments have been slow but are starting to gain momentum.



Institutional Adoption



Belshe estimates that currently, only about 5% of institutional money is invested in Bitcoin. He attributes this slow uptake to the cautious and methodical approach of large institutions, which typically involve extensive committees and evaluation processes. Belshe notes that as these processes conclude, more institutional money will flow into Bitcoin, significantly boosting its price.



Fiat Debasement and Bitcoin’s Role



Belshe points out that we are witnessing fiat debasement on steroids, which he believes is a primary reason for Bitcoin’s existence and its continued performance as a top asset. He stresses that the US debt is uncontrollable and that the government will continue to print more money, leading to the devaluation of the dollar. According to Belshe, “Your dollar is going down. My dollar is going down. Get off the dollar.” He argues that Bitcoin is a hedge against this devaluation and will continue to rise in value as more people and institutions seek alternatives to fiat currencies.



The Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs



The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a significant milestone. Belshe highlights that these ETFs make it easier for institutions to invest in Bitcoin without facing the complexities of direct ownership. He also notes that the early demand for these ETFs has been primarily retail-driven, but institutional interest is starting to pick up. Belshe expects this trend to accelerate, leading to substantial inflows of institutional capital into Bitcoin.



Future Demand for Spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Belshe also discusses the future demand for both spot Bitcoin and spot Ether ETFs. He predicts that Ethereum ETFs will take a bit longer to gain full approval but will eventually succeed. He anticipates that the approval of Ethereum ETFs will further validate the cryptocurrency market and attract more institutional investors.



Macro and Political Influences



Belshe elaborates on the macroeconomic backdrop, emphasizing that the US’s foreign policy and sanctions controls are driving global entities to seek alternatives to the dollar. He mentions that the BRICS nations are working on alternative payment systems, which could diminish the dollar’s dominance. Additionally, digital technologies are enabling seamless cross-border payments, further eroding the need for traditional financial intermediaries.



Regulatory and Political Climate



Belshe expresses concerns about the politicization of financial regulations, particularly in the context of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. He points out that political motivations have influenced regulatory decisions, such as the sudden approval of spot Ether ETFs. Belshe believes that both major political parties should recognize the value of Bitcoin and digital assets for innovation and economic stability.



Ethereum’s Potential and Market Dynamics



Regarding Ethereum, Belshe is optimistic about its potential as a smart contract platform. However, he differentiates its role from that of Bitcoin, viewing Ethereum as more suited for building decentralized applications rather than as a store of value. He also discusses the implications of staking rewards and the potential emergence of two classes of Ether: staked and non-staked, each with different valuations.

Anthony Scaramucci projects Bitcoin to skyrocket to $700k


    Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, has maintained his bullish stance on Bitcoin’s (BTC) future, suggesting that it is only a matter of time before the cryptocurrency reaches a six-figure value.



In an interview with David Lin published on June 7, Scaramucci projected that Bitcoin could match gold, seeing the asset rally to almost $700,000. His prediction hinges on Bitcoin’s unique technological attributes and increasing adoption as a store of value akin to gold.



Scaramucci pointed out that Bitcoin’s adoption rate in the United States is currently around 5%. However, if Bitcoin continues to scale and adopt at the same speed as it has over the past decade, he sees no reason why its value couldn’t increase exponentially.







He added that Bitcoin’s current market cap of almost $1.5 trillion could feasibly grow by 10x over the next 15 years. Based on the possible tenfold growth, this means that with the current value of about $69,500, Bitcoin could hit a market cap of $15 trillion in the next 15 years.



Using the formula for the new price of Bitcoin, which is the latest market cap divided by the current market cap, then multiplied by the current price of Bitcoin, the asset’s projected price will be approximately $695,000 if the market cap grows 10x.




 “There’s no reason why this can’t be a $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 asset. <…> If gold’s at $16 trillion, bitcoin’s at $1.5 trillion, could Bitcoin 10x in the next 15 years? I believe it can and I believe it has the properties the technical properties to allow it to do that and we’re already seeing that happen it’s already manifesting in that direction,” he said. 




Drivers of Bitcoin to $700,000



Scaramucci’s optimistic forecast is grounded in Bitcoin’s inherent characteristics and the ongoing trends in its market adoption. 



At the same time, the investor pointed out that Bitcoin’s potential also lies in its potential as a digital store of value. He argued that people would accept a store of value in the digital age if it possesses qualities like scarcity, ease of use, trustworthiness, and stable value. 



Drawing parallels to gold, Scaramucci explained that Bitcoin meets these criteria through its decentralized and permissionless network. Bitcoin’s limited supply ensures scarcity, while its decentralized nature guarantees secure and reliable value transfer.



Scaramucci concluded that Bitcoin’s growth is driven by its ability to replicate the valued qualities of traditional assets in a digital form, predicting its increasing acceptance and long-term growth in the global financial system.



In the short term, he maintained that Bitcoin will likely trade at $170,000 by 2025.

Gemholic Vanishes After Withdrawing $3.5 Million in Locked ETH


The crypto community is raising alarms over a potential $3.5 million rug pull by Gemholic, a project on zkSync. On June 7, multiple transactions drained the project’s smart contract funds.
Concerned members on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) highlighted that Gemholic’s online presence has vanished. The project’s X handle and Telegram channel have been deleted as of press time.
How Did The Gemholic’s Rugpull Occur?

Last year, Gemholic lost access to 921 ETH raised in a token sale due to a bug in its smart contract. At the time, the team promised to refund investors if the locked funds were recovered.
On June 7, the Matter Labs-backed Ethereum layer-2 network zkSync completed its v24 upgrade. The update fixed the smart contract issue, allowing access to Gemholic’s locked funds. However, according to on-chain data, instead of returning the funds to investors, the Gemholic team withdrew 921 ETH and transferred it to the Ethereum blockchain.

0xMorgosh, the pseudonymous founder of Zkmarkets, called this action a “rugpull,” accusing Gemholic of deceiving investors for a year with false refund promises. He pointed out that the Gemholic team had completed Know Your Customer (KYC) verification with SolidProof, which has not publicly addressed the situation.

“A KYC provider must either admit its incompetence in conducting thorough verifications, or take action in reporting fraudsters to authorities and making a public statement. If SolidProof continues to ignore this issue, then their platform is useless and should be discredited,” he added.


0xMorgosh also noted that Binance supposedly funded the contract creator’s address and urged the community to share insights on how the exchange might assist.

Meanwhile, this incident is reminiscent of a similar case involving ZKasino, another ZK stack-powered platform. ZKasino reneged on its promise to return users’ bridged Ethereum, sparking stiff resistance from the crypto community. The project would later backtrack from its fraudulent activities after Dutch authorities made arrests and began investigations into the matter.

How Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Will Transform Global Finance: Abra CEO | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent interview with Michelle Makori, Lead Anchor and Editor-in-Chief at Kitco News, Bill Barhydt, Founder and CEO of Abra, provided profound insights into the future roles of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in the global financial system. The conversation delved into Barhydt’s visionary outlook on how these cryptocurrencies will transform finance, from serving as global reserve assets to facilitating institutional transactions and retail payments.



Bill Barhydt is the CEO and founder of Abra, a global cryptocurrency wallet and exchange application. He has a rich background in technology and finance, which has established him as a key figure in the cryptocurrency world.



Barhydt began his career as a software engineer at NASA and later transitioned to Goldman Sachs, where he worked as a fixed-income analyst. His entrepreneurial journey includes co-founding WebSentric, which developed media sharing and collaboration tools for enterprises, and Boom Financial, a company focused on providing financial services to immigrants.



In 2014, Barhydt founded Abra, a platform that facilitates investment in both cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Abra’s mission is to make financial services more accessible and transparent through the use of blockchain technology.



Bitcoin: The Shadow Central Bank



Barhydt foresees Bitcoin becoming the “shadow central bank” as fiat currencies continue to face instability. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it an ideal reserve asset. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which are prone to devaluation due to government policies and excessive money printing, Bitcoin’s value is predictable and mathematically proven. This inherent stability positions Bitcoin as a potential safeguard against the failures of fiat systems.



The Abra CEO expects governments around the world, particularly those with weaker currencies, to start holding Bitcoin as part of their reserves. Barhydt predicts that 50 to 75 non-US-dollar-backed or non-euro-backed currencies will fail in the next 25 years and he believes that nations may turn to Bitcoin and other commodities to stabilize their economies.



He says:







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

“Bitcoin will become the shadow central bank, as the fiat system fails … We’ve been slow boiling the frog for 50 years and that could go on for another 25, but when it fails, it will fail very quickly, like overnight.“



Ethereum: The Institutional Blockchain



Ethereum, according to Barhydt, will play a crucial role in bringing traditional finance on-chain through tokenization. This process involves representing real-world assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate as digital tokens on the blockchain. Barhydt says that Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities make it the ideal platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which are already revolutionizing how financial transactions are conducted.



Barhydt highlighted that Ethereum’s infrastructure allows for always-on, borderless financial operations, which is a significant improvement over traditional banking systems. He thinks the ability to tokenize assets and execute transactions without intermediaries will make financial services more efficient and accessible. He predicts that within the next five years, institutional assets in DeFi will reach a trillion dollars.



Solana: The Retail Blockchain



For retail transactions, Barhydt sees Solana as the go-to blockchain due to its high throughput and low transaction costs. Per his words, Solana’s ability to handle a large volume of transactions quickly and cheaply makes it ideal for applications that require scalability, such as payment systems and consumer financial services.



Barhydt also mentions that the rise of meme coins and the launch of PayPal’s stablecoin on Solana are early indicators of its potential. Barhydt envisions a future where Neo banks are built on Solana, providing users with seamless financial services including stablecoin issuance, yield generation, and crypto payments.



Interoperability and the Future Financial Ecosystem



Barhydt also discussed the importance of interoperability between these blockchains. Cross-chain transaction processing will, Barhydt claims, enable assets from different blockchains to interact seamlessly. For example, he says, that users could borrow against Bitcoin using Ethereum-based DeFi platforms, facilitated by innovations like wrapped Bitcoin.



Barhydt expects this interconnected ecosystem to allow consumers and institutions to leverage the strengths of each blockchain. In such a scenario, consumers would benefit from high-speed, low-cost transactions on Solana, while institutions would utilize Ethereum’s robust DeFi infrastructure for complex financial operations, and Bitcoin would underpin the entire system as a stable reserve asset.

CoinGecko Suffers Data Breach Through Third Service Provider - Details


								Crypto data aggregator firm, CoinGecko, has experienced a data breach through one of its third-party services. While no CoinGecko user accounts were compromised in this incident, the hackers accessed vital users’ personal information which they employed in launching a wide-scale phishing attack.


23,723 Users Compromised In Data Breach
According to a security notice on June 7, CoinGecko claimed that hackers gained access to an employee’s account at GetResponse, an email marketing platform, leading to a high level of unusual activity. On June 6, the team at GetResponse confirmed the attack stating that a data compromise had occurred. 
Through this hack, the bad actors transferred out 1,916,596 contacts from the CoinGecko GetResponse account before proceeding to send phishing emails to 23,723 of these contacts using another GetResponse account.
For context, a phishing mail represents a fraudulent mail designed to deceive an unsuspecting recipient into revealing particularly sensitive or important information. In this case, such information could be particularly detrimental, leading to a loss of assets. 
However, through a fast response,  the malicious emailing activity was quickly detected and halted by CoinGecko in collaboration with GetResponse. However, data of certain users including personal information such as users’ name, email address, etc, and metadata such as account sign-up date and subscription have been obtained by the hacker. 
Notably, the data breach at CoinGecko occurred on the same day following an alert from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stating that an established email vendor popularly used by crypto firms had been compromised. 
To mitigate the potential damage from this incident, CoinGecko has reached out to all users affected by the data breach. Furthermore, the crypto data firm has commenced an investigation into the attack in partnership with GetResponse. CoinGecko admonishes all users to exercise caution in opening emails from strange sources/domains. In particular, they have warned against engaging with any email that claims to offer token airdrops by CoinGecko or GeckoTerminal. 
Commenting on the incident, CoinGecko Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer, Bobby Ong has emphasized similar warnings, saying: 
Unfortunately GetResponse has confirmed that we are one of the impacted accounts that suffered a breach. This is a targeted supply chain attack on our email newsletter software vendor. There is no CoinGecko token being planned so don’t be duped by phishing emails.


Crypto Market Overview

According to data from CoinMarketCap, the general crypto market has taken a dip recently, losing 2.74% of its market value over the last 24 hours falling to around $2.55 trillion. In tandem with this decline, Bitcoin is also down by 1.92% and valued at $69,392.

El Salvador's Transformation: Nayib Bukele’s Approach to Peace and Prosperity | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a captivating interview with Tucker Carlson that aired on TCN on June 6, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador shared his insights and experiences in transforming one of the most dangerous countries in the world into one of the safest in the Western Hemisphere. The interview covered a wide range of topics, including Bukele’s strategies for combating gang violence, his views on Western civilization, and his advice to former President Donald Trump.



Tucker Carlson is a prominent American conservative political commentator, writer, and television personality. He gained significant recognition as the host of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Fox News, where he served from 2016 until April 2023, when he was reportedly fired by the network. Since then, Carlson has continued to influence public discourse through his independent projects and social media presence.



Nayib Bukele is the President of El Salvador, a position he has held since June 2019. Bukele is known for his charismatic leadership style and his unconventional approach to governance, which has garnered both praise and criticism domestically and internationally. Before his presidency, he served as the mayor of San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador.



Here is how Nayib Bukele earned the nickname “the Bitcoin President”:



Bitcoin as Legal Tender: On June 9, 2021, El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly passed the Bitcoin Law, making Bitcoin legal tender in the country. This law came into effect on September 7, 2021. This move was aimed at promoting financial inclusion, attracting investment, and stimulating economic growth.Chivo Wallet: The government introduced the Chivo digital wallet to facilitate Bitcoin transactions. Each citizen received $30 worth of Bitcoin upon downloading the wallet, which helped drive initial adoption.Bitcoin City: Bukele announced plans for “Bitcoin City,” a project aimed at creating a tax-free city powered by geothermal energy from a nearby volcano, specifically designed to attract Bitcoin businesses and investments.Volcano Bonds: The government proposed the issuance of Bitcoin-backed “volcano bonds” to fund Bitcoin City and further develop the country’s Bitcoin mining operations using geothermal energy.Global Advocacy: Bukele has been a vocal advocate of Bitcoin on the global stage, positioning El Salvador as a pioneer in cryptocurrency adoption and frequently highlighting the potential benefits of Bitcoin for other nations.



Achieving Peace and Safety



Bukele emphasized that the foundation for any societal progress is peace. When he took office, El Salvador was known as the murder capital of the world. “We turned it into the safest country in the Western Hemisphere,” Bukele stated. He detailed his administration’s strategic phases to combat gang violence, which included doubling the army and equipping them with necessary tools. The efforts were a combination of methodical planning and what Bukele described as a “miracle.”



Combating Gang Violence



The transformation wasn’t without challenges. Bukele revealed that MS-13 and other gangs retaliated violently, resulting in 87 murders in just three days. This unprecedented violence required immediate and decisive action. Bukele and his team prayed for wisdom and minimal civilian casualties, which he credits as instrumental in their success. “We didn’t have any civilian casualties,” Bukele proudly noted.



Spiritual Warfare



Bukele also touched on the spiritual dimension of his battle against gangs, describing MS-13 as a “satanic” organization. He shared chilling accounts of gang rituals and murders, underscoring the moral and spiritual battles his administration faced. Bukele believes that winning the spiritual war was crucial to their physical victory against crime.



Economic Plans and Seeking God’s Wisdom



Turning to economic policies, Bukele highlighted his three-point plan, with the first point being to “seek God’s wisdom.” He argued that divine guidance is essential for wise decision-making, a stance that distinguishes him from many other world leaders. 



Western Civilization and Leadership Challenges



Bukele expressed concerns about the decline of Western civilization, attributing it to a lack of maintenance and moral decay. He criticized the current state of democracy in many Western countries, suggesting that leaders often prioritize short-term gains over long-term stability. Bukele believes that true leadership requires a commitment to maintaining and improving societal systems, much like the maintenance needed for infrastructure.



Advice to Donald Trump



When asked about former President Donald Trump, Bukele offered strategic advice for navigating political challenges. He emphasized that attempts to undermine a candidacy often backfire, garnering more support for the targeted individual. “If there’s no way to stop him from competing in the election, all the things they do to him will just give him more votes,” Bukele observed.



U.S. Criticism and American Immigration to El Salvador







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Bukele addressed criticism from U.S. politicians, such as Congressman Jim McGovern, who criticized the relocation of a painting in El Salvador’s airport. Bukele dismissed these critiques as out of touch and irrelevant. He also noted a significant influx of Americans and returning Salvadorans moving to El Salvador, attracted by the country’s newfound safety and opportunities. This migration has spurred a housing boom, contributing to economic growth.



International Cooperation



Bukele revealed that several Latin American leaders have sought his advice on improving their own countries. El Salvador’s successful strategies in security and prison reform have become a model for others facing similar challenges. Bukele emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared knowledge in addressing regional issues.

Argentina has reached out to El Salvador, known for its groundbreaking adoption of Bitcoin, to gain insights and learn from its experiences in the realm of digital assets. This collaboration aims to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency regulation and growth.



As detailed in a report by Argentina’s National Securities Commission (CNV), top officials from both nations recently engaged in discussions about cryptocurrency regulation. This highlights the influential role of El Salvador, which, in 2021, became the first country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.



Dr. Silva of the CNV praised El Salvador’s pioneering efforts in the crypto space, particularly the establishment of the National Commission for Digital Assets (CNAD). He noted El Salvador’s prominent position not just in Bitcoin usage but also in the broader crypto asset landscape. He expressed a desire to strengthen ties and explore collaborative agreements with El Salvador.



Dr. Boedo of the CNV, who visited El Salvador for technical discussions on securities market development and regulatory aspects, highlighted El Salvador’s valuable experience with crypto assets. He emphasized the importance of maintaining and strengthening ties with El Salvador, a leading figure in this field.



Mr. Juan Carlos Reyes of the CNV acknowledged Argentina’s role in technology and the commission’s commitment to effective industry regulation. He appreciated the innovative approach of El Salvador’s National Digital Assets Commission, recognizing its supervisory experience in digital assets.



El Salvador’s regulatory framework, overseen by the Financial Superintendency and the Central Reserve Bank, manages all digital assets and financial instruments, underscoring the country’s advanced stance in the digital asset sector.



According to a report by Cointelegraph, this collaboration is timely for Argentina, which has recently made strides towards regulating its domestic cryptocurrency market. In April, Argentina introduced registration requirements for crypto firms, signaling a move towards a more regulated crypto environment. This initiative is bolstered by the election of Javier Milei, a Bitcoin-friendly politician, as president in late 2023.



In a related development, Argentina’s foreign affairs minister, Diana Mondino, announced at the end of 2023 that her government was preparing a decree to legalize the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for payments under specific conditions.

Norwegian Authorities Return $5,700,000 Worth of Stolen Crypto Assets From 2022 Ronin Network Hack - The Daily Hodl


								Norwegian authorities successfully froze and returned $5.7 million worth of crypto assets that were stolen in a massive 2022 hack on the Ronin (RON) network.
Ronin is a gaming-focused Ethereum (ETH) sidechain developed by Sky Mavis, the same team that created the non-fungible token (NFT)-based game Axie Infinity (AXS).










In March 2022, hackers believed to be from the North Korean cybercriminal organization Lazarus Group exploited the private keys of the Ronin bridge and stole 173,600 ETH and 25.5 million USD Coin (USDC) worth over $600 million at the time.
On Friday, Sky Mavis announced that the Økokrim (Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime) had seized and returned $5.7 million worth of the stolen assets.
“Recovery of these assets requires close coordination and dedicated effort amongst law enforcement agencies, lawyers, accountants, and blockchain forensic teams such as Chainalysis. ~ 15% of recovered assets will be used to cover costs and expenses incurred by those involved in the recovery efforts. The remaining 85% of recovered funds will be deposited into the Axie Infinity treasury.”
The developer also noted that a total of $40 million worth of the stolen crypto had been frozen by law enforcement since the hack.
“These assets will take some time to recover and we don’t have enough information to give guidance around a specific timetable for recovering and returning this separate pool of assets.”

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo Customers Lose $456,000,000 in One Year To 'Dirty Little Secret Called Zelle': Senate Committee Chairman - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are failing to protect customers from hundreds of millions of dollars in scams and fraud per year, according to a US Senate panel.
At a hearing held by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Democratic Senator and Chairman Richard Blumenthal said the banking giants’ customers submitted claims to recover $456 million in 2022 – all due to fraud and scams on the payments network Zelle.










“The banks of America have a dirty little secret. It’s called Zelle… 
Zelle markets itself as ‘A fast and easy way to send and receive money.’ But, as this Committee has found, a fast and easy way to lose money is often what happens on Zelle.”
Senator Blumenthal says Zelle – a network owned by seven US banks including Chase, BofA and Wells Fargo – creates a veil of security while leaving customers far too vulnerable to fraud.
“Zelle transfers are nearly instant and irreversible, and by the time a consumer knows they’ve been scammed, usually it’s too late to do anything about it – at least according to Zelle and according to the banks that own, control, and in effect operate Zelle…
Zelle and the banks that own it offer to customers the appearance of the trust they feel they deserve. But the risks there are real and present, and they simply are failing to protect consumers in the way that they deserve.”
The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that of the $456 million customers reported lost to Zelle scams in 2022, $341 million was repaid. According to the panel, 13% of users on Zelle and other peer-to-peer payment platforms report sending money to someone and later realizing it was a scam.
In response to the Senate panel’s inquiry, Zelle released a statement via its parent company, Early Warning Services, LLC.
“Providing a safe and reliable service to consumers is the top priority of Early Warning Services, LLC, the network operator of Zelle, and our 2,100 participating banks and credit unions. 
As a result of our continued efforts to build on Zelle’s strong foundation of security, less than one-tenth of one percent (.1%) of transactions are reported as fraud or scams, making Zelle one of the safest ways for consumers to pay people they know and trust. Zelle is also currently generally free for most consumers.”

A CBDC Is Like a ‘Death Star’, Argues US Senate Candidate, While Advocating for Bitcoin | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent interview with Kitco News, Bernie Moreno, the Trump-endorsed Republican Senate nominee from Ohio, shared his perspectives on the current political climate, the role of cryptocurrencies, and the potential dangers posed by Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Speaking on the sidelines of Consensus 2024, Moreno emphasized the importance of preserving financial freedom and fostering innovation in the crypto industry.



Moreno is a notable businessman and political figure currently making headlines as the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate race in Ohio. A Colombian-American, Moreno has a diverse background in business, particularly in the automotive sector. He initially gained prominence by transforming a Mercedes-Benz dealership in North Olmsted, Ohio, into one of the top-performing dealerships in the country. Over the years, he expanded his business ventures, establishing a network of luxury car dealerships. In recent years, Moreno has shifted his focus towards blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. He has actively promoted the integration of blockchain solutions in business practices, underscoring his commitment to technological innovation.



Moreno first entered the political arena during the 2022 Senate race but ultimately withdrew to support JD Vance, who won that election. In 2024, Moreno returned to the political stage, securing the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in Ohio. Moreno’s campaign focuses on several key issues, such as reducing foreign energy dependence, enhancing border security, and promoting the “America First” agenda. He has been critical of the current administration, particularly on matters of immigration and economic policy, positioning himself as a staunch opponent of Democratic incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown​.



The Threat of CBDCs



Moreno is vocal about his concerns regarding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). He describes CBDCs as a potential “Death Star” for personal freedom, arguing that they could lead to unprecedented government control over individuals’ financial lives:



“If you have the government remove cash from the system and we can only use fiat currency through some sort of centralized digital bank currency, it’s checkmate, the Death Star, whatever analogy you want to use.“



Moreno warns that a central digital currency would allow the government to dictate what people can and cannot purchase, thus eroding fundamental liberties. He draws parallels to historical struggles against centralized control, likening the original Bitcoin supporters to America’s founding fathers who feared central power:



“The original Bitcoiners were our Founders. They understood the power of central control and feared it more than anything else.“



Political Landscape and Crypto Regulation







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Moreno asserts that the upcoming elections are crucial for the future of the crypto industry. He criticizes Democrats for what he perceives as a superficial shift toward pro-crypto policies, attributing it to election-year strategies rather than a genuine commitment to innovation. He warns that if Democrats win, they will “crush” the crypto industry despite recent positive signals.



Central Bank Digital Currencies vs. Bitcoin



Highlighting the philosophical divide between his views and those of his opponent, Senator Sherrod Brown, Moreno underscores his belief in minimal government intervention. He argues that Bitcoin represents a check against fiscal irresponsibility and monetary mismanagement. Moreno believes that while the U.S. dollar must maintain its status as the world’s reserve currency, Bitcoin’s existence as an alternative can help keep the government’s fiscal policies in check.



Economic Policies and Innovation



Moreno outlines his vision for fostering a pro-crypto environment in Ohio. He emphasizes leveraging the state’s abundant energy resources to support crypto mining and creating a regulatory landscape that encourages innovation. Moreno also highlights the importance of maintaining America’s leadership in technology and finance, suggesting that rejecting a CBDC could serve as a strategic advantage, attracting freedom-loving individuals from around the world.



Transparency and Accountability



Addressing concerns about political conflicts of interest, Moreno supports measures to prevent elected officials from trading stocks and other financial assets while in office. He advocates for strict transparency and accountability, ensuring that public servants prioritize the interests of their constituents over personal gain. Moreno’s commitment to transparency is evident in his own decision to divest from cryptocurrencies to avoid any potential conflicts.



The Role of President Trump



Moreno praises former President Trump for his strong stance against CBDCs and his support for a pro-crypto regulatory environment. He argues that Trump’s business acumen and openness to diverse viewpoints make him well-suited to lead the country through its current challenges. Moreno looks forward to working with Trump to craft legislation that fosters innovation and preserves financial freedom.



Election Integrity and Blockchain



While expressing confidence in Ohio’s election integrity, Moreno acknowledges widespread concerns about electoral processes nationwide. He advocates for the use of blockchain technology to enhance transparency and security in voting systems. However, he notes that public trust in government must be restored for such innovations to be widely accepted.

Web3 Watch: SDNY targets NFT rug pull - Blockworks


The Southern District of New York is at it again with more cryptocurrency-related charges. The US district court, in cooperation with the FBI, unsealed an indictment Thursday against three United Kingdom nationals for an alleged fraudulent NFT scheme. 
Mohamed-Amin Atcha, Mohamed Rilaz Waleedh, and Daood Hassan are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering in connection with the “Evolved Apes” NFT collection. 
The trio lied to investors in 2021 about developing a related video game — which, investigators say, never came to fruition — in order to “pump up the price of the NTFs.” 
“Ghosting customers without fulfilling a promise not only reflects poor business integrity, it also violates the implicit trust buyers place in sellers when purchasing a product, no matter if that product is in a store or stored on a blockchain,” FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said in a statement Thursday. 
The scheme, which prosecutors described in the indictment as a “rug pull,” allegedly resulted in the defendants making off with more than $2 million. 
“Digital art may be new, but old rules still apply: making false promises for money is illegal,” US attorney Damian Williams said. 
Are domains Web3’s next onramp?
Unstoppable Domains and Blockchain.com will be partnering to launch a new Web3 “.blockchain” domain, the companies said Thursday. The companies hope to register the new domain with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). 
The hope, Unstoppable Domains said on X, is that .blockchain domain owners will be able to capitalize on Web2 functions, such as email, “while retaining all of the existing incredible features of Unstoppable Web3 domains.”
The companies will have a year to prepare their ICANN applications, as the global authority said it will release its new application guidelines next year. 
One interesting stat: 

The $KITTY token on SOL, a memecoin inspired by infamous Reddit GameStop trader “Roaring Kitty,” lost more than 60% during the retail trader’s livestream Friday afternoon. GameStop shares also took a tumble of more than 30% before the New York Stock Exchange halted trading. 

In other news:

Modular blockchain base layer Avail closed a $43 million Series A this week, bringing its total funding to $75 million. The company plans to grow globally and “address the most critical challenges facing Web3” with the new capital.
Alchemy launched its new “Alchemy Rollups” tool this week, which aims to help developers launch their own chains. The product is currently available on waitlist, the company said. 
Andrew Tate wants to crash Solana, he told X Friday. Upon further investigation it would appear that he intends to buy and hold a few memecoins in an effort to engagement farm, but only time will tell.

PEPE whales buy the dip, but is that enough for the memecoin? - AMBCrypto



PEPE registered a surge in whale interest as prices fell
Social volume and sentiment around PEPE declined too

Recently, Pepe [PEPE] surprised memecoin investors by rallying significantly on the charts against all odds. However, the aforementioned surge was short-lived as the rally quickly came to a halt over the last few days.
Whales buy at a discount
Despite the decline in price, however, whales continued to have faith in the popular memecoin. In fact, over the last few days, a whale bought 447.67 billion PEPE – worth $5.85 million – after PEPE’s price dropped, according to Lookonchain’s data.
Source: X
Here, it’s worth noting that it wasn’t just one whale that behaved like this in isolation. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the 10- 10,000,000 cohort of holders grew significantly, indicating a large-scale accumulation of PEPE being done by whales. This hike in interest from whales may translate to positive price movement for the memecoin sooner or later.
However, a high concentration of whales would come at the cost of centralization of PEPE holdings. If the percentage of PEPE held by whales becomes increasingly high, retail investors will become susceptible to volatile price movements caused by the behaviour of these whales.
Source: Santiment
At press time, PEPE was trading at $0.0000129. Over the last 24 hours, the price of PEPE fell by 10.06%. Despite the significant decline in price, the trend for PEPE has been relatively unharmed though. Ever since PEPE began rallying after 01 May, the price hit multiple higher highs and higher lows – Indicative of a bullish trend. The price of PEPE would need to fall further before a full reversal can be expected.
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) for PEPE fell significantly – A sign that bullish momentum had declined materially over the last few days. On the contrary, the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for PEPE remained high – A sign of high capital inflows owing to recent whale behavior.
With enough whale accumulation and money flow, PEPE holders could soon see green again.
Source: Trading View
The social angle
On a separate but related front, the social volume fell too, pointing to the waning popularity of the token. Coupled with that, the weighted sentiment around the token declined, indicating a surge in negative comments around PEPE.
These factors could inhibit PEPE from seeing further growth on the charts.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $25 billion market cap in the second half of the year


    The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, heavily influenced by broader economic factors. Recent U.S. job growth data exceeded expectations, indicating the economy is coping well with higher interest rates.



This reduces the likelihood of rate cuts, which impacts the flow of money into riskier investments like cryptocurrencies.



Amid this backdrop, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies projected to achieve a $25 billion market cap by the second half of the year.







These predictions hinge on the continuation of the bull run and the potential benefits of high supply inflation, which could boost market caps even if price movements are minimal.



Dogecoin (DOGE)



Dogecoin’s (DOGE) current market cap stands at $21 billion. Recently, the price of Dogecoin faced severe bearish pressure, dropping below $0.15 for the first time in June 2024. 



Despite this downturn, recent blockchain activity suggests this decline might be temporary.



Significant whale activity has been observed on the Dogecoin blockchain. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported over 150 DOGE transactions, each worth over $1 million, in a single day.



Doge price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap



This surge in whale transactions, the highest since mid-April, indicates that major investors are acquiring Dogecoin at current prices, setting the stage for a potential price recovery.



Although the meme coin sector has been under intense selling pressure, technical analysis projects DOGE could surpass $1 per coin.



However, economic fundamentals and market volatility may challenge this target.



Despite a recent 7% decline in value on the weekly chart, Dogecoin’s substantial market cap and strong community support could drive it towards the $25 billion mark.



Toncoin (TON)



Unlike broader market trends, Toncoin, a Layer-1 cryptocurrency closely linked to Telegram, has rallied by over 6.5%. 



As of press time, Toncoin is trading at $7.18, with a market cap of $17.4 billion and trading volumes exceeding $354 million. 



This surge follows Telegram’s announcement of a new in-app currency, Stars, linked to Toncoin. 



Stars will facilitate the purchase of digital goods and services across all mini-apps on Telegram, creating a crypto-backed ecosystem. 



Users can purchase Stars with fiat currency or directly within Telegram, using them to buy digital products within Telegram mini-apps.



Toncoin’s price rally is also supported by significant whale accumulation. Market analyst Ali Martinez noted a 237% increase in Toncoin whale transactions in a single day, rising from 5  to 27 transactions as of June 3. 



Toncoin price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap



Analysts predict Toncoin’s price could reach $10 if Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market continue their upward trends



With continued integrations and robust investor interest, Toncoin is well-positioned to reach the $25 billion market cap in the second half of the year.



It’s worth noting that while the ecosystem’s activities support these cryptocurrencies, their potential to reach the $25 billion mark largely depends on whether the market maintains its bullish momentum.

Andrew Tate’s Meme Coin Ignites Crypto Market Frenzy


Andrew Tate, a social media influencer and former professional kickboxer, recently ignited controversy in the crypto community. On Friday, he began promoting various tokens in the Solana (SOL) ecosystem while posting inflammatory statements on Twitter, creating a social media storm.
Known for his provocative social media presence, Tate’s actions have once again stirred up a whirlwind of positive and negative reactions.
Andrew Tate’s Meme Coin Ventures Spark Chaos and Interest

The chaos began after Tate stated his intention to hold onto $1 million worth of various assets with “diamond hands” if his post got a specific number of retweets. The term “diamond hands” is used to describe the action of keeping an asset for the long term, regardless of its price fluctuations, due to a strong belief in its future value.
Shortly after his post achieved the required number of retweets, he announced his plan to “crash the Solana network.” This statement implied that he intended to purchase many tokens in Solana, enough to potentially overload the network.

Tate shared an address and encouraged people to send him coins. Hundreds of different coins flooded in. He burned some and promoted RNT throughout the day. Despite receiving many coins, Tate claimed he made “zero” money from these activities.

“I’ve made over 100 million trading through Solana. I’ve turned people into millionaires. I’ve made zero. Zero. I just bought coins and held them to dust,” he wrote on his X account.

Andrew Tate’s involvement in Solana significantly impacted the meme coin market. Real Nigger Tate (RNT), which he has been shilling hard, reached a market capitalization of $61.1 million.
Another coin, TOPG, achieved a market capitalization of $38.01 million. The TOPG developer allocated 58% of the supply to Tate, which he then burned. Additionally, TATE reached a market cap of $5.8 million, exemplifying the contagious popularity of these meme coins.

Following Tate’s actions, a slew of Tate-associated meme coins entered the market. For example, G, linked to Tate’s dog, achieved a market capitalization of $4.5 million. GRETA, inspired by Tate’s past encounter with Greta Thunberg, reached a market capitalization of $4.6 million, with Tate receiving 50% of its supply. 
Other noteworthy coins include WARROOM, which is associated with Tate’s private club, hitting $3 million in market capitalization. Meanwhile, EMORY, connected to his father, and FTRISTAN, stemming from a disagreement with his brother, reached market capitalizations of $2.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively. RBASE also reached a market capitalization of $1.7 million.

Although Tate’s motives remain unclear, his actions align with his history of creating controversial content. In mid-May, Tate claimed to have cashed out $500,000 in Bitcoin to invest in GameStop (GME) and meme coins to spite hedge funds. This further showcases his knack for stirring the pot in the crypto space.

Kraken Pro, an advanced cryptocurrency trading platform, has announced the listing of a new trading pair: DOGE/GBP. This addition comes just days after the exchange introduced the DOGE/AUD pair, signaling its commitment to expanding its offerings for Dogecoin traders around the globe.The introduction of the DOGE/GBP trading pair allows traders to directly trade Dogecoin against the British Pound. This move is expected to enhance liquidity and accessibility for DOGE in the crypto market, providing more options for users to engage with the popular cryptocurrency. Earlier this week, the subsidiary of the U.S.-based Kraken crypto exchange listed the DOGE/AUD pair, which allows Dogecoin trading against the Australian Dollar (AUD). By offering direct trading pairs with fiat currencies like the British Pound and Australian Dollar, Kraken Pro aims to accommodate the growing demand for Dogecoin trading in different regions. These additions reflect the exchange's strategy to support a diverse and global user base.Kraken Pro's decision to list these pairs might also be a response to the growing demand for Dogecoin, which has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to its vibrant community and increasing use cases.Dogecoin dips 10%The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn, with Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessing a sharp 10% fall in value. This decline is part of a broader market crash that has seen liquidations exceed $410 million, affecting major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin.Dogecoin was not immune to the market's movements, plunging to lows of $0.1399 during Friday's trading session before slightly rebounding. At the time of writing, DOGE was down 8.47% in the last 24 hours to $0.146.Before the fall, Dogecoin was sustaining above the daily SMA 50 at $0.155, a level which it has now lost due to the market crash. Dogecoin has now reverted to its previous trading range, which it was in mid-April until briefly breaking above in late May.

Crypto influencer lost $8 million in one month from a $15 million investment


    The cryptocurrency market went through a shakeout, with most cryptocurrencies experiencing a crash in the past 24 hours. A crypto influencer and Ethereum (ETH) supporter currently holds $8 million in unrealized losses with the ERC-20 token FRIEND.



Notably, the pseudonymous influencer Machi Big Brother, with 164,400 followers on X, has over 50% losses with FRIEND. Lookonchain spotted the one-month losing position from the labeled account and reported it in a post on June 8.







According to the on-chain analyst, Machi Big Brother has been buying the token since May 3. Overall, he bought 8.6 million FRIEND for an average price of $1.81. The crypto influencer spent 4,975 ETH, worth $15.6 million, in this investment, currently down 55%.







As of this writing, FRIEND trades at $0.808, having crashed 60% in the last 30 days. Therefore, Machi Big Brother’s position is now valued at $6.95 million, down $8.65 million in over a month.

FRIEND and social volume with crypto influencers



The well-known cryptocurrency trader Ansem has defined FRIEND as a meme coin and a “culture coin,” highlighting its ecosystem. Ansem posted this on X on May 4, suggesting he could have been building a position on the token approximately at the same time the other crypto influencer did.







Interestingly, the token peaked in social volume and price in early May but never reached these levels again. Data from Santiment suggests FRIEND experienced a brief hype driving its prices and crypto influencers’ interest one month ago. However, this was a short-life surge, which has now been fading away and accumulating losses.

Meme coins and the greater fool theory



Meme coins, like FRIEND, come with significant risks that traders must not underestimate due to their speculative nature. These cryptocurrencies often lack intrinsic value, and their prices are primarily driven by social media hype and buzz.



Crypto influencers and traders who invest in meme coins are essentially gambling, hoping to sell at a higher price to others. This mindset aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests profits can be made from overvalued assets. However, this theory also underscores the inherent risk, as the market may eventually run out of willing buyers.



When hype fades and demand wanes, traders can be left holding worthless assets, resulting in substantial financial losses.

Is It Time To Buy Bitcoin And Altcoins? Crypto Millionaire Arthur Hayes Has The Answers


								Arthur Hayes, a crypto millionaire and the co-founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange, has encouraged crypto investors to go long on Bitcoin and other promising altcoins in the market. He encouraged investors to get ready for an imminent Bitcoin bull run this season.  

Arthur Hayes: Go Long On Bitcoin And Altcoins
In a recent blog post titled “Group Of Fools,” Hayes has acknowledged Bitcoin’s prospects, highlighting that the crypto bull run was finally reawakening with Bitcoin potentially being one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies during this bull cycle. 
The BitMEX co-founder linked the efforts of the central bank to the performance of the crypto market, suggesting that actions taken by the US central bank could help propel the cryptocurrency’s market to its earlier glory days, with the market recovering from the previous summer slump.
Hayes also disclosed initial expectations of major policy changes in August 2024 during the Federal Reserve Jackson Hole Symposium. However, currently, he has noticed a reduction in monetary policies, and as a result, has encouraged investors to go long on Bitcoin and other altcoins in the market. 

In addition, the BitMEX co-founder recommended the introduction of new tokens and the deployment of liquid crypto assets, expressing strong conviction in shitcoins. In his blog post, he declared, “The crypto bull is reawakening and is about to gore the hides of profligate central bankers.”
Furthermore, Hayes believes that the upcoming Group 7 (G7) countries meeting would be an important one. He disclosed that the financial market was more interested in the possibility of the Federal Reserve and The Bank of Japan (BOJ) cooperating to strengthen the Chinese (yuan). He also highlighted in his post that the dollar-yen exchange rate was one of the most important macroeconomic indicators.
The BitMEX co-founder noted that the financial market is also interested in the possibility of a rate cut among the G7 countries, excluding the Bank of Japan. He made his reservations about the prospects of the Federal Reserve cutting rates close to the US Presidential elections scheduled for November 2024, citing the political and economic implications of the move.

Hayes has predicted that neither the Fed nor the BOJ will make rate changes in their June meetings. However, he remains optimistic about the Bank Of England (BOE), suggesting that the BOE may follow in the footsteps of the Bank of Canada (BOC) and European Central Bank (ECB), in cutting rates. 
Bitcoin On Track To Reach New All-Time Highs
Sharing a similar sentiment as Hayes on going long on Bitcoin, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Jelle,’ on X (formerly Twitter) has made a bullish prediction about Bitcoin. 
According to Jelle, Bitcoin is less than 4% away from surging to a new all-time high. The cryptocurrency witnessed a rally to a new all-time high earlier in March, surpassing $73,000 and outpacing its previous all-time high of more than $69,000 in 2021.

Jelle has stated that the Bitcoin market is getting ready to expand soon, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s strong price fundamentals. Similarly, Michael van de Poppe, a prominent crypto analyst has also expressed bullish sentiments concerning Bitcoin, disclosing that the cryptocurrency is “heavily ready” for a breakout upwards to a new all-time high.

'Other' cryptocurrencies dominate market liquidations, $100 million losses


    The cryptocurrency market liquidated over $345 million from trading positions in the last 24 hours. Surprisingly, $100 million were from “other” cryptocurrencies outside of the top 50 by market cap.



Finbold retrieved this information from CoinGlass on June 8, following a massive crash that speculators believe happened after macroeconomic data.



In particular, long-position traders exposed to “other” cryptocurrencies had the vast majority of losses, with $103.82 million in liquidations. Short-sellers of these low-cap coins lost only $6.09 million, totaling $109.91 million lost capital in 24 hours.







Overall, bulls were severely punished with $309.53 million out of the $345.12 million liquidations among all digital assets. Bitcoin (BTC) saw a total of $43.21 million in liquidations, while Ethereum (ETH) had $38.75 million—mostly from long positions.

Altcoin and meme coin traders got ‘REKT’ amid liquidations



In this context, TradingView‘s crypto market cap index (TOTAL3), which includes all cryptocurrencies excluding BTC and ETH, has lost over $60 billion in capitalization since June 7. The index currently indicates a $666 billion market that is testing its resilience before what could be an altseason.



TOTAL3 is slightly below its 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA, daily chart). Thus, bouncing up from this support level would suggest a bullish momentum for altcoins, likely igniting a surge. Analysts have identified a “once in a few years golden opportunity” on these alternative cryptocurrencies, as reported by Finbold.

Interestingly, the current crash could help to filter solid projects amid a growing meme coin mania that dominated the market. For example, a crypto influencer registers $8 million in unrealized losses from a meme coin investment.



Meme coins come with significant risks that traders must not underestimate due to their speculative nature. These cryptocurrencies often lack intrinsic value, and their prices are primarily driven by social media hype and buzz.



Crypto influencers and traders who invest in meme coins are essentially gambling, hoping to sell at a higher price to others. This mindset aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests profits can be made from overvalued assets. However, this theory also underscores the inherent risk, as the market may eventually run out of willing buyers.



When hype fades and demand wanes, traders can be left holding worthless assets, resulting in substantial financial losses or traders getting “REKT,” as in the last 24 hours.

ICE-Backed Crypto Marketplace Bakkt Mulling Possible Sale: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto marketplace backed by the owners of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is reportedly mulling over the possibility of a sale.
According to a new report by Bloomberg, anonymous sources familiar with the matter say that crypto firm Bakkt has been working with a financial advisor to contemplate its future options, including the possibility of a breakup or a sale.










However, no additional details were given and no firm decisions have been made yet, according to the report.
Bakkt, which first went public in 2021, recently announced a partnership with digital asset technology firm Crossover Markets to power its upcoming Electronic Communication Network (ECN), or a platform that facilitates asset trading outside of traditional exchanges.
Bakkt says its ECN, which is called BakktX, will be specifically tailored for institutional investors. As stated by Ray Kamrath, the company’s chief commercial officer,
“As institutional interest in crypto grows, further expanding Bakkt’s capabilities is a key priority. 
With the development of BakktX, we are positioning ourselves as an ideal partner for institutions seeking a compliant, qualified trading venue. This will be a truly groundbreaking solution that fulfills a currently unmet need in the US market.” 
News of the partnership sent Bakkt (BKKT) flying as its price went from $20.00 on June 6th to $23.94 just a day later, a 19.7% rise. It has since stabilized and is trading for $18.95 at time of writing.
Bakkt is 55.6% owned by the financial conglomerate Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the NYSE.

Why Ethereum Layer-2 Network Taiko Is Spending $100K Daily on Blobs - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsAn Ethereum layer-2 network named Taiko is dominating the market for so-called blobs, or dedicated data storage for Ethereum scalers—but those endeavors are resulting in tens of thousands of dollars worth of costs for the little-known scaling solution each and every day, even topping the $100,000 mark multiple times this week.The Taiko protocol, which went live in late May, seeks to offer users cheaper and faster transactions than on Ethereum's mainnet, while borrowing elements of the network's security. Since going live, Taiko has spent a whopping $900,000 on blobs in less than two weeks to funnel users’ transactions over to Ethereum’s network.Meanwhile, Taiko’s competitors, such as the Optimism network, rarely spend more than $1,000 per day on Blob-related fees. Introduced in March as part of an Ethereum upgrade, blobs were billed as a new resource for layer-2 scaling networks to post Ethereum transactions more cheaply.The protocol’s maker Taiko Labs announced in March that it had raised $15 million in a Series A funding round. Leveraging “zero-knowledge” cryptography in its design, Taiko is striving to differentiate its scaling design in an increasingly competitive field that includes dozens of different scaling networks.“Taiko just launched its mainnet, and there’s a lot to be figured out before it becomes stable,” Taiko Labs CEO Daniel Wang told Decrypt in a written statement. “We knew that we will use more blobs than other layer-2s. This is a design decision, not a bug.”Layer-2 networks often work by bundling batches of transactions together and processing them on a separate chain before posting receipts back to Ethereum. However, Taiko’s design differs from that formula, where lots of transactions are rolled up into batches elsewhere.Instead, the process of ordering transactions, known as sequencing, takes place on Ethereum itself. In a blog post, Taiko Labs said this process, dubbed “base sequencing,” is more decentralized than that of other layer-2s that rely on centralized sequencers—which are controlled by a network’s development team and collect a small portion of users’ fees.“That sounds expensive,” Alexei Zamyatin, the co-founder of Bitcoin layer-2 network BOB, told Decrypt in an interview. “It makes it more secure, but not as secure as [Ethereum], and you’re also much more expensive than most layer-2s.”A game of tradeoffsStill, Wang stated that the costs associated with Taiko’s functionality could easily reach the point of break-even if “Taiko is fully utilized by users,” providing a sustainable amount of gas fees.Wang added that Taiko is fully aware of the pros and cons associated with its sequencing method, and he hopes that Ethereum researchers will study Taiko’s on-chain data to explore improvements that could allow Ethereum to better support similar scaling networks.Some Ethereum researchers, including Justin Drake, believe that Taiko’s team is trailblazing a new form of decentralized sequencing that could solve key hurdles in Ethereum’s ecosystem.“It is making a leap forward in the decentralization, credible neutrality, and composability of rollups,” he told Decrypt in a written statement.If more layer-2 networks shifted the sequencing of their transactions to Ethereum itself, then fragmentation issues holding the entire space back could be solved, he stated. As of now, liquidity and assets are largely spread out across different layer-2s, effectively siloing users and applications within a given scaling solution while all being tied to Ethereum.When it comes to layer-2 networks on Ethereum, the introduction of blobs represented a significant shift in how those protocols interact with the underlying blockchain. Before blobs were available as a separate fee market, layer-2s could only post bundled transactions in the form of Ethereum “calldata,” a space for data to be contained within transactions.Instead of trafficking users’ transactions in bulk alongside regular Ethereum activity, blobs serve almost as a dedicated lane on a highway, where less congestion can reduce costs. However, the best way to package those transactions before they’re shipped is still up for debate.Blobs blobs blobsIn some cases, centralized sequencers can be leveraged to grind a network to a halt, puncturing the veil of permissionless activity that is synonymous with crypto. Sometimes, centralized sequencers can be abused to delay transactions too. However, Taiko’s commitment to decentralization may not be the most efficient, according to one of its community advocates.“Sadly, it’s kind of expensive,” the pseudonymous crypto researcher arixon.eth said on Twitter (aka X). “Because of based sequencing, we need to post a blob every 12 [seconds], and if there aren't enough [transactions], then we just won't fill the blobs.”Wang of Taiko Labs said changing this pace could be a potential solution enacted soon, stating that Taiko’s community is “considering lowering the block proposing frequency a bit.”The constant stream of blobs, regardless of how full they are, has made Taiko a top user of them. On Sunday, for example, Taiko posted 25% of all blobs on Ethereum, according to a popular Dune dashboard. That day, Taiko spent nearly $63,000 on blob-related fees. On Thursday, Taiko paid $123,000 in fees for blobs—representing 73% of all costs paid for them across layer-2s—which was its second straight day with a six-figure fee tally. And while most layer-2s pass cost savings onto their users through lower fees, the premium Taiko is paying for decentralization, as of now, isn’t a bill that users need to foot.“For now, it's partially subsidized by the team,” arixon.eth said, adding that the process could be modified in the future so that “blocks are missed until there are enough [transactions] in the mempool for a proposer to push a block to [Ethereum] profitably.”Amid the network’s first airdrop on Wednesday of TAIKO tokens, the network’s native cryptocurrency, the layer-2 averaged around 6.42 transactions per second, according to L2BEAT. Meanwhile, Ethereum registered around 13.6 transactions per second itself.So far, the performance of Taiko’s token has been turbulent. After crashing 40% an hour after it launched, to $2.27 from $3.80, the token’s price had recovered to $2.45, as of this writing, showing a nearly 3% decrease over the past day, according to CoinGecko.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Russia, China Developing 'Independent Payments System' To Ditch US Dollar, Avoid 'External Interference': Vladimir Putin - The Daily Hodl


								A group of economically-aligned nations say they’re building an “independent payments system” in a move away from the US dollar.
At the SPIEF 2024 Conference in Saint Petersburg, Russian President Vladimir Putin said work is underway on a system designed to safeguard the sovereignty of national currencies.










“Within BRICS, we’re working on shaping an independent payment system, free from political pressure, abuse and external sanctional interference.”
Putin’s statement follows initial reports that the China and Russia-led BRICS – which also consists of Brazil, India, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates – will use blockchain technology to power the payments system.
In an interview with the Russian state-owned news outlet TASS, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said BRICS is designing a system that’s fully digital, fair and cost-effective.
“We believe that creating an independent BRICS payment system is an important goal for the future, which would be based on state-of-the-art tools such as digital technologies and blockchain.
The main thing is to make sure it is convenient for governments, common people and businesses, as well as cost-effective and free of politics.”
While the payments system is in development, Ushakov says BRICS nations are focused on boosting banking networks and trade in national currencies.
“Work will continue to develop the Contingent Reserve Arrangement, primarily regarding the use of currencies different from the US dollar.”

American Crypto Advocacy Movement Tops Milestone 1 Million Supporters


																On June 5, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong reported that one million people have joined ‘Stand With Crypto’ as advocates for the industry, adding, “That’s a lot of voters!”
He continued to state that 600,000 of these advocates joined after a Whitehouse veto threat, “and thousands mobilized around the back-to-back historic, bipartisan wins in the House and Senate.”
“Crypto is non-partisan and momentum for pro-crypto policy in America has never been stronger.”


US Crypto Support Grows
The comments came in reference to the Biden Administration attempting to block Republican crypto legislation that would enable banks to custody digital assets for clients.
However, things have gone in favor of the industry recently, with the House of Representatives voting to pass the bill and the passing of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) in May.




The Stand with Crypto Alliance, an advocacy organization focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process, was launched by Coinbase in August 2023 in response to the increasingly heavy-handed enforcement action from regulators.
On June 5, it surpassed a million supporters, with the figure standing at 1,011,058 at the time of writing. It also has had $87 million donated by crypto supporters to further its cause.
Commenting on the potential voters in the November US presidential election, Armstrong said, “It’s a much bigger voting bloc than most people probably would have anticipated.”
Armstrong added that the surge in the group’s membership was fueled by frustration over the Biden administration’s veto and by strong support for the FIT21 bill that would create a new legal framework for crypto assets giving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) more oversight.
Speaking to Reuters, he said:
“I think that it’s just bad politics to be anti-crypto. There’s no voter constituency that you’re winning over by doing that, but you are upsetting a huge number of Americans who’ve used this technology,”
Big Donations for Pro-Crypto Candidates
The crypto industry is spending tens of millions of dollars in this year’s elections to boost friendly candidates against those who are against it.
On June 3, Coinbase announced a $25 million donation to the pro-crypto political action committee (PAC) Fairshake. Other big industry names, including Ripple and venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, have also made donations.

BlackRock Deepens BTC Bet As Spot Bitcoin ETF AUM Barrels Past $21 Billion


								American multinational investment company, BlackRock has surpassed Grayscale in total Assets Under Management (AUM) for Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). This milestone signifies BlackRock’s growing prominence in the ETF sector, highlighting the company’s confidence in crypto-based investments.  

BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Surpasses $21 Billion 
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has exceeded $21.4 billion in assets under management, surpassing Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) by more than $1.6 billion. This massive increase is attributed to the consistent inflows witnessed by BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF since the beginning of the year.
Following the launch of its Spot Bitcoin ETF on January 11, BlackRock has recorded millions in inflows daily, only witnessing a few zero inflows and even fewer outflows for the past five months. 
According to Farside’s data, BlackRock recorded its first-ever inflow on January 11 after its launch, amassing over $111 million. Since then, the ETF has attracted hundreds of millions in inflows, recording its largest-ever daily inflow of $849 million on March 12, 2024. 
Grayscale, on the other hand, has witnessed more outflows than inflows since its launch in January. Unsurprisingly, BlackRock’s IBIT has surpassed GBTC, considering Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF has recorded a total of $17.5 billion in outflows. 
Data from BlackRock’s fund site has revealed that the company’s Spot Bitcoin ETF has accumulated more than 302,536 BTC, constituting more than 1.4% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. In contrast, Grayscale has gathered approximately 285,105 BTC in its trust and currently holds $19.75 billion in assets under management. 
Despite experiencing brief inflows in May, Grayscale continues to face substantial outflows. The most recent drops occurred on June 6 and June 7, with GBTC seeing outflows of $37.6 million and $36.3 million, respectively. 
BTC is currently trading at $69,406. Chart: TradingView
Compared to Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock’s IBIT has been performing extremely well. BlackRock currently charges an annual management fee of 0.25% for its Spot Bitcoin ETFs, while Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF imposes an expensive 1.5% fee. 
This substantial difference in ETF fees has had an influence on GBTC’s outflows since the beginning of the year. Many investors have been shifting assets from Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF to more cost-effective options like BlackRock’s IBIT.

GameStop's decline hits memecoins as GME, KITTY, AMC see red - AMBCrypto



GameStop’s stock price fell after a recent earnings call
KITTY and AMC recorded the highest corrections in the last 24 hours

The memecoin sector continues to be the most volatile space in the crypto market. The recent performances of GME-related memecoins is a case in point, with each of these cryptos recording significant volatility on the charts.
What is happening with GME?
Keith Gill, the internet investor better known by his online handle Roaring Kitty, made a much-anticipated return to the spotlight on Friday after a years-long hiatus. However, his comeback livestream wasn’t met with the celebratory surge some expected.
GameStop’s stock price had already taken a nosedive that morning after the company released a disappointing earnings report and announced a significant new share offering. This negative news overshadowed Gill’s return, and the stock continued to slide throughout his livestream even as he presented his bullish long-term outlook on the company.
By the day’s end, GameStop shares were down a staggering 40%.
The impact wasn’t confined to traditional markets either. A memecoin inspired by GameStop, GME, also saw a wild ride. Its price skyrocketed by nearly 100% in a single day, before crashing back down by 50% within hours.
Despite the reversal, GME still ended the week significantly higher than it began. Gill’s return to social media last month, after a three-year silence, reignited the speculative frenzy surrounding GameStop, with the meme stock craze even spilling over into the cryptocurrency world.

Not all memecoins see corrections!
After surging significantly following Roaring Kitty’s comeback, the memecoins GME, KITTY and even AMC surged. However, on the back of the market’s latest depreciation, memecoins saw much of their value disappear too. For example, GME declined by 51% over the last 24 hours, with the crypto trading at $0.01515, at the time of writing.
AMC, on the other hand, was trading at $0.004811, having fallen by 61% over the same period.
KITTY, the memecoin inspired by Keith Gill’s account, also faced similar selling pressure. However, it was not as significant as the pressure seen by the other two altcoins.
In fact, CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that the price of the altcoin fell by ‘just’ 18.5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.006843.

Hundreds of Millions of Dollars of Offers Accepted on This Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


The Arbitrum Foundation, the organization that supports Ethereum rollup-based Layer 2 network Arbitrum, has received approval to distribute hundreds of millions of dollars to support gaming projects on the network over the next three years.
The proposal, first announced in March, was officially adopted on Friday with over 75% support votes. The proposal will allocate 225 million ARB tokens, worth approximately $215 million at current prices, over three years to a newly created Game Catalyst Program (GCP).


GCP is designed to “…immediately expand awareness and adoption of Arbitrum/Orbit/Stylus by developers and players in the gaming community,” according to the proposal.
Organizations that significantly supported the proposal included L2Beat, Wintermute, and the gaming-focused Treasure DAO, while Blockworks Research and Camelot DAO were among those who voted against it.





The bulk of the funding was allocated to developers; New and early-stage developers have the opportunity to apply for grants worth up to 500,000 ARB (about $483,000 at current prices), while more established developers must apply for investments with a share of value component through tokens, equity or similar means. The remainder of the funds can be allocated to infrastructure-related awards and operational expenses.

Former director of Ripple Sean McBride has published a post on the X social media network to suggest a move that Ripple Labs should make using the large funds it has in its possession.Ripple should "invest, build, repeat"McBride believes that it is now important for Ripple to “acquire another company” and spend on it some of the money it is sitting on. “Reinvest, build, repeat,” he tweeted an encouragement, addressing his former blockchain giant employer. Earlier this year, McBride tweeted that “Ripple has tons of capital.” Recently, the San Francisco-based fintech behemoth secured several important new partnerships. One of them was in Japan, when Ripple announced a new tie-up with specialized blockchain consulting company Hashkey DX based in Tokyo, Japan.The second partnership was inked by Ripple with a payments provider Clear Junction based in the U.K. The goal was to boost the efficiency and security of payouts in pounds sterling and the euro.Ripple shovels 150 million XRPOn Friday, June 7, the Ripple behemoth was spotted transferring a massive 150 million XRP coins to an unregistered blockchain wallet. This data about the transfer worth $78,209,179 in fiat was shared with the cryptocurrency community by the popular crypto tracking service Whale Alert.This staggering transfer raised eyebrows and made many XRP fans leave questions and guesses in their comments as to what is happening and what could be the reasons behind this sizeable XRP transaction. Some were wondering if Ripple began to sell some of its XRP holdings. Bithomp XRP explorer shows that the 150 million left Ripple’s -5x1o91m wallet and went to an anonymous address -63sKxv3. However, behind it stands Ripple, according to the same data source. Therefore, this massive XRP transfer could indeed signify a sale that the crypto decacorn intended to make.

Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Reach Groundbreaking $100,000 Milestone - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD is nearing a significant technical breakout, potentially reaching a milestone of $100,000, according to an analyst.What Happened: Bitcoin is on the cusp of a significant technical breakout if it surpasses its previous peak of about $73,800. Technical analyst JC Parets of AllStarCharts noted that maintaining levels above $70,000 increases the likelihood of Bitcoin reaching $100,000. “The idea was we [Bitcoin] were gonna get to $47,000, take a break, get to $70,000, take a break, and then ultimately breakout to a $100,000,”  Parets said on a “Trends with Friends” podcast last month.Parets highlighted that Bitcoin has followed this pattern so far. “We got to $47,000, we took a break. We broke out, got to $70,000, we’re taking a break. Like this is perfectly normal,” he added. A $100,000 target represents a 40% potential upside from current levels.Also Read: Crypto Analyst Foresees Upswing In Bitcoin’s Value Before Major PlungeThe cryptocurrency has rebounded significantly over the past year, recovering from a severe bear market in 2022. Bitcoin is now forming a “cup and handle” pattern, a bullish technical formation. If this pattern materializes, Bitcoin could potentially reach a measured move price target of about $130,000.Why It Matters: The potential breakout comes after a period of significant volatility for Bitcoin. In late May, pseudonymous trader and crypto analyst Rekt Capital provided insights into Bitcoin’s status and future prospects. Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin was no longer in the “danger zone” but warned of a possible 13% dip from its current value.Rekt Capital explained that Bitcoin typically enters the “danger zone” after a halving event, which reduces miners’ rewards. Despite these concerns, Bitcoin has shown resilience and has been on an upward trajectory, indicating strong market confidence.As Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 mark, it is essential to consider the broader context of its recent performance and the technical patterns that have emerged. Investors and analysts will be closely watching to see if Bitcoin can sustain its momentum and achieve this significant milestone.Now Read: Crypto Analyst Forecasts Monumental Bitcoin Rally By 2026This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock

Binance Active Users Reached 200 Million Mark - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Binance active users achieved growth of more than 30 million in early 2024 despite legal challenges.



The exchange secured regulatory approvals and lifted a 10-month Mastercard restriction.




Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange globally, has demonstrated substantial growth in 2024 despite facing significant legal challenges and government scrutiny.



Binance Active Users Reached 200 Million Mark 4



Binance Active Users Achieve Major Growth in 2024



Binance active users increased by over 30 million in the first half of the year, highlighting the platform’s resilience and continued user trust amid ongoing turbulence in the cryptocurrency market.



The increase in users from 100 million to 200 million on Binance took two years and two months. According to Binance CEO Richard Teng, the company is dedicated to putting the demands of its expanding user base first because it is a user-centric platform.



Throughout 2023, Binance faces numerous difficulties, including lawsuits from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite these challenges, the exchange has made considerable strides in compliance and regulation. In 2024, Binance secured regulatory approvals from several countries, marking a significant step towards bolstering its global operations.




Mastercard Restriction Lifted And Founder Changpeng Zhao Sentenced



As Coincu reported, Binance lifted a 10-month restriction on purchasing cryptocurrency with Mastercard. This decision reinstates the ability for Mastercard users to buy digital assets after the card giant deactivated the option in August 2023. Mastercard’s initial restriction was due to the legal and regulatory issues Binance faced in the United States, including scrutiny from the SEC and the CFTC.



For comparison, the largest American crypto exchange, Coinbase, currently has around 98 million users, which indicates how strong the growth rate of Binance’s active users is.



In a related development, Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of Binance, has surrendered to a low-security federal prison in Lompoc, California. This follows Zhao’s guilty plea to facilitate money laundering on the platform, resulting in his judgment in April. His case draws parallels to another high-profile incident in the crypto world involving Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of FTX.



Overall, despite legal hurdles and regulatory pressures, Binance active user base continues to expand, underscoring the platform’s robust market presence and ongoing efforts to navigate the complex landscape of digital asset regulation.

Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific Partners With AI Firm, Forecasts $3.5 Billion in Revenue


																Core Scientific, a top player in North America’s digital infrastructure industry, has announced a strategic partnership involving a series of long-term contracts extending over 12 years with CoreWeave, an AI Hyperscaler.
Under the agreement, Core Scientific will supply approximately 200 MW of infrastructure to support CoreWeave’s high-performance computing (HPC) operations.
Core Scientific Ventures into AI
The partnership is a significant milestone for Core Scientific as it enters the AI data center space. The company is looking to seize growth opportunities in AI computing while maintaining its strong position in Bitcoin mining.
Adam Sullivan, the CEO of Core Scientific, is optimistic about the transformative potential of this collaboration. He highlights the growing demand for high-power sites and Core Scientific’s ability to meet customer needs efficiently. Their focus on quick and reliable solutions aims to reduce the time needed for power compared to new data center projects.
Beyond the initial 12-year contracts, the agreement with CoreWeave also includes provisions for renewal terms and further expansion. These provisions position Core Scientific as a leading data center operator in the United States, with the potential to become one of the largest in the industry. This partnership is expected to broaden Core Scientific’s revenue sources and increase its earnings.




The HPC infrastructure is forecasted to generate over $3.5 billion in revenue during the initial contract period, complementing Core Scientific’s existing Bitcoin mining business. Core Scientific plans to shift some of its Bitcoin mining capacity towards this expansion to support business continuity and growth.
Core Scientific Expands Infrastructure
In January, Core Scientific’s shares resumed trading on Nasdaq following its bankruptcy and restructuring.
The company then surpassed 20 exahash of energized self-mining hash rate in April 2024. This followed the deployment of S21 miners and the temporary energization of preceding generation miners at data centers capable of supporting their operations financially.
An influx of cash flow enabled Core Scientific to settle $19 million in debt associated with mechanics’ liens and begin completing 72 MW of infrastructure at its Denton, TX, data center. This is part of the company’s broader plan to add 372 MW, contributing to over 20 exahash of hash rate, as part of its growth strategy.
Since April’s Bitcoin halving, which reduced miner rewards by 50%, Bitcoin mining companies like Core Scientific have actively sought to expand their revenues. In line with this trend, other mining firms such as Bit Digital and Hut 8 have diversified their revenue streams into AI.
Notably, Core Scientific reported a net income of $210.7 million in the first quarter of this year, a surge compared to a net loss of $388,000 in the same period of 2023.
