Here’s when the XRP price could hit $0.62


As Ripple Labs nears the conclusion of its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the cryptocurrency community is closely monitoring the potential impact on XRP‘s price. 
With the lawsuit drawing to a close and key economic reports on the horizon, analysts are optimistic that a favorable outcome could push XRP’s price to $0.62.
The culmination of Ripple’s prolonged SEC lawsuit, paired with the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on May 15, is poised to play a critical role in shaping XRP’s market valuation.


As stakeholders anticipate the legal resolution and economic indicators, the market is speculatively poised for a shift from the current price range of $0.46 to $0.57, potentially reaching a higher stable level amidst regulatory clarity and economic stimuli.
Technical analysis and price movements

Currently, XRP trades in a range between $0.46 and $0.57. This price band indicates a delicate equilibrium of supply and demand.
A crucial observation was made on May 7 when XRP’s price dipped below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $0.52, signaling potential bearish dominance in the market. 
The next significant support level is at $0.46, where a robust defense by buyers could stabilize the price and prevent further declines.
For a bullish scenario to emerge, XRP needs to sustain a breakout above the $0.57 resistance level. Such a movement would suggest that the market correction might be concluding, potentially setting the stage for an ascent towards the $0.62 target.
The role of CPI data in XRP’s price trajectory
The upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, scheduled for May 15, is another critical factor to consider. Matthew Dixon, CEO of the crypto rating platform Evai, highlights that a weaker-than-expected CPI could act as a catalyst and awaken XRP, which he described as a “sleeping giant.” 

Dixon believes this could be a bullish catalyst, potentially propelling XRP to the $0.62 mark. The anticipation is that subdued inflation figures might lessen the pressure on monetary policy, encouraging investment in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.
Furthermore, market participants should closely monitor XRP token unlocks, which could negatively impact the token’s valuation.
The convergence of Ripple’s legal developments and economic indicators like the CPI data is setting the stage for a potentially significant price movement for XRP. 
Investors and market observers are closely monitoring these events, which are expected to determine the direction of XRP’s price in the near term. 
A favorable legal outcome and a positive economic report could indeed be the twin engines that propel XRP to the anticipated $0.62 target and beyond.

Whale alert: 10-year inactive Bitcoin wallets move 1,000 BTC


Bitcoin (BTC) long-term holders suddenly activated two dormant wallets on May 12, moving 1,000 BTC worth over $60 million. These whale addresses remained inactive for 10.7 years since September 2013, when this stash was valued at $125,000.
Notably, the Whale Alert account on X posted each transaction with an interval of 20 minutes. According to the alerts, these holdings were valued at $62,890 and $63,565 when the addresses first acquired them.

On that note, the Lookonchain account also reported the dormant whales’ activity, identifying that one address acquired 500 BTC on September 13, 2013, and the other on September 14, 2013.



The short interval between each receiving and, later, spending suggests that both 10-year Bitcoin wallets belong to the same entity. This recent activity could mean simple wallet management or that this whale intends to sell the 1,000 BTC.
Bitcoin dormant whales activity and BTC price analysis
Interestingly, Finbold retrieved data from Santiment showing that increased dormant whale activity usually correlates to BTC’s price top formation. The chart shows that most spikes on this metric were close to a trend reversal, typically bearish.
However, despite the recent two, there is currently significantly low 5-year dormant whale activity in the Bitcoin network.

As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $61,000, and only 1,056 BTC have been moved within this category instead of over 10,000 units during top formations. Moreover, technical analysis, derivatives liquidations, and on-chain metrics suggest Bitcoin could soon rally to $72,000, for over 18% gains.
Conversely, analysts warned of an imminent BTC meltdown, while others are optimistic about an altcoin season potentially surging.

Bitcoin Lightning Network for global corporate transactions? - Let's see... | Cryptopolitan

David Marcus, once the big boss at PayPal and a key player at Facebook, recently made a bold claim: the Bitcoin Lightning Network could soon be the world’s top payment network. Leading his team at Lightspark, he emphasized the growing trend of cryptocurrency becoming a staple in mainstream finance. Quick and Cheap: The Lightning PromiseAt Lightspark, Marcus and his team are all-in on Bitcoin’s potential as a global settlement platform. He talks about Bitcoin being neutral — ideal for hassle-free transactions worldwide. This neutrality is crucial for its widespread acceptance. The Lightning Network, a layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, is designed to speed up transactions and cut costs. This could be a big deal, making it easier and cheaper for both people and businesses to handle money.Marcus believes these changes could greatly improve how we handle money, making crypto more accessible globally. His thoughts come at a time when the mix of digital and traditional finance is getting more attention, showing a move towards more connected financial tech.Coinbase, a top U.S. crypto exchange, has already jumped on the Lightning Network bandwagon, showing the industry is keen on faster, more efficient blockchain tech. Before this, Bitcoin transactions at Coinbase would take 10 minutes to two hours and cost a lot during busy times. The Lightning Network changes the game by handling transactions off the main blockchain, allowing for almost instant transactions with very low fees.Global Reach and Technological SynergyViktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at Coinbase, is excited about what the Lightning Network means for Bitcoin’s future. He thinks this step will make Bitcoin transactions faster and make Bitcoin more useful and reachable worldwide. This marks a major point in the crypto world’s timeline.Previously, Marcus praised Bitcoin’s potential as the go-to currency for Artificial Intelligence systems. This view places Bitcoin at the forefront of tech advances, showing it could lead to new ways to handle transactions and boost Bitcoin’s role in the tech world.Lightning Labs, under CEO Elizabeth Stark, is pushing new features built using Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade from late 2021. Speaking at FT Live’s Crypto and Digital Assets Summit, Stark talked about how they’re working to make stablecoins and other digital assets a reality on Bitcoin’s platform. They’ve started testing transactions with these new assets on the Lightning Network:“We released an early part of the code in October and recently showed off the first-ever transaction on Lightning with an asset. We’re aiming to have crypto dollars and stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain,” Stark said. She pointed out that while digital assets usually run on other blockchains that can have high fees and other problems, Bitcoin’s network is super secure and decentralized, making it ideal for stablecoins.Stark discussed how Bitcoin and stablecoins are good options for people in countries facing inflation and currency problems. She noted a big uptick in stablecoin use since the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in developing countries.“People who need a reliable store of value are really sticking with this. Some are choosing Bitcoin, others go for stablecoins, and some use both,” Stark explained.With the growing importance of the stablecoin market, Stark said it’s essential to have the right setup to allow issuing of stablecoins and real-world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.That’s why Lightnight Labs is building this tech now. Their vision is to create the infrastructure for it. Asset issuers will use the tech to put out real-world tokenized assets.Financial institutions might soon issue gold assets, stablecoins, and other fiat-backed assets on Bitcoin and then make transactions over the Lightning Network.Stark highlighted how this could be a cheaper alternative to traditional finance methods like Visa, where fees can be over 3% in the U.S.:Transacting with stablecoins on Lightning could cost just a cent or even less. That’s a massive drop from what traditional systems charge.

zkSync Mainnet v24 Upgrade Delayed, Sepolia Testnet Restoration Imminent! - Coincu



	

Key Points:




zkSync Developers delay v24 mainnet upgrade to ensure stability of Sepolia test network. 



Issues with eth_sender service and proof submissions resolved, full restoration imminent. 



Investigation ongoing for Sepolia test network issues, impacting mainnet v24 release.




zkSync developers have provided updates regarding the zkSync Era Sepolia testnet, aiming for full restoration in the next few hours. 





The v24 mainnet upgrade, however, faces postponement until late next week to ensure thorough stability evaluation.







Issues plaguing the testnet have been identified and addressed by the zkSync team. The first issue stemmed from instability with the eth_sender service, which disrupted L1 commit block submissions for approximately 24 hours. This was attributed to differences in the gas market for blob pricing on Sepolia. The second issue involved delays in withdrawals due to a failure to submit proofs for over two days, caused by discrepancies between the in-circuit VM and the out-of-circuit VM.

Can Tellor (TRB) Reach $232 Despite $5.46 Million Whale Sell-Off?


In a noteworthy series of moves by crypto whales, a total of $5.46 million worth of Tellor (TRB) tokens were recently moved to centralized exchanges.
This indicates potential sales impacting the token’s market dynamics. The Tellor whales’ activities coincide with TRB’s significant price volatility, suggesting potential profit-taking.
Can TRB Hit $232 Despite Crypto Whales Selling?
Spot On Chain, an on-chain analysis platform, tracked a significant transaction where a crypto whale wallet 0xf2b deposited 10,582 TRB (approximately $1.32 million) to Coinbase. The crypto whale made the transaction at a price of around $124. 
Previously, this wallet withdrew the tokens at an average price of $57.7. Hence, he will realize an estimated profit of $706,000—a 116% gain in nearly two months.

Additionally, several other crypto whales replicated this pattern of buying low and selling high between early March and May 2024. 

“Lastly, please note that this is the sixth whale that withdrew TRB from Coinbase between early March and May and then deposited all tokens back to the CEX for profits in the past 3 days after the price surged up to 108%,” Spot On Chain said.

For instance, another crypto whale wallet, 0xeb1, deposited 10,486 TRB (valued at about $1.38 million) to Coinbase. The crypto whale withdrew TRB at an average price of $76.59. He held the tokens for over two months, securing a profit of $581,000, representing a 72.4% return.

Moreover, a third crypto whale wallet, 0xb4b, engaged in a similar strategy, selling TRB tokens worth approximately $1.4 million to achieve a profit of $488,000 (54.5%). Also, another crypto whale – 0xfac, deposited 10,375 TRB ( ~ 1.36 million) to Coinbase to realize an estimated profit of $461,000.
These strategic trades underscore a common approach among crypto whales to maximize returns within relatively short trading periods.
Despite these substantial sales, TRB’s market performance has demonstrated resilience. The token recently experienced a breakout from a bull flag pattern, a bullish continuation pattern characterized by a swift price movement followed by a consolidation phase resembling a flag. 

This breakout indicates that TRB might extend its uptrend, with crypto analysts like Emre suggesting a potential target of $232.

However, this bullish forecast would be invalidated if TRB falls below a critical support level of $115.As TRB continues to show robust market movements, stakeholders should closely monitor these developments.

Cryptocurrency and SEC Statements by Billionaire Mark Cuban - Bitcoin Sistemi


Billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, recently accused Gary Gensler and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of trying to hinder the developing cryptocurrency industry.
Cuban argues that the SEC's decision to regulate through litigation rather than encouraging compliance creates a hostile environment for new participants. Cuban says:



“They make it impossible to comply with the registration rules. The cost in terms of time and legal fees of trying to register and comply makes it impossible to operate realistically.”

Cuban also explains that the SEC's approach discourages him from investing in companies that plan to issue tokens. Cuban stated:

“If I get an investment opportunity to issue tokens, I say no now. It's not because of the company itself, but because the SEC will not allow the company to operate.”

The entrepreneur also criticizes the SEC for creating a “destructive environment” when the industry could have been improved to increase compliance and protect investors. Cuban believes the cryptocurrency industry is eager to find a way to register and comply and separate legitimate tokens from “junk tokens.”





But Cuban argues that because the SEC's approach makes compliance so expensive and time-consuming, it's difficult for companies to distinguish themselves from less reputable entities. “Junk tokens sit side by side with real companies, and investors have no way of knowing what is junk and what is real,” he says.

U.S. Scrutiny of Tether Raises Concerns for Stablecoin Industry - DailyCoin


        
A major investigation into Tether, the leading issuer of stablecoins, has rocked the cryptocurrency industry.



Concerns have been mounting over Tether’s reserves and potential misuse, raising questions about transparency.



The outcome of the investigation could have a significant impact on the future of stablecoins.
The cryptocurrency industry is on edge as the U.S. government intensifies its investigation into Tether, the world’s leading issuer of stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a steady price, typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. Tether Faces Questions About ReservesThey act as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, allowing users to easily move in and out of crypto positions without enduring the wild price swings common in the market. 
This increased scrutiny stems from concerns that Tether might not have adequately backed its tokens with real-world dollar reserves, raising questions about its transparency and stability. Additionally, allegations have surfaced suggesting Tether could have been used by sanctioned nations and groups to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions.“It’s evident the U.S. government is closely examining Tether,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, a major player in the blockchain and payments industry. “Given their vital role within the crypto space, the potential consequences for the broader industry are difficult to predict.”Tether has maintained it’s actively working to comply with regulations. However, the lack of clarity surrounding its dollar reserves continues to fuel doubts.Ripple Wants to Enter the RingRipple’s recent announcement to launch its own stablecoin in April 2024 underscores the growing acceptance and potential of stablecoins. This move by a prominent industry player highlights the significance of stablecoins within the cryptocurrency landscape.
The coming months are likely to bring further developments in the U.S. investigation. The outcome could have a significant impact on the future of stablecoins and the overall cryptocurrency environment. Increased regulation could bring more stability and legitimacy to the market, but it could also stifle innovation and growth. The industry will be watching closely as this situation unfolds.On the Flipside
Tether argues their reserves are adequate, and the ongoing audits will provide the necessary transparency.



The investigation could encourage the rise of other well-regulated stablecoins, fostering competition.



The launch of new stablecoins indicates the market is adapting and innovating.
Why This MattersThe US investigation into Tether, the dominant stablecoin, throws uncertainty over a financial tool crucial for crypto market stability and user activity. Unraveling Tether’s legitimacy could trigger a domino effect, impacting investor confidence, stablecoin adoption, and potentially the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem’s growth trajectory.Crypto giant Tether is taking on Google in the tech world with a new phone!  This article dives into Tether’s plan to release a decentralized smartphone:Tether’s “Pear Phone” to Battle Google as Tech Giant StrugglesCurious about Tether’s recent profit boom?

Economist taunts Bitcoin replacing fiat is like ‘a sideshow in Las Vegas’


As Bitcoin (BTC) matures, proponents have maintained that the digital asset has the potential to replace fiat currencies, having already found use cases as a legal tender in El Salvador.
However, Professor of Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University, Steve Hanke, has reiterated his longstanding view on Bitcoin, noting its incapacity to take on fiat currencies or precious metals such as gold. He made these remarks during an interview with David Lin, published on May 12.
Hanke likened the possibility to what he termed a ‘sideshow in Las Vegas.’ His sentiments coincide with a period in which institutional investors have increased their allocation in Bitcoin, especially with the rollout of exchange-traded funds (ETF).



“We’re talking about a sideshow that occurs in some places like Las Vegas. As I’ve said since day one, Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset with zero fundamental value,” he said. 

It should be remembered that Hanke was highly critical of El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender, warning that the move could lead to an economic collapse. As reported by Finbold, the renowned economist suggested that countries involved in approving Bitcoin are closely related to corruption. 
Bitcoin is a ‘non-event’
Hanke’s comments were echoed by fellow economist Peter Schiff, who also participated in the interview. Schiff dismissed Bitcoin as a “non-event,” labeling it a sideshow with little relevance in the broader financial landscape.

“It’s important to the people who have bought it, and they’re going to end up losing a lot of money if they don’t sell it. But somebody’s got to get caught holding the bag because somebody’s going to own it when the music stops,” Schiff said. 

Schiff’s skepticism extended to Bitcoin’s potential to replace traditional assets like gold or fiat currencies.

“Central banks are not going to buy it,” he asserted. “It’s not going to replace gold, let alone any of these fiat currencies,” he added. 

Notably, Schiff has also been critical of Bitcoin, questioning its true value and terming it a failure based on factors such as transaction costs. 

VIDEO

The gold bug has noted in the past that Bitcoin might face a “catastrophic crash” due to large amounts of BTC entering into spot ETFs, making it more vulnerable, as BTC ETF buyers are unlikely to be true believers.
In the meantime, Bitcoin is facing bearish pressure and resistance at $65,000. By press time, BTC was trading at $61,183.

Pepe Doge to Skyrocket 7,500% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Doge has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,500% in the coming two days, and Pepe Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Pepe Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Doge by entering its contract address – 7s7VZhFWTez5ykSr214AxnqRTMdcKu5rd77YFAx2DGG1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEDOGE.

Technicals Suggesting Altcoins May Be on the Verge of a ‘Massive Move,’ According to Glassnode Founders - The Daily Hodl


								Technical signals are hinting at an explosion in altcoin prices approaching over the horizon, according to veteran crypto analysts.
Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 62,800 followers that altcoins are likely on the verge of a “massive move.”










The analysts say that ALTS (TOTAL3), which represents the total market cap of crypto assets excluding Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins, appears ready to move up now that both its monthly relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators have potentially bottomed out.
“BTC has recovered some ground after the decline of the last couple of weeks – and has broken higher.
SP&500 and Nasdaq look like they are on the move higher as well.
So – what about ALTS?
Technicals say that we may be standing right in front of a massive move. RSI and MACD suggest the bottom is in – and that a large push higher may set in soon.
How many percentage will we see this time in the possible rally to new highs in ALTS?”
 
Source: Negentropic/X
The RSI and the MACD are momentum oscillators used to spot potential areas of trend reversals.
Looking at Bitcoin, the analysts say that BTC is still inside a large pennant pattern, which traditionally suggests a gradually narrowing consolidation before the next move to the upside.
“BTC still looks like it is about to BLOW higher!
Last week’s candle was a Reversal Candle – a Hammer with a long Wick. Price moved back into the Pennant Structure.
This candle still dominate the structure.
This week’s pullback hence seems like a healthy correction before higher. Correction often pulls back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous impulse move.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,038.

Web3 Watch: Reebok jumps into digital wearable game - Blockworks


If you’ve been pining for the opportunity to have your favorite photos replicated onto a digital Reebok sneaker, you are in luck. 
On Friday, the sports brand announced a new feature in partnership with Futureverse called “Reebok Impact” — an AI-powered tool where users can send a photo via Instagram direct message and in return receive “a custom sneaker in the colors and style of the image.”
Users can create up to four pairs for free and send the file to games like Fortnite and Roblox. 
Leveraging AI creates an easy-to-navigate user experience that meets sneaker fans where they are. The future of fashion has arrived, and this is only the beginning,” Futureverse co-founders Shara Senderoff and Aaron McDonald said in a statement. 
Reebok is the latest to jump into the digital fashion game. Parent company Adidas announced a “long term collaboration” with move-to-earn app STEPN last month, intended to bring Adidas sneaker NFTs to the platform. 
Corporate rival Nike this week also announced new developments in their digital wearable business. .SWOOSH, Nike’s NFT platform now allows users to create their own designs and enter a competition to make their digital shoe real. 
Reebok is not offering users the ability to purchase physical pairs of their “Reebok Impact” sneakers, but the company said using Reebok Impact will come with an “incentive” to make some real-life purchases.

Use of Fake Money Reported Across US After Secret Service Seizes $21,800,000 of Counterfeit Cash in One Year - The Daily Hodl


								Reports of people trying to use counterfeit cash are spreading across the US.
Headlines on various attempts to pay with fake money are popping up around the country, with ABC News declaring counterfeiting is “making a comeback.”










Police in Hilo, Hawaii say someone has been bleaching the ink off of $1 bills and printing $100 marks on top, reports the Fox-affiliated news station KHON.
Police captain Rio Amon-Wilkins says authorities are looking at several persons of interest in connection with the crime.
“Because it’s being printed on original US currency notes, the pen still works properly and doesn’t identify it as counterfeit. This is the first time, to my knowledge, we’ve had this type of case where they’re using the original U.S. currency notes.”
The report is one of several on various attempts to use phony money around the US in the last few weeks alone:
• In Brownsville, Texas, a man is accused of manufacturing counterfeit dollar bills and using them to pay for groceries, hotels, gas and food.
• In Boardman, Ohio, police say counterfeit money was used to enter a community baseball stadium in an ongoing investigation.
• In North Carolina, a man has admitted to bleaching $1 bills and trying to print $100 graphics on top.
In addition, police in Germany say they just confiscated piles of fake cash with a face value of $103 million, as reported by the Associated Press.
Investigators believe the bad bills came from Turkey and were being sent to the US for illicit purposes.
“The bills, known as ‘prop copy or ‘movie money,’ could be recognized as fakes when scrutinized closely, but Germany’s central bank and US authorities believe they could be mistaken for real money in everyday life, police said in a statement.”
The US Secret Service says it seized $21.8 million in fake currency last year, triggering 197 arrests. Although the dollar value of its seizures has dropped in recent years, the agency warns counterfeiting techniques are evolving along with advances in technology.
“The threat of counterfeit U.S. currency to the financial system of the United States continues to evolve. Advances in technology, the availability of scanning and printing devices and the adoption of the U.S. dollar by nations as their legal tender have exacerbated the global threat.”

Render's [RNDR] 20% surge halts: Is the AI token's bull run over? - AMBCrypto



RNDR’s price only moved up marginally in the last 24 hours.
Selling pressure on the AI token has increased of late. 

After a massive weekly rally, Render [RNDR] had a setback as the entire crypto market somewhat turned bearish. But the last few hours were in investors’ interest as the token’s chart turned green. 
Does this mean that RNDR will soon resume its bull rally? 
RNDR pushes the brake 
According to CoinMarketCap, RNDR investors had a gala time last week as the AI token’s price surged by nearly 20%, only to face a correction on the 11th of May. 
The declining price trend didn’t last long, as the token’s daily chart again turned green. At the time of writing, Render was trading at $10.90 with a market capitalization of over $4.2 billion. 
To check whether this was the sign of RNDR resuming its rally, AMBCrypto analyzed its metrics. It was surprising to find that, despite the massive weekly rally, RNDR’s Social Volume declined last week. 
Its Weighted Sentiment also went negative on the 11th of May, which indicated that bearish sentiment was dominant in the market.

In fact, while the token’s price remained bullish, investors might have thought it to be a market top as they started to sell. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that RNDR’s supply on exchanges increased substantially last week. 
Meanwhile, its Supply outside of Exchanges dropped, further establishing the fact that selling pressure was high. 
On top of that, Render’s supply held by top addresses declined slightly, suggesting that the top players in the crypto market were selling.

Render’s bull rally is ending
Though these aforementioned metrics looked bearish, things might turn out to be different. Popular crypto analyst Crypto Tony recently posted a tweet mentioning how he expects an AI tokens season to arrive. 
To check whether that possibility is likely to happen in the short-term, AMBCrypto then took a look at RNDR’s daily chart. As per our analysis, the MACD displayed a clear bullish upperhand in the market. 
Its price was also resting well above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), which can be inferred as a bullish signal.

Nonetheless, the rest of the indicators suggested otherwise. For example, the token’s price touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, which often results in price corrections.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a sharp downtick and was headed under the neutral mark at press time. 
These two indicators hinted that Render bears were stepping up and might push the token’s price down in the near term.

                        Leading financial institutions on Wall Street are shifting their focus towards industrializing proofs-of-concept (PoCs) developed within the blockchain experiment known as Project Guardian.JPMorgan’s blockchain platform, Onyx, is particularly keen on converting the insights gained from its pilot program with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) into tangible products.During the TokenizeThis event held in Miami on May 10, Stephanie Lok, product manager of JPMorgan’s Onyx, said the company is focused on investment fund tokenization as a key area of focus.“That’s a very big focus area: how can we kind of productionize, industrialize what we built out as a proof-of-concept?” Lok stated.WisdomTree Highlights Interest in RWA Tokenization
Another traditional firm heavily invested in blockchain-enabled finance migration is WisdomTree, an asset manager.Maredith Hannon, head of business development for WisdomTree, highlighted the company’s interest in portfolio personalization and blending portfolios with checking accounts.Hannon further elaborated on the potential benefits of real-world asset tokenization for investor portfolios, envisioning the ability to create a myriad of allocation variations and risk profiles.WisdomTree is also exploring the provision of different on-chain services through a unified interface for its clients.The company aims to integrate various financial services, including tokenized portfolios and traditional banking services, into a single application.“Deliver that end value of being able to use your money more effectively. Being able to be in the market, in a money market fund earning 5% versus earning pretty much nothing in your checking account.”As a prominent asset manager involved in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), WisdomTree brings its expertise and experience to the Project Guardian initiative.Launched in May 2022, Project Guardian seeks to explore decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and asset tokenization in wholesale funding markets.The initiative focuses on developing open and interoperable networks, institutional-grade DeFi protocols, asset tokenization, and trusted infrastructure.JPMorgan, DBS Bank, SBI Digital Asset Holdings, and WisdomTree are the main participants in Project Guardian, collaborating to assess the feasibility of DeFi and asset tokenization on a larger scale.Tokenized Funds Continue to Gain Popularity
In a report earlier this year, Moody’s, a leading investment risk assessment firm, revealed the value of tokenized funds surged from $100 million at the beginning of 2023 to approximately $800 million, driven by the rising tokenization of U.S. treasuries.The report highlighted that both public and private blockchains are witnessing the inclusion of various assets.Some of the more notable examples include Franklin Templeton’s U.S. Government Money Fund expanding from Stellar to Polygon, Backed Finance launching a tokenized short-term U.S. treasury bond exchange-traded fund (ETF), and UBS Asset Management deploying a tokenized money market fund (MMF) on the Ethereum blockchain.According to Moody’s, the tokenization of MMFs offers the potential to combine their stability with the technological advantages of stablecoins.Just recently, DigiFT, a Singapore-based fintech company, also announced the launch of its US Treasury bill depository receipt (DR) tokens.Likewise, Turkey’s Misyon Bank has announced its partnership with Swiss firm Taurus to leverage its digital asset custody and tokenization technology.

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) Will Rally 8,000% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gensler Devil (GENDEV), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gensler Devil presents a similar opportunity.



Gensler Devil has a market cap below $14,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Gensler Devil could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Gensler Devil can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gensler Devil on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gensler Devil by entering its contract address – GwoY3GpqrSmws6QW88CyDaJkkTNfrQLGN2zZ1rSbJ6z9 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GENDEV.

                        Shiba InuShiba Inu’s trading price of $0.000023 shows minor fluctuations, yet there’s buzzing speculation about its future growth. Given a marginal 1.7% surge over the past 24 hours, the fervor around Shiba Inu price predictions escalates, with discussions centering on the potential of the token reaching a $1 valuation.Supported by substantial trading activity and a significant market cap, SHIB continues to capture the attention of the cryptocurrency community.Shiba Inu Sees 338% Surge in Token Burns: Millions of SHIB Vanish
Over the past week, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced an impressive 338% increase in its token burn rate, resulting in the permanent removal of 200,591,910 SHIB tokens from circulation.This significant uptick in burning activity reflects the cryptocurrency’s strategy to diminish its supply and potentially boost its value. The dramatic rise in burns, detailed in Shibburn’s latest update, is part of ongoing efforts to enhance Shiba Inu’s market dynamics.
Burn Rate Increase: 338.77% over the past week.
SHIB Tokens Burned: 200,591,910 tokens permanently removed.
Purpose: To decrease supply and improve token value.
Shiba Inu Price Prediction
Shiba Inu present a key pivot point at $0.000024, having an immediate resistance at $0.000025, with subsequent hurdles at $0.000026 and $0.000028.Conversely, support levels are currently found at $0.000022, $0.000021, and $0.000018. A breach below these could lead to a further dip in price, potentially targeting the $0.000018 mark in a more extensive bearish scenario.From a technical standpoint, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 41, indicating a slight bearish bias but not fully oversold, suggesting potential for either movement depending on market inputs.The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.000023 also hints at bearish sentiment, as the current price hovers below this indicator.Shiba Inu Price PredictionShould Shiba Inu’s price sustain below its pivot of $0.000024, it could confirm the bearish outlook. However, any upward movement past this pivot could invite a reversal to bullish conditions. This intricate balance between bearish and bullish signals offers traders a complex landscape to navigate.In conclusion, traders should monitor these levels closely, as a break above $0.000024 could signal a shift towards bullish tendencies, while continued trading below could further cement its current bearish path.Last Chance to Buy Dogeverse Before Launch: Over $15M Raised

Are Altcoins Set for the Moon? Analysts Watch These 3 Key Indicators - Coin Edition


							

Analysts anticipate explosive altcoin rallies, citing the market’s current disbelief stage.
Key indicators watched include the 20-day EMA, Stochastic RSI, and Bitcoin dominance.
Altcoin cap holds above $250B despite a recent 17% drop, signaling a potential upside.




The altcoin market, often overshadowed by the behemoth Bitcoin, might be on the cusp of a significant rally, according to multiple market watchers. These experts closely monitor technical indicators that could signal an impending surge in the value of alternative cryptocurrencies.



In a recent post on X, widely followed crypto analyst Milkybull suggested that the altcoin market is currently in the “disbelief stage.” This phase is characterized by investor skepticism despite positive market trends. 



Historically, this stage has been a precursor to a robust rally, the analyst observed. Milkybull pointed out instances in the 2016 and 2020 cycles where such occurrences were followed by explosive gains for altcoins.







According to TradingView, the total valuation of altcoins has declined 17.55% over the past 30 days to $264.9 billion. Notably, this valuation excludes the market cap of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. 



Despite this downturn, the market cap has managed to stay above the critical $250 billion support level. In parallel, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital asserted that the market is “positioning itself for a future move to the upside.”



The three indicators under scrutiny by prominent traders include the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), the Stochastic RSI, and Bitcoin dominance. The EMA provides a weighted average price over the last 20 days. 



Titan of Crypto, another pseudonymous trader, highlighted that a bullish crossover on the Stochastic RSI, combined with a retest of the EMA20, could signal the start of rally time.



Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance stands at 54.7%, having decreased by 0.56% over the past week. According to technical analyst Yoddha, a further decline in Bitcoin dominance could trigger the beginning of an altcoin season, a period where altcoins outperform Bitcoin.

Gas Gone Cheap! Ethereum Fees Plunge 93% To Rock Bottom Prices


								Ethereum users are rejoicing over a dramatic drop in gas fees, with the network experiencing its lowest point since early 2020. This translates into significantly cheaper transactions, making the platform more accessible for everyday users and developers. However, experts caution that this fee fiesta might be temporary, raising questions about the long-term health of the network.

Ethereum Gas Prices Hit Rock Bottom
Data from from BitInfoCharts shows intraday gas fees dropping 93% from the peak of $30 just six months ago. This translates to a significant cost reduction for various activities on the Ethereum blockchain. Simple asset swaps now cost around $5, while minting NFTs has become a much more affordable endeavor at roughly $9.
This newfound affordability is attributed to a confluence of factors. The recent Cancun-Deneb upgrade is believed to have played a role in optimizing network efficiency. Additionally, a general downturn in network activity coincides with a calmer period in the broader cryptocurrency market.

Source: BitInfoCharts
A Boon For Users, But A Challenge For Miners
While users are celebrating the lower fees, concerns linger about the long-term sustainability of this trend. The near-zero “blob fee” suggests a lack of demand for block space, raising the specter of future congestion and fee spikes. Additionally, lower fees could negatively impact the profitability of miners who secure the Ethereum network.
According to analysts, this situation is a double-edged sword. While lower fees are great for users, they could make it more economical for large players to dominate block space, hindering decentralization.

Ethereum is now trading at $2927. Chart: TradingView
The Quest For Scalability: Enter Multi-Dimensional Gas
The recent gas fee developments highlight the ongoing struggle to optimize Ethereum’s scalability and affordability. In response to these challenges, Vitalik Buterin, the platform’s founder, has proposed a significant upgrade introducing the concept of “multi-dimensional gas.”

This upgrade aims to provide Ethereum with greater flexibility in managing various resources. By taking a more nuanced approach to resource allocation, the network could potentially improve transaction throughput without compromising security.
A Look Ahead: Will Ethereum Maintain Its Momentum?
The dramatic drop in gas fees serves as a welcome respite for Ethereum users. However, the long-term viability of these low fees remains uncertain. The network’s ability to handle future surges in demand and maintain a healthy balance between user experience, miner profitability, and decentralization will be crucial for its continued success.
The proposed multi-dimensional gas mechanism embodies the ongoing efforts to address these challenges. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, its ability to adapt and innovate will determine its position in the ever-changing landscape of blockchain technology.

Hong Kong Police In Search of Four After Crypto Investor Abduction: Report


																The Hong Kong police force is in search of four men who abducted a crypto investor on Tuesday at Tai Lau Leng Village off Po Shek Wu Road in Sheung Shui district.
According to a report by the South China Morning Post, the suspects stopped the 55-year-old woman while she rode in a car with her husband and attacked him with a stun gun when he tried to prevent them from taking her.
Four Abduct Crypto Investor
The unidentified woman was freed around 9:45 pm, roughly an hour after she was taken away in a seven-seater vehicle. She works as a crypto investor, while her 43-year-old spouse owns an information technology firm.
People familiar with the matter said the attack was tied to a HK$15 million (U.S.$1.9 million) crypto investment dispute in which the victim was involved.
Police officers eventually got to the incident scene after receiving a report from the victim’s husband. When the woman was released in Ta Kwu Ling, about 4.3 miles from the crime scene, she went to seek help at the nearest police station.




Further investigation revealed that the captors were between the ages of 30 and 50, and the woman did not know them. She incurred minor arm and leg injuries while her husband sustained wounds on his head, neck, and limbs.
While the police treat the case as unlawful detention and assault, the couple has been sent to a hospital for treatment. The force has made no arrests so far, and the case was the second abduction the city witnessed within 32 hours.
Hong Kong Sees Rise in Crypto Crimes
Hong Kong is currently experiencing a surge in crypto crimes, mostly from financial disputes over digital asset investments.
Last month, CryptoPotato reported that the Hong Kong police force rescued a 19-year-old who had fallen victim to a harrowing ordeal, apprehending three teenagers who were responsible for the assault and unlawful detention.
The victim was subjected to threats and brutal assault with baseball bats over a dispute regarding $23,000 in crypto trading profits. There are nine suspects, but only three were arrested at the crime scene. The police are still in search of the remaining six, comprising four males and two females.

BTC, XRP, DOGE Communities Abuzz Over Elon Musk's X Message

A recent tweet by Elon Musk has garnered significant attention from the Bitcoin (BTC), XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) communities. In his characteristic style, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made a tweet on X prompting speculation and interpretation among his followers.The tweet, which offered a perspective on the workings of the Federal Reserve, has sparked a reaction from the crypto community. In a compelling tweet, Musk drew an analogy between the United States Federal Reserve and the popular board game Monopoly.Musk compared the Federal Reserve's ability to create money to the Monopoly game's rule that allows the bank to never go bankrupt, implying that, like the game, the Fed can always print more money. This metaphor emphasizes concerns about the Fed's quantitative easing (QE) program and its impact on inflation and currency value. In the aftermath of Musk's X post, cryptocurrency communities like Bitcoin, XRP and Dogecoin responded in a variety of ways, offering their perspectives.In response to Musk's post, financial analyst Michaël van de Poppe advocates Bitcoin, silver and gold, predicting that QE might be reintroduced.Some members of the Bitcoin community interpreted Musk's post on how the Federal Reserve works as a recognition of the need for sound monetary policies and the potential benefits of a deflationary digital asset like Bitcoin. "Bitcoin fixes this," they said. This belief stems from the idea that Bitcoin is sound money due to its supply cap and predictable issuance schedule.Some Dogecoin community members replied, including co-founder Billy Markus, also known as "Shibetoshi Nakamoto" on X. Prominent Dogecoin community member "Sir Doge of the coin" also noted, "Dogecoin fixes this."XRP influencer "XRP crypto wolf" said, "Save yourself with XRP and crypto."

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionIn the latest Bitcoin price prediction, the flagship cryptocurrency hovers around $61,154, reflecting a slight 0.60% increase within 24 hours. With a robust trading volume exceeding $13 billion and a market cap nearing $1.2 trillion, Bitcoin demonstrates resilience as bulls strive to maintain the $61,000 support level.Bitcoin Price Prediction
At present, Bitcoin‘s price action revolves around a pivotal point set at $60,975, suggesting a bearish Bitcoin price prediction as long as BTC hold below this level.If the price can sustain itself above this level, it might challenge immediate resistances placed at $63,400, $65,050, and potentially $67,160. If convincingly breached, these resistance levels are critical markers that could lead to further bullish momentum.Conversely, Bitcoin’s support levels are $59,075, $56,640, and $54,400. A dip below these could signal a bearish downturn, intensifying selling pressures and potentially leading to more significant price drops.The technical indicators offer a mixed view. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 45, which lies in neutral territory, hinting at an equilibrium between buying and selling pressures.However, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,875, which is slightly above today’s price, suggests a bearish undertone. This indicates that Bitcoin might struggle to maintain upward momentum unless it can consistently close above this moving average.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewIn summary, while there’s potential for an upside if Bitcoin can overcome key resistance levels, the price’s proximity to the 50 EMA and the neutral RSI pose challenges.Traders should watch for whether Bitcoin can maintain support above the pivotal $60,975 or if it will succumb to bearish pressures, potentially revisiting lower support levels.Mega Dice Presale Nears Completion with $913K Raised: Last Chance Before Price Increase
The Mega Dice presale is close to achieving its target, having successfully raised $913,229 with over 13.23 million $DICE tokens sold out of an available 14.7 million. This surge in investment underscores the growing interest in crypto-integrated iGaming platforms within the Web3 space, where Mega Dice is making significant strides.Layer 2 solutions, while primarily enhancing Ethereum’s scalability, reflect the market’s fluctuations. However, as Ethereum maintains a dominant 63.42% market share with $54.3 billion in total value locked, its performance directly influences Layer 2 outcomes.In the burgeoning sector of GambleFi, Mega Dice stands out by leveraging its native $DICE token to revolutionize the online gaming experience. Players use $DICE for gameplay, reaping benefits such as entry into exclusive competitions and access to a loyalty program that promises generous rewards and VIP experiences.Additionally, Mega Dice has announced a buyback and burn strategy to maintain the token’s scarcity and bolster its market value. With the presale drawing to a close and the next price stage imminent, now is a pivotal moment for potential investors.Stay updated with the latest from Mega Dice on platforms like X/Twitter and Telegram, and consider joining the presale before the price increases to $0.069 per $DICE token.

US House Financial Committee Criticize SEC's Crypto Approach


The US House Financial Committee has aligned with billionaire Mark Cuban’s critique of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach to the crypto industry.
In a May 11 social media post, the Committee explained why Congress must pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act.
US House Committee Believes FIT21 Act Will Solve Crypto Regulatory Issues
This weekend, Cubans took to social media to express concerns about how the SEC’s stance against cryptocurrencies might affect President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. Cuban continued his criticism of the financial regulator in a May 11 social media post, saying the commission and its chair, Gary Gensler, were “trying to destroy the crypto industry.”

“The crypto industry wants a way to register and comply. It wants a way to keep the speculative noise out. Instead the SEC makes it so expensive, time consuming and difficult for those who want to comply, that the junk tokens are side by side with real companies and investors have no way to know what is garbage and what is real,” Cuban added.

In response, the US House Financial Committee acknowledged Cuban’s concerns, noting that the SEC’s current approach hampers the industry’s ability to comply. So, the Committee is pushing the FIT21 Act to address these regulatory gaps. 
The committee believes the legislation would provide much-needed clarity and consumer protections. The law would also end the SEC’s regulation by enforcement approach and enable the US digital asset ecosystem to flourish.

Furthermore, the forthcoming legislation aims to clearly define the responsibilities of both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC. Under the proposed legislation, the CFTC will extend its oversight to encompass crypto commodities, while the SEC’s regulatory domain will be clarified concerning cryptocurrencies offered as investment contracts.

“The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act is the culmination of years of bipartisan efforts to finally provide clarity…This legislation will cement American leadership of the global financial system for decades to come and bolster our role as an international hub for innovation,” said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry.

Notably, efforts to advance the FIT21 Act have been ongoing since its committee approval in July 2023, with a push for a floor vote expected in the coming weeks. Interestingly, the bill has garnered support from major crypto stakeholders. Bitcoin ETF issuer Grayscale said the proposed law “is a welcome effort to achieve regulatory clarity for the crypto ecosystem.”

Similarly, Matt Corva, the General Counsel at Consensys, said that the regulation would help clear the regulatory messes created by federal agencies.

“Regulation could be timely to clean up the mess created by agencies outside their authority and the APA who have been left unchecked for too long. It won’t be [without] compromise, but sensible regulation will move the ball forward for market participants, innovators, and consumers,” Corva remarked.

This Week on Crypto Twitter: Fantasy Top Tops the Charts, Trump Courts Crypto - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for DecryptThis week, a gamified competition among Crypto Twitter influencers generated a frenzy of posts and millions in profits while major public figures like Tom Brady and Donald Trump waded back into crypto waters. Fantasy Top—an Ethereum NFT game that pits social media fan bases against each other in a fantasy football-like competition—made waves this week as tribes of Crypto Twitter users furiously commented and reposted to support their chosen influencers. The game paid out $1.25 million to creators this week, plus potentially millions more in Blast Gold, as a cut of the game’s success. As the first round of the game concluded this week, influencers took victory laps alongside their followers; several accounts shared their bounties with the fans who pushed them over the top.  While most of the buzz surrounding Fantasy Top was positive, given its incredible profitability, others were more skeptical given the long history of “SocialFi” projects with no apparent use case other than generating speculative interest, which typically collapse after stalling.Meanwhile, in the real world, Tom Brady caught some rough jokes at his Netflix roast earlier this week over his current commitment to crypto and former ties to the failed FTX exchange. Many crypto users still welcomed the brief mainstream moment in the spotlight as a sign that crypto can still climb higher.The biggest mainstream news to impact crypto came on Wednesday, however, when former president Donald Trump hosted a dinner party for holders of his NFTs at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. At the gathering, Trump declared his intent to embrace crypto in the United States if re-elected, sending many crypto users into a frenzy. At the same event, another NFT holder asked Trump about BODEN, a meme coin mocking President Joe Biden. Simply by making a quip about it—saying he didn’t think the coin sounded like a good investment—BODEN surged the following day.Remarkably, users of the crypto betting site Polymarket had already waged nearly $100,000 on whether Trump would reference the coin by July. But read the fine print: Trump had to say the word ‘Boden,’ which he failed to. So close, yet so far. For all the frivolity, Trump's event was a stark contrast to Pres. Joe Biden backing the SEC at the start of the week, and many commentators saw a serious election wedge issue developing. “Crypto voters will be heard this election,” former TIME and Bloomberg tech journalist and MoonPay exec Keith Grossman tweeted. “What is really needed is not division but rather a clear regulatory framework that is NOT politicized.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Crypto wallet adds pay-per-use access to premium subscription AIs


The popular crypto wallet, Cake Wallet, has added support to a pay-per-use artificial intelligence (AI) platform that allows access to premium APIs like ChatGPT-4, Dall-E 3, Claude 3 Opus, and more. Finbold exclusively talked to the companies’ founders about using cryptocurrencies for payments in their services.
Vik Sharma, founder of Cake Wallet, announced the implementation of NanoGPT in a post on X on May 12. The AI application is available on Cake’s Marketplace, below the Cake Pay service for pre-paid gift cards.

Now, Cake Wallet users can pay-per-use premium AI chatbots directly from their cryptocurrency self-custody address with Nano (XNO). Moreover, it is possible to swap other supported cryptocurrencies in-app, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Monero (XMR), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Polygon-based USDT, USDC, and others.



“AI chatbots have become very popular and, in Cake Wallet, we believe cryptocurrencies like the ones supported by the app can be a great way to open up access for them [AI chatbots], more efficiently and privately – as we are fully committed to these attributes as a company. Also, nano is perfect for this micropayment use case due to having zero fees.”
– Vik Sharma, for Finbold

What is NanoGPT?
NanoGPT is a cryptocurrency service connected to multiple artificial intelligence APIs bridging crypto payments to a pay-per-use model. This allows users to avoid keeping numerous premium subscriptions to access different AIs according to their specific needs.

Notably, Finbold reported about the tool when it was first launched as a simple Telegram bot that supported only ChatGPT-4. Thus, we again talked to NanoGPT’s founder, Mira Hurley, about the recent partnership with Cake Wallet.

“NanoGPT has improved a lot since it was a simple Telegram bot. We’ve moved from a single model to users being able to select from a range of text and image models; you can continue any old conversation at any time; users can now track their usage to see to what extent our service is cheaper than subscription; we’ve added support via discord, email, and Twitter; and have added just a ton of quality of life improvements.”
– Mira Hurley, for Finbold

As of this writing, Hurley was giving away small amounts of XNO for new Cake Wallet users to try the tool for free.

Subscriptions vs. pay-per-use services using crypto wallets
Interestingly, pay-per-use services are increasingly becoming preferred alternatives to the popular subscription models broadly used by many industries. This model looks at feeless and instant crypto payments as a natural way to make it possible.
In particular, access to premium AIs like ChatGPT-4, Dall-E 3, Claude 3 Opus, and others has earned the attention of developers and companies like Cake Wallet, NanoGPT, and PayPerQ. The latter offers a similar pay-per-use service while taking Bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network, as reported by Finbold in April.
Should users start preferring this new model, companies will need to adjust their offerings and payment options to adapt. However, it is still soon to tell where the pay-per-use concept will lead the AI industry and if crypto payments will be part of that change.

Funding Wrap: Arbelos raises $28M for derivatives-focused exchange - Blockworks


Crypto’s love affair with derivatives drags on. 
In the week’s largest funding round, Arbelos Markets raised $28 million for a principal trading firm specializing in crypto derivatives. Dragonfly led the seed round, which also drew participation from FalconX, Circle Ventures, Paxos and Deribit, among others.
Derivatives are financial contracts that base their value on an underlying asset. Put and call options are examples, as are futures contracts. DeFi pioneered the concept of perpetual futures, a crypto-native innovation that lets futures contracts be traded without an expiration date. Huge leverage, huge risk. 
But Arbelos is less degen and more institutional. In a press release, co-founder and CEO Joshua Lim called it a “smart principal risk-taker with a strong balance sheet and a flexible product.” Former FTX.US CEO Brett Harrison is building a product in a similar vein.

But Arbelos is not a brokerage. It’s a firm that provides liquidity and infrastructure for the trading of assets including derivatives. The firm will use the fresh funds to “improve its quant trading infrastructure, hire top talent, and expand its access to new markets and its range of products,” Arbelos said in a press release.
Arbelos seems to be pitching itself as more trustworthy and grown-up in contrast to the crypto firms that played fast and loose with risk controls and blew up the market in 2022. 
“Post the collapses of last cycle, Arbelos is rebuilding the DNA of the modern primary dealer, and in the process they’re returning trust & transparency to the space at large,” Dragonfly’s Omar Kanji wrote on X.
Founders Fund backs zero-knowledge proof startup
Peter Thiel-backed Founders Fund led a $13.2 million round in Lagrange. Archetype Ventures, 1kx, Maven11, Fenbushi Capital, Volt Capital, CMT Digital and Mantle Ecosystem Fund also contributed.
Lagrange says it’s building a “hyper-parallel ZK coprocessor.” In plainer terms, Lagrange is trying to apply privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs in a way that can handle tons of data — as blockchains tend to do. 
Lagrange has launched zk light clients for Ethereum rollups as an actively validated service on EigenLayer. 
Other notable funding news

AgriDEX, a platform for the tokenization of agricultural commodities, disclosed a $5 million raise. 
Blockchain data access protocol Lava Network announced a strategic $11 million raise. 
Solana-based game developer Seeds Labs raised $12 million.

Hacker returns $71 million worth of crypto to phishing victim


A whale lost 1,155 Wrapped BTC (WBTC), worth $71 million, due to a phishing attack on May 3. Surprisingly, the attacker returned all the funds to the victim a week later.
On May 2, the whale spent $29.6 million DAI to buy 502 WBTC at $58,951. Later, on May 4, the victim created a new address and transferred 0.05 ETH for testing—a usual practice when moving large amounts.
As reported by Finbold, the attacker generated phishing addresses in advance and monitored users’ on-chain activities. When the victim whale was about to transfer WBTC, the attacker sent 0 ETH using a phishing address.

A specific phishing: Address poisoning attack
Interestingly, this attack used a technique known as “Address Poisoning,” as it poisons the victim’s transaction history. The phishing address had the same starting and ending letters as the whale’s new address.
This attack is particularly hard to spot because many crypto wallets hide the middle part of the address with “…” to improve the user interface. Moreover, users often copy addresses from transaction histories and only check the starting and ending letters.
Therefore, the whale mistakenly copied the phishing address and sent 1,155 WBTC to the attacker.
Attacker returns stolen $71 million to phishing victim
On-chain data shows that the attacker immediately converted the stolen WBTC into 22,960 ETH, possibly for money laundering purposes. Lookonchain reported the entire development of these events and summarized it in a post on X on May 12.
Attacker’s swap history. Source: Etherscan / Lookonchain
Notably, the whale tried to contact the attacker, offering a 10% bounty for returning 90% of the funds. Initially, the attacker did not respond, but as the cybersecurity company Slow Mist tracked the attacker’s IPs, possibly from Hong Kong, the attacker replied and returned all the funds.
To prevent such attacks, users should carefully check the entire address when making transfers. Saving trusted addresses in the address book and copying from there is recommended. Enabling small transaction filtering in wallets can also help filter out phishing transactions, further preserving the funds.

How To AI: Fine Tune Your Chatbot Privacy Settings - Decrypt

It may be easy, even comforting, to imagine that using AI tools involves interacting with a purely objective, stoic, independent machine that knows nothing about you. But between cookies, device identifiers, login and account requirements, and even the occasional human reviewer, the voracious appetite online services have for your data seems insatiable.Privacy is a major concern that both consumers and governments have about the pervasive spread of AI. Across the board, platforms highlight their privacy features—even if they're hard to find. (Paid and business plans often exclude training on submitted data entirely.) But any time a chatbot “remembers” something can still feel intrusive.In this article, we will explain how to tighten your AI privacy settings by deleting your previous chats and conversations and by turning off settings in ChatGPT, Gemini (formerly Bard), Claude, Copilot, and Meta AI that allow developers to train their systems on your data. These instructions are for the desktop, browser-based interface for each.ChatGPTStill the flagship of the generative AI movement, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has several features to improve privacy and alleviate concerns about user prompts being used to train the chatbot.In April, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT could be used without an account. By default, prompts shared through the free, account-less version are not saved. But, if a user does not want their chats used to train ChatGPT, they still need to toggle the “Temporary chat” settings in the ChatGPT dropdown menu at the top left of the screen.If you have an account and subscription to ChatGPT Plus, however, how do you keep your prompts from being used? GPT-4 gives users the ability to delete all chats under its general settings. Again, to make sure chats are also not used to train the AI model, look lower to “Data controls” and click the arrow to the right of “Improve the model for everyone.”A separate “Model improvement” section  will appear, allowing you to toggle it off and select "Done." This will remove the ability of OpenAI to use your chats to train ChatGPT.There are still caveats, however."While history is disabled, new conversations won’t be used to train and improve our models, and won’t appear in the history sidebar," an OpenAI spokesperson told Decrypt. "To monitor for abuse—and reviewed only when we need to—we will retain all conversations for 30 days before permanently deleting."Claude“We do not train our models on user-submitted data by default,” an Anthropic spokesperson told Decrypt. “Thus far, we have not used any customer or user-submitted data to train our generative models, and we’ve expressly stated so in the model card for our Claude 3 model family,”“We may use user prompts and outputs to train Claude where the user gives us express permission to do so, such as clicking a thumbs up or down signal, on a specific Claude output to provide us feedback,” the company added, noting that it helps the AI model “learn the patterns and connections between words.”Deleting archived chats in Claude will also keep them out of reach. “I do not retain or have access to any previously deleted chats or conversations,” the Claude AI agent helpfully answers in the first person. ”My responses are generated based on the current conversation only.”Like ChatGPT, Claude does hold on to some information as required by law.“We also retain data in our backend systems for the amount of time specified in our Privacy Policy unless required to enforce our Acceptable Use Policy, address Terms of Service or policy violations, or as required by law,” Anthropic explains.As for Claude's collection of information across the web, an Anthropic spokesperson told Decrypt that the AI developer’s web crawler respects industry-standard technical signals like robots.txt that site owners can use to opt-out of data collection, and that Anthropic does not access password-protected pages or bypass CAPTCHA controls.GeminiBy default, Google tells Gemini users that “your conversations are processed by human reviewers to improve the technologies powering Gemini Apps. Don't enter anything that you wouldn't want to be reviewed or used."But Gemini AI users can delete their chatbot history and opt out of having their data used to train its model going forward.To accomplish both, navigate to the bottom left of the Gemini homepage and locate “Activity.”Once on the activity screen, users can then turn off “Gemini Apps Activity.”A Google representative explained to Decrypt what the “Gemini Apps Activity” setting does.“If you turn it off, your future conversations won’t be used to improve our generative machine-learning models by default,” the company representative said. “In this instance, your conversations will be saved for up to 72 hours to allow us to provide the service and process any feedback you may choose to provide. In those 72 hours, unless a user chooses to give feedback in Gemini Apps, it won’t be used to improve Google’s products, including our machine learning technology.”There is also a separate setting to clear out your Google-connected YouTube history.CopilotIn September, Microsoft added its Copilot generative AI model to its Microsoft 365 suite of business tools, its Microsoft Edge browser, and Bing search engine. Microsoft also included a preview version of the chatbot in Windows 11. In December, Copilot was added to the Android and Apple app stores.Microsoft does not provide the option to opt out of having user data used to train its AI models, but like Google Gemini, Copilot users can delete their history. The process is not as intuitive on Copilot, however, as previous chats still show on the desktop version’s home screen even after being deleted.To find the option to delete Copilot history, open your user profile at the top right of your screen (you must be signed in) and select “My Microsoft Account.” On the left, select “Privacy,” and scroll down to the bottom of the screen to find the Copilot section.Because Copilot is integrated into Bing’s search engine, clearing activity will also clear search history, Microsoft said.A Microsoft spokesperson told Decrypt that the tech giant protects consumers’ data through various techniques, including encryption, deidentification, and only storing and retaining information associated with the user for as long as is necessary.“A portion of the total number of user prompts in Copilot and Copilot Pro responses are used to fine-tune the experience,” the spokesperson added. “Microsoft takes steps to de-identify data before it is used, helping to protect consumer identity,” adding that Microsoft does not use any content created in Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams) to train underlying “foundational models.”Meta AIIn April, Meta—the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp—rolled out Meta AI to users.“We are releasing the new version of Meta AI, our assistant, that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses,” Zuckerberg said in an Instagram video. “Our goal is to build the world's leading AI and make it available to everyone.”Meta AI does not provide users the option to opt out of having their inputs used to train the AI model. Meta does give the option to delete past chats with its AI agent.To do so from a desktop computer, click the Facebook settings tab at the bottom left of your screen, located above your Facebook profile image. Once in settings, users have the option to delete conversations with Meta AI.Meta does explain that deleting conversations here will not delete chats with other people in Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on whether or how users could exclude their information from being used in Meta AI model training, instead pointing Decrypt to a September statement by the company about its privacy safeguards and the Meta settings page on deleting history.“Publicly shared posts from Instagram and Facebook—including photos and text—were part of the data used to train the generative AI models,” the company explains. “We didn’t train these models using people’s private posts. We also do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs.”But anything you send to Meta AI will be used for model training—and beyond.“We use the information people share when interacting with our generative AI features, such as Meta AI or businesses who use generative AI, to improve our products and for other purposes,” Meta adds.ConclusionOf the major AI models we included above, OpenAI’s ChatGPT provided the easiest way to delete history and opt-out of having chatbot prompts used to train its AI model. Meta's privacy practices appear to be the most opaque.Many of these companies also provide mobile versions of their powerful apps, which provide similar controls. The individual steps may be different—and privacy and history settings may function differently across platforms.Unfortunately, even cranking all privacy settings to their tightest levels may not be enough to safeguard your information, according to Venice AI founder and CEO Erik Voorhees, who told Decrypt that it would be naive to assume your data has been erased.“Once a company has your information, you can never trust it’s gone, ever,” he said. “People should assume that everything they write to OpenAI is going to them and that they have it forever.”“The only way to resolve that is by using a service where the information does not go to a central repository at all in the first place,” Voorhees added—a service like his own.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Solana Price Prediction - Could Solana Regain Bullish Momentum And Push To $200?


								Solana has seen its price struggling to return to bullish levels for the past month. Solana previously reached $208 on March 18 after a strong price uptick spanning over five months. However, this cross over $200 was very brief as Solana dipped to $167 before reversing and reaching $203 again on April 1. 

Again, this cross over $200 was also brief and Solana has been on a downfall since then. Interestingly, the recent price level has put Solana on a 30% correction in the past six weeks. While this is a hard crash, Solana is now looking prime to resume its uptrend, with indicators now flashing bullish.
Solana To Regain Bullish Momentum?
Solana’s parabolic price rise from October 2023 to April 2024 led to an overheated market that was bound to correct. This rise was mostly exacerbated by the surge in popularity of Solana meme coins and the general bullish crypto market greed spearheaded by Bitcoin. 
This uptick saw Solana briefly overtaking BNB in market cap rankings after fully displacing XRP and ADA. However, as the greed flipped to caution, Solana started to correct with the rest of the market.
Solana dipped to a low of $120 on May 1 with the bulls defending this price support. According to a crypto analyst known pseudonymously as Inmortal, this was the last major price correction for Solana in the current market cycle. 
As a result, Solana now finds itself ranging around a minor support at $140. Per a SOL chart shared by Inmortal on social media, the crypto is now ready to march to a fresh all-time high of $320.


Inmortal is not the only analyst predicting a bullish Solana move. Analysts Maximilian FX and Orson Fawley also believe Solana is ready to beat the $200 price mark again.

Solana is currently trading at $145. Chart: TradingView
Price Levels To Watch For Solana’s Next Move
At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $145, down over 30% from its yearly high of $208. After such a sharp drop Solana has created some key price levels to watch during its next big move. The first notable price resistance is at $158. 
If Solana can break back above $160, it may signal the correction is over and the uptrend has resumed. Other resistance levels on the journey to $200 are around $175 and $185. On the other hand, a drop below $140 risks a move toward the next major support level at $120. 

Although the overall crypto market sentiment is currently neutral, the environment remains favorable for a SOL price recovery.

Can Ethereum bulls take bears out of the market? - AMBCrypto



The positive reading of the bulls and bears indicator suggests that the price might increase.
Ethereum’s network was overvalued and could hinder the potential upswing.

The price of Ethereum [ETH] might have decreased by 7.30% in the last 24 hours, but an assessment of a key indicator suggested that the decline might soon end.
The indicator talked about here is the Bulls And Bears metric provided by IntoTheBlock. This indicator can be measured in addresses or volume.
However, the focus is usually on large buyers or sellers, as they have a big influence on price movements.
The 1% want to keep the faith
A net negative of the Bulls and Bears indicator suggests more large sell orders than buys. In this instance, the price of the asset involved might decrease.
But for Ethereum, data showed that the reading was positive, indicating bullish confidence in the price trend. Should this metric maintain its position over the coming days, then ETH might be able to rise toward $3,100.

However, failure to sustain the status quo or improve on it could send the price of the altcoin below $2,800. When AMBCrypto looked at Ethereum’s STH-NUPL, we observed that market participants were not exactly confident in the cryptocurrency.
STH-NUPL stands for Short Term Holder — Net Unrealized Profit/Loss. With this metric, one can have an idea of the behavior of short-term investors.
Investors panic, but ETH may come to their aid
From our analysis, ETH’s underwhelming price action has changed the sentiment investors have toward the coin. In March, the metric was in the optimism (yellow) region.
At that point, holders were confident in ETH’s price action. But as of this writing, that reading has reached the capitulation (red) region, indicating that market participants are in fear.
Source: Glassnode
However, fear can act as fuel for a bounce. If the STH-NUPL continues to fall, ETH’s price might also decrease.
Moving, on, a turnaround might occur as intense fear could trigger a harder upswing if buying pressure increases.
In this instance, Ethereum might target a rise toward $3,500. Besides this metric, AMBCrypto found another indicator suggesting that ETH might soon recover.
This time, we looked to the dormant circulation. According to on-chain data from Santiment, the 90-day dormant circulation had dropped to 9246.
If the metric increases, it means that coins that have not moved for a long while are starting to change wallets. Sometimes, this means old hands are selling.
Source: Santiment
Thus, the recent decline implied that long-term Ethereum investors were not selling as much as they did around the 7th and 8th of May.

However, the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio suggested that ETH might still be overvalued. Low values of the NVT suggest undervalued.
But for Ethereum, the metric spiked, indicating that the network is overvalued relative to transactions.

Bitcoin or Ethereum? We asked ChatGPT which asset is a better buy for summer 2024


As summer 2024 approaches, the debate intensifies between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), two major players in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital gold, offering stability in times of economic uncertainty.
This perception is supported by its reduced volatility post-halving, now lower than that of many S&P 500 companies, according to Fidelity.
Ethereum continues to push the envelope with technological innovations like the recent Dencun upgrade, which aims to cut fees and enhance scalability. However, these changes have brought back inflationary aspects, moving away from the deflationary trend set by the 2022 Merge.


This has led to heightened volatility, with Ethereum’s implied volatility remaining significantly higher than Bitcoin’s despite the overall market calming.
With their divergent roles in investment portfolios—Bitcoin as a burgeoning digital asset and Ethereum as a technological pioneer—Finbold sought insights from ChatGPT, OpenAI’s advanced AI model, to determine which might excel in the coming months.
This analysis highlights the need to evaluate Bitcoin’s appeal as a growing store of value against Ethereum’s progressive platform in a rapidly changing market landscape.
ChatGPT’s analysis: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum investment prospects
According to ChatGPT, the decision largely depends on individual investment strategies and risk tolerance. Bitcoin is generally better suited for investors seeking stability and a relatively safe store of value, akin to digital gold, especially amidst economic uncertainties. It appeals to risk-averse individuals or those new to cryptocurrencies.

Conversely, Ethereum fuels a platform for decentralized applications and is a major player in blockchain technology. Investors who believe in the future of these technologies may prefer Ethereum.

While Bitcoin offers stability and potential for incremental growth, Ethereum provides a gateway to a rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem with higher risk and potentially higher rewards.
Ultimately, diversification with both BTC and ETH can be a way to manage risk and potentially benefit from the growth of both major cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin and ETH recent price performance

As of 2024, the year-to-date performance of Bitcoin and ETH presents a clear contrast in investment returns. Bitcoin has seen a significant rise, with a YTD increase of 45.16%, showcasing its volatile yet high-growth nature. The current price of Bitcoin stands at approximately $61,200.
On the other hand, ETH has gained 28% YTD, with its current price at about $2,921.
The choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum should align with individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and interest in the technological aspects of cryptocurrencies. 
While Bitcoin offers stability and potential for incremental growth, Ethereum provides a gateway to a rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem with higher risk and potentially higher rewards.

Wall Street Giants Unveil Crypto Plans To Boost Institutional Adoption - Coin Edition


							

Renowned financial institutions set to test novel blockchain-based regulated settlement network.
Identified institutions for the test include JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Visa, and Mastercard.
Polygon’s Colin Butler considers the developing trend a signal for mass crypto adoption.




Renowned financial institutions, including JPMorgan, Citi, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo, are among the organizations that will test an upcoming regulated settlement network involving the common settlement of tokenized assets on shared-ledger technology. According to reports, payment giants Visa and Mastercard and global financial messaging service Swift will also participate in the testing process.









The innovation comes amid growing concerns over the struggles of the U.S. dollar, the universal settlement currency. In a recent report, the billionaire Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, warned that the greenback could collapse. Hence, efforts by the identified Wall Street giants to explore asset tokenization, an idea that Citi analysts predict could become a $5 trillion market by 2030.







Colin Butler, global head of institutional capital at Polygon, considers the developing trend a signal for mass crypto adoption. Butler described it as the five-yard-line for mass institutional adoption. He noted that adding the latest test is “incrementally more important” than earlier trials like JPMorgan’s onyx private blockchain and unified ledger, a concept introduced by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) last year.









Rendering his opinion on the ongoing development, Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president for blockchain and crypto at Mastercard, highlighted the importance of significant partnerships in blockchain exploration. According to him, it will be critical for public and private organizations to partner closely to explore how to apply blockchain solutions to solve real-world pain points and improve efficiencies.



Dhamodharan’s comment supports the statement by Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive, who described asset tokenization as “the next generation for markets.” Fink’s statement aligns with his company’s recent announcement that it has entered the second stage in its plan for a crypto-based revolution in financial markets. BlackRock noted the revolution would involve launching a tokenized private equity fund.

Religious leaders debate going to church in the metaverse

When the first radio and television broadcasts began to trickle into homes around the world, religious programming was among the early mainstays of both new mediums. Now, as the world pivots away from flat, 2D screens and frequency-bound audio broadcasts, religious practitioners from around the globe have begun adopting metaverse, Web3, spatial computing, and artificial intelligence technologies as conduits to faith. However, there are still naysayers who believe there are dangers associated with these technologies, faith leaders who wonder if modern technological trappings are necessary, and billions of traditional religious followers awaiting guidance. On the supporting side, Sreevas Sahasranamam a Professor at the University of Glasgow, recently expounded on the positive potential for a metaverse for practitioners of the Hindu faith in Swarajya magazine:“Imagine getting Geetopadesha straight from Lord Krishna. No, I am not talking about being on a Sci-Fi time machine to take me back in time to the Kurukshetra war. Rather, I am talking about being in my living room, donning the role of Arjuna, seeking answers to my internal battles through Geetopadesha from Lord Krishna's avatar on a Ray-Ban Meta glass.”Many see the immersive qualities of the metaverse, especially when experienced through virtual reality, as a method to bring them closer to the scriptures and stories surrounding their religions. Sahasranamam also wrote about using the metaverse as a meditation aid, saying that the immersion it offered could lead to deeper and more meaningful experiences. Not everyone is as pumped about the potential for the metaverse as a religious tool. Gavin Ortlund and Jay Kim, theologians and Christian pastors from the United States, see it as something that could add to the current fellowship paradigm, but both men appeared to agree that it wasn’t a replacement for physical churches. The two discussed the issue in a recent video. During the talk, Kim wondered aloud if the idea of “church in the metaverse” was an oxymoron. The duo’s main objection appears to be the digital/virtual nature of the metaverse. Per Ortlund:“So, baptism and the Lord’s Supper, and those are physical acts, a church is irreducibly physical, you know, you need physical bodies for church because you have to have people there to get into the water or to eat the bread and wine. And so that’s just one example of where something gets lost if you’re moving away from face to face, bodily contact.”In Rome, the Catholic church takes a different view altogether. It embraces some metaverse tech, having dabbled in Web3, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and metaverse for the past couple of years, but Pope Francis, its current leader, isn’t a fan of all future-facing technologies. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the Pope had some choice words concerning the onset of the artificial intelligence era:“There is the substantial risk of disproportionate benefit for the few at the price of the impoverishment of many.”His ultimate prescription is to advocate for the development of a strong moral and legislative bulwark against the existential and detrimental harms posed by AI, though he does recognize the benefits of technology when used responsibly.

Another Bitcoin Earthquake in Hong Kong: This Time They Are Working on "Bitcoin Collateralized Mortgage" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Hong Kong, known for its financial center status, recently hosted the Bitcoin Asia conference. The event attracted a significant number of participants from mainland China, despite the country's ban on commercial cryptocurrency trading. Organized by BTC Inc, which also runs the Bitcoin Conference and owns Bitcoin Magazine, the conference was attended by approximately 5,500 participants, half of whom are estimated to be from mainland China.
David Bailey, co-founder and CEO of BTC Inc, noted that interest in the conference was strong due to Hong Kong's imminent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and anticipation of the launch of Ethereum ETFs, as well as an increase in the development of layer 2 projects. “I think ETFs are kind of an admission that Bitcoin is here to stay,” Bailey said.



New ETFs in Hong Kong that accept in-kind subscriptions and allow purchases made with Bitcoin and ETH have been positively received by cryptocurrency investors. According to Bailey, this feature is “very important” because crypto investors can use ETF shares as collateral for loans. Harvest Global and ChinaAMC, managers of Hong Kong's crypto ETFs, confirmed they are working to promote collateralization of ETF products in the city.

Bitcoin Hovers Below $62,000, But Could This Signal a Bottom? - DailyCoin


        
The price of Bitcoin has slumped after reaching a record high. Analysts are now debating whether the worst is over.



Weak investors have likely sold their holdings, while strong believers are accumulating more Bitcoin. 



Analysts suggest the lack of widespread “buy-the-dip” chatter could be a bullish signal.
After reaching a new all-time high of $73,750 in March, Bitcoin has experienced a significant correction, consolidating around the $60,000 mark. This price drop initially ignited a “buy-the-dip” frenzy among cryptocurrency traders, confident that Bitcoin would quickly rebound. Is Bitcoin Price Nearing a Bottom?Recent trends suggest this buying pressure might be waning, and according to some analysts, this could be a positive sign for the future of Bitcoin’s price. Cryptocurrency analytics platform Santiment observed a decline in social media chatter around “buying the dip,” which they view as a potential indicator that the market is nearing a bottom. Historically, periods of extreme negativity often follow Bitcoin crashes, with “buy-the-dip” sentiment fading as fear sets in. However, Santiment suggests that the current decline in such conversations might signify a shift. 
With the weak hands, or risk-averse investors, likely having sold their holdings, the remaining players could be the more resilient bulls who are strategically accumulating Bitcoin at its current price point. While definitively identifying a market bottom remains impossible until after the fact, some technical factors provide a glimmer of hope. Key support levels on the Bitcoin chart haven’t been breached, and the underlying fundamentals of the cryptocurrency haven’t changed significantly. If Bitcoin can maintain its position above $60,000, it could be a strong indication that the correction has reached its floor.Bullish Signs Emerge Despite Short-Term DipFurther bolstering the bullish case is the ongoing positive narrative surrounding the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Increased mainstream adoption through these exchange-traded funds could trigger a significant price upswing for Bitcoin. 
Crypto analyst Willy Woo highlights another positive technical indicator, Bitcoin’s risk signal recently printed a lower high. This formation has historically paved the way for bullish trends, suggesting a potential reversal in the near future.Bitcoin is currently trading at $61,000, reflecting a 4.2% dip in the last week. While the immediate future might see continued consolidation, factors like the halving event, which significantly reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, still has the potential to lead to bullish price movement in the coming months.On the Flipside
The decline in “buy-the-dip” chatter could also indicate a waning of investor interest, rather than just resilience from remaining holders.



While historical trends offer some insight, technical indicators like the “lower high” haven’t proven to be foolproof predictors of future price movements.
Why This MattersThe decline in “buy-the-dip” chatter could signal a shift in investor sentiment, with fear giving way to strategic accumulation by long-term holders. This, combined with strong technical indicators and upcoming events like ETF approval and the halving, suggests a potential bottoming out and future price surge for Bitcoin.Bitcoin has seen a lot of innovation lately.

Shiba Inu Adoption Grows: Buy Nike Gear and PS5 with SHIB


CoinGate, a fintech company based in Lithuania, has boosted the utility of Shiba Inu (SHIB) by integrating it with Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). 
This strategic move allows SHIB holders to purchase products from major brands like Nike and book services like Airbnb.
Shiba Inu Price Consolidates Despite Growing Adoption
The payment gateway CoinGate acts as a link between crypto and traditional finance, facilitating digital asset transactions for goods and services. The inclusion of SHIB tokens on these platforms enhances accessibility and presents numerous opportunities for SHIB holders to participate in real-world transactions. 

“Shibarmy, use your SHIB to book Airbnb, grab the latest games from Steam & PS5, refresh your wardrobe with Nike & Zalando and more,” CoinGate wrote.

Moreover, Shiba Inu is not just expanding its transactional use. It is trying to evolve beyond its meme coin origins. The launch of Shibarium, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, represents a significant step forward in improving blockchain efficiency. 
This update includes a major hard fork completed earlier this month, which is expected to result in faster transactions and more stable gas fees, enhancing the overall user experience.

In April, the Shiba Inu team also made headlines by raising $12 million to develop a new layer-3 blockchain. This fundraising attracted significant contributions from notable investors, including Polygon Ventures, Mechanism Capital, and Animoca Brands, highlighting the growing confidence in SHIB’s potential.
Despite these advancements, the price of SHIB has been consolidating. Since May 7, it has fluctuated between $0.00002379 and $0.00002227. A breakout could propel the price to $0.00002558, marking an increase of over 13% from current market price.

Crypto market's weekly winners and losers - TON, RNDR, BONK, CORE - AMBCrypto

$81,000 Drained From Wells Fargo Account, Sent To Citibank - Victim Says She Received No Alerts, No Care, No Compensation - The Daily Hodl


								A woman who discovered tens of thousands of dollars missing from her Wells Fargo account says the financial giant is failing to protect its customers.
The victim, who wants to remain anonymous to protect her identity, says thieves looted more than $81,000 from her account via electronic transfers, reports FOX News Memphis.










The woman says she had only withdrawn money from her account three times after opening it five years ago.
She says the incident happened in November, but she noticed the theft months later because she did not receive any suspicious activity alert or notification from Wells Fargo.
“I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me. I wasn’t expecting anything to go out of that account. I called the bank immediately…
I would want them to refund or reimburse my money back.”  
The victim says Wells Fargo told her the funds were transferred to a Citibank account under her name and social security number. But she says she never opened a Citi account and was not alerted by the banking giant that someone was using her personally identifying information to open one.
She says she’s worried that she may not see a single cent of her money after both Wells Fargo and Citi told her that they would not reimburse the looted funds. She also says Wells Fargo is blaming her for not taking immediate action.
“[They’re] saying, ‘If you would have told us within two hours, we would have stopped that transaction from happening,’ when they did not even send an alert.”
The victim says she doesn’t know how her details got exposed because she only shared her name, social security number and bank account with two potential lenders in September when she was buying a house and to the town she’s living in for bills purposes.
Without recourse, the woman now says she’s taking all her money out of her Wells Fargo account.
“I am changing banks. I am not ever going to trust a bank that does not care for its customers.”

Canada’s Financial Regulator Fines Binance Holdings $4,300,000 Over Alleged Anti-Money Laundering Failures: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Regulators in Canada have reportedly fined Binance millions of dollars after the crypto exchange allegedly failed to comply with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws.
According to a new report by Reuters, The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) is penalizing the world’s largest crypto exchange platform by volume after it failed to register as a foreign money services business.










FINTRAC says it fined Binance $4.38 million after it failed to report receiving crypto assets worth C$10,000 ($7,310) or more on 5,902 separate instances between June 1st, 2021 and July 19th, 2023.
Binance decided to leave Canada in May of last year after it said it had issues with the country’s regulations on investor limits and stablecoins.
At the time, Binance said Canada’s new regulations rendered its market “no longer tenable.”
 “Unfortunately, new guidance related to stablecoins and investor limits provided to crypto exchanges makes the Canada market no longer tenable for Binance at this time. 
We put off this decision as long as we could to explore other reasonable avenues to protect our Canadian users, but it has become apparent that there are none.”
However, Binance said that it would consider returning to Canada  the country establishes proper regulations. Also last year, Changpeng Zhao, the Canadian chief executive of Binance, pleaded guilty in a US court to violating anti-money laundering laws.
Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison and Binance was slapped with a massive $4.3 billion penalty.

Bitcoin Nears $60,000 Amid Post-Halving Volatility and Market Speculation



                    

Bitcoin‘s price recently approached the $60,000 support level as it faced the post-halving “danger zone,” causing concern among investors. 



On May 10, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView highlighted Bitcoin’s intraday lows reaching $60,190 on Bitstamp. 




The cryptocurrency experienced a sharp decline from around $63,000, sparking varied speculations about the cause of this drop.



Trader Skew, discussing the market dynamics on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out, “Monthly open has been swept again as well monthly buyers taken out. 



If bulls want higher & want to break this downtrend its here imo,” indicating a critical juncture for Bitcoin bulls around the $60.8K to $61K range, which he identifies as a key area for potential bullish action.




Material Indicators, a trading resource, suggested that large-volume institutional players might be influencing the market, speculating, “that some institutional entity may not want to see Bitcoin breakout over the weekend while the BTC ETF market is closed,” reflecting concerns over market manipulation during off-hours.



An analysis of the order book on Binance showed a new sell block around $62,500, which was predicted to possibly adjust post-weekly close.

Material Indicators further speculated, “I won’t be the least bit surprised if this sell wall moves lower to push price down. 




“I also won’t be surprised if we see a roof pull after the W candle closes on Sunday,” suggesting potential strategic moves in the market.



Rekt Capital, a popular trader and analyst, updated his views on Bitcoin’s behavior post-halving. 



He noted that the typical price drop following a halving event was nearing its end, marking a close to the “danger zone.” 



He recalled his prediction from the end of April about a significant downturn, which materialized as Bitcoin fell to two-month lows at $56,500. 



Reflecting on the market’s response, he concluded, “Bitcoin indeed downside wicked below the Re-Accumulation Range Low just like in 2016. 



Thus price-wise, the Post-Halving ‘Danger Zone’ purple has been satisfied,” yet he also noted, “Time-wise however, the ‘Danger Zone’ officially ends in 2 days.”

Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) Will Explode 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PEPEVIR will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Viral Pepe.



Currently, Viral Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PEPEVIR on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Viral Pepe by entering its contract address – AKN68pzqJzSDNfiv7nDFk27ny5TkgKFjmKEozcwYszVq – in the receiving field.




PEPEVIR currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

BofA Announced: "June Will Be a Month to Remember", Here's Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bank of America (BofA) analysts predicted that June will be an “unforgettable” month with important decisions expected from many central banks.
This week has been a week full of surprises from central banks, with the Bank of Sweden (Riksbank) cutting interest rates and the Bank of England (BoE) expressing more confidence than previously expected that inflation will move in the desired direction.


“We got a glimpse of what June will look like for markets, when many central banks will make important decisions,” BofA analysts said. Analysts continued: “All together, we may be entering one of the most important months for markets in a long time, where key decisions will be made for many central banks. This could be a June to remember.”

Despite the BoE's 'structural' dovish trend, BofA analysts still believe wage increases will be more stubborn. BofA said, “Our call for the first rate cut in August continues.”





Looking ahead, BofA said its focus in Europe will be on March UK labor market data due next week. They also expect the German ZEW indicator to continue improving in May and the first quarter GDP for the Eurozone to provide further insight into the evolution of growth across the region.

FLOKI, BONK's volatile week: Will the bear runs continue? - AMBCrypto



Market sentiment remained bearish on both BONK and FLOKI. 
Most indicators and metrics hinted at continued price declines. 

Bonk [BONK] and Floki Inu [FLOKI], two of the most popular meme coins, had a tough week as their values declined in double digits. 
However, as the market trend changed, their southward momentum also declined. Does this mean that investors could expect their charts to turn green in the upcoming week? 
BONK and FLOKI bears stand strong
According to CoinMarketCap, BONK’s price dropped by more than 17% in the last seven days. FLOKI’s fate was also similar, as its value dipped by over 13% during the same time.
 The declining price action took a heavy toll on these meme coins’ market sentiments. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, both meme coins’ Weighted Sentiments remained drastically low. 
This signified that bearish sentiment around BONK and FLOKI was dominant in the market.
Source: Santiment
However, the bearish trend seemed to have been coming to an end as the degree of price decline dropped. While BONK’s price dropped only by 1.8% in the last 24 hours, FLOKI’s price dipped by 1.5%.
 This might be an indication of a trend reversal. At press time, FLOKI was trading at $0.0001685, while BONK had a value of $0.00002264.
Is a trend reversal possible?
To see whether that’s the case, AMBCryto checked their metrics. We found that FLOKI’s MVRV ratio dropped sharply last week, meaning that fewer investors were in profit. 
Its Funding Rate increased on the 12th of May. Generally, prices tend to move the other way than the Funding Rate, suggesting that FLOKI’s price might continue to fall. 
Coinglass’ data revealed that, like FLOKI, BONK’s Funding Rate also registered an increase in the past few hours.
Source: Santiment
We then analyzed both meme coins’ daily charts to better understand what to expect. Beginning with FLOKI, we found that the meme coin might just be testing the upper trendline support of its bullish flag pattern. 
Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a slight uptick, hinting at a price increase. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained in the bears’ favor. 
If the southward price action continues, then FLOKI’s price might touch $0.000156 support, from where it might rebound. 
Source: TradingView
BONK’s market indicators also looked pretty bearish. Its CMF was also considerably lower than the neutral mark. 
Unlike FLOKI, BONK’s MFI registered a downtick, suggesting that the chances of a continued price decline were high. Additionally, the MACD also displayed a bearish crossover.

AMBCrypto then checked BONK’s liquidation heat map to look for possible support zones. As per our analysis, BONK has strong support near $0.000022. 
If it manages to turn bullish from there, then its price could move up towards $0.000029. But a plummet under that could push BONK’s price down to $0.000018 in the coming week.

DOJ Appoints Consulting Firm for Three-Year Monitoring Role of Crypto Exchange Binance: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly appointed a London-based consulting firm to serve as an outside monitor for Binance after the world’s largest crypto exchange pleaded guilty to violating US anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and sanctions laws.
People familiar with the matter but wanted to remain anonymous say the DOJ has selected Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) for the three-year monitorship of Binance over the previous frontrunner, New York-based law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, reports Bloomberg.










One of the conditions of Binance’s plea deal in November is the appointment of an independent firm to monitor its compliance. The newly appointed monitor will have access to Binance’s internal records, facilities and employees to report on the crypto exchange’s activities to the government.
Sullivan & Cromwell used to be the leading contender for the lucrative role, but controversies over its ties with defunct crypto exchange FTX and its alleged failure to detect the fraud perpetrated by the firm’s convicted co-founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, reportedly prompted the Justice Department to review other options.
But Sullivan & Cromwell is still expected to get the appointment for a separate five-year Binance monitorship on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).
FRA, which specializes in forensic accounting, data governance and compliance consulting services, previously worked with Switzerland-based trading company Gunvor SA to negotiate a $661 million settlement with the DOJ over a bribery case involving Ecuadorian officials.

Forensic Risk Alliance Appointed to Monitor Binance Compliance After $4.3 Billion Plea Deal



                    

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has appointed Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) to monitor cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s compliance with regulatory standards. 



This follows Binance’s November 2023 plea deal wherein it admitted to charges of money laundering and other federal offenses, resulting in a $4.3 billion fine. 




FRA’s three-year engagement will involve scrutinizing Binance‘s internal records, premises, and employee interactions to keep the DOJ informed of its compliance status, a Bloomberg report revealed on May 10.



Originally, the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell was considered for the monitoring contract due to their prominence in the sector. 



However, their previous association with FTX, another crypto exchange that went bankrupt, influenced the DOJ’s decision to opt for FRA instead. 



This decision came amid allegations against Sullivan & Cromwell for their involvement in FTX Group’s fraudulent activities, as reported by Cointelegraph on February 17.

The firm allegedly had prior knowledge of deceitful practices at FTX that led to the loss of client funds, as stated by FTX creditors in a class-action lawsuit.



Despite these controversies, Sullivan & Cromwell is expected to secure a separate five-year monitoring contract for Binance under the auspices of the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.




In related news, Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, was sentenced to four months in prison on April 30. 



The sentence was for failing to implement an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the exchange. 




Although prosecutors sought a three-year term, the judge mitigated the sentence, citing a lack of evidence that Zhao was directly aware of specific illicit activities within Binance.

Ripple's XRP Architect David Schwartz Explains His 40,000 ETH ICO Purchase and Missed Fortunes ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has recently provided insights into his involvement in Ethereum’s early days, shedding light on his purchase of 40,000 Ethereum tokens during the public initial coin offering (ICO).



The revelation came following a query posed by an XRP supporter, MetamanX, on May 10. This prompted Schwartz to elaborate on his engagement with Ethereum before the public pre-ICO phase.



Schwartz clarified that his involvement in Ethereum’s ICO was not merely a business decision but a personal one, as he revealed his acquaintance with Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum’s founders. In response to the inquiry, Schwartz disclosed that Buterin, a close friend, had extended an invitation to participate in the ICO, which prompted him to contribute 20 BTC to support Buterin’s initiative.



“I knew Vitalik. He invited me to participate. I wanted to support him, so I went in for 20 BTC. I didn’t really ask any questions. It got me 40,000 ETH. I thought of it as helping an acquaintance,” Schwartz stated.



Public records validate Schwartz’s account, indicating that the Ethereum ICO lasted 42 days between July 22 and September 2, 2014. Early investors could secure 2,000 ETH for 1 BTC. As the ICO progressed, the exchange rate of ETH to BTC increased, with 1 BTC eventually fetching 1,337 ETH by the sale’s conclusion.

&nbsp



The pundit shared a tweet from last December in which he disclosed having sold his Ether. Notably, Schwartz’s decision to liquidate his 40,000 ETH portfolio when its value rose to $40,000 marked a commendable return on investment, amounting to roughly 220% after a two-year holding period.



“As many of you know, I sold 40,000 ETH at about $1 to put solar panels on a house I no longer own. That ETH was worth over $100 million shortly after,” Schwartz wrote on December 8, 2023.



However, hindsight reveals a missed opportunity for the Ripple CTO. Had he retained his investment to date, Ether’s current price of $2,927, it would be worth a staggering $117,166,291, reflecting a 292,816% increase from his sale price of $40,000.



In a reflective tone revealing the sale, Schwartz shared a personal tale, drawing parallels between his actions and those of his father. He recounted his father’s decision to sell Apple stock to fund renovations and a new house, only to witness the stock’s value soar subsequently. 



“My father, ironically, did almost the same thing. After my older siblings moved out, my parents didn’t need the enormous house we were living in. But it needed quite a bit of fixing up to sell. So, my father sunk a lot of money into gutting and redoing the house. But during the months it took to do that, as renovation costs escalated, the real estate market crashed. He took a huge loss on the deal.” Schwartz revealed.

New Memecoin Book of Shiba Inu Will Surge 9,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Book of Shiba Inu (BOSHIBA) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Book of Shiba Inu (BOSHIBA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 9,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because BOSHIBA has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Book of Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Book of Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Book of Shiba Inu on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Book of Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 24YoPq1drHd7Xs7NbYhU3HvBCMsGZqmSefD7FYeZ6W5D – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BOSHIBA.

Sam Altman thinks giving everyone ‘a slice of GPT’ could pay for UBI

OpenAI CEO and Tools for Humanity Chairperson Sam Altman believes the progress being carved out by today’s frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models could lead to a vast restructuring of socioeconomics. Altman recently unveiled a vision wherein treating “compute” as a resource and asset, could supplant monetary income as a means of providing a universal basic income (UBI), during a recent interview on the All-In podcast. VIDEOWhile the interview touched on a number of subjects, it quickly turned to the dangers of AI and how humanity would cope with threats ranging from AI-wrought human extinction to employment displacement. On the former subject, Altman acknowledged that there could come a time when AI models were sufficiently capable of posing such threats. His solution is a global oversight board with the capacity to regulate the largest projects, thereby leaving startups relatively unfettered by potentially growth-stifling laws. “I think there will come a time, in the not super distant future ... where the frontier AI systems are capable of causing significant global harm. And, for those kinds of systems ... I would like to see some sort of international agency that is looking at the most powerful systems and ensuring reasonable safety testing.”Altman assured the All-In team that GPT-4, OpenAI’s current state-of-the-art production model, posed no “significant” threat to human lives.On the jobs front, Altman is a well known advocate for UBI. Aside from OpenAI, he also helms Tools for Humanity, a firm whose main product is the Worldcoin cryptocurrency and identity verification platform. Worldcoin is given to anyone willing to verify their humanity. After which, holders receive a monthly token stipend.Speaking to the All-In team, Altman decried government poverty assistance programs as mostly ineffective and called for a simple, respectful approach to UBI: “I’m not a super fan of how the government has handled most policies designed to help poor people, and I kind of believe that if you could just give people money they would make good decisions and the market would do its thing.”He went on to point out that giving people money is not going to solve all problems,” adding that it’s “certainly not going to make people happy.” But ventured that “it might solve some problems and it might give people a better horizon with which to help themselves.”As to why he’s such an advocate for UBI, Altman said that he and his colleagues realized back in 2016, when they began taking AI seriously, that it could have far-reaching effects. They began conducting studies and found that UBI showed promise. Now, Altman believes that the UBI paradigm itself could be ripe for an upending:“2016 was a very long time ago. ... I wonder if the future looks something more like universal basic compute than universal basic income and everybody gets a slice of GPT-7’s compute and they can use it, they can resell it, they can donate it to somebody to use for cancer research.

Satoshi Resurfaced? Decade-Long Dormant Wallets Spring To Life, Unleashing Over $60 Million In BTC ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
In a notable development, two dormant Bitcoin wallets, untouched for over a decade, have suddenly come to life, transferring a staggering $60 million in Bitcoin (BTC).



The revelation came to light through a tweet by Lookonchain, a service that tracks significant crypto transactions. The tweet announced the movement of 1,000 BTC from these long-dormant wallets in just 20 minutes.



Notably, the wallets, identified as “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH,” received 500 BTC on September 13, 2013, when Bitcoin’s price hovered around a mere $124. Going by this price, each Whale’s Bitcoin reserve was worth $62,000. Mirroring it with today’s BTC price at $61,107, each whale’s BTC worth is approximately $30.6 million, reflecting a 49,179.8% Return on Investment (ROI).



This latest development comes after another dormant Bitcoin wallet, inactive for a decade, came to life on May 6 and moved 687.33 BTC, valued at around $44 million.



Notably, the movement of such vast sums of Bitcoin raises questions about the intentions of the wallet holders. Speculation abounds regarding whether these wallets belong to Bitcoin Creator, Satoshi Nakamoto or early Bitcoin miners who had forgotten about their holdings or individuals with an unparalleled commitment to the “HODL” strategy.

&nbsp



Notably, the timing of these events coincides with Bitcoin’s current volatility. Analysts are divided on the direction of its price amid conflicting indicators. While some foresee a potential surge to $70,000 or beyond in the coming months, on-chain data suggests that long-term holders may be offloading their holdings.



JA Martunn, a leading analyst at Cryptoquant, recently highlighted this phenomenon, noting that the “Coin Days Destroyed” metric indicates a likely peak in Bitcoin’s price. Notably, this metric considers the age and volume of Bitcoin transactions, suggesting that seasoned market participants are divesting their holdings.







Martunn, however expressed optimism, suggesting that newer market participants may ultimately catalyze a fresh bull run by relinquishing their holdings to experienced market players. 



“Eventually, there reaches a point where the influx of new investors cannot sustain the demand for older coins at prevailing prices, leading to a decline. This prompts newer investors to sell at a minor loss, triggering further sell-offs. Ultimately, the cycle concludes with capitulation, as newer participants relinquish their holdings to experienced market participants” he added.



That said, it is important to note that the average purchase price for new whales is $61,200. According to Cryptoquant analyst Axel Adler, they may experience stress if the price drops below this threshold.



“Currently, this level is acting as support. Based on history, new whales almost always have to experience stress. The simplest way to get rid of it is to HODL,” he wrote.

Crypto Market Continues its Descent: Is the Bull Run Over? - DailyCoin


        
Crypto markets have experienced volatility, leading investors to question the longevity of the current bull market.



While some cryptocurrencies have defied the trend with impressive gains, others have endured significant losses.



Analysts have remained bullish on the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies despite the short-term turbulence.
This week, the cryptocurrency market navigated choppy waters, leaving many investors wondering if the recent surge is nearing its peak. While some coins managed to weather the storm, others took a significant tumble.TON Soars 20% While Dogecoin Leads Top 10 LosersDespite the overall downturn, a few bright spots emerged. Telegram’s native token, TON, defied the bearish trend and surged a staggering 20%. Binance Coin (BNB), the exchange’s token, also clung to modest gains of 0.34%. However, its position remains precarious, hovering just above the break-even point.
Among the biggest losers this week were Dogecoin (DOGE), Avalanche (AVAX), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). DOGE, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, posted the steepest decline in the top ten coins, dropping a hefty 11.2%. AVAX and SHIB weren’t far behind, suffering losses of 9.8% and 9% respectively.Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also took a hit, shedding 7% of its value over the past week. The remaining coins in the top ten managed to limit their losses to under 5%. XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), and Cardano (ADA) dipped by 5%, 4.5%, and 4.2% respectively, while Solana (SOL) rounded out the losers with a minor 1.8% decrease.Despite the current setback, many analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of cryptocurrencies. They point to continued institutional adoption, growing developer activity, and the potential of emerging blockchain technologies as reasons for continued growth.WinnersOnly 2 of the top 10 cryptocurrencies experienced price increases over the past week.

This is Why Franklin Templeton Bets on Blockchain Technology


Jenny Johnson, President and CEO of Franklin Templeton oversees a financial titan with $1.6 trillion in assets. Recently, she underscored the significant benefits of blockchain technology in asset management. 
Speaking at the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California, Johnson expressed her enthusiasm for blockchain’s potential, especially in tokenizing real-world assets.
Jenny Johnson Believes Mutual Funds and ETFs Will Soon Come On-Chain
During her conversation with Bloomberg, Johnson emphasized Franklin Templeton’s innovative approach to utilizing blockchain technology. She detailed an experiment where the company processed account records using traditional and blockchain methods over six to eight months. 

“We were astonished by how much less cost it was to run it on the blockchain. It’s a very effective technology, and we think it is going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities. Eventually, I think exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain,” Johnson stated.


The CEO also discussed the challenges in financial services related to data reconciliation across systems. This process is often costly and time-consuming. 
Blockchain provides a single source of truth for transactions, dramatically reducing costs and improving efficiency. This reduction in friction indeed paves the way for new investment opportunities.
Johnson also illustrated blockchain’s broader potential with a reference to pop superstar Rihanna, who issued non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for royalties from her songs. 

“So when Spotify plays a Rihanna song, and you own that token, the smart contract can kick off. And the payment mechanism built into the blockchain can give you your fractions,” Johnson said.

Franklin Templeton launched the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) in 2021, a trailblazer as the first US-registered fund that uses public blockchain for processing transactions and documenting share ownership.

“I am a huge fan of blockchain and the technology. We had the first SEC approved money market fund, the SEC had us run the shareholders’ servicing system,” Johnson said.

At the heart of this innovation lies the BENJI token. Operating on the Stellar (XLM) and Polygon (MATIC) blockchains, these tokens uniquely represent shares of the FOBXX fund. 

They include assets like government securities, cash, and repurchase agreements. They also offer a stable yield, which is highly attractive to investors seeking dependable returns.
Recent data from rwa.xyz shows that the BENJI token has a market capitalization of $367 million. This impressive figure ranks it second only to BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). 
On April 25, Franklin Templeton expanded the functionality of BENJI tokens. They are now available for peer-to-peer transfer on the public blockchain.

Continuing its commitment to the blockchain, the company launched a Bitcoin ETF in January, achieving modest net flows of $351 million to date. Moreover, on February 13, Franklin Templeton sought SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF, further integrating blockchain into its offerings.

Blockchain adoption in healthcare faces serious obstacles in Germany

Blockchain technology has expanded beyond cryptocurrency and is now used in a number of applications, including decentralized databases, which can prevent counterfeiting through transparency and security. This ability to secure data is particularly valuable to the healthcare sector, where blockchain tech can secure data, enhance data integrity and empower patients to control their data more effectively. It can also improve transparency in supply chains and verify the authenticity of medicine. Additionally, blockchain aids in healthcare identification and has the potential to enhance biomedical research by simplifying data storage and exchange.Blockchain in the healthcare sector: Germany’s untapped potential?Although blockchain technology offers numerous benefits, its applications are rarely found in the German healthcare sector.The German Federal Ministry of Health recognized the potential of blockchain and organized a workshop on the topic in 2019. Recent: Despite Bitcoin price volatility, factors point to BTC’s long-term successOut of 142 project outlines, 20 finalists were selected, and projects such as secure electronic prescriptions, decentralized Patient Consent Service forms and a blockchain-based certificate of incapacity for work were awarded prizes. However, to date, none of these projects have been implemented.Since then, new initiatives have emerged, but many remain isolated and rarely implemented. What’s stopping Germany from adopting blockchain?Why are there so few blockchain projects in the German healthcare market when the technology is so promising?Volker Nürnberg, professor of management in healthcare at the Technical University of Munich, told Cointelegraph that the German healthcare sector is highly regulated and not always seen as a driver of innovation, which is a particular challenge for startups: “From a global perspective, the healthcare sector is not always the driver of innovation. It is also extremely regulated [in Germany]. Startups, in particular, don’t always want to fight their way through the legal jungle.”Nürnberg also addressed the technical, ethical and privacy hurdles that make blockchain implementation difficult. Protecting sensitive data and ensuring interoperability are key factors: “Without politics and legislators — due to the strong regulation in the healthcare sector — the introduction of blockchain technology is not possible.” Lukas Weidener, a doctor of medicine and investor in various medical decentralized autonomous organizations, told Cointelegraph that these “particularly strict data protection regulations to protect sensitive patient data place high demands on the security and confidentiality of blockchain systems.”GDPR poses unique challenges for blockchainsThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ensures that sensitive patient data is processed in accordance with strict security and confidentiality requirements. This is particularly important in the healthcare sector, where the misuse or unauthorized disclosure of data can have serious consequences. Therefore, compliance with the GDPR can be seen as a mark of quality and a basis of trust for patients and users, ensuring their data is secure and handled with care.According to Weidener, however, these data protection and security requirements can pose a challenge for blockchain applications. This technology relies on data transparency and immutability, potentially conflicting with the right to be forgotten or the principle of data minimization.Weidener said that these regulations could lead to firms in other countries overtaking German companies, limiting the control and influence of German industry in the global development of these technologies.On the other hand, the GDPR also offers the opportunity to promote the development of blockchain applications that are designed to comply with high standards from the outset. “This could make Germany a pioneer in the development of secure, transparent and patient-oriented blockchain solutions in the healthcare sector,” said Weidener. According to the expert, close cooperation between technology developers, data protection officers and regulatory authorities is required to fully exploit blockchain technology’s benefits and meet the GDPR requirements. “The aim must be to develop innovative solutions that ensure both technical progress and the protection and security of patient data.”Blockchain’s bad reputationAnother factor in the way of adoption is blockchain technology’s association with cryptocurrencies.The association of blockchain technology with the volatility and security concerns of cryptocurrencies has a negative impact on public perception, said Weidener, adding that the “perceived energy consumption of some blockchain protocols can also lead to concerns about environmental sustainability.” “This could lead to reservations among decision-makers and users in the healthcare sector who view the technology with skepticism, especially if sustainability and environmental protection play an important role in their organizations.”In addition to these hurdles, the “strict authorization and certification processes for medical devices mean that any technological innovation must undergo extensive testing and approval procedures, which slows down the innovation cycle.”Investment in research and funding necessaryAdopting blockchain technology in healthcare also requires significant investment in technology and expertise, which is particularly challenging for smaller clinics and practices. According to Weidener, the need to update or even completely replace existing IT infrastructures and the lack of standardized solutions make implementation even more difficult.Recent: Crypto firms brace for intensified SEC, CFTC action after regulator warningWeidener emphasized the importance of targeted investment in research and funding, especially for new technologies that comply with data protection regulations. Without this investment, Germany risks falling behind technologically and patients losing access to advanced technologies.Weidener said interoperability and integration with existing IT infrastructures, as well as the development of user-centric applications that enable easy interaction with blockchain-based healthcare applications, are also important.“This is the only way Germany can play a leading role in the development and implementation of blockchain applications in the healthcare sector.”

Polkadot (DOT) Ecosystem Recap: Here are the Latest Advancements


																TL;DR

Polkadot has recently improved its network performance, significantly boosting the speed and capacity for processing transactions.
In addition to its technical advancements, the protocol is exploring a potential $8.8 million sponsorship deal with the American soccer club Inter Miami.


What’s New Around Polkadot?
The blockchain protocol made the headlines in the past few days due to completing some important advancements. As CryptoPotato reported, it enabled Asynchronous Backing on the network. The mechanism represents “an optimized approach for how parachain blocks are validated by the Relay Chain.”
The Relay Chain is the central chain and is of critical importance to the Polkadot’s ecosystem. It facilitates communication and interoperability between the different parachains and handles the inter-chain messaging passing (XCMP) protocol. 
Polkadot’s team announced that blocks are produced twice as fast following that upgrade, while available blockspace was boosted by 6-10 times. “3-5x more extrinsic per block and higher utilization of parachain blocks” are two additional consequences of the development.
“Async Backing boosts throughput by 8x, without sacrificing security, paving the way for supporting Web3 applications across verticals such as gaming and DeFi. It brings Web2 scale into the reach of Web3, which is crucial for large-scale platforms like Mythical Games,” the team stated.
The Previous Endeavors
Several weeks ago, Polkadot released the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper. It represents a prospective design to foster the advancement of the Relay Chain and combines elements of Polkadot and Ethereum.




“JAM provides a global singleton permissionless object environment—much like the smart-contract environment pioneered by Ethereum—paired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network, a proposition pioneered by Polkadot.” the team explained at the time.
Another major development that has not yet seen the light of day is the possible partnership between Polkadot and the American soccer club Inter Miami. Nico Zini – Partnership Marketing and Media Rights for the sports team CF – revealed that the team may join forces with the blockchain protocol on an $8.8 million sponsorship deal. 
For the uninitiated, Inter Miami’s biggest star is the Argentine legend Lionel Messi, while its co-owner is David Beckham. 
This is Polkadot’s second attempt to enter the soccer world. Two years ago, it had a chance to become FC Barcelona’s official jersey sponsor. However, the Catalan club eventually chose Spotify.

One Altcoin Has $1 Billion Token Unlock in the New Week - Bitcoin Sistemi


The cryptocurrency market will witness a very interesting token lock opening event in the new week.
Aevo (AEVO), which was recently launched as Binance's Launchpool project, will experience a token unlock of approximately $1 billion on Wednesday, May 15, 2024. The token unlocking is expected to take place at 08:00 Türkiye time (UTC+3).


This will be an extremely interesting development considering that AEVO is an altcoin with a market cap of only $132 million. The tokens to be unlocked correspond to 752% of the tokens in circulation.

However, AEVO's vesting table is calculated based on the RBN vesting schedule, with the assumption that all tokens can be converted immediately after unlocking. RBN holders can convert their RBN to AEVO at a 1:1 ratio.





Following the token openings in question, a significant portion of the AEVO maximum supply will be in circulation. AEVO price is trading at $1.20 at the time of writing this article. When it was first launched, the price of the altcoin opened at approximately $3.

How does the order book work?

A very commonly used term in the field of financial trading is order book.
It is a term that refers to the register on which all purchase and sale orders are stored waiting to be executed on an exchange. 

What is the order book and how do you read it?
The same term “order book” clearly suggests that it is a book, or rather a register, related to orders. 
The fact is that purchase and sale orders are not always executed immediately. 
When an order, whether it is a purchase or a sale, is actually executed, it is also removed from the order book, so here you only have those already loaded but not yet executed. 
There are two types of orders: limit orders, and market orders. 
Market orders are executed immediately at the market price as soon as they are placed by users. 
In other words, these are purchase or sale orders for which the user who uploads them does not indicate a limit price. By not indicating the execution limit price, the user allows the exchange to execute them immediately at the market price, so they practically do not even enter the order book.
Indeed, only the orders not yet executed are recorded in the order book, that is, limit orders. 
In limit type orders, the user also specifies the limit price, in addition to the quantity they want to buy or sell. In the case of a buy order, they specify the maximum price they are willing to pay, while in the case of a sell order, they specify the minimum price they are willing to sell at. 
If the limit price indicated by the user is lower than the market price, in the case of a buy order, or higher in the case of a sell order, the order cannot be executed immediately, and is therefore placed in the order book to be executed later. 
The user can also specify a date or an expiration period, so that the order is removed from the order book within a certain time if it is not executed. 
The main features
Often the display of order books on various exchanges is more or less the same. 
At the top there are the sales orders, and at the bottom the purchase orders. They are sorted by price, from highest to lowest. 
The order book is divided in two, because it includes both sell orders, at the top with a price higher than the market price, and buy orders, at the bottom with a price lower.
In theory, in the middle there should be the market price, but since this is nothing more than the price at which the last transaction took place, it is often not displayed within the order book, to avoid confusion.
Actually, when a user places a new order, the exchange looks in its order book for other orders already loaded but not yet executed to see if there is any that can meet the requirements of the new order. 
If the user places a market order to buy, the exchange will simply take all the sell orders at a lower price already present in the order book to completely fulfill the buy order.
In this case, practically the price of the sale would have been decided in advance by those who have placed the limit sell orders that were satisfied thanks to the new buy order.
The same thing happens, on the contrary, if a user places a new market sell order.
More complicated is the functioning of matching a new order limit with the orders already present on the order book. 
Indeed, in the event that on a new purchase order the user has indicated a price lower than those of the sales orders already present in the order book, the matching simply cannot occur, and so the new order cannot be executed and is simply added to the order book. 
Instead, if it indicates a sufficiently high purchase price, the exchange will be able to match it with sell orders already present in the order book, and will be able to execute the transaction. 
However, the exchange does not always manage to find a sufficient quantity of assets at a price not higher than that indicated in the new purchase order, so it may also happen that this is only partially executed, and the rest is then recorded on the order book for the unexecuted part. 
The same things happen, on the contrary, if a user places a new limit sell order.
How to analyze the order book
In light of all this, it is easy to understand how useful it can be to analyze order books, especially since they are usually public. 
Before explaining how to analyze an order book, however, a necessary clarification is needed: not all orders publicly displayed on the order book are real. Sometimes, in fact, fictitious orders are added, which are then promptly removed after a short time, either to artificially inflate the order book, or to alter its analysis. 
It must also be said that there are many orders that are removed from the order book by the users who created them even shortly after their creation, either because they were the result of errors, or because the user changed their mind. 
Furthermore, unfortunately it is not possible to know for certain which orders are real and which are fake, so generally one simply performs these analyses with a certain caution. 
The fact is that purchase orders at higher prices, and sales orders at lower prices, indicate very well the market situation on a given exchange at a given moment. 
Furthermore, not only the prices indicated on those orders are interesting, but also the quantities. 
By analyzing this data, you can determine how deep a buying or selling market is on an exchange, remembering that crypto exchanges do not have shared order books, as each one has its own completely independent and detached from those of other exchanges. crypto
So if, for example, on an exchange there are purchase orders at a relatively high price and with high quantities, it means that both the purchasing power is high on that exchange and that even large sales can lower the price slightly. 
Conversely, if for example on an exchange there were sell orders at a not particularly low price, and with small quantities, the selling power would be scarce, and large purchases could quickly and significantly increase the price. 
However, analyzing order books is not at all simple, and generally only experienced traders know how to interpret them correctly and effectively.

Bitcoin trades sideways while TON, RNDR, PEPE and AR flash bullish signs

Bitcoin (BTC) could not hold its recovery this week, signaling that the bears have not given up and are using the rallies to sell. Bitcoin is on track to finish the week with a loss of more than 4%. The longer the price stays closer to $60,000, the greater the possibility of a downside breakdown.However, analysts remain bullish on the price action in the post-halving cycle. According to Cane Island Alternative Advisors founder and investment manager Timothy Peterson, Bitcoin could soar to anywhere “between $175,000 - $350,000 in the next 9 months.” Peterson cautioned in a X post that “this bull market will end in January 2025.”Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Despite the sideways price action, select traditional finance companies are adding Bitcoin to their portfolio. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo reported exposure to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in their May 10 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the allocation to Bitcoin is small, it looks to be a step in the right direction.Will Bitcoin’s range-bound action shift focus to altcoins? Let’s study the top 5 cryptocurrencies that look promising on the charts.Bitcoin price analysisThe bulls have successfully defended the $59,600 level in Bitcoin but failed to push the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($62,650). This shows an intense battle between the bulls and the bears.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory indicate advantage to sellers. If the $59,600 level cracks, the BTC/USDT pair could retest the May 1 intraday low of $56,552. This level is expected to attract buyers, but if the bears prevail, the pair may drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298.If bulls want to prevent the downside, they will have to propel and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair could rise to $67,250. Buyers will have to overcome this hurdle to start a rally to $73,777.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. The crucial support to watch on the downside is $59,600. If this level is breached, the selling may pick up, and the pair could plunge to $56,552.Contrarily, if the price rises above the 50-simple moving average, it will suggest that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The pair may rise to $63,500 and later to $65,500. A break above this resistance will signal that the bears may be losing their grip.Toncoin price analysisToncoin (TON) has been attempting to rise above the immediate resistance of $7.23, but the bears are holding their ground.TON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewA minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to slip much below $7.23. This enhances the prospects of a break above $7.23. If that happens, the TON/USDT pair could challenge the resistance at $7.67.The essential support to watch on the downside is the moving averages. A break and close below this support will suggest that the pair may consolidate between $4.72 and $7.67 for a few days.TON/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is near the overbought territory on the 4-hour chart, indicating that the bulls have the upper hand. Buyers will try to strengthen their position further by pushing the price above $7.23.On the contrary, the bears will try to yank the price below the 20-EMA. If they do that, it will suggest that the bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance. The pair may then slump to the 50-SMA.Render price analysisRender (RNDR) broke above the moving averages on May 5, signaling that the corrective phase may be ending.RNDR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bears are trying to stall the recovery near the overhead resistance of $12, but the bulls have not ceded much ground. This suggests that the dips are being purchased. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that the bulls are in control.If the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($9.59), it will increase the likelihood of a rally above $12. The RNDR/USDT pair may then climb to $13.83. This optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages.RNDR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe bears are trying to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If they succeed, the short-term bullish momentum will weaken, and the pair may plunge to the 50-SMA. This level could attract buyers but the bounce may face selling at the 20-EMA. If the 50-SMA cracks, the next stop is likely to be $9.50.If buyers want to maintain their hold, they will have to defend the 20-EMA and kick the price above the $12 resistance.Related: Is the altcoin market set for an ‘explosive rally?’ Analysts eye these 3 indicatorsPepe price analysisPepe (PEPE) has steadily recovered in the past few days, indicating sustained buying at lower levels.PEPE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe price action has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that will complete on a break and close above $0.0000092. If buyers maintain the price above the neckline, the PEPE/USDT pair could resume its uptrend. The pattern target of the bullish setup is $0.0000145.The moving averages are likely to act as a strong support during pullbacks. If the price rebounds off the moving averages, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying the dips. The trend will turn negative in the near term if the $0.0000060 support cracks.PEPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows the pair is taking support at the moving averages, indicating that the bulls are fiercely defending the level. Buyers will need to overcome the overhead obstacle at $0.0000092 to gain the upper hand.If the price turns lower and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the bears are back in the game. The price could then slide to the critical support at $0.0000076, which is likely to witness strong buying by the bulls.Arweave price analysisArweave (AR) has been gradually climbing higher in the past few days, indicating solid demand from the bulls. AR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($36) and the RSI above 61 suggest that the bulls have the edge. The AR/USDT pair could reach the overhead resistance of $47.51, an important level to watch out for. If bulls thrust the price above this resistance, the pair is likely to accelerate toward $52 and then $68.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the pair turns down and breaks below the moving averages. That could pull the pair to $26.50.AR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows that the pair is taking support at the 50-SMA during pullbacks. Buyers will try to push the price to $45 and later to $47.51. Sellers are expected to defend this zone with vigor because if they fail in their endeavor, the bullish momentum could pick up.The 50-SMA is the support to watch out for on the downside. If this level breaks down, the pair could plummet to $36 and next to $34. The price may rebound off this zone but is likely to face selling at the 20-EMA.

Trump's Crypto Pivot Is Bullish...But For Whom? Mad Crypto Money With Ivan - Benzinga

gm,I’m Ivan and welcome to my weekly column Mad Crypto Alpha.Trump Is Right…You read that right.Donald Trump flip-flopped on crypto last week.And in the viral video clip documenting Trump’s totally-not-surprising pivot, Trump only says true things from second 17 onwards:Alright, even if Trump is right…why should you care?Read Also: If You Bought Your Mom $100 In Bitcoin, Dogecoin And Ethereum Last Mother’s Day, Here’s How Much She’d Have Today…And Everyone’s Losing Their MindAs long as things go according to plan and only regulators and Congresspeople comment on crypto it’s all fine.But as soon as Trump comments on crypto…The following anecdote will tell you all you need to know to position yourself correctly for maximum chance of profits going into election season.It was all nice and quiet on Crypto Twitter following Trump’s 180 until Blockworks’ opinion editor Molly Zuckerman chose to poke the hornet’s nest by giving a — wait for it— different opinion *audience gasps*.[Narrator’s voice:] What Molly did not know is that one does not simply shared a different opinion.The customary social media s–tstorm ensued. All nuance went out the window and Molly got dunked on for her looks, her presumed agenda and everything else a good old hate mob addresses.But you’re not here to read about Ryan Selkis, CEO of Messari and speaker at Trump’s event, trying to calm down the mob.Or that Coindesk thinks Trump’s speech lacked substance (no I’m not surprised, how could you tell?).You want to know why Trump’s pivot is bullish and for whom.Most people’s dunks on the op-ed had a notable conservative/libertarian undertone. These people aren’t voting Democrat in the fall and most likely never were, Trump pivot or not. And these people do not like President Joe Biden, for good reason or not.But these people do have a lot of market-moving power because they’re quite wealthy in the crypto industry.So, what coins are conservative-leaning crypto diehards going to buy come election season?Read Also: JPMorgan Reports $760K Spot Bitcoin ETF Holdings Even As CEO Jamie Dimon Called For Shutting Down Crypto IndustryCrypto Isn’t All Conservative But Whales Probably AreCrypto actually does skew Republican as much as it might appear.As Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, points out, it’s really a bipartisan issue and split almost evenly along party lines.But that is not the case on Crypto Twitter. It has long leaned Republican, and many crypto or crypto-adjacent accounts, such as WallStreet Silver, think Trump is likely to win the election (or at least retweet people that think so).When Trump-supporting crypto whales go coin-shopping in the coming weeks and months, they’re likely to buy cryptocurrencies that are mascots for their candidate.And political meme coins do not offer much for liberal-leaning folk anyway:
Trump is the biggest holder of MAGA Memecoin TRUMP/USD, the meme coin created in his honor.



Jeo Boden BODEN/USD is technically a “SOL - Benzinga">Democrat meme coin,” but it makes fun of the president’s gaffes and perceived lack of mental clarity.



Other politicial meme coins like Tooker or Ju Rugan parody right-wing media figures, but there’s no such alternative for liberals.
Conclusion: Crypto Twitter wants Trump to win. Coins supporting Trump (or making fun of Biden) have done well and will probably be high on the list again.But what about other cryptocurrencies? Are these coins going to outperform Dogecoin DOGE/USD or Shiba Inu SHIB/USD?No idea. If I knew that, I wouldn’t be … ah nevermind.I’m not saying these coins are guaranteed to do well.

Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) Will Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PEPEVIR will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Viral Pepe.



Currently, Viral Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PEPEVIR on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Viral Pepe by entering its contract address – AKN68pzqJzSDNfiv7nDFk27ny5TkgKFjmKEozcwYszVq – in the receiving field.




PEPEVIR currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Dogecoin's 'big boys' are buying: Should you do the same? - AMBCrypto



Despite the accumulation, DOGE’s price might face resistance at $0.15.
Traders looking to short the coin might get burnt as a recovery might happen quickly.

The number of Dogecoin [DOGE] addresses holding between 100,000 and 1 billion coins has increased, AMBCrypto can confirm.
Employing data from Santiment, we noticed that the accumulation started around the 2nd of April.
Typically, a surge in these addresses is a sign that demand for the coin has increased. And if demand increases, the price of DOGE is supposed to rise.
DOGE plans to win
But in most cases, this potential price increase does not happen immediately. This is because some sell-offs could be happening at other ends.
As of this writing, DOGE’s price was $0.14— a 28.18% correction in the last 30 days.
However, if the number of large addresses scooping the coin at discount prices increases, then Dogecoin might soon begin a rally that takes it back to $0.18.
Source: Santiment
Furthermore, AMBCrypto looked at the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z Score. This score checks if a cryptocurrency is in a bear or bull phase.
When the MVRV Z Score is negative, it implies that the market is in a bear cycle. But for Dogecoin, the metric was 52.83%, indicating that the coin has held on to its bull phase.
However, the metric was falling, suggesting that the price might come down again. Should this be the case, DOGE might trade at $0.12.
As a trader, a potential drop to this price might be enticing. However, it is important to check other metrics before deciding to go all in.
Source: Santiment
Wait for a decline before placing the trade
For this part, AMBCrypto analyzed the liquidation levels. With the liquidation levels, traders can have an idea of a cryptocurrency’s next movement.
This is because the indicator shows areas of high liquidity and prices where large liquidation levels might occur.
According to Hyblock, high liquidity only appeared at $0.15, meaning that it could be challenging for DOGE to reach this price.
If this remains the case, you might need to overlook buying DOGE at this point. But if the price goes lower, then it could be a good entry point.
In terms of entry point, the Cumulative Liquidation Levels Delta (CLDD) gave insights into Dogecoin’s prediction. As of this writing, the CLLD was negative.
Source: Hyblock
Positive values of the CLLD indicate that there are more long liquidations in the market. On the other hand, a negative CLLD suggests that shorts are facing a chunk of the position wipeout.

In addition, the negative CLLD confirmed the latter part of the statement above.
For the price, the negative reading of this indicator implies that later shorts might be punished, as Dogecoin could begin a sharp recovery in no time.

Crypto traders eye explosive rally as altcoin market revives | Cryptopolitan

Crypto markets are in a stage called “disbelief,” where skepticism prevails despite bullish indicators. Traders, eyeing an imminent rally, are closely monitoring three tech indicators that could signal a significant uptick in the altcoin sector.Signs of a Surge Amid SkepticismCrypto analyst Mikybull Crypto recently alerted their followers on X that the altcoin market’s capitalization is currently at the disbelief stage, which is typically followed by an explosive rally. Despite the overall market cap of altcoins, excluding the top ten, experiencing a 17.55% decline over the last 30 days to $264.9 billion, there’s still strong support above the $250 billion mark. This level is crucial as it suggests altcoins are gearing up for a potential upswing.According to the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, there has been a notable drop of 24 index points in the past month, with the “Greed” score now sitting at 56. This drop further highlights the current market skepticism that defines the disbelief stage. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital, another prominent voice in the crypto space, highlighted to their 465,300 X followers that despite recent downturns, the market is positioning itself for a future upward trajectory.Key Indicators to WatchTraders are keeping tabs on a trio of indicators across the broader crypto market that includes the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), the stochastic relative strength index (RSI), and Bitcoin dominance. The EMA provides a weighted average of prices over the period, with more emphasis on recent data, serving as a critical metric for market direction.Pseudonymous crypto trader Titan of Crypto noted that if the total crypto market cap retests the EMA20 and simultaneously achieves a bullish cross on the stochastic RSI, it could usher in rally time. These indicators are essential for predicting the altcoin market’s movement and are closely watched by market participants.Furthermore, Bitcoin’s market share, known as Bitcoin dominance, is another vital indicator. Currently, at 54.7%, having decreased by 0.56% over the past week, a continued fall in Bitcoin dominance could signal the start of an ‘altseason,’ where altcoins could perform exceptionally well compared to Bitcoin.Future Prospects and Market CyclesHistorically, altcoins tend to find their local price bottoms before making significant rallies. Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggested that altcoins are on track to find their local bottom around early June, based on past market cycles. This potential bottoming could set the stage for the next altcoin bull cycle.However, for altcoins to truly outperform, several conditions need to be met. Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, explained that the sentiment in the crypto market since mid-March has been subdued. For altcoins to thrive, Bitcoin’s price needs to break out decisively above the 20-day EMA, which would reduce the volatility in altcoin prices and foster a more bullish environment.Despite the recent challenges, the altcoin market cap remains up over 24% year-to-date and an impressive 167% over the past year. This resilience suggests that while the market is in a consolidation phase, it is also preparing for potential new highs in the future.Analysts have pointed out that a bull flag is forming on Bitcoin’s charts, indicating that we might see new all-time highs later in 2024. This setup is crucial as altcoin sentiment is tightly linked to Bitcoin’s price movements.

How the Binance beef could ruin Nigeria's economy | Cryptopolitan

Nigeria’s currency, the naira, has hit rock bottom, making it the worst performer worldwide this past month. The exchange rate has dropped to a low of 1,466 to the dollar, the weakest since March 20, affected by a drastic reduction in available US dollars, which fell to just $84 million last Thursday.Razia Khan from Standard Chartered notes that $1.3 billion in naira futures will soon mature, potentially increasing dollar demand even more. This financial instability follows changes made by President Bola Tinubu, who loosened foreign-exchange controls last June.Since then, the naira has fallen by about 68%. According to Khan, the market saw a quick rise and subsequent fall in the naira value due to offshore investors cashing in, indicating that market forces are actively shaping the exchange rate.The Central Bank of Nigeria is now under pressure to hike interest rates again at its next meeting on May 21. Previously, rate increases totaling 600 basis points earlier this year helped the naira recover from a low of 1,627 naira to 1,072 by mid-April.Market Reactions and Further ComplicationsAbubakar Muhammed from Forward Marketing Bureau de Change Ltd. reported a 0.9% dip in the naira’s value on the unofficial market, driven by heightened demand from locals.Danelee Masia from Deutsche Bank highlighted that sluggish investor interest and diminishing reserves make the naira vulnerable to future dips, especially during the higher demand in Q3 and Q4 for the holiday season.Ayodele Salami from Emerging Markets Investment Management Ltd. pointed out that as one of Africa’s largest oil producers with limited refining capabilities, Nigeria is bleeding dollars for energy imports.This is exacerbating the currency’s weakness, a situation reflected in other African nations like Zambia and Ghana, both dealing with debt restructuring challenges that hinder their ability to attract new capital.Binance and Nigeria’s Foreign Investment DilemmaThe situation with Binance has thrown another wrench into Nigeria’s economic stability. Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, has accused Nigerian officials of seeking bribes, casting a long shadow over Nigeria’s investment climate. SBM Intelligence reports that these allegations and the subsequent detention of Binance executives could severely deter foreign investment.On February 26, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla of Binance assured their safety by Nigerian authorities, faced an abrupt shift in their treatment.Following a neutral initial meeting involving top Nigerian financial and security agencies, they were later held under stricter conditions, asked to delist the naira from Binance and provide detailed user data.Teng described how Binance was asked to delist the naira as a tradable asset and provide extensive user data to Nigerian authorities.The situation escalated quickly when Binance executives were taken to a high-security location and their personal freedoms severely restricted. He emphasized that these actions were taken without clear legal justification and communicated through aggressive and non-diplomatic channels.The CEO stressed that the ongoing detention of Binance personnel, particularly Tigran Gambaryan, is a misuse of authority by the Nigerian government and a misalignment with the international community’s standards of justice and business operations.In his plea, Teng highlighted Binance’s readiness to comply with local regulations and its past cooperative history with law enforcement worldwide. He pointed out that Binance has engaged more than 600 times voluntarily with law enforcement to ensure that their platform is not misused.Despite these efforts, the response from Nigerian authorities has been disproportionately harsh and unyielding. Teng called for a rational and fair resolution to the situation, urging the Nigerian government to consider the broader economic implications of their actions.He reiterated Binance’s commitment to constructive dialogue and legal compliance, hoping for a swift resolution that would allow detained employees to return home safely and for Binance to continue contributing positively to Nigeria’s economy.The ongoing detention has caused international dismay and could potentially label Nigeria as hostile to foreign enterprises.Despite Binance’s compliance and cooperation efforts, including shutting down certain operations as a gesture of good faith, the Nigerian government has yet to ease its grip.

Billion-Dollar Bank Prepares for $450,000,000 Fine From US Government for Failing To Effectively Detect, Report, and Respond to Suspicious Activity - The Daily Hodl


								Banking giant Toronto Dominion (TD) is preparing to pay nearly half a billion dollars in penalties over an inadequate anti-money laundering (AML) program.
In an announcement, TD says it has set aside an initial provision of $450 million to pay the US government over an AML program that was “insufficient to effectively monitor, detect, report, and respond to suspicious activity.”










According to the announcement from TD, the bank is in ongoing discussions with three US regulators, plus the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
TD says it expects more monetary penalties and that the initial provision does not “reflect the final aggregate amount of potential monetary penalties or any non-monetary penalties, which are unknown and not reliably estimable at this time.”
The bank now says it’s working to address the issues within its AML program.
“Work has been underway to remedy these deficiencies. 
TD is a strong institution with the capital, liquidity, and capacity to fund the critical effort currently underway to strengthen its AML program, invest in the business, and continue to serve its customers and clients with excellence.”
TD’s US arm, based in Wilmington, Delaware, has $367 billion in assets under management and is currently the 10th largest bank operating within the US.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe Says Big Moment Coming for Ethereum, Predicts Rally for Layer-1 Altcoin - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto strategist Michaël van de Poppe believes that Ethereum (ETH) is close to witnessing a big trend shift.
Van de Poppe tells his 717,600 followers on the social media platform X that he doesn’t expect the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve pending applications for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the coming weeks.










The SEC is slated to approve, delay or deny the ETH ETF applications by financial giants Hashdex and Ark 21Shares on May 30th after postponing it in March.
Van de Poppe predicts that the SEC’s decision will end up being a pivotal point for the top altcoin by market cap.
“This is a very likely scenario with Ethereum, through which the delay/denial in two weeks is the big moment of reversal for ETH and the markets.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will plunge below $2,700 before reversing and rallying to $3,800.
At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,920.
Next up is the layer-1 crypto project AIOZ (AIOZ). According to the analyst, he expects AIOZ to sustain its bullish momentum as long as it continues to trade above $0.65.
“This one looks very promising and is one of the strongest trending assets. 
In-trend level to hold: $0.65-0.68. 
If that’s lost, then the long-term investment region comes into play. 
If we hold, I expect $1.35-1.45 might seem next. 
Very strong one.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, AIOZ is trading for $0.795.
Another altcoin on the trader’s list is the Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB). Van de Poppe thinks that ARB is very close to carving a bottom.
“This one has a full correction and is at the end stage of the correction. Massive cascade in the past weeks, through which the markets often fill that wick in the weeks after. In that regard, markets are close to the end of the correction.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ARB will bottom out at around $0.90.
The last altcoin on Van de Poppe’s radar is the native asset of the video-sharing blockchain Verasity (VRA). According to the analyst, VRA is in a full-blown downtrend and may find support at $0.004
“A full retracement is happening, which is relatively common for altcoins in this stage of the cycle.
An important area of support, and I think most of the pain is already in.
This support has held in the past, and I expect to do the same here.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, VRA is worth $0.0051.

Bitcoin Runes Hype Simmers Down as Network Activity Plunges - DailyCoin


        
After setting the bar high with its launch, Runes has been performing below expectations.



Runes activity has plummeted significantly since launch, hitting rock bottom over the weekend.



The decline could be interpreted as a natural correction as the protocol finds its footing amid the miners’ exodus and declining network activity.
Bitcoin’s novel protocol, Runes, sparked quite the excitement with its launch, promising to bring significant revenue for miners by introducing memecoins into the foray through its platform. In its first week, starting April 19, the protocol’s high-profile debut spurred record network activity even after the halving, generating millions in transaction fees and leading everyone to assume that Runes would help offset the hit to block rewards. 
However, with Bitcoin now struggling to perform and miners exploring alternate options, Runes is struggling to live up to the hype. Rune Activity Plunges to the DepthsThree weeks ago, Runes made quite the splash with its grand entrance after raking in a whopping $135 million in transaction fees during its debut week. With the protocol making up nearly half of all transactions on Bitcoin, the anticipation surrounding it was sky-high, with many expecting it to maintain its momentum. However, the novel protocol’s journey has been far from expectations.Since setting the bar high in its first week, Runes activity has taken a nosedive, hitting rock bottom over the weekend. Data from Dune showed a severe decrease in total Runes minted, falling from a peak of 23,061 on April 26 to just 62 by May 12. Similarly, fees earned from Runes plummeted from a peak of $321,263 on April 26 to just $970 on May 12. While Runes still generates considerable fees on Bitcoin, according to data from the Block, the sum of fees generated has breached $1 million only twice in the past two weeks.
Nonetheless, even with network activity plunging, Runes’ decline isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm. Don’t Let it Rune Your DayRunes’ recent downturn could be seen as a natural correction as the protocol finds its ceiling and floor. The protocol continues to perform exceptionally well, with collections already surpassing market caps exceeding $100 million, according to data from Magic Eden.Runes are likely bearing the brunt of the miner exodus as Bitcoin miners weigh whether it’s worth continuing their operations. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty dropped by 6%, making the largest reduction since July 2021, suggesting that miners are leaving the network due to the hit on their profitability. To put things into perspective, daily mining revenue has stumbled from as high as $107.8 million before the reward halving to $29.9 million on Saturday, May 11, a 29-week low, according to data from Ycharts. Until miners regain confidence in the network and Bitcoin stabilizes in the current market conditions, Runes could remain a second thought for many. On the Flipside
Many developers are concerned that memecoins tarnish crypto’s long-term vision and drive developers away.



Experts suggest that memecoins’ success stems from human desperation to get rich quick.
Why This MattersRunes is undergoing a natural correction, so it would be unfair to call Runes a flop at this time, especially considering the protocol is just three weeks old. However, in hindsight, it does raise concerns for the network since Runes hoped to offset the hit to block rewards for miners, but it isn’t a strong enough reason to retain miners.ARK 21Shares kick staking component out of their proposal:ARK 21Shares Update ETH ETF Proposal: No More Staking Mark Cuban isn’t happy with the SEC:Mark Cuban Blasts SEC Chair Gensler’s Hostile Crypto Probe

Robinhood Crypto Revenue Triples Amid SEC Crackdown


																The popular millennial trading platform released its earnings report on May 8, beating analyst estimates.
According to its first-quarter results, Robinhood reported record revenues of $618 million, up 40% year-over-year.
Additionally, revenue from cryptocurrencies surged 232% to $126 million.
“Transaction-based revenues increased 59% year-over-year to $329 million, primarily driven by cryptocurrencies,” the firm stated.

Robinhood’s crypto revenue tripled in Q1 pic.twitter.com/Z6UtTWvz4C
— Jeff Roberts (@jeffjohnroberts) May 8, 2024





Robinhood Record Revenue
Net income for the first quarter totaled $157 million, or 18 cents a share. This eclipsed the 6-cent average estimate from analysts and compared to a loss of $511 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier.
The firm also did very well out of gold-based products, with gold subscribers increasing to a record high of 1.7 million in Q1.
Vlad Tenev, CEO and co-founder of Robinhood said, “We continued to aggressively execute on our product roadmap in Q1, leading to all-time highs for Net Deposits and Gold Subscribers.”
Robinhood is the latest target in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto crackdown. On May 4 it received a Wells notice from the regulator warning the firm that it is likely to face enforcement action regarding its crypto business.
The regulator made the same argument it has with most enforcement actions, namely that most tokens traded on Robinhood are securities and subject to SEC rules and registration requirements.
Tenev described the SEC action as a “disappointing development,” while chief financial officer Jason Warnick said, “So it’s disappointing to see more regulation by enforcement here.”
“We’ve run our crypto business very carefully. We’ve been very selective about the coins we offer, and we’ve not offered services that have been criticized by the SEC,” continued Warnick.
“The Wells Notice clouds the future of this income stream,” said Lauren Ashcraft, financial services analyst at Emarketer, according to Reuters.
Robinhood stock (HOOD) gained 5.2% in after-hours trading to reach $18.60. It is up 50% so far this year, according to MarketWatch.

                        Russian energy firms are preparing to “hunt down” private crypto miners and crack down on people mining cryptoassets at home, a report claimed on May 12.The media outlet Izvestia said the Russian Government Expert Council was preparing to send fresh mining-related proposals to the Cabinet.Lawmakers want to bundle the proposed measures in a new package of crypto laws. These laws also aim to legalize industrial crypto mining and ban most domestic exchanges.Crypto Miners: Russian Energy Firms to ‘Hunt’ Offenders
The media outlet noted that the council will send written proposals, which its reporters have already seen, to the Cabinet on May 16.The documents propose using electricity meter technology to identify suspected miners. Data analysts will “compare declared readings with actual electricity usage” using “remote checking solutions.”The document also explains how power firms will fine “illegal” miners. The document proposes allowing power companies to charge home-based offenders at “higher rates.”These rates are typically reserved for “industrial enterprises.”Energy Companies to Gain More Powers
Dmitry Tortev, of the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia, told the media outlet that the move would allow power providers to act without the need to go through the legal system. He said:“At present, electricity suppliers need to provide proof of crypto mining-related violations in court. That wastes these companies’ time and money. However, if a unified system for fines is developed at the federal level, this will speed up and intensify the fight against [illegal crypto mining].”Crypto mining remains extremely popular in Russia. But as the activity currently has no legal status, mining coins is currently neither illegal nor legal.Private mining is not illegal either, and at present, Russian power firms can only step in if they suspect individuals are stealing power from local grids.A Russian home crypto miner shows off his equipment. (Source: ProMining/YouTube)Systems Overloaded, Say Providers
The documents reportedly lament that the Russian energy system is “overloaded” in many areas.The authors say that this is resulting in “interruptions in the supply of electricity to consumers.” The document reportedly claims:“In some regions, there has been a significant increase in electrical energy consumption, [often] due to an increase in mining loads. This has led to […] local deficits in the south-eastern part of […] Siberia.”The documents’ authors also said shortages had been reported in “the Irkutsk-Cheremkhovo district of the Irkutsk region, the southern part of Buryatia, and certain parts of the Trans-Baikal region.”These are known crypto mining hotspots, popular for their low power rates and cold winters.Irkutsk in particular has become a hub for mining, both legal and illegal, in recent years. This has led the region to develop a somewhat complicated relationship with mining.An engineer working in a Russian industrial crypto mining data center. (Source: Nastoyashee Vremya Syuzhetiy/YouTube)Izvestia also quoted the Deputy Minister of Energy Pavel Snikkars as saying energy tariffs for miners should “increase in such a way as to encourage them to move away from energy-deficient areas.”The same ministry has previously floated proposals aimed at reducing the strain on overloaded networks.One included forcing industrial miners to shut off their rigs for certain fixed portions of the year.While these have been met with dismay by most miners, most industrial miners want Moscow to “hurry up” and legalize their sector.While this would mean they would have to begin paying taxes on their earnings, the biggest firms want legal clarity from Moscow before they make more data center-related investments.Sergei Bezdelov, the head of the Industrial Mining Association, said:“We have a positive attitude towards any measures aimed at creating conditions for the development of industrial mining in this country. We would be happy to invite inspections by power providers if that would be desirable. This will help bring this sector legitimacy in Russia”

Charles Hoskinson Warns CBDCs Could Imperil Financial Freedom


Cardano blockchain founder Charles Hoskinson spoke against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) while explaining the fundamental concept behind crypto.
Hoskinson made this statement in a May 11 social media post while expressing his views about the forthcoming US presidential elections.
Hoskinson Explains Why Crypto is Important
According to Hoskinson, the fundamental concept of cryptocurrency is to establish new social contracts. These contracts, he explained, would hold governments, corporations, and other authorities accountable to the people. He urged the industry to focus on advancing this purpose rather than engaging in arbitrary debates on taxes and regulations.
Hoskinson warned that those opposing the expansion of crypto might unwittingly endorse the concentration of power among the few. He cautioned that if the crypto industry fails to seize the opportunity, CBDCs could become the only viable alternative.

Consequently, these CBDCs would potentially escalate financial surveillance and citizen control, endangering user privacy and autonomy. Hoskinson furthered that governments might exploit CBDCs to manipulate information flows and hinder social mobility.

“Crypto gives us our voices, financial freedom, and shared humanity back. Any politician who wants to rob us of that is dangerous,” Hoskinson remarked.

The Cardano founder’s view on CBDCs echoes concerns shared by privacy advocates who perceive them as potential tools for extensive government surveillance and economic manipulation. Renowned author Robert Kiyosaki, famous for “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” recently warned of central banks exploiting CBDCs to infringe upon individuals’ privacy.

“Please be careful. Banking crisis worsens. Threat of war grows. Cental banks will push for CBDC, Cental Bank Digital Currency, to SPY on us. I am buying more Bitcoin and silver coins,” Kiyosaki said.

Despite such apprehensions, proponents argue that CBDCs could enhance transactional efficiency and bolster defenses against fraud in digital transactions. Joachim Nagel, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, highlighted the pressing need for central banks to reevaluate their business models and swiftly embrace CBDCs.

A CBDC is a blockchain-based iteration of government-issued currency. Compared to conventional banking infrastructure, it facilitates expedited settlement of fiat currency transactions for central banks, retail banks, and consumers. 
Notably, an overwhelming majority of nations and currency unions—134 in total, comprising 98% of global GDP—are contemplating CBDC implementation, a substantial surge from the 35 nations exploring it in May 2020. Presently, 68 countries are actively engaged in advanced stages of CBDC exploration, including development, pilot programs, or launch preparations.

“19 of the Group of 20 (G20) countries are now in the advanced stages of CBDC development. Of those, eleven countries are already in the pilot stage. This includes Brazil, Japan, India, Australia, South Korea, South Africa, Russia, and Turkey,” the Atlantic Council wrote.

Bitcoin whale wallets move $61M in BTC after a decade of dormancy

Two mysterious Bitcoin (BTC) wallets holding a combined 1,000 Bitcoin — worth $61 million at current prices — have suddenly awoken after a 10-year hiatus, transferring out almost every single satoshi.Wallet address “16vRq…qjzEa" transferred out its 500 Bitcoin at block 843,131 on May 12 at 7:10 pm UTC, while the other 500 Bitcoin was sent by address “1DUJuH…NgfC5” two blocks later, according to Blockchain.com’s Bitcoin block explorer.The wallets each received 500 Bitcoin on Sept. 12 and Sept. 13, 2013, when Bitcoin was priced at $134, according to CoinGecko. At current prices, the combined amount transferred is now worth 456 times more than their acquisition price, at $61.2 million.Since the transfers, one of the receiving addresses from “16vRq…qjzEa” has already transferred the 500 Bitcoin onward to a multitude of , while the receiver from “1DUJuH…NgfC5” is still holding its 500 Bitcoin. The proximity of the inward and outward transfers prompted blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain to pair the two transactions together, onlookers believe the two wallets were owned by the same person or entity.Source: LookonchainPrior to the transfers, the two addresses were the equal 4,353rd largest Bitcoin whales, according to BitInfoCharts.Less than a week ago, a Satoshi Nakamoto-era Bitcoin wallet transferred 687 Bitcoin, worth $43.9 million, to two separate addresses.Related: 'Epic sat' mined from fourth Bitcoin halving block sells for $2.1MWhile at least one of these early-day Bitcoin wallets tends to wake up each month, there are nearly 1.8 million Bitcoin addresses that have remained dormant for over a decade, according to a recent analysis by Chainalysis and Fortune.These wallets, which exclude Nakamoto’s wallet, contain about $121 billion worth of Bitcoin, Fortune said.While it is impossible to know how much this has been lost, the 1.8 million addresses account for 8.5% of the total 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist.People often speculate that dormant wallets may be waking up to sell Bitcoin at an opportune time,  others suggest it could be to transfer the funds to a different address, perhaps under a more secure noncustodial wallet service provider.Bitcoin is currently priced at $61,450 and is up 130% over the last 12 months, according to CoinGecko.Bitcoin’s change in price since April, 2013.

Bitcoin, Ethereum: Two levels where a swing trade could be profitable - AMBCrypto



Ethereum has a slightly more bullish bias for the coming week.
The Bitcoin consolidation phase was still ongoing, and a revisit to $60k was growing more likely.

Bitcoin [BTC] traders were going through a relatively tough period after the easy, straightforward rallies that have been the norm since last October.
Ethereum [ETH] has been more complicated, but BTC’s halving event last month has changed the market conditions to chop and range formations all over the market.
AMBCrypto investigated what the market sentiment was looking like over the weekend, and where this week’s price action could go.
One of the two has speculators expectant of bullish returns in the near term

The 10th of May saw an increase in the Bitcoin Open Interest, but the OI has been trending downward since the price spike on the 6th of May.
Meanwhile, the price also formed a series of lower highs over the past week, descending from $64k to $61.1k at press time.
The Funding Rate was negative at the start of May when Bitcoin plummeted to $56k. Since then, the Funding Rate has recovered.
However, in the past few days, it has been barely above zero, which indicated the sentiment was not strongly bullish.

Ethereum also saw Funding Rates slip into the negative territory in early May but has since recovered. The past week’s downtrend saw the funding rate hover around the baseline +0.01 mark.
A slight bounce from $2980 to $3040 on the 9th of May saw the Open Interest and the funding rate jump higher.
This did not repeat with Bitcoin despite a similar price bounce, which suggested that speculators were more eager to long ETH than BTC.
What are the next liquidity pockets that could attract prices?

The 7-day liquidation heatmap of Bitcoin showed a bright cluster of liquidations at the $60k area. To the north, $61.8k and $63k are the next bullish targets.
On the 5th of May, we saw prices jump above the $64k mark to collect liquidity before a brutal short-term reversal.
Similarly, we might see a downward plunge on Monday to collect the liquidity at $60k before rebounding higher. Hence, BTC traders would want to buy the dip to the $50.6k-$60k region.
However, traders must also be prepared for a move below $59.4k for BTC, and set their stop-losses accordingly in the event of a dip to $60k.


Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

On the other hand, Ethereum has a cluster of liquidity nearby to the north at $2950. This was close to the current market price of $2928. A dip to the $2860 region would likely present a buying opportunity.
The liquidation levels around the $3.1k-$3.2k area present an attractive target. A drop below $2.8k would likely herald a strong short-term downtrend, and traders can cut their losses in this scenario.

North Korean hackers deploy ‘Durian’ malware, targeting crypto firms

North Korean hackers are utilizing a “striking” new malware variant dubbed “Durian” to reportedly launch attacks on South Korean crypto firms.The North Korean hacking group Kimsuky used the new malware in a series of targeted attacks on at least two cryptocurrency firms so far, according to a May 9 threat report from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky. This was done through a “persistent” attack by exploiting legitimate security software used exclusively by crypto firms in South Korea. Source: KasperskyThe previously unknown Durian malware acts as an installer that deploys a continued stream of malware including a backdoor known as “AppleSeed,” a custom proxy tool known as LazyLoad, and other legitimate tools such as Chrome Remote Desktop.“Durian boasts comprehensive backdoor functionality, enabling the execution of delivered commands, additional file downloads, and exfiltration of files,” wrote Kaspersky.Additionally, Kaspersky noted that LazyLoad was also used by Andariel, a sub-group within fellow North Korean hacking consortium Lazarus Group — something that suggested a “tenuous” connection between Kimsuky and the more notorious hacking group. Related: North Korean Lazarus hacker group using LinkedIn to target and steal assets: ReportFirst emerging in 2009, Lazarus has established itself as one of the most notorious groups of crypto hackers. On April 29, independent blockchain sleuth ZachXBT revealed that the Lazarus group had successfully laundered over $200 million in ill-gotten crypto between 2020 and 2023.In total, the Lazarus Group is accused of stealing over $3 billion in crypto assets in the six years leading up to 2023.Lazarus was credited with stealing over 17% — a little over $309 million — of the total stolen funds in 2023.

Franklin Templeton CEO Excited About Future with On-Chain ETFs - DailyCoin


        
Franklin Templeton’s CEO is excited about the future of blockchain technology. 



Jenny Johnson cites eye-opening results from in-house experiments. 



Franklin Templeton is optimistic about integrating the technology into the firm’s operations. 
Blockchain technology and the crypto industry have recently gained favor among major financial institutions, marking a significant shift from just a few years ago. Back then, trillion-dollar asset management firms cast doubt on the space, branding it as a hotbed of fraud. However, the industry has evolved remarkably in recent years, winning over even the staunchest critics. Among them is Franklin Templeton’s CEO, Jenny Johnson, whose public support signals a seismic shift in perception. Franklin Templeton CEO Expresses Her Love For Blockchains“First of all, I am a huge fan of blockchain and the technology,” Jenny Johnson reiterated her unwavering support for blockchain technology during the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California. 
The Franklin Templeton CEO expressed her enthusiasm for blockchain’s potential, emphasizing her firm has been working on new ways to leverage the technology. During her interview, Johnson shared that the trillion-dollar asset management firm gained a lot of insights from in-house experiments comparing traditional and blockchain technologies. The results were eye-opening for Franklin Templeton, with Johnson expressing astonishment at the cost efficiency of blockchain technology compared to traditional methods.“We were astonished by how much less cost it was to run it on the blockchain. It’s a very effective technology, and we think it is going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities.” Johnson shared.Convinced by the technology’s potential, the CEO hinted at Franklin Templeton’s plans to explore new investment avenues, including on-chain ETFs and mutual funds. Johnson explained that navigating the currency financial infrastructure, particularly reconciling data across multiple systems, was particularly costly and time-consuming. With blockchain technology, Franklin Templeton can mitigate costs significantly and enhance its efficiency. Johnson expressed enthusiasm over opening up avenues for other investment opportunities. Optimism radiated from the CEO, who was particularly looking forward to using the technology for myriad applications within the firm. On the Flipside
Franklin Templeton launched the first US-registered fund using a public blockchain to process transactions and document share ownership.



Franklin Templton’s Bitcoin ETF held $365 million in assets under management at press time. 
Why This Matters A few years ago, blockchain technology and the crypto industry had a bad rap, primarily due to the prevalence of bad actors and scammers tarnishing the industry’s image. However, Jenny Johnson’s recent comments signal a major shift in the perception and highlight the remarkable progress the industry has made. It also underscores the growing willingness of major asset managers and institutions to delve into and incorporate blockchain technology into their operations.Are Bitcoin Runes a Flop?Bitcoin Runes Hype Simmers Down as Network Activity PlungesArk 21Shares cut staking from their ETF proposal:ARK 21Shares Update ETH ETF Proposal: No More Staking

Polkadot: THIS signals worrying signs for DOT - What should you do? - AMBCrypto



Social activity for the Polkadot network declined materially in the last few days.
The overall activity on the network also fell.

Polkadot [DOT] has been one of the L1s that has not seen as much growth as its counterparts. One of the reasons for the same would be the declining popularity of Polkadot across social media platforms.
Word on the street
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the social volume for Polkadot declined significantly. Moreover, the Weighted Sentiment around DOT fell materially.
Source: Santiment
Nevertheless, Polkadot has been actively collaborating with a media agency to amplify awareness about the network.
eVox, a Media Agency & Content Creator Management firm, has dedicated several months to advancing the Polkadot cause.
Presently, they are aiming to extend this outreach effort to CoinMarketCap.
Source: X
It remains to be seen whether Polkadot’s efforts to improve its popularity can yield positive results in the long run.
Looking at the price
DOT wasn’t doing too well in terms of price movement, either. Since the 1st of April, its price fell by 27.96%. During this period, DOT showcased multiple lower lows and lower his, indicative of a bearish trend.
Moreover, the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for DOT had grown slightly, implying that there could an uptick in the money flow for DOT going forward.
However, the RSI had declined to 42, implying that bullish momentum had fallen significantly. DOT would need to retest the $7.598 level a couple more times before it can start its journey upwards.
Source: Trading View
Coming to the state of the protocol, the situation looked quite dire. The number of active users on the Polkadot network declined significantly over the last 30 days.
The revenue generated by the network also declined during this period.

These factors suggested that not only was DOT not doing well in terms of its price and social activity, but the overall strength of its ecosystem was also declining.
It could be difficult for DOT to recover if things continue like this.

Mark Cuban Schools Crypto Critic, Blames SEC For FTX-Like Events: 'This Is An Institutional Failure' - Benzinga

Billionaire and prominent television celebrity, Mark Cuban, highlighted a host of cryptocurrency benefits in response to a supposed critic of the asset class.  What Happened: James Love, Director of an NGO Knowledge Ecology International, posed a sardonic question on the utility of cryptocurrencies to Cuban. He asked, "Other than speculation, avoiding taxes and engaging in criminal activity, what is the utility of crypto?"Cuban detailed various benefits of digital assets, including minimal transaction fees, easily accessible credit, and insulation against theft."For crypto: lower cost of capital transfers, immediate collateralized loans, store of value , tokenization of assets, application and retention of royalties to digital assets like books,  real time, low cost insurance markets , cold storage ownership of significant assets to protect against theft," the entrepreneur argued. Regarding incidents like the FTX collapse which questioned the market's credibility, Cuban pinned it on the SEC. "This is an institutional failure of the SEC, not a crypto issue," he asserted. "If the SEC has instituted audited collateral and segregation of funds requirements, we would not have seen FTX and others fail."Why It Matters: Mark Cuban, one of the most influential voices in the crypto space, has advocated for clarity in legal frameworks governing digital assets. Like most influencers, he has criticized the SEC’s overbearing approach to the matter, and blamed SEC Chair Gary Gensler for making it impossible for cryptocurrency companies to function in the United States.With an energetic pro-crypto campaign launched by former U.S. president and current Republican candidate, Donald Trump, many of the players in the space have extended their unequivocal support to the firebrand leader.Photo: Courtesy of Gage Skidmore on FlickerPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin BTC/USD was trading at $61,037, following a marginal 0.25% growth in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Trade Mixed After Turbulent Week: Analyst Says King Crypto Can Rise To $76K Level If It Reclaims This Crucial Support

Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) to Skyrocket 17,000% as ByBit Listing Announced, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because BLATRUMP has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on ByBit.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Black Donald Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Black Donald Trump could become the next viral memecoin.



Black Donald Trump launched with over $54,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Black Donald Trump on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the ByBit listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Black Donald Trump by entering its contract address – 29BiHVTBEo7RnbtwqwTmV3Hy6nDTadcCgopM6HUyjGRK – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BLATRUMP.

PEPE nears breakout? A bullish pattern is set in motion - AMBCrypto



PEPE’s price increased by more than 3% in the last seven days. 
The meme coin might face resistance at $0.0000092 before retesting its ATH.

Pepe [PEPE] might once again come into the spotlight, as it was fast approaching its all-time high. 
In fact, a bullish pattern had formed on its chart, which indicated that the meme coin to go further above its ATH was high. Let’s take a closer look at what’s going on. 
PEPE is on the right track
AMBCrypto reported earlier that PEPE was heading towards its ATH to retest that level. The trend continued as the meme coin came closer to testing its ATH. 
In fact, Crypto Tony, a popular crypto analyst, also pointed out this development in a recent tweet. 
As the meme coin was on track to test its ATH, its price increased by more than 3.6% in the last seven days.
 At the time of writing, the meme coin was trading at $0.000008732 with a market capitalization of over $3.67 billion. 
The possibility of PEPE going above its ATH seemed likely to happen in the coming days as a bullish ascending triangle pattern emerged. 
The meme coin’s price has started to consolidate inside the bull pattern since the 1st of April. At press time, it was on the verge of breaking out of the pattern. A few of the metrics suggested a successful breakout.
Source: TradingView
For example, PEPE’s price remained above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick, hinting at a continued price increase. 
However, a few of the indicators suggest otherwise. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp decline. 
The Money Flow Index (MFI) also, after a comfortable rise, went down slightly, which might restrict PEPE from breaking above the pattern. 
What metrics suggest
AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data to see whether metrics supported the possibility of PEPE breaking above the pattern. We found that PEPE’s MVRV ratio remained positive last week. 
At press time, the metric had a value of nearly 15%. However, the meme coin’s open interest dropped. 
Additionally, sentiment around PEPE started to turn bearish, as evident from the decline in its Weighted Sentiment.

AMBCrypto then checked Hyblock Capital’s data to find out if there were any roadblocks for the meme coin ahead of its ATH. As per our analysis, PEPE’s liquidation would rise sharply near $0.0000092. 
A rise in liquidation often results in a price correction. Therefore, it will be crucial for the meme coin to go above that level in order to test its ATH and possibly go above it.

Franklin Templeton CEO: Blockchain offers major cost savings for tokenization - Crypto Briefing




Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, speaking at the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California, praised blockchain’s efficiency and cost reduction in asset tokenization and shared her thoughts on the benefits of generative AI.Johnson stated that the company ran a parallel experiment for six to eight months, processing account records using both traditional and blockchain methods. The results showed that blockchain was more cost-effective and produced fewer errors.
“We used to run our own in-house, one of the few firms that did. And the one that we built on blockchain. So these are the records of the shareholders and we parallel process for a period of 6 to 8 months,” Johnson said.
“And we were astonished by how much less, how much cost it was to run a blockchain. It’s a very effective technology, and we think it is going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities,” she emphasized.
Johnson predicts that all ETFs and mutual funds could eventually transition to blockchain technology. She believes this shift would lead to significant cost savings due to the elimination of data verification between different systems on the blockchain.
“Eventually, I think exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain,” Johnson stated.
“In the case of blockchain, there’s only one source of trust. That transaction happens, everybody has the source of trust, and so that drives out a lot of costs. And when you can drive out the friction in transactions, you can start to invest in new areas,” she explained.
Franklin Templeton is behind one of the world’s leading equity tokenized funds, the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), represented by the BENJI token. As of May 12, the BENJI token had a market capitalization of $368 million, according to Dune Analytics.Data is the next oilIn addition to tokenization, Johnson also discussed the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in assisting asset managers to better meet customers’ needs.According to her, “data is the next oil next year.” She believes that large asset managers will have an edge in the AI race because these firms have much proprietary data to analyze and train AI models.Johnson said Franklin Templeton has introduced an AI bot to their help desk to assist with handling inquiries, and the bot is capable of handling 60% of queries.However, the real potential is “a model that’s leveraging a bunch of different AI,” she noted. She believes these advancements could pave the way for highly personalized investment strategies.

This Week's US Inflation Reports Are Expected to Shake Crypto Markets


																Crypto markets remained flat over the weekend following a fall last week, dropping total capitalization to $2.38 trillion.
This week’s economic calendar could induce more volatility as key inflation data is reported alongside a number of Federal Reserve speeches, which could indicate the direction of monetary policy going forward.
Economic Calendar
Tuesday will see the release of the core PPI (Producer Price Index) report, which reflects input prices for producers and manufacturers, measuring the costs of producing consumer goods and directly affecting retail pricing.
It is viewed as a pre-indicator of inflationary pressures, making it a leading indicator for the following month’s CPI (Consumer Price Index) report.






April’s Core CPI report is released on Wednesday. This is one of the two key indicators used to measure inflation, the second being Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE.
CPI directly shapes price trends in the economy, consumer spending, and business outlooks. It also directly impacts the Federal Reserve’s policy rate decisions.
“If CPI inflation rises again this week, it will mark the third straight monthly increase,” observed the Kobeissi Letter.
There are also a total of 12 Federal Reserve speaker events this week, including chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday.
According to a Conference Board measure of company CEO expectations survey last week, the majority of US CEOs expect the Fed to cut rates just once this year.
Out of 136 CEOs surveyed, 31% said they do not expect any rate cuts this year, while 26% project 2. “Meanwhile, markets are pricing just 2 rate cuts this year as a base case with the first cut in September,” reported Kobeissi.
Interestingly, Elon Musk took a swipe at the Fed over the weekend, comparing it to the Monopoly board game. He specifically referenced a section of the rules referring to the in-game bank, which says the bank never goes bankrupt and can print new money when needed.


Crypto Market Outlook
Crypto markets remain subdued this Monday morning in Asia, with little movement among most of the majors.
Bitcoin prices were around $61,000 at the time of writing having remained at almost the same time as yesterday. The asset is down 4.3% since the same time last week, however.
Ethereum has failed to recover above $3,000 following a fall below it on May 10 and remains short-term bearish at $2,900 at the time of writing.
The altcoins were predominantly in the red, with larger losses for Solana, Dogecoin, Avalanche, and Near Protocol.

Decade-old Bitcoin wallets make a $60 million exit: What's going on? - AMBCrypto



Two wallets sell over $60 million worth of BTCs.
Key metrics have declined recently.

Recently, two wallets, which had remained inactive for several years, have initiated movement, transferring all their Bitcoin [BTC] holdings. 
This action coincides with a decline in key on-chain metrics and heightened levels of greed in the Bitcoin market.
Bitcoin wallets rake in millions of dollars in gains
Recent data from Lookonchain revealed that two Bitcoin wallets, which have been dormant for nearly 11 years, have recently become active. These wallets, each containing 500 BTC, sold their entire holdings. 
Data showed that BTC was priced at $124 when they were purchased years ago, bringing each wallet’s value to approximately $62,000. 
Also, with the current Bitcoin price, the wallets sold their holdings for over $30 million each, totaling approximately $60.9 million. 
Furthermore, this significant move raises the question whether it will trigger reactions from key on-chain metrics that have recently experienced declines.
Bitcoin key metrics declines
According to Santiment data, Bitcoin has experienced significant declines in daily active addresses, transaction volume, and whale transactions. 
Analysis of the data revealed that these metrics saw significant declines following their peaks in February. Also, they are currently approaching historic lows. 
Towards the end of April, daily active addresses exceeded 815,000, transaction volume surpassed 1.5 million, and whale transactions totaled over 73,500. 
Source: Santiment
However, as of this writing, daily active addresses have decreased to around 545,000, transaction volume has fallen to approximately 495,000, and whale transactions have reduced to around 26,500.
Greed dominates the Bitcoin sentiment
According to the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, BTC was currently in the Greed zone at the time of this writing. 
The analysis of the Index revealed that BTC had a score of 56, indicating a sentiment of greed among investors. This suggests that more people were entering the BTC market to capitalize on potential profits.
 However, given the decline in key metrics that BTC was experiencing, and the recent sell-off witnessed, this could lead to a price decline.
BTC stays above 60,000 for now
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin daily timeframe price trend revealed that it was trading at around $61,100, representing a less than 1% increase at this time.

This slight uptick followed its previous trading session in the $60,000 price zone. However, examining the stochastic indicator indicated a potential price reversal on the horizon.
Typically, a crossover in the blue or red line of the indicator could signal an impending reversal in price direction.

Phishing Alert for BounceBit (BB) Amid New Listings


BounceBit, a Bitcoin (BTC) restaking protocol, announced the official launch of its mainnet at 02:30 UTC today. Shortly after, from 08:30 to 10:00 UTC, the company will start its BB token airdrop.
Additionally, the much-anticipated listing of BB tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges KuCoin and Gate.io is set to expand its market presence. Both exchanges will begin trading operations for BB tokens starting at 10:00 UTC today.
BounceBit Trading Begins; Watch Out for Phishing
However, a cybersecurity alert has tempered the excitement. The Chief of Information and Security Officer at SlowMist, known as 23pds, has flagged a significant risk. The first Google search result for “BounceBit” is a phishing site called bouncbit.io, posing threats to users’ safety.

“Clicking it will jump to the phishing website bouncbit[.]io. Please be aware of the risks,” 23pds warned.

Following the warning, BounceBit has shared official airdrop and customer support links on its X (Twitter) account. It also warned that any tweets below its official announcement thread that use its name and post links are likely scams.

The launch of BounceBit mainnets and BB token airdrop came after the protocol secured a $6 million seed funding earlier this year. Blockchain Capital and Breyer Capital co-led this round, with participation from various venture capital entities and angel investors. Furthermore, in April, Binance Labs, Binance’s venture capital and incubation arm, invested an undisclosed amount in BounceBit.
At its heart, BounceBit introduces a BTC restaking mechanism. It is launching a Shared-Security Clients (SSC) infrastructure, starting with the BTC Restaking Chain.
This mechanism involves a dual-token system where validators stake both BTC and BB. Therefore, such a mechanism enhances the platform’s security and stability.

As of May 13, DeFiLlama reports BounceBit has a total value locked (TVL) of $448.65 million. Given its backing, it is plausible that BounceBit’s mainnet launch and BB tokens airdrop catch the crypto community’s interest and attract scammers.

El Salvador's Bitcoin Strategy Advances with Public Mempool


El Salvador, a Latin American country famous for adopting Bitcoin (BTC) as its legal tender, recently made a significant move in its cryptocurrency investment strategy. The government now offers public access to Bitcoin investment data through a personalized mempool.
The latest mempool data reveals that El Salvador currently holds 5,748.76 BTC valued at over $352.8 million.
El Salvador Adds Transparency to Its Bitcoin Investments
The Bitcoin Office, a Salvadoran government-owned body aimed at managing all projects related to BTC, announced this new feature through their official X (Twitter) account on May 12.

“El Salvador now has its own mempool space where anyone can consult our Bitcoin treasury holdings,” The Bitcoin Office noted.

In addition to tracking the holdings, El Salvador’s mempool data unveils that the government has purchased an additional 31 BTC over the last month. This purchase is a part of the Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy announced by President Nayib Bukele in November 2022. BeInCrypto previously reported that Bukele said his administration would buy 1 BTC daily “until Bitcoin became unaffordable with fiat currencies.”

The crypto community also welcomed El Salvador’s mempool. They praised its transparency in El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings. Criptolawyer, a prominent Latin American crypto community figure and founder of Bitcoin legal advisor and consultant—Legalrocks, expressed her support.

“The Government of El Salvador publishes its holdings in BTC so that anyone in the world at any time can audit their Bitcoin reserves in real-time,” Criptolawyer said.

Despite the government’s strong BTC investment strategy, the adoption rate of Bitcoin in El Salvador remains modest. According to a study from José Simeón Cañas Central American University, only 12% of the local population in El Salvador used Bitcoin at least once to pay for goods and services in 2023.

This figure is a significant drop from 2022. During that period, 24.4% of Salvadorans had engaged in Bitcoin transactions.

Peter Schiff Says He Gets A 'Kick' Out Of Fanatics Accusing Him Of Secretly Owning Bitcoin: They Are 'Drunk On The Kool-Aid' - Benzinga

Noted economist and staunch Bitcoin BTC/USD critic, Peter Schiff, ridiculed opponents’ claims that he secretly owns the King Crypto.What Happened: The gold proponent trashed the ongoing speculation from certain section of his critics, calling them "drunk on the Kool-Aid.""I get a kick out of Bitcoin fanatics who accuse me of secretly owning Bitcoin, but refusing to publicly wear the ribbon," Schiff jabbed the pro-Bitcoin crowd. Schiff added that he fundamentally differed over the prospect of cryptocurrencies, and his detractors were finding it tough to come to terms with this fact.Why It Matters: One of the strongest anti-Bitcoin voices on social media, Schiff has stayed persistent in his opposition to the asset class over the years, vehemently advocating for gold over its so-called digital counterpart.That said, in one of the interviews in March, he wished he bought the the world's largest digital asset back in 2010, given its profit potential. Schiff stated that even if he had bought Bitcoin, he would have kept it to himself. “I would have bought it just betting on other people being dumb enough to buy it and pay a higher price.”Earlier this month, the fierce critic noted that Bitcoin was in a bear market and mocked HODLers, a crypto jargon for long-term holders of the coin, saying, "The party is over."Photo Courtesy: Wikimedia CommonsPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $60,807, following a 0.16% decline in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. It was down 18% from the all-time high set during March.Gold was seen trading at $2,357 as of 11:40 p.m. EDT, down 0.11% in the last 24 hours.

Trump Campaign Develops Bitcoin Agenda With Industry Expert


								David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, has publicly announced his collaboration with Donald Trump’s campaign to forge a crypto-friendly agenda, potentially shaping future US policy on digital assets. Using the social media platform X, Bailey detailed his direct involvement in crafting a strategic vision for BTC and other cryptocurrencies under a potential Trump administration
A $100 million War Chest For Bitcoin
Bailey announced, “For the past month we have been working with the Trump campaign to develop their Bitcoin and crypto policy agenda. We proposed a comprehensive executive order for President Trump to sign on day 1.” This executive order is expected to lay the groundwork for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, reflecting the campaign’s strategic approach to digital assets.
Bailey also emphasized the campaign’s commitment, stating, “We intend to raise a $100 million war chest for the campaign to ensure the next President of the United States is pro Bitcoin.”

This development follows Trump’s recent remarks at the Trump Cards NFT Gala, where he criticized the current administration’s stance on cryptocurrencies. Trump quipped, “[Biden] has no idea. But look, [he’s] very much against it. The Democrats are very much against it.” He further aligned himself with pro-crypto sentiments, indicating, “If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for me.”
The announcement by Bailey sparked diverse reactions within the crypto community. Sweep (@0xSweep), a well-known crypto influencer, commented, “Bitcoin doesn’t need Trump. Trump needs Bitcoin.” Bailey responded by emphasizing the mutual benefits of this alliance, suggesting a strategic partnership rather than a one-sided dependency.
Bailey elaborated on the potential impact of a pro-BTC presidency, stating, “As Bitcoin’s trajectory becomes undeniable this cycle, the establishment is going to fight us tooth and nail. A pro-Bitcoin presidency buys us 4 years of status quo at a minimum (maybe more).” This perspective highlights the critical window of opportunity for the Bitcoin and crypto community to solidify its position within the US financial system.

Addressing the political nuances, Bailey asserted, “Bitcoin is not a partisan issue, it’s apolitical. However, we will mobilize to defend ourselves.” He clarified that the community’s support is more about opposing the current administration rather than an outright endorsement of Trump, saying, “We’re not voting for Trump per se, we’re voting against Biden. The only person to blame for that is Biden.”
Bailey also made a bold statement about the community’s political influence: “It’s time for Bitcoin to elect the next President of the United States.” This statement underscores the increasing recognition and potential clout of digital currencies in US electoral politics.
The dialogue between Trump, Bailey, and the broader cryptocurrency community suggests a significant shift in the political landscape concerning digital assets. As the US presidential election approaches, the BTC policies of candidates could become a pivotal issue for winning the election, influencing not only the future of regulatory landscapes but also the broader acceptance and integration of digital currencies in the US economy.
At press time, BTC traded at $60,896.

The conference, organized by Bitcoin Magazine, aimed to showcase the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments in Asia. It featured discussions centered around the implementation and implications of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in Hong Kong.The HKEX launched Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on April 30, marking the first spot virtual asset ETFs in Asia.David Bailey, co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, emphasized the event’s role in bridging Hong Kong’s emerging crypto economy with the mainland’s restrictive regulatory environment.“I think the ETFs were kind of an admission that Bitcoin is here to stay,” said Bailey. “There’s no way that Hong Kong just accidentally stumbled into launching an ETF … It wasn’t random.”Bailey also stated that the local government has shown strong support for the sector and the company is already considering returning to the SAR. The city has hosted several web3 events this year, including the WOW Summit and Web3 Festival.“I think they see Bitcoin as a massive opportunity for Hong Kong,” said Bailey.Regulated Bitcoin Trading Offers New Investment Options
Ben Gagnon, Chief Mining Officer of Bitfarms, expressed hope that Hong Kong could serve as a “conduit for Chinese investors” to access Bitcoin-related technologies. He views this as a potential way to mitigate the market downturn in China.“What I’m optimistic about is, with these rules and these regulations now in place, Hong Kong actually may find a way to be this bridge for China to Bitcoin and to the greater crypto ecosystem in a way that’s more safe, more controlled or regulated,” said Gagnon.“I hope that there’s going to be more pathways into mainland China,” Gagnon added.

Bitcoin Dominance Keeps Surging as Altcoins Plunge


Major altcoins are taking a severe beating, losing more than 5% of their value over the past 24 hours.  Solana (SOL) is down more than 5% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data, becoming the top laggard among the 10 biggest cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 4.6% while Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have 3.2% and 4%, respectively.  XRP, the Ripple-affiliated token, is also down 3% over the same period of time. According to the 100eyesCrypto indicator, the token is now approaching horizontal support. Bitcoin dominance tops 55% Bitcoin is currently trading below the $61,000 level, but it is down only a mere 0.1%. At the same time, Bitcoin dominance has now risen above the 55% level yet again after peaking at nearly 57% in April. Ethereum (ETH) is currently underperforming Bitcoin (BTC), slipping by more than 1%. All eyes on the CPI dataSo far, the cryptocurrency market remains in the doldrums since there is no obvious bullish catalyst that could drive the prices higher. However, the upcoming CPI data, which is scheduled to be published on Wednesday, could be that much-needed bullish impetus, setting volatility for the week ahead. Lower-than-expected inflation is likely to push prices higher, encouraging the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. However, a disappointing CPI reading will negatively affect the market.

Joe Biden’s Position at Risk with Anti-Crypto Stance: Uniswap Founder


							

Hayden Adams points out the US Presidential Election candidates’ contrasting approaches to cryptocurrencies.



The Uniswap Founder states that Biden and other Democrats’ anti-crypto stance could harm the crypto industry.



Adams urges Biden to reverse his stance to ensure his next Presidential term, hinting at his potential loss if he holds the current view.




Uniswap Founder Hayden Adams, in his recent X post, raised the alarm over US President Joe Biden’s approach to cryptocurrencies. Adams pointed out that Biden and other Democrats’ alleged anti-crypto stance could harm the crypto industry.







Ahead of the 2024 US Presidential Election, both Democratic and Republican candidates have been addressing the public, requesting for their votes. In a recent speech, Former President and Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump embraced crypto, criticizing Biden for his skeptic view of crypto. He further slammed Biden asserting that the latter has “no idea” about crypto but is “very much against it.”



In response, Mark Cuban, a prominent television voice, highlighted the need for comprehensive crypto regulatory rules. Shedding light on the prevailing regulatory uncertainties and the increasing threats, Cuban pointed out the significance of pushing for a regulatory framework rather than simply supporting crypto.









According to Adams’ post, Biden and his followers consider crypto irrelevant in the 2024 election, worsening the regulatory anarchy. Reflecting on the candidates’ contrasting views of crypto, Adams posited, “Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto.” He added,




”Not much time for Biden to save it. Any one close to him or dem leadership should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto (public support/plan and reigning in sec + warren).” 




In a previous X post, Adams shed light on the shift occurring in the financial sector with the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. He pinpointed the potential threat to Biden’s election prospects amidst the growing influence of cryptocurrencies.

Chinese workers paid in CBDC are cashing it out for real money: Report

China’s digital currency project reportedly still has teething problems, with a report suggesting some state Chinese workers being paid in “e-CNY," or digital yuan, seldom use it and have been converting it to physical cash. According to a May 13 report from South China Morning Post, some Chinese cities have begun paying state employees in the country’s CBDC but most of these early adopters convert it to cash immediately. “I prefer not to keep the money in the e-CNY app, because there’s no interest if I leave it there,” said Sammy Lin — an account manager at a Chinese state bank in Suzhou. “There are also not so many places, online or offline, where I can use the e-yuan.”Civil servant Andrew Wang said he wasn’t too worried by the idea of digital cash as it was only a small part of his salary being paid in digital yuan.However, his wife — who receives her full salary in digital yuan — withdraws the full amount as regular cash the moment she’s paid due to a lack of utility with the digital cash. The e-CNY app being used in in Suzhou. Source: Kyodo“She can’t deposit the money or buy financial products with the e-CNY wallet,” Wang said. While China has reportedly been a “functionally cashless” society for the better part of a decade, many Chinese citizens remain hesitant to use a purely digital currency like the digital yuan due to wider fears of surveillance and its limited use cases, SCMP's report suggested. Despite these concerns, more than $250 billion worth of transactions have been conducted by way of the digital yuan as of July 20, 2023, according to Yi Gang, the former governor of the People’s Bank of China.Ye Dongyan, a researcher at Beijing’s Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business said there needs to be more effort made when balancing privacy and security if the government wants to roll out the digital yuan throughout the rest of China. “Paper currency is used anonymously, but the digital yuan is different. The boundaries between information tracking and information security protection need more deliberation,” he said. Related: Hong Kong issuer seeks spot Bitcoin ETF for mainland ChinaGang said the privacy issues with the new CBDC were the “biggest challenge” of the digital finance era. Despite the privacy concerns shared by participants in the program, Gang said at a March forum in Beijing that the digital yuan was able to “fully protect privacy” through something called “controllable anonymity” which means there’s no tracking of small payments but some for larger ones. Since the currency’s inception in 2020, several jurisdictions in China have been working to boost the adoption of the CBDC, with multiple cities giving away over $26.5 million (180 million Chinese yuan) by way of subsidies and consumption coupons.

Reports of ‘bleached’ counterfeit bills crop up across North America

Fake dollar bills are appearing in greater numbers across North America in recent weeks, from Texas to Hawaii to Canada.On May 8, a report revealed that police in Brownsville, Texas, have arrested a man accused of manufacturing counterfeit dollar bills.The 45-year-old was charged with seven counts of forgery following numerous police reports from local businesses including grocery stores, hotels, gas stations, and restaurants complaining about people paying with counterfeit bills. However, it appears that these fake banknotes were not limited to just one area as they have been circulating further afield.Earlier this month, it was reported that counterfeit money was used to enter a baseball field in Ohio. Dodgy dollars have even been found as far away as Hawaii as police have reported that people are taking low-denomination USD bills and turning them into $100 bills.The counterfeiters were reportedly taking $1 bills, bleaching the ink off, and printing over the original currency to make it look like $100, said local police. They will then use the fake note to purchase something small to get genuine currency in return for change. Earlier this year, fake $100 bills were reported circulating in Ontario, Canada. Meanwhile, on May 12, police in Charlottetown, Canada, warned that counterfeit American $100 bills used as movie props were being passed at local businesses. Source: Charlottetown PoliceIt also comes amid the circulation of a widely shared Tiktok video of a former Donald Trump staffer showing him boasting that he hands out “fake Hollywood money” to homeless people. The U.S. Secret Service reported that they seized nearly $22 million in counterfeit cash in 2023 while ABC reported that “the crime of counterfeiting is making a comeback,” in March. Related: How to identify fake cryptocurrencyHowever, fake fiat is not a problem limited to North America.On May 12, Insider Politic reported on X that a resident of Barcelona, Spain, was arrested for the production of counterfeit 20 and 50-euro banknotes in her apartment. In April, German investigators reported the seizure of counterfeit dollar bills with a face value of over $103 million. Another blow to fiat?The latest flurry of fake fiat reports is another blow to traditional paper currencies which have been under the macroeconomic microscope over the past year or so. Many commentators, particularly in the crypto community, have been critical of central bank policy which involves printing money and inflating the circulation.Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk even compared the U.S. central bank to the popular board game Monopoly on X on May 12 for its similarities in manufacturing money and having a bank that can never go broke. 


On the other hand, crypto assets such as Bitcoin are extremely difficult to counterfeit or double-spend due to the immutable nature of the blockchain on which they reside and the security of the network through proof-of-work consensus. However, that hasn’t stopped other types of scams, such as attempted sales of testnet BTC, which is supposed to be worthless, to dupe users into thinking they’re receiving the genuine article. Other scams include spurious tokens with the same or similar tickers being peddled as tokens for a genuine project, such as a fake Ethena labs token which was exploited for $290,000 on the Binance launch pool in March.Magazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom

Bitcoin sats the ‘most valuable digital canvas ever’ - Ordinals artist

The lead artist behind the Bitcoin art community “Nurorealm” said it was a “dream come true” to inscribe their 3D art on an “epic sat” — which he won in a recent auction. “[The artwork is now inscribed on] one of the most valuable digital assets in existence and is the most valuable digital canvas ever,” said “Nuro” in a recent interview with Cointelegraph.Nuro and fellow Bitcoin art community “Book of Blob” won an auction on April 25 to successfully claim the latest epic sat — the first satoshi mined in a new Bitcoin halving block — which was mined by ViaBTC.“Winning the auction was surreal,” Nuro explained. “Putting my art 'Spike #1' on the epic sat is a dream come true.”Spike #1 is the first 3D neurogenerative piece of art inscribed on Bitcoin’s Ordinals protocol, according to Book of Blob, which was also founded by Nuro.


The aim behind Nuro’s Nurorealm, a neurogenerative brain collection on the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, is to “free the mind” and create a community where anyone can create art and technology to live their truth. “[It] utilizes my on chain brain data to generate art and preserve human consciousness on bitcoin forever,” Nuro said.The epic sat-inscribed 3D art piece came with music and the AI-generated voice of Canadian electronic pop artist Claire Boucher, widely known as “Grimes.”Book of Blob said it took over 12 months and more than 50 libraries to create the original art.


Bitcoin artists “Eloc,” “EPIC CHEF STEAKTOSHI” and “Bop” assisted Nuro with the artwork. “Every artist and OG ordinals member dreams of owning and inscribing their work on the epic sat,” Nuro said in reflection of the accomplishment.More on the auctionBook of Blob’s Asia lead “XBT” placed a 33.3 Bitcoin (BTC) bid, worth $2.13 million at the time, in the final minutes of the auction — held by ViaBTC’s partner cryptocurrency exchange CoinEx Global — comprehensively beating the previous highest bid at 20 BTC.Nuro said XBT’s “clear bidding strategy” was to make a high bid at the last moment to successfully claim the fourth epic sat.Related: Bitcoin whale wallets move $61M in BTC after a decade of dormancyFunding mostly came from the Blob team and its community.One sat is currently worth $0.00065 — but special sats like the one claimed by Book of Blobs hold inherent “collectible value” in the Bitcoin ecosystem, CoinEx Global explained.In an earlier interview, ViaBTC said the auction was an event of “exceptional significance” for the Bitcoin ecosystem, which continues to expand its initial use as a peer-to-peer cash transfer system.“Allocating these sats, imbued with special commemorative meaning, to communities in greater need is a more effective way to foster Bitcoin's development.”Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?

El Salvador Is Making It Easy For Everyone To Know How Much Bitcoin The Country Holds, Launches New Platform Aimed At Fostering Transparency - Benzinga

El Salvador, the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin BTC/USD as legal cash, launched its own platform to make information on its treasury holdings accessible and transparent to the general public.What Happened: According to the National Bitcoin Office, an agency tasked by the El Salvador government to oversee all things related to the cryptocurrency, informed via an X post about the launch of a mempool-like space, where details like treasury holdings and Bitcoin transactions in can be tracked 24×7.For the curious, a mempool already exists for the broader Bitcoin blockchain, where details around blocks, pending transactions, and transaction fees are updated real-time. At the time of writing, El Salvador had 5,748.76 Bitcoins in its custody, worth more than $300 million. Seven Bitcoins were added to the treasury over the last week, and 31 over the month.Why It Matters:  The latest move by El Salvador sets a new standard for financial transparency in government operations. It also validated the much-hyped concept of an immutable public ledger, which has been vigorously supported by Bitcoin and cryptocurrency proponents over the years. El Salvador has doubled down on Bitcoin ever since adopting the world's largest digital currency as a legal tender in 2021. The country has adopted a plan to buy one Bitcoin every day, until it becomes affordable with fiat currencies.The country’s seriousness with regards to its Bitcoin investments was further exemplified when it transferred more than 5,000 Bitcoin to a cold wallet, considered a safer storage option in the space. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading just below $61,000, trading flat in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin To $1.3M By 2028?

It’s ‘clear’ the US government is going after Tether: Ripple CEO

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says it is “clear” that the United States government is “going after” stablecoin issuer Tether — which could have an unpredictable impact on the crypto markets.Garlinghouse said on a May 10 episode of the World Class podcast there would “100%” be another crypto-related black swan event such as the collapse and subsequent uncovering of fraud perpetrated by FTX’s executives.“The U.S. government is going after Tether, that is clear to me,” he said without elaborating and stopping short of calling any possible U.S. action against Tether the next black swan. He instead called it an “interesting one to watch.”“I view Tether as a very important part of the ecosystem,” the Ripple boss said. He added he doesn’t know how to predict what impact potential U.S. regulatory action against Tether would have on the crypto ecosystem. Garlinghouse's comments come as Ripple is planning to launch its own stablecoin this year. Brad Garlinghouse speaking on the World Class podcast. Source: YouTubeTether Holdings Limited is the parent company for a web of similarly-named subsidiaries incorporated all over the world responsible for various operations in the issuance and management of the stablecoin Tether (USDT) — the world’s largest by market capitalization.In October last year, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative French Hill urged the Department of Justice in a letter to “carefully evaluate the extent to which Binance and Tether are providing material support and resources to support terrorism.”Tether responded to the letter saying it had “always assisted law enforcement” when asked and was “fully committed” to continuing work with authorities globally.Bloomberg reported in November 2022 that Manhattan-based U.S. Attorney Damian Williams took over an earlier Justice Department probe into Tether’s alleged concealment of crypto-linked funds from banks it used to move cash.Related: Tether slams Deutsche Bank over suggestion its stablecoin could failThe company has also been criticized for its lack of transparency regarding its backing reserves and in recent years has published quarterly third-party audits on its USDT-backing treasury. In October 2021 it paid a $41 million fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after the regulator said Tether “misrepresented to customers” its reserve holdings and found it held sufficient fiat reserves to back USDT for “only 27.6% of the days” between June 1, 2016 to Feb. 25, 2019.Ripple has plans to launch a U.S. dollar stablecoin later this year, with Ripple chief technology officer David Schwartz telling Cointelegraph last month that it would back its token with dollar deposits, short-term government Treasurys and “other cash equivalents.” Magazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom

Top Analyst Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says BTC at Risk of Flashing ‘Ginormous’ Sign of Weakness - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto trader who nailed the 2022 Bitcoin bottom thinks that BTC is at risk of witnessing an over 15% correction.
In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 59,300 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is in danger of losing its range low and support at $61,000 again after reclaiming it earlier this month.










DonAlt warns that a daily close below $61,000 is a huge sign of weakness that will likely trigger a sell-off event that sends BTC close to $50,000.
“This is just the bearish scenario. This was just kind of the complacency bounce off of the range and we start losing it again…
The worst case would be reclaiming the range and then actually losing it again because that’s a ginormous sign of weakness, and then I think we would be heading toward $52,000 and lower… And the reason for that is basically because this range is watched by many. When you get a reclaim like we’ve had and it fails, that just f**ks over a lot of people because you get a bunch of people basically freshly positioning at the level now that it’s broken and reclaimed. 
If it starts failing, it’s pretty very, very obvious to see that there’s actually just a major weakness in the market, and I think that would lead to a bigger washout… You really don’t want to lose this range.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,273, a marginal decrease on the day.

Panshi Underground Bank Busted: Over 2 Billion Yuan in Transactions


							

Panshi police bust underground bank using virtual currency.



Over 2.1 billion yuan in illegal transactions identified.



Six suspects arrested for facilitating illegal currency exchange.




Police in Panshi City of the Jilin Province have successfully cracked down on a large-scale underground bank operation involving virtual currency, with the total transaction amount exceeding 2.14 billion yuan (approximately $317 million USD).



The operation, which involved six suspects, facilitated illegal currency exchange between the Chinese yuan (RMB) and the South Korean won (KRW) by exploiting the anonymity and decentralized nature of virtual currencies.



According to authorities, the investigation began after the Panshi City Public Security Bureau’s Economic Investigation Brigade discovered suspicious activity linked to two individuals, Jin Moudong and Shen Mou. The investigation revealed a high volume of daily transactions, numerous customers, and patterns consistent with underground banking.



Following a comprehensive investigation, police apprehended Jin Moudong, Shen Mou, and other suspects. Authorities also seized a significant number of bank cards and related criminal tools.









The investigation uncovered that the group conducted illegal foreign exchange transactions through various methods, including using domestic accounts for fund transfers, over-the-counter (OTC) virtual currency trading, and Korean won settlements. These activities catered to clients such as Korean purchasing agents, cross-border e-commerce businesses, and import/export companies seeking to exchange RMB and KRW.



The remaining suspects, Chen Mouguang, Luo Moutao, He Mouda, and Zheng Mouyu, were apprehended through further investigation and evidence collection. This case highlights the growing challenge of illegal financial activities facilitated by virtual currencies. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies in China in combating such operations.

                        Lawmakers in Turkey are reportedly set to submit a draft law on crypto regulation to the parliament this week.Local outlet Daily Sabah reported Sunday that the Ruling Development and Justice Party’s (AK Party) chairperson hosted a meeting to conclude preparations for the draft law.The proposed regulations aim to reduce risks for people dealing with cryptocurrency. These also aim to bring crypto trading platforms under the Capital Markets Board’s (SPK) control. The SPK would then license and supervise these platforms.Other areas of regulation include how platforms store customer’s cash and crypto penalties that apply for breaking the rules. Specific rules for how these platforms operate will be decided later. This will be done through additional regulations that will be created separately.Turkey’s Crypto Regulations Target Security, Licensing, and Global Recognition
Earlier this year, Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said the country’s crypto regulations were in its final stages. He added that they aim to reduce crypto trading risks and establish licensing and operating standards for trading platforms.An additional benefit is that they could help Turkey improve its standing with the Financial Action Task Force’s standards.Nigeria and Turkey Lead Global Crypto Adoption Race
A recent Statista study revealed that Nigeria and Turkey led in terms of crypto adoption and the proportion of crypto owners among 56 countries as of Feb. 2024. In both countries, 47% of internet users reported owning or using cryptocurrency.Interestingly, it also found North America and European countries surveyed lagged significantly behind in crypto adoption rates.Nigerians and Turks turn to crypto for reasons including economic hardships like high inflation, weak currencies, and limited access to banks. They also consider crypto to be a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation and that it can provide greater financial accessibility and inclusion through the global crypto market.

                        The Public Security Bureau of Panshi City in Jilin Province has cracked down on an illegal operation involving underground banks and virtual currencies.The case, which involved approximately 2.14 billion yuan (around $300 million), led to the arrest of six individuals suspected of engaging in criminal activities related to money laundering between China and South Korea, according to a report from ChinaNews.com.The suspects exploited the anonymous and decentralized nature of virtual currencies to conduct unlawful exchange operations between the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and the South Korean Won.The Scheme Facilitated Money Laundering Activities
The illicit scheme allowed them to facilitate large-scale money laundering activities across borders.Authorities became aware of the operation through the Economic Investigation Brigade of the Panshi City Public Security Bureau.During their investigation, they uncovered crucial leads that pointed to the involvement of Jin Moudong, a resident of Jilin, and his accomplice, Shen Mou, in conducting currency exchange businesses in both China and South Korea.It was revealed that they lured unsuspecting individuals into fraudulent transactions before fleeing back to China.After gathering substantial evidence, the police discovered that the bank accounts linked to Jin Moudong and Shen Mou exhibited significant transaction volumes.The accounts had frequent inflows and outflows of funds, a diverse customer base, and transaction patterns consistent with illegal underground banking activities.Utilizing this information, the police formed a task force to further investigate the financial activities, social connections, and organizational structure of the criminal gang.After some analysis, they were able to apprehend Jin Moudong, Shen Mou, and their associates.The law enforcement operation resulted in the seizure of a considerable number of bank cards and tools used in the commission of the crimes.The investigation revealed that the criminal network in question engaged in various illegal activities, such as using domestic accounts to receive and transfer funds, conducting over-the-counter (OTC) trades of virtual currencies, and settling transactions in Korean Won.Their operation catered to Korean purchasing agents, cross-border e-commerce platforms, and import-export trading companies, providing them with the means to exchange RMB for Korean Won and vice versa.Six Arrested in Connection with Austrian Crypto Fraud
A joint operation involving national authorities from Austria, Cyprus, and the Czech Republic led to the arrest of six individuals connected to an online scam related to the sale of rights or tokens for a supposed new cryptocurrency.Supported by Eurojust and Europol, the coordinated action resulted in the seizure and freezing of assets totaling €2 million.In another incident, Instagram influencer Jebara Igbara, known as “Jay Mazini,” has been sentenced to seven years in prison for orchestrating a multi-million dollar crypto Ponzi scheme.More recently, Queensland Police took action against an alleged crypto investment fraud operating on the Gold Coast, resulting in the arrest and charging of four individuals. The investigation, led by the Financial and Cyber Crime Group Money Laundering Unit, began in July 2022.

US Government is Going After USDT: Ripple CEO


							

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that the US government is coming after Tether.



The executive said that he can’t predict the impact that the crackdown will have.



Ripple is seeking to debut its own stablecoin backed by the US dollar.




The chief executive of American blockchain payments firm Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, stated recently that the United States government, under the leadership of President Joe Biden, is going after Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, USDT.



In a post on social media platform X, Garlinghouse noted that he believes USDT and Tether to be an important part of the crypto ecosystem and doesn’t “know how to predict” the impact that the US government’s crackdown on the stablecoin “would have on the rest of the ecosystem.”



In an interview, Garlinghouse talked about multiple events that are currently going on in the digital asset sector, including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s arrest and the existing threat to Bitcoin from a technological standpoint. 









It is important to note that the American government found information about the usage of USDT by terrorist organizations and by users in the countries sanctioned by the United States. As a result, in April, Adewale Adeyemo, the US Treasury Deputy Secretary, testified before the Senate Banking Committee while pointing out Russia’s usage of USDT and alternative payment methods to bypass US sanctions.As per earlier reports, Ripple recently disclosed its intention to debut a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar on the XRP Ledger. While the current stablecoin market value stands at $150 billion, the American fintech firm predicted that the value would surge to $2.8 trillion by 2028.

US Court Freezes 279 North Korea-Linked Crypto Accounts


Justice Timothy Kelly of the US District Court for the District of Columbia has ordered the seizure of 279 crypto accounts linked to North Korean operatives. 
This action intensifies the battle against international money laundering and nuclear proliferation. 
North Korean Crypto Hackers Use New Malware
The decision follows a series of US actions to disrupt the financial networks facilitating North Korea’s illicit activities. Initiated by the US government in August 2020, this case involved actors linked to North Korea transferring stolen crypto to exchanges and unhosted wallets outside the US. 
These sophisticated operations obscure the origins of stolen currencies and convert them into hard cash, helping North Korea skirt sanctions.

In response, Washington has toughened its stance by sanctioning crypto mixers, services that make tracing the origins of stolen funds difficult. However, North Korean cybercrime groups have skillfully evaded US and international sanctions by devising new laundering methods.
These activities are part of a broader pattern of cyber heists targeting cryptocurrency exchanges. For instance, a single heist alone netted almost $250 million after an unwitting employee downloaded malware. This malware gave attackers remote access to manage virtual funds privately.

Moreover, in a recent report, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky described Durian as a tool for remote control and data theft. The malware cleverly utilizes legitimate security software used by crypto firms, thus enhancing its effectiveness and stealth.

“With the help of Durian, first, the North Korean hackers introduced additional malware named “AppleSeed”, an HTTP-based backdoor commonly employed by the Kimsuky group. Furthermore, they incorporated legitimate tools, including ngrok and Chrome Remote Desktop, along with a custom proxy tool, to access target machines. Ultimately, the actor implanted the malware to pilfer browser-stored data, including cookies and login credentials,” Kaspersky explained.

Additionally, the United Nations has reported that between 2017 and 2023, North Korea amassed about $3 billion from crypto hacks. These funds significantly support Pyongyang’s weapons programs, including its nuclear and missile development efforts.

 According to a UN panel of experts, this funding is critical as it represents nearly half of North Korea’s foreign currency revenue.

LBank Crypto Exchange to Add Ethereum Blockchain’s New Store of Value Token

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
Mollars (MOLLARS) is making waves ahead of its highly anticipated Initial Coin Offering (ICO) set for June 1st. 
Positioned as a Store of Value (SOV), the soon-to-release Bitcoin alternative has captured significant attention for its groundbreaking and scarcity-focused approach, distinguishing itself from other cryptocurrencies. That approach has garnered approval of another crypto exchange, LBank, who’s announced they will list $MOLLARS come June 1st.
Designed with meticulous attention to detail, Mollars token is engineered to be deflationary over time.   This is much in part to its limited token supply of just 10 million tokens and equal opportunity trading policy. This strategic model has already yielded success during the project’s presale phase, raising over $1.3 million, and continuing to grow daily.
Token wise, crypto investors have already acquired rights to over 2.1-million tokens.  A total of over 70% of the supply allocated for the discounted presale, the last 30% could sell out any day now.
According to tokenomics, the founder nor developers will be given ‘free tokens,’ unlike what Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) did in secrecy.  Instead, a small percentage of ICO funds will be used  to pay the professionals involved with development of the project for their services and  ‘knowing’ they’ve created one of the greatest cryptos to date on Ethereum blockchain.
The ‘no coins free’ clause gives investors the confidence of knowing there can be no post-listing rug pulls nor manipulation.   It prevents market influence from greedy founders, who don’t deserve the power of liquidating billions of dollars in money they never earned.
Another attractive & influential factor of the token to investors, when compared to lead rival Bitcoin, is Mollars transaction fees.   It is a digital store of value asset, like $BTC, but based on a much more modernized blockchain that is likely to cost up to -80% for trading actions [buy,sell,etc].

Bitcoin’s blockchain, as of 2023, was the most expensive of all in the cryptosphere.   Now, 250-million users will have the option of storing value without crossing-chains.  And also, others who want to trade cross-chain can still cross to Ethereum-blockchain for a lesser cost.
LBank’s 7-Million Users Could Push Mollars Into A Parabolic Uptrend
The recent news of Mollars securing a listing on LBank, a well established cryptocurrency exchange, has generated new excitement within the digital currency community as well.  The nearly decade old crypto exchange has over 7-million users it’s going to introduce to Mollars finite token supply.  
If the audience begins to buy quickly, the price of Mollars could be driven upwards in a parabolic growth as only 10-million tokens are to be minted ever. 
Extreme scarcity and large audiences creating new demand is a recipe for massive ROI yields.
This listing not only exposes Mollars to a diverse global investor base but also signals potential demand surges for MOLLARS tokens, boosting liquidity and market engagement.



LBank’s sterling reputation as a secure and reliable platform further bolsters Mollars credibility in association. Both seasoned traders and newcomers, once skeptical, are forced to accept the legitimacy of this new Bitcoin alternative. 
Come June 1st, LBank exchange’s robust infrastructure and user-friendly interface are going to open a seamless trading experience to token presale buyers. However, HODLing will be the smart thing to do until all exchanges have listed the token as its highly plausible Mollars will reach over 250-million traders over time.

Cryptocurrency experts are optimistic about Mollars trajectory, with price projections hinting at a potential hyperparabolic surge in 2024. This optimistic outlook stems from the ERC-20 token’s scarcity-driven model, deflationary strategies, and its strategic positioning as a challenger to Bitcoin’s dominance in the Store of Value sector.

As the countdown to the ICO launch progresses, investors are eyeing an initial 12% return on investment, but more importantly is the long-term forecasts. An anticipated launch price of $0.62 per token is an easy ‘grab’ but that can be surpassed.

Closing Thoughts
Mollars current Initial coin offering event, which is to be followed by a listing on LBank, signifies a significant milestone in its journey to redefine the cryptocurrency landscape. 
With a robust strategic framework, scarcity-driven design, and promising price projections, Mollars presents a compelling opportunity for anyone. As the crypto market evolves, the ‘new Bitcoin killer’ stands poised to make a lasting impact, attracting interest and investment from a wide range of stakeholders.

Tokyo-Listed Metaplanet Adopts Bitcoin (BTC) as Strategic Reserve Asset as Japan Grapples With Debt Burden

XRP To Hit Zero Vs. BTC? Veteran Cites 'Pure Classical Charting'


																In a recent analysis shared via X, Peter Brandt, regarded as one of the leading experts globally in applying classical charting techniques to trading futures, foreign exchange, and crypto markets, suggested that the XRP to Bitcoin (XRP/BTC) exchange rate could potentially hit zero. Brandt’s analysis applies traditional techniques inspired by pioneers such as Schabacker, Edwards, and Magee to forecast this drastic trend.
Brandt stated, “From a pure classical charting point of view (that is, Schabacker, Edwards, Magee) this chart looks like it is headed toward Zero. XRPBTC”
XRPBTC analysis, 1-week chart | Source: @PeterLBrandt
Why Brandt Thinks XRP Is Going To Zero Vs. BTC
The chart indicates a troubling trajectory for XRP when priced in Bitcoin, with key support levels being consistently tested over time. The weekly chart showcases a series of peaks and troughs with notable highs in 2017 and a sharp decline from 2018 onwards.

	Related Reading



Recently, the XRP/BTC ratio has been hovering around a crucial support line, illustrated by a dashed horizontal line on the chart. Notably, the chart shows XRP/BTC experiencing significant volatility over the years. After reaching highs in 2017 at 0.00025 BTC, it has been on a general downtrend, especially notable after September 2018. “XRPPBTC has lost 70% of its value since the Nov 2017 post,” Brandt commented.
A critical historical support level for the digital asset is highlighted by Brandt at around 0.000007 BTC (black line), which the market is currently testing. The continuation of the bearish trend might break this support.
Moreover, two moving averages are depicted on the chart. The 8-week SMA (Simple Moving Average) is currently at 0.00000838 BTC, while the 18-week SMA stands at 0.00000990 BTC, indicating bearish momentum as the price is below both averages.

	Related Reading



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the chart, with a 14-week period, is at 28.80, which is near the oversold territory. This might usually suggest a potential for price recovery, yet the persistent bearish sentiment depicted suggests caution.
Peter Brandt’s assertion that the XRP/BTC ratio could be “headed toward Zero” comes from observing the continued failure of the price to rebound from key support levels and the downtrend remaining intact without signs of reversal. His commentary reflects a stark outlook for XRP when compared against Bitcoin, emphasizing the importance of these technical levels in predicting future movements.
In a follow-up post on X, Brandt doubled down on this claim, stating, “It is actually fun poking a stick at XRP_aholics. My comparison is to BTC, not USD, so here is what I don’t understand. How can XRP bulls be so insistent in that XRP is near ATLs vs BTC, and, in fact, has only closed higher than present levels in 6 of the last 126 months?”
At press time, XRP traded at $0.49845.

SHIB or FLOKI: Which memecoin should you bet on today? - AMBCrypto



Shiba Inu and FLOKI both saw accumulation amidst negative social media sentiment
The selling pressure behind Shiba Inu was not intense in the past six weeks

Shiba Inu [SHIB] and Floki [FLOKI] were unable to keep pace with the gains of Pepe [PEPE].
The PEPE token had a strongly bullish technical bias and was trending on CoinMarketCap with a daily trading volume of $611 million at press time.
AMBCrypto analyzed the on-chain metrics of both SHIB and FLOKI to understand if they might set out on a bullish trajectory soon.
As things stand, it did not appear very hopeful for either meme coin unless Bitcoin [BTC] can turn on an uptrend.
Both memes saw an accumulation phase

The price trend of both FLOKI and SHIB has been bearish since mid-March, but this was only apparent in early April.
Support levels established during the retracement were not defended. This saw the MVRV ratio drop deep into negative territory toward mid-April.
At press time, SHIB’s MVRV ratio was still negative, while FLOKI was at +0.54%. This meant that holders of the latter token were slightly at a profit.
On top of that, the mean coin age of FLOKI has trended upward in the past two weeks. For SHIB, it has strongly trended higher since mid-March, a much stronger sign of accumulation.
Both tokens present a buying opportunity given the near-zero or negative MVRV values and the rising mean coin ages. What do the social metrics reveal about market perception?
Social media engagement remained bearish

The Weighted Sentiment of both tokens on a 3-day interval was negative, showing social media engagement was more bearish. However, FLOKI has been consistently and heavily negative since late March.
On the other hand, SHIB has been slightly positive in the latter half of April.
The dormant circulation could help settle some doubts. Investors bullish on FLOKI would not be encouraged to see the numerous spikes of this metric in the past six weeks.
It indicated sizeable amounts of the token moving on-chain, likely for selling.

Realistic or not, here’s SHIB’s market cap in BTC’s terms

Conversely, the dormant circulation of SHIB has been relatively quiet since mid-March. The last significant spike was on 19th April when holders used a 6% bounce to realize some profits.
Overall, the on-chain metrics of SHIB and FLOKI were similar. But the mean coin age, dormant circulation, and Weighted Sentiment showed Shiba Inu could be better poised for recovery than FLOKI.

‘$XRP Will Reach Approx $250 This Cycle,’ Claims Popular Crypto Analyst | Cryptoglobe


                                
Cryptocurrency analyst and digital content creator Block Bull has recently forecasted a massive increase in XRP’s value, potentially reaching $250 by the year 2025. This prediction is supported by an analysis of historical market trends, especially those related to Bitcoin halving events—critical periods in cryptocurrency markets when the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions is halved, thereby reducing the supply of new Bitcoins and historically triggering price increases across the market.



Block Bull’s analysis includes a detailed study of XRP’s price movements from its 2017 surge to its peak in 2021, emphasizing the role of Bitcoin’s halving events. Block Bull says each market cycle, approximately 77 weeks from a breakout point to its peak, has been identified as a significant period of price increase for XRP. Furthermore, the popular analyst believes the cycles show a predictable pattern where XRP’s value spikes following the reduced supply of Bitcoin and subsequent market dynamics.



One pivotal component of Block Bull’s methodology is the “green trendline,” a tool used in technical analysis to track the consistent upward trajectory of an asset. This trendline represents a running average of closing prices over time, adjusted to emphasize more recent price data, and indicates a strong bullish (upward) trend for XRP that is projected to continue past 2023.



XRP currently is the 7th most valuable cryptoasset with a market cap of around $27.2 billion. Despite a recent dip, according to the analyst, the overarching analysis suggests substantial future growth. This growth, they believe, is underpinned by indicators like the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The EMA helps highlight price trends by giving more weight to recent prices, making it a valuable indicator in the fast-moving crypto markets. Meanwhile, the RSI measures the magnitude and persistence of price movements; values typically above 70 indicate a potentially overbought market, whereas values below 30 suggest an oversold market.



Another vital metric in Block Bull’s analysis is the realized market capitalization of XRP, which stands at approximately $55.2 billion.



Source: X



In the context of cryptocurrencies, realized market capitalization is a metric that aims to provide a more accurate representation of a cryptocurrency’s market value by taking into account the price at which each unit last moved, instead of simply multiplying the current market price by the total supply.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Here’s how it works:



Realized market capitalization is calculated by summing the value of each coin or token at the price it was last transacted on the blockchain. This approach differs from the standard market capitalization, which calculates the total value based on the current price of a cryptocurrency multiplied by its circulating supply.



This metric is particularly useful because it:



Filters out lost or inactive coins: By only accounting for coins that have recently moved, it excludes lost, forgotten, or hoarded coins that may not be contributing to the current market dynamics.Provides insights into the actual economic activity: It offers a view of the market that reflects the prices at which actual trades were made, giving a potentially more realistic view of the market’s valuation.



Realized market cap can often be significantly different from traditional market cap, especially for cryptocurrencies that have been around for a long time and have experienced significant price changes. It helps investors gauge the actual invested capital as opposed to speculative market value.



Despite XRP’s promising long-term outlook, its market dominance has declined, suggesting its share of the total cryptocurrency market is decreasing. This could reflect shifting investor interests or competitive dynamics within the crypto space.



At the time of writing (7:30 a.m. UTC on May 13), XRP is trading at around $0.4984, down 1% in the past 24-hour period (and down 19.62% in the year-to-date period).

The $12 million crypto airdrop in NEXO tokens

The NEXO token is a cryptocurrency that has been on the market for more than six years. 
A few days ago, the crypto lending platform of the same name announced a $12 million airdrop. 


The NEXO token and the $12 million crypto airdrop
NEXO is a token launched on the Ethereum blockchain, and also present on other blockchains such as BNB (BSC).
It is issued by the homonymous crypto lending platform, and landed on the markets in May 2018 during a bear market. 
Indeed, in the first months after its launch, its market value plummeted from $0.18 to $0.04, and remained below the initial price until November 2020, except for a couple of exceptional occasions.
During the great bull run of 2021, however, it saw a significant surge, so much so that it reached all-time highs in November of that year above $4.6. 
At that point the profit from the initial price had risen to +2,400%. 
Then there was the bear market of 2022, during which there were concerns about the stability of Nexo. The price of their token dropped to just over $0.5, a value significantly lower even than the one at launch during the previous bear market. 
Moreover, the bottom of the last bear market for NEXO occurred in October 2023, just a few months ago. 
At this point, it’s not surprising that during the late 2023 bull run it didn’t manage to exceed the $1 mark, and that when it did so in early 2024, it still couldn’t bring itself back above $1.6.
The current price of about 1.2$ is significantly higher than the launch price six years ago, but much lower than the peak of 2021.
Actually, it is perfectly in line with the price of June 2022 following the implosion of Terra/Luna, just before the failure of Celsius and BlockFi also cast shadows on Nexo.
The airdrop to users
At a price of $1.2 per token, the Nexo airdrop announced a few days ago has a market value of about 12 million dollars, because the prize pool consists of exactly 10 million NEXO tokens.
However, this is a special airdrop, because the distribution is not random. 
To participate, you must accumulate points and then use these points to request your share of the prize. 
It is still the largest prize ever allocated by Nexo. 
Points can be collected until July 7, 2024, using eligible Nexo products, namely Account Funding, Nexo Card, Borrow, Earn, Exchange, and Future Trading. 
Staking of Ethereum and the Referral Program do not entitle you to earn points, and only loans taken during the campaign period are valid.
Furthermore, some actions, such as withdrawals, can reduce the balance of accumulated points. 
There are also multipliers that allow you to collect more points. 
Once the points have been collected, you can request your share of the NEXO token prize starting from July 10, 2024.
There is no limit to the points that can be collected, but there is an overall limit to the rewards: 10 million NEXO tokens. So each participant will receive a percentage of these 10 million tokens comparable to the points they have collected compared to the total points distributed. 
Indeed, the prize will be distributed based on the total amount of points collected by users, and the “token per point” ratio will be calculated at the end of the campaign.
The Nexo portal
The Nexo platform was launched in 2018, the same year in which the NEXO token landed on the crypto markets. 
The co-founder and CEO is Antoni Trenchev, born in Germany but of Bulgarian origin, and the company’s headquarters is in Sofia, Bulgaria.
They claim to have over 7 million customers in 200 jurisdictions, with over sixty cryptocurrencies supported.
Initially the platform was mainly specialized in crypto loans, but over the years it has added many other features that have made it what it is now. 
It is worth noting that the NEXO token has a market capitalization of less than 690 million dollars, which is less than ApeCoin or PancakeSwap’s CAKE, and much less than DeFi projects tokens like dXdY or Aave.
The company is not listed on the stock exchange, so it is not possible to calculate its current market value. However, it is a regulated company, and now that crypto markets are effectively regulated in the European Union, this appears to be quite relevant (Bulgaria has been a member of the EU since 2007).

Balena di Bitcoin: due wallet hanno mosso oltre 1.000 BTC

Yesterday, May 12th, two wallets belonging to a dormant Bitcoin whale since 2013 executed transactions for a total of over 1,000 BTC. Behind these transactions worth 61 million dollars, it is believed that the same entity is involved. 

Bitcoin Whale: the transaction of over 1,000 BTC from inactive wallets since 2013
On May 12th, while BTC was trading above $61,000, two inactive Bitcoin wallets from 2013 executed transactions, totaling over 1,000 BTC. 
And indeed, after 10 years and 8 months of inactivity, it seems that a bitcoin whale has awakened, as it is believed that the same individual is behind these wallets. 
According to what is reported, at block height 843,131, the wallet identified as “16vRq” transferred 500 BTC. Specifically, the BTC moved from an original Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH) address to a modern Pay to Witness Public Key Hash (P2WPKH) wallet.
This 16vRq wallet was created on September 12, 2013 and the transaction on May 12, 2024 achieved a moderate privacy score of about 55. 
About two blocks later, at block height 843,133, a second transaction was executed from another P2PKH wallet known as “1DUJu”, also created on September 12, 2013. This wallet sent 500 BTC, approximately worth 30 million dollars, to another P2WPKH address. 
This transaction mirrors the first one, with 499.99 BTC still in the wallet and a similar privacy score of 60.
Bitcoin Whale: transactions from inactive wallets and the reaction of BTC price
In addition to these two transactions, another wallet of a Bitcoin whale has also been detected, created in May 2013 and inactive since then, which has moved another 108 BTC at block height 843,017. 
Since this transfer also originated from a legacy P2PKH wallet and ended up in a P2WPKH wallet, it is believed that the same entity is behind it, but of course this is not guaranteed. 
Anyway, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin whale wallets have moved some significant amounts such as the equivalent of over 61 million dollars. 
But how did the price of BTC react? Looking at the price chart, BTC continues to fluctuate around the $61,000 mark, without showing major changes. 
At the time of writing, BTC is worth $61,390, and its market cap exceeds $1.2 trillion. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume of BTC appears to have increased by 37%. 
The wallet of the Satoshi Nakamoto era
Even in this month of May 2024, it seems that another wallet with BTC movements has been reported, created in the era of Satoshi Nakamoto.
Basically, the pseudonym behind the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared into thin air in 2011. 
This awakened wallet would have sent BTC to two different addresses and then received two more incoming transactions. While the received BTC were of insignificant amounts, the sending was instead of 687 BTC, equal to almost 42.7 million dollars. 
In reality, Satoshi Nakamoto’s BTC wallet was not exactly dormant. In fact, there have been recorded incoming transactions for small amounts of BTC in 2020 and 2021, as well as in 2018, 2016, 2015, and 2014.

Robert Kiyosaki, renowned author of the book on financial management “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” investor and entrepreneur, has taken to his account on the X app (formerly Twitter) to endorse Bitcoin in light of signs of new global developments coming.He says Bitcoin is the best option now, along with several other assets, to protect oneself from the approaching U.S. dollar crash.Buy Bitcoin to protect yourself from this, Kiyosaki saysIn the tweet, Kiyosaki talked about the country he is interested in at the moment – South Africa. He has been looking out for rumors about BRICS planning to launch its own cryptocurrency, which will possibly be backed by gold, plenty of which can be mined in the BRICS regions. BRICS consists of multiple members, starting from its earliest members – Brazil (B), Russia (R), India (I), China (C) and South Africa (S). In January 2024, this list was expanded as the UAE, Egypt, Iran and Ethiopia were also accepted.Robert Kiyosaki tweeted that should the BRICS gold-backed crypto indeed launch, a massive amount of U.S. dollars will start flowing back into the U.S. The “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author calls the U.S. dollar “fake money” in his X message. He believes that this tremendous USD inflow will cause hyperinflation in America and will ultimately destroy the U.S. dollar completely.The financial expert reckons that the only way to protect oneself from the expected U.S. dollar crash is to start buying Bitcoin, gold and silver.Bitcoin is Kiyosaki's tool against "fake money"Kiyosaki has been an advocate of all three (Bitcoin, gold, silver) over the past four years, praising these two popular precious metals and Bitcoin since the pandemic started and world economies suffered from multiple lockdowns.Back then, the U.S. government began stimulating the economy by giving away so-called “survival checks” and buying out large banks and businesses. These aims were achieved through printing additional U.S. dollars and injecting them into circulation. In 2020 alone, more than $6 trillion worth of greenbacks were printed. Since then, Kiyosaki has been slamming the U.S. dollar as “fake money.”Since then, the government has been frequently taking to this quantitative easing policy and printing billions of U.S. dollars. The EU and other countries followed suit.

Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today?


The total market cap (TOTAL) is attempting to secure the $2.3 trillion mark as support. At the same time, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is also fighting the bearish cues to prevent a decline below $60,000. 
Amidst this bearishness is Bittensor (TAO), which has lost the most this past week, falling to a three-month low as a result.
In the news today:-

Bitcoin staking platform BounceBit is set to launch its mainnet today. Along with this, the token airdrop and trading on Binance will take place.
China’s CBDC, digital yuan, is observing selling at the hands of its users. The participants of the state-backed digital asset program are exhibiting concerns about holding the digital currency.

TOTAL Could See Some Upside
The total market cap is currently in a symmetrical triangle, testing the lower limit as support at $2.17 trillion. The upper limit has been attempted to be breached thrice, but it has failed. This shows that a breakout would require considerable bullishness from investors.
If this bullishness is not secured, a breakdown to $2.11 trillion will likely mark a two-week low. Losing this support would result in a sharp drop to $2 trillion, marking a two-month low.

On the other hand, if the bearishness fades and a breakout takes place, the likely uptick could push TOTAL to breach the $2.3 trillion multi-week resistance.
Bitcoin Price Is Still Safe
Bitcoin’s price is around $61,000, which has been a key support level for many days. Despite the slight decline noted in the past 24 hours, BTC still has a shot at recovery, provided the crypto asset breaks out of the downtrend and secures $63,700 as support.
This would result in a potential uptrend, which is key for investors to regain the losses they witnessed during the drawdown over the past two months.

However, losing this support would cause a drop to $59,119, invalidating all hopes of recovery and sending BTC to $58,000.
Bittensor Correction Continues
Over the last week, TAO price has noted a 22% decline, bringing the altcoin to $352. $350 acts as a crucial psychological support level, and a fall below it would send TAO to $304, extending the correction.

As is, the altcoin is at a three-month low, and the declining volume is supporting the bearish thesis.

However, if shifting cues from the broader market result in a recovery rally, TAO price could reclaim $377 as support. This would result in a rally beyond $400, enabling a recovery of the recent losses.

Remarkable Warning from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse: 'The US Government is After This Stablecoin!' - Bitcoin Sistemi

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has warned that the US government is targeting Tether, the largest issuer of the stablecoin by market cap. Garlinghouse made this statement while speaking with Chris Vasquez on a recent episode of his World Class Podcast.
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Claims the US Government Targeted Tether
According to Garlinghouse, potential US action against the stablecoin issuer could trigger significant disruption in the crypto space.


“The US Government is going after Tether. That's very clear to me. I see Tether as a very important part of the ecosystem, and I don't know how to predict the impact it will have on the rest of the ecosystem,” Garlinghouse said.
This claim comes after findings emerged that USDT was being used by terrorist organizations and sanctioned countries to evade US financial restrictions.





In April, US Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo testified before the Senate Banking Committee and emphasized that Russia was increasingly using alternative payment methods such as Tether's USDT to evade economic sanctions.

“We have seen Russia increasingly turn to alternative payment mechanisms, including the stablecoin tether, to evade our sanctions and continue funding its war machine,” Adeyemo wrote.


Simultaneously, a UN report shed light on the widespread use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering, with USDT on the TRON blockchain emerging as an important tool, especially in illegal online gambling platforms.
Despite these concerns, Tether emphasizes its commitment to compliance standards and cooperation with law enforcement to combat illegal financial activities.





The company has taken proactive measures, including freezing addresses holding a significant amount of its tokens involved in illegal activities.
Tether's USDT maintains its position as the leading stablecoin by market cap, with a circulating supply of approximately $110 billion. Notably, the company achieved a historic net profit of $4.52 billion in the first quarter.

                        The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission has issued a warning regarding deepfake scams infiltrating the cryptocurrency industry.The commission revealed that a group operating under the name Quantum AI or AI Quantum resorted to using deepfake videos of renowned entrepreneur Elon Musk to deceive unsuspecting individuals into believing that he was the mastermind behind the platform.It is essential to distinguish this group from NASA’s Quantum AI Lab (QuAIL), which focuses on quantum computing research and is unrelated to the fraudulent activities in question.Scammers Turn to Deepfakes to Promote Scams
Exploiting the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence technology, scammers have increasingly turned to deepfakes as a means to defraud victims of their hard-earned money.Deepfakes utilize AI algorithms to convincingly mimic the facial expressions and voice of a targeted individual, creating realistic video or audio clips.Scammers employ deepfakes to establish video calls with their victims, using software to alter their own appearance and simulate the identity of the person they are impersonating.One notorious group known as “The Yahoo Boys” from Nigeria has been employing deepfakes to carry out romance scams successfully.The Hong Kong-based group implicated in this case claimed to offer cryptocurrency trading services backed by advanced artificial intelligence.However, authorities suspect that the operation served as a facade for engaging in fraudulent activities related to virtual assets.The group utilized three websites and two Facebook pages to carry out their crypto scams, as stated in the warning issued by the authorities.To lend credibility to their scheme, the scammers employed deepfake videos featuring Elon Musk, falsely portraying him as the developer behind their technology.They even went as far as creating a counterfeit “news” website to disseminate fabricated information about their services, further deceiving potential victims.Taking swift action, Hong Kong police shut down all the group’s websites and social media pages.However, the full extent of the damage caused by the scam remains unknown.Elon Musk Deepfakes Used to Exploit Users
This isn’t the first instance of scammers exploiting deepfakes featuring Elon Musk to orchestrate fraudulent schemes. In a separate case in April, a South Korean woman fell victim to scammers who impersonated Musk on Instagram, resulting in a loss of $50,000.The woman even engaged in a video call with the deepfake version of Musk, during which the imposter went as far as expressing affection.“‘Musk even said ‘I love you, you know that?’ when we made a video call,” as explained by the victim on 60 Minutes.As reported, Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister of Singapore, has also warned his social media followers regarding the use of deepfake videos that use his voice and image to promote cryptocurrency scams.At the time, Loong even shared an example video of himself being interviewed, which was created by scammers to endorse a fraudulent “hands-free crypto trading” scheme.

CryptoPunks leads daily NFT sales with over US$1.39 million


CryptoPunks dominated the non-fungible token (NFT) market with a US$1.39 million daily sales volume on May 12, according to CryptoSlam data.



Most of those sales came from CryptoPunk 741, which sold for almost US$800,000 at the Larva Labs marketplace. The NFT’s last on-chain sale occurred seven years ago, for US$400.



CryptoPunk 741 is now the eighth-highest-valued CryptoPunk in the collection.



The second-ranking collection for the day was DMarket, which operates on Mythos Chain, a blockchain specialized for Web3 gaming applications. Dmarket had US$945,383 in daily sales, the third consecutive day above the US$900,000 mark.

	
	
	
	


Sunday’s sales total follows a monthly high of over US$970,000 on Friday.



DMarket’s all-time sales volume now stands at US$427.16 million.



NodeMonkes, the all-time leader among Bitcoin collections, claimed the third spot with sales of US$565,277, a decrease from the previous day’s US$1.21 million.



Outside the top three in the NFT market, Pudgy Penguins saw a daily sales volume of US$473,136, and $CORE BRC-20 NFTs, recorded US$450,912. 

	
	
	

	


Solana Monkey Business, on the Solana blockchain, reported sales of US$429,598 for the day’s sixth spot, followed by $LTC+ BRC-20 NFTs, Mad Lads, and $π BRC-20 NFTs.



Sunday’s sales pushed the Ethereum blockchain, home to the CryptoPunks collection, to the top of the blockchain rankings for NFT sales. 



The network reported a total sales volume of US$5.24 million on Sunday, a 25.6% increase from US$4.17 million the previous day.



The Bitcoin blockchain trailed behind with US$5.08 million in daily sales, as Solana posted US$2.67 million.

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) Will Rally Over 8,000% After Solana Launch, as it Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gensler Devil (GENDEV), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gensler Devil presents a similar opportunity.



Gensler Devil has a market cap below $14,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Gensler Devil could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Gensler Devil can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gensler Devil on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gensler Devil by entering its contract address – GwoY3GpqrSmws6QW88CyDaJkkTNfrQLGN2zZ1rSbJ6z9 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GENDEV.

Renowned XRP Whale Move 30M Tokens to Exchange


							

A prominent XRP whale transferred 30 million tokens to an exchange.



The digital asset lost crucial support at the $0.5 price level.



The RSI indicator shows that the selling pressure is quite high in the market.




A prominent XRP whale transferred a whopping 30 million tokens to an exchange as bearish winds engulfed the digital asset market in the past 24 hours and the cryptocurrency lost crucial support at $0.5. 



According to blockchain data, the whale moved the tokens to the exchange, possibly cashing out, which resulted in the token facing increased selling pressure and following a downward trajectory. 



The data from CoinMarketCap shows that the trading volume of the seventh largest digital asset surged by a whopping 52.33% in the past 24 hours, while the market capitalization of XRP stands at $27.2 billion. Further, as of 1:32  a.m. ET Monday, the price of the token stands at $0.4925, down 3%. 



Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan also took to social media platform X to highlight that XRP had lost the $0.5 price level and is currently trading at $0.4. 



Moreover, as per the chart provided by TradingView, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP/USDT on a daily time frame has turned bearish, reading 37.63. 







The bears are currently in control of the XRP price action, and the sellers dominate the market. Notably, if the situation persists, the token might go into the oversold region. In March, the price of the digital asset rose as high as $0.744 but went as low as $0.4188 in mid-April. Since then, investors are looking forward to XRP strengthening its price action above $0.5.

Bitcoin still struggling around $61k: Will it dip lower?



                    

                    Key takeaways

Bitcoin continues to struggle below $62k and could plunge lower in the short term.
Bitbot has raised $3.3m so far, with only two stages of the presale left.

Bitcoin stays below $62k
Bitcoin has been struggling in recent weeks and could record further losses if the market condition persists. At press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at $61,254, down by than % in the last seven days.
The poor performance comes as the US Federal Reserve recently dashed hopes of cutting interest rates in the short term. Risk-averse assets like Bitcoin continue to underperform with the interest rate still high. 
What is Bitbot? 
Bitcoin’s boring price performance hasn’t affected other activities in the broader crypto market. Presales and airdrops continue to attract the attention of Degens and other industry participants. 
Bitbot is one of the projects that is raising capital from investors to address certain pain points in the market. It is a Web3 project that seeks to bring unique value propositions to traders in the cryptocurrency space. It is a Telegram trading bot that puts the power in the hands of the user. 
According to their whitepaper, the team describes Bitbot as a self-custodial trading bot that enables users to trade via their cold wallets on Telegram. The solution provides traders with an innovative way of trading and is leveraging Telegram’s position as a leading social media platform for crypto users. 
Bitbot users will enjoy certain features available only to institutional investors, making it easier for traders to grow their trading portfolios.
Bitbot’s tech targets retail traders
Bitbot is rolling out tech solutions that could help retail traders excel in the cryptocurrency market. According to their whitepaper, Bitbot will leverage the Knightsafe to offer a self-custody solution. This solution helps in mitigating the typical risks associated with Telegram trading.
Furthermore, the integration of anti-MEV and anti-rug solutions will help users protect their assets. These solutions would ensure traders protect their data and assets from bots artificially pumping transaction costs and block scam projects.
With more than $3.3 million raised so far, some of the presale funds will be channeled towards integrating Ultra-flexible wallet management fuelled by non-custodial API technology. 
Finally, Bitbot will also enable the Cop Trading feature, allowing novice traders to copy the trades of the strongest-performing wallets based on on-chain activities.
Bitbot’s presale tops $3.3m
The Bitbot presale is currently in its tenth stage and is drawing closer to its end. So far, the project has raised $3,337,931 of the required $3,546,000 in this current stage. According to the team, there are only two presale stages left.
The $BITBOT token is going for $0.0180 in the current presale round and will increase to $0.0189 once the next round commences. 
The whitepaper indicated that the Bitbot development team will hold 20% of the total token supply and use it to fund ongoing development. An additional 14% is allocated to marketing & CEX listings while 3% is allocated to exchange liquidity provision.
Click here to read more about Bitbot’s upcoming presale. 
Should you buy the Bitbot token now? 
There are only two stages left in this presale, which means the opportunity to invest early in this project is slipping away. Bitbot’s presale continues to attract more investors despite the choppy market conditions.
Bitbot is looking to gain massive adoption in the market by offering unique technologies that would allow traders to improve their trading activities. Its native token could be a big winner in the coming months and years with the right level of adoption.

Jenny Johnson Discusses Blockchain’s Potential to Transform Finance | Cryptoglobe


                                
Jenny Johnson, president and CEO of Franklin Templeton, recently underscored the transformative potential of blockchain technology and generative artificial intelligence (AI) during an interview at the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference (held May 5-8, 2024 in Los Angeles, California). With $1.6 trillion in assets under management, Franklin Templeton is keenly exploring innovative technologies to enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs.



Franklin Resources, Inc. (NYSE: BEN), also known as Franklin Templeton, is a premier global investment management organization renowned for its mutual funds and investment services. Founded in New York in 1947 by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., the company was named in honor of American polymath Benjamin Franklin, reflecting its commitment to prudent and conservative investment practices.



Over the years, Franklin Templeton has evolved into one of the leading asset managers globally, providing a broad array of investment and advisory services to individuals, institutions, and financial professionals across multiple countries. The company offers diverse solutions spanning various asset classes, including equities, fixed income, alternatives, and multi-asset strategies.



According to a report by Cointelegraph, Johnson highlighted a recent experiment in which the firm processed account records using traditional methods alongside blockchain technology over a six—to eight-month period. The blockchain approach emerged as significantly more cost-effective, bolstering Johnson’s belief in the technology’s capacity to streamline financial processes.



Johnson predicts a major shift in how investment products are managed, suggesting that all ETFs and mutual funds could eventually operate on blockchain platforms:



“It’s a very efficient technology, and we think it’s going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities. And, honestly, eventually, I think ETF and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain.“







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

This transition, she notes, is largely driven by the need to reduce the substantial costs associated with data verification across disparate systems. Blockchain, with its inherent transparency and efficiency, could effectively address these challenges.



Johnson also delved into the potential of tokenization, citing the example of pop icon Rihanna, who released 300 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offering a small percentage of royalties from one of her songs through a smart contract. This move exemplifies the innovative ways blockchain can facilitate new investment opportunities and democratize access to financial markets.



In addition to blockchain, Johnson addressed the role of generative AI in finance. While recognizing its benefits, she cautioned about its limitations, humorously comparing it to a student excelling in English but failing in math. Despite these challenges, Franklin Templeton is actively incorporating AI technologies, including a collaboration with Microsoft to develop an AI-driven sales assistant.



Back in December 2023, at the Fortune Global Forum in Abu Dhabi, Johnson engaged in a discussion with Anna Tutova, CEO of Coinstelegram, regarding the company’s evolution and its ventures into the realms of blockchain and cryptocurrency.



During the conversation, Johnson elaborated on Franklin Templeton’s engagement with blockchain technology, specifically mentioning the company’s application for a Franklin Bitcoin ETF. She clarified the distinction between Bitcoin and blockchain, viewing the latter as a tool to democratize access to private markets and enhance transactional efficiencies. Johnson pointed out that blockchain technology has the potential to transform nontraditional asset classes and boost the efficiency of existing financial products. She highlighted Franklin Templeton’s initiatives, such as the development of a tokenized money-market fund and a blockchain-based shareholder recordkeeping system, which aim to mitigate fraud and reduce latency in financial transactions.



Johnson, an investor in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, SushiSwap, and Uniswap, considers these holdings a minor part of her portfolio. She also discussed Franklin Templeton’s readiness to introduce blockchain or crypto-related products, dependent on the decisions made by retirement plan fiduciaries. Johnson emphasized blockchain’s role in facilitating active, risk-adjusted investment decisions. She noted the success of the company’s U.S. tokenized money-market fund, which has garnered over $270 million in inflows, and expressed optimism about future opportunities as blockchain technology continues to evolve. While acknowledging the potential in specific NFT investments, she urged caution and drew parallels between some aspects of the NFT market and art valuation.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin (BTC) began the week on a downward trend, trading around $61,000 with an intraday low of $60,675. Despite a previous surge following the U.S. approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Bitcoin has not regained momentum.
The decline is largely due to hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve and speculation that the Fed may postpone its easing plans, driving investors toward safer assets amid economic uncertainty. This has strengthened the U.S. dollar, contributing to Bitcoin’s losses.
Looking ahead, Bitcoin traders will focus on upcoming speeches by Fed officials Jefferson and Mester. Subsequent attention will turn to major U.S. economic reports such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), and Retail Sales. Stronger-than-expected data could dampen hopes for a Fed rate cut and increase selling pressure on Bitcoin.
Hawkish Fed and Consumer Worries Weigh on USD and BTC

The U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish tone, alongside weaker consumer sentiment, has strengthened the dollar but applied downward pressure to Bitcoin. Fed officials, including San Francisco’s Mary Daly, have advocated for sustained restrictive policies to manage inflation, while others, like Atlanta’s Raphael Bostic, see potential rate cuts despite prevailing uncertainties. 
Conversely, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari underscore the risks of inflation, supporting a cautious approach towards rate adjustments.
Recent data compounds the economic outlook; the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index recorded a significant drop to 67.4 this May, signalling growing consumer concerns about inflation, which may influence future monetary policy decisions. This mixed economic feedback fosters uncertainty, affecting both traditional and digital asset markets.

Fed’s Mixed Signals: Diverse opinions among Fed officials create market volatility.
Consumer Sentiment Dip: Indicates rising inflation worries, impacting spending and investment decisions.

El Salvador’s BTC Transparency Boosts Confidence but Faces Adoption Hurdles

El Salvador has taken a bold step in enhancing transparency around its Bitcoin investments by publicizing transaction data through a customized mempool. 
The country’s strategic approach includes holding 5,748.76 BTC, valued at over $352.8 million, and adhering to a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) buying method. Despite these efforts and President Nayib Bukele’s regular Bitcoin acquisitions, only 12% of Salvadorans used Bitcoin for transactions in 2023.


This low uptake highlights challenges in widespread adoption among the populace.
The initiative to make Bitcoin investment data accessible could strengthen global investor trust in Bitcoin. Yet, the limited use of Bitcoin within El Salvador suggests that substantial effects on BTC prices might require broader acceptance and integration into daily financial activities.

Investment Transparency: El Salvador’s open approach could increase global trust in Bitcoin.
Usage Gap: Minimal local Bitcoin transactions underline adoption challenges.
Market Influence: Widespread adoption is necessary for a significant impact on BTC pricing.

Bitcoin Price Prediction

Today’s technical analysis of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) reveals a slight downtrend. The price is currently at $61,098, reflecting a decrease of 0.61%. Bitcoin price prediction struggles below a pivotal $61,764, indicating a potential continuation of the bearish trend.Resistance levels are significant at $63,824, $65,506, and $67,222, which BTC must overcome to reverse the downward momentum.Support, meanwhile, is firm at $60,185, with further potential floors at $58,812 and $56,640. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44, suggesting a neutral to bearish sentiment.Bitcoin Price PredictionThe 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) sits at $61,792, closely aligning with the pivot point, thereby underscoring its importance as a threshold for bearish or bullish shifts.

Kimsuky hacking group targets South Korean crypto firms with new malware â report - Crypto Briefing




Kimsuky, a North Korean hacking group, has reportedly been utilizing a new malware variant called “Durian” to launch targeted attacks on South Korean crypto firms.The incidence is highlighted in a recently published threat intelligence report from Kaspersky. According to Kaspersky’s research, the malware is deployed specifically to break and exploit against security software used by South Korean crypto firms, at least two of which have been identified.“Based on our telemetry, we pinpointed two victims within the South Korean cryptocurrency sector. The first compromise occurred in August 2023, followed by a second in November 2023. Notably, our investigation did not uncover any additional victims during these instances, indicating a highly focused targeting approach by the actor,” the report stated.The Durian malware is an “initial-stage” installer. It introduces supplementary malware and establishes a persistence mechanism inside the device or instance that it attacks. Once executed, the malware generates a stage loader and adds it to the exposed operating system for automatic execution. The malware’s installation is finalized with a culminating payload written over Golang, an open-source programming language developed by Google.The final payload then enables the execution of remote commands that instruct the exploited device to download and exfiltrate files. The choice of language is also suspect due to Golang’s efficiency for networked machines and large codebases.Interestingly, Kaspersky’s report also revealed that LazyLoad, one of the tools deployed by Durian, has been used by Andariel, a sub-group within the notorious North Korean hacking consortium Lazarus Group. This finding suggests a potential connection between Kimsuky and Lazarus, although Kaspersky described the link as “tenuous” at best.Lazarus Group, which first emerged in 2009, has established itself as one of the most notorious groups of crypto hackers. Independent onchain sleuth ZachXBT recently revealed that the group had successfully laundered over $200 million in ill-gotten crypto between 2020 and 2023. In total, Lazarus is accused of stealing over $3 billion in crypto assets in the six years leading up to 2023.Last week, a US court has ordered the forfeiture of 279 crypto accounts tied to North Korean threat incidents.

Whale Loses More Than $70M To Phishing Scam, Here's How They Got Their Money Back - Benzinga

In a dramatic turn of events, an attacker returned the entirety of funds stolen from a cryptocurrency whale in just a week.What Happened: According to on-chain tracking platform, Lookonchain, the whale lost more than $70 million in Wrapped BItcoin WBTC/USD to a phisher who tricked them into sending their funds to an address that resembled their own.The whale was trying to send their WBTC tokens purchased after the market dip on May 2. For this purpose, they created a new address. The phisher, who was scrutinizing the victim's on-chain activities, started spamming them with transactions using an address with the same starting and ending letters. The tactic, known in the crypto space as an address poisoning attack, works by tricking the victim into sending funds to a similar-looking address, which is exactly what happened.  Upon realizing that theft, the whale contacted the attacker, and tried to strike a deal to get the funds back. They offered the phisher 10% of the stolen funds, with the rest to be returned. However, there was no communication from the other side. However, unexpectedly, the attacker replied to the whale on May 10, saying, "Please leave your Telegram and I will contact you." After this, the attacker returned all the funds. Why It Matters:  Cybersecurity agency Match Systems claimed that it helped the victim in quick recovery of the stolen cryptocurrencies.The company underlined that the sooner victims seek assistance from experts in such circumstances, the better their prospects of receiving their funds in full. As far as prevention was concerned, Lookonchain advised users to save trusted addresses in an address book and avoid copying addresses from transaction history. It also urged users to add a filter for small transactions as a safeguard against phishing efforts.  Photo by Igor Faun on ShutterstockRead Next: Peter Schiff Says He Gets A ‘Kick’ Out Of Fanatics Accusing Him Of Secretly Owning Bitcoin: They Are ‘Drunk On The Kool-Aid’

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Soars by 7% in an Hour: Details


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu experienced a 7% price increase, aligning with a broader market uptick of the cryptocurrency market.
The rise in SHIB’s value could be linked to a significant increase in its token burn rate and upgrades to its Shibarium layer-2 solution.


SHIB Flashes Green
After several days of underperforming, the popular meme coin finally started rallying again. Its price spiked by almost 7% in the past hour while its market capitalization neared the $14 billion mark.

SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko
The resurgence coincides with a sudden green wave that pervaded much of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to almost $63,000, Ethereum (ETH) is close to surpassing the $3,000 mark, while Solana (SOL) crossed $145. 
The revival in the meme coin sector is also evident. Shiba Inu’s biggest rival – Dogecoin (DOGE) – is up 3% in the past hour. Dogwifhat (WIF), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk Inu (BONK), and many more have also witnessed impressive gains, albeit not as substantial as SHIB. 
The Potential Reasons
Besides the overall market revival, SHIB’s valuation might have been positively impacted by the Shiba Inu burn rate, which skyrocketed by over 300% in the past week. This resulted in more than 200 million tokens destroyed.




The mechanism’s ultimate goal is to reduce the tremendous circulating supply of the asset, making it scarcer and potentially more valuable in time.
Shibarium’s advancement is also worth mentioning. Shiba Inu’s layer-2 scaling solution (which aims to foster the development of the meme coin by reducing transaction fees and improving speed) recently underwent two essential upgrades. The goal was to enhance user experience and allow compatibility with popular wallets, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet.

Pudgy Penguins Plushie Craze: Over 1 Million Sold in Under a Year!


							

Pudgy Penguins sells over 1 million plushies in record time 



Retail partnerships with Target, Hot Topic fuel sales success 



Plushie sales demonstrate strong brand building for Pudgy Penguins 




Pudgy Penguins, a top-ranking NFT collection, is making a splash in the physical world. In a recent video Luca Netz the project’s CEO has announced a remarkable achievement of over one million Pudgy Penguin plush toys having been sold in less than a year. 



This record breaking sales figure signifies a major success story for Pudgy Penguins in its ability to bridge the gap between the digital and physical realms of collectibles.



The video showed how strategic retail partnerships are a key driver of this sales boom. Netz revealed collaborations with major retailers like Target and Hot Topic, along with specialty stores across the globe. These partnerships have played a crucial role in making Pudgy Penguin plushies accessible to a wider audience and fueling their popularity.



Beyond the impressive sales numbers Netz spoke about the importance of Pudgy Penguins’ success compared to other NFT projects. While some projects struggle to translate digital hype into real-world engagement, Pudgy Penguins has established a strong brand presence with tangible products and a loyal following. This also speaks about the project’s future long-term sustainability.









The enthusiasm surrounding the Pudgy Penguin plush line extends beyond physical sales. The project also boasts a developing metaverse, which briefly propelled it above the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club in terms of floor price earlier this year. Looking ahead, Pudgy Penguins plans to launch its Pudgy World alpha on the zkSync Era blockchain further solidifying its presence in the ever-evolving Web3 landscape.

Can BNB Outshine Bitcoin (BTC) This May?


BNB, the native crypto of the Binance exchange, maintains a strong position at the $600 level, indicating potential bullish momentum. 
Whether BNB will reach a new all-time high soon depends on market sentiment and broader cryptocurrency trends. Positive technical indicators and a favorable market could propel BNB to new heights, but the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility.
BNB Strong Recovery: A Look at This Month’s Surge
The BNB price has notably recovered this month, following a previous decline of approximately 20%. This month’s increase is around 13%, indicating a resurgence in bullish sentiment.
The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence Indicator (MACD) histogram has demonstrated a consistent upward trend over several months, accompanied by the bullish crossover of the MACD lines. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching overbought levels, suggesting heightened buying pressure.
Currently, BNB faces resistance at the Golden Ratio level around $590. A successful bullish breakout could propel BNB towards the recent high near $645 and potentially even surpass its all-time high at approximately $692.

BNB Price Analysis. Source: Tradingview
Crucial support levels lie at the Fibonacci levels, around $477 and $370. If BNB remains above the golden ratio support at $370, the bullish momentum will likely persist in the medium term.

Analyzing BNB: Bearish MACD on the Weekly Chart Points to Risks
The MACD histogram has shown a downward trend in the weekly chart for several weeks. This suggests that the MACD lines may imminently cross in a bearish manner. Nonetheless, the RSI does not indicate either bullish or bearish signals.
BNB Price Analysis. Source: Tradingview
Should BNB not surpass the golden ratio resistance near $590, it will find additional support at the 50-week EMA, approximately $380. Before this, substantial Fibonacci support was positioned at around $477.
BNB Price Analysis: Stuck in a Sideways Trend for 2 Months
The Binance Coin price forms an ascending triangle as it consistently reaches higher lows and repeatedly encounters resistance at the same price level. This pattern is generally considered bullish and may soon lead to a bullish breakout.
The 50-day EMA, situated at approximately $566, is also significant support. Over the past two months, the 50-day EMA has successfully acted as support on multiple occasions, as evidenced by the BNB price rebounding from this level.
Furthermore, the indicators present predominantly bullish signals. The EMAs continue to display a golden crossover, affirming a bullish trend in the short to medium term.

BNB Price Analysis. Source: Tradingview
The RSI remains neutral, and the MACD lines are poised to cross bullishly, supported by the MACD histogram, which has shown bullish momentum since yesterday.
Bullish Indicators Emerge in 4H Analysis
A golden crossover in the 4-hour chart also corroborates the short-term bullish trend. Although the MACD lines have crossed bearishly, the MACD histogram is currently ticking upward bullishly.
BNB Price Analysis. Source: Tradingview
Meanwhile, the RSI remains in neutral territory. Should BNB experience a short-term correction, significant Fibonacci support levels are expected at approximately $579 and $563.

BNB vs. BTC: Analyzing Three Months of Uptrend
The BNB price has been trending upwards against Bitcoin for the past three months, having already breached the 50-month EMA resistance at approximately 0.007984 BTC.
The next notable Fibonacci resistance levels are set at around 0.01077 BTC and around 0.00145 BTC. The overall indicators appear bullish.

The histogram of the MACD is trending upward, suggesting that the MACD lines may soon intersect in a bullish configuration. The RSI remains neutral, providing neither bullish nor bearish signals.

Unexpected Outage in Popular Blockchain Network! Statement from Developers is Awaited! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


L3 blockchain project Degen Chain experienced a significant outage, halting block production for over 11 hours.
Degen Chain's Block Production Stopped for More than 11 Hours, Reason Unknown
Degen Chain's use of Arbitrum Orbit technology, previously developed by Syndicate, a startup backed by a16z, raised questions about the unexpected halt of block production activities.



Degen Chain, known for its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, experienced an outage without any apparent explanation, sparking concerns among both users and investors.
Operating on Syndicate's cutting-edge infrastructure, the platform uses unique features and the Gas token DEGEN, which is a key component in the broader Farcaster ecosystem.





Touted as one of the largest coins in the Farcaster network, Gas token DEGEN plays an important role in facilitating transactions and strengthening various functions in the Degen Chain ecosystem.
However, the halt in block production has undoubtedly affected DEGEN's functionality and liquidity, prompting stakeholders to clarify the underlying issues causing the outage. No statement has been made by the developers yet on the subject.

CPI meets $60K BTC price battle - 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week

Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week carefully preserving $60,000 support as sentiment walks the line between bullish and bearish.BTC price action is sticking tightly to a narrow trading range — what could cause a dramatic change of pace?This week is as good a time as any for crypto market volatility. United States macro data will combine with commentary from Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, in what could prove to be an explosive mix for risk assets.There is much at stake for Bitcoin bulls, even in this established range — the market has already teased a deeper correction, and traders are already marking levels that could come next.These focus mainly on bid liquidity below $50,000 — an attractive zone for a longer-term market bottom. On shorter timeframes, however, BTC/USD seems more interested in clearing liquidity to the upside as the week begins.Cointelegraph takes a look at the current state of play when it comes to BTC/USD performance.BTC price: It's all about $60,000A weekly close which went almost unnoticed means that Bitcoin is still firmly in familiar territory as the week’s TradFi sessions get underway.BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingViewData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows a lack of volatility on BTC/USD into the end of the week.Crucially, $60,000 has held since being reclaimed on May 3, and for some, this level marks the line in the sand for bulls.Commenting on a chart uploaded to X (formerly Twitter), popular analyst Mark Cullen flagged a “bullish order block” of bidder interest just below $60,000.“Bitcoin still holding above 60k and the down trend break,” he wrote. “That blue OB is going to be the key in the short term, lose it & we revisit the lows & likely much lower. Hold and another leg to take liquidity above the highs at 64-67k is likely.”BTC/USD charts. Source: Mark Cullen/XCullen added that this week’s macroeconomic data releases, specifically the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on May 14, should be pivotal for BTC price action.As Cointelegraph reported, the $60,000 zone represents more than simply bids — key moving averages and other bull market support trendlines have converged there.Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades noted the so-called “bull market support band” still buoying price.“Bounced exactly from the Bull market Support Band last week,” he told X followers over the weekend. “So far during this and previous bull cycles, it has offered good support. Let's see how we do from here.”BTC/USD chart with bull market support band. Source: Daan Crypto Trades/XThe support band is formed of two exponential moving averages, or EMAs. The latest data from monitoring resource CoinGlass meanwhile shows that overnight into May 13, a new $65 million block of bids was placed at around $60,250. A cloud of ask liquidity which was waiting in the wings above $62,000, meanwhile, is now getting cleared in what could be the next spot price battleground.BTC liquidation heatmap (screenshot). Source: CoinGlassThe day prior, fellow trader Skew said that he suspected “passive spot buying” being responsible for support nearer to $60,000 not seeing a test.“Overall good spot bid depth $60K - $58K,” part of X comments added.CPI hits as Fed's Powell due to speakAll eyes are on macroeconomic developments in the U.S. this week as data prints come thick and fast.CPI forms the highlight when it comes to the inflation debate and risk-asset hopes for interest rate cuts.Prior to that, however, May 14 will see the Producer Price Index (PPI) print for April, along with a public speaking appearance from Fed Chair Powell.Powell will discuss the economy during a moderated discussion with Klaas Knot, president of the Netherlands’ central bank, De Nederlandse Bank, at the annual general meeting of the Foreign Bankers’ Association in Amsterdam.Markets have shown themselves to be highly sensitive to Powell’s tone when it comes to hints as to future policy moves.The latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool underscores sentiment — traders see barely any chance of a rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting in June, with the likelihood only increasing substantially in September.Fed target rate probabilities as of May 13 (screenshot). Source: CME Group“If CPI inflation rises again this week, it will mark the third STRAIGHT monthly increase,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter commented alongside its weekly macro diary dates post on X, describing the upcoming few days as “very busy.”Long-term holders halt 2024 BTC distributionSeasoned Bitcoin hodlers are channeling the 2021 bull market, as seen through some on-chain data.In a positive development, long-term holders (LTHs) are in the midst of boosting their BTC exposure after distributing to the market throughout 2024.This is the conclusion of J. A. Maartunn, a contributor to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant.Uploading some of his latest findings to X, he argued that just like in mid-2021, LTH entities are attempting to capture more of the BTC supply.“They see the low price of bitcoin as an opportunity to accumulate coins cheaply, to then reintroduce them to the market during hype phases,” Maartunn explains in an accompanying analysis on CryptoQuant. “Interestingly, a trend line can be drawn between the data points from 2018, 2021, and 2024. There's a cyclical trend occurring, as previously described, where long-term holders buy in bear markets and sell in bull markets. However, a broader and more enduring trend is also at play: despite this cyclical trend, an increasing share of bitcoin is steadily being held by long-term holders.”Bitcoin LTH supply ownership. Source: Maartunn/XAs Cointelegraph reported, both Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) speculators, known as short-term holders or STHs, form another nearby support level, which has broadly endured throughout the current bull market.Funding rates reset endures across cryptoBitcoin and altcoin market observers may not need to wait much longer to see more varied conditions return.The current picture across derivatives markets shows the extent of neutrality, which now characterizes crypto.In particular, funding rates remain neutral regardless of near-term price moves — something which makes Bitcoin’s trip to all-time highs in March look like a blip on the radar.“Crypto Funding Rates now down at neutral levels for longer than they were overheated back in February/March,” Daan Crypto Trades noted about the phenomenon. CoinGlass data shows a broad funding reset coming at the end of March.“That's basically how it goes: Slow market, breakout, overheating, reset. Rinse & Repeat,” Daan Crypto Trades added.Crypto funding rate heatmap.

Legendary trader Roaring Kitty posts comeback meme, Solana memecoin $GME soars 500% - Crypto Briefing




Keith Gill, also known online as Roaring Kitty (also known by other pseudonyms such as DeepF*ckingValue), has posted a cryptic meme on X.Notably, this was Gill’s first post in roughly three years since the events surrounding the GameStop case and the shutdown of the WallStreetBets subreddit.The meme depicts a man leaning forward from a sitting position while holding what appears to be a smartphone. Notably, the meme has a red chair and a red arrow going right, indicating some sort of movement or directional change.Gill is largely credited for spiking the GameStop stock surge in late 2020. Gill worked as a financial analyst, became convinced that GameStop stock was undervalued and shared this belief on Twitter (now X) and YouTube using the handle RoaringKitty.In 2019, Gill purchased $53,000 worth of GameStop stock. As he continued posting about the stock on social media, more retail traders (everyday people who trade stocks) began buying GameStop, leading to a rapid rise in the stock price. When GameStop’s stock price peaked at $483 per share in January 2021, Gill’s investment was valued at nearly $48 million.Gill’s identity was revealed shortly after the GameStop stock surge by Reuters who identified him using public records. In February 2021, Gill testified to Congress about his role in the GameStop stock saga, stating that he thought the stock was “dramatically undervalued.”In September 2022 and 2023, Netflix and Sony Pictures released a docuseries and a movie titled “Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga” and “Dumb Money,” respectively, which spotlighted Gill’s journey.A Solana memecoin ($GME) made to commemorate the events surrounding the GameStop controversy suddenly surged $510.9% just over eight hours since Gill’s X post.“The $GME memecoin pays homage to the GameStop saga anniversary, showing we can stand up to the big guys together,” states the token’s official website.According to data from CoinGecko, the token’s price has been largely inactive since its creation in late January. It remains unclear whether Gill has any connection with the token.Disclaimer: The author does not hold any crypto above $100 in value and only purchases crypto for utility and experimentation, not investment.

CNBC's Ran Neuner Revealed 3 Cryptocurrencies He's 'Buying': XRP, TON and Something Else

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



CNBC's Ran Neuner has recently unveiled his latest crypto picks, which, as he wrote in his post, he is "buying."Neuner's picks explainedNeuner has most likely chosen Solana for its great potential in the DeFi sector and its massive meme scene, which adds cultural leverage to its technical progress. Solana is recognized for its fast and cost-effective operations, making it a good pick for building scalable applications — especially when the network does not go offline. Arweave: Arweave stands out as a decentralized storage network that aims to provide perpetual data storage. Billing itself as a "collectively owned hard drive that never forgets," Arweave supports the permaweb — a permanent web that facilitates the creation of decentralized applications. This technology not only ensures that data remains accessible irrespective of the original host’s status but also supports data integrity over time, a critical feature in today's digital age.TON: Neuner’s interest in TON is likely spurred by its integration with Telegram, one of the largest messaging platforms globally. TON is deeply integrated into the fabric of Telegram through various features such as a native wallet, trading bots and other integrated services, making it a surprisingly strong pick with one of the biggest ecosystems behind it."Anti-picks"While Neuner leans toward SOL, AR and TON, he notes contrasting preferences among Crypto Twitter users, such as HBAR, ADA and XRP. We can point to the lackluster performance of XRP, which can be viewed negatively due to its -12% growth rate in what should be a bullish market. Despite ADA’s strong fundamentals and positive performance in 2024, it remains less favored in his portfolio. He has not disclosed the reason for it, which his critique of ADA obviously attracted ADA defenders in the comments quickly.

Kaspersky's report reveals new tactics used by North Korean crypto hackers - CoinJournal



                    

                    
North Korean hackers deploying “Durian” malware targeting South Korean crypto firms.
The resurgence of dormant hackers like Careto underscores the evolving cybersecurity landscape.
Hacktivist groups like SiegedSec escalate offensive operations amidst global socio-political events.

The first quarter of 2024 has proven particularly eventful, with notable findings and trends emerging from the frontline of cyber security. From the deployment of sophisticated malware variants to the resurgence of long-dormant threat actors, the landscape of cyber threats continues to shape-shift, presenting new challenges for security experts worldwide.
A recent report by the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky made a striking revelation shedding light on the activities of various advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.
The Durian malware targeting South Korean crypto firms
Among the findings made by GReAT is the emergence of the “Durian” malware, attributed to the North Korean hacking group Kimsuky. It has been used to target South Korean cryptocurrency firms and it has a high level of sophistication, boasting comprehensive backdoor functionality.
The Durian malware’s deployment marks a notable escalation in the cyber capabilities of Kimsuky, showcasing their ability to exploit vulnerabilities within the supply chain of targeted organizations.
By infiltrating legitimate security software exclusive to South Korean crypto firms, Kimsuky demonstrates a calculated approach to circumventing traditional security mechanisms. This modus operandi highlights the need for enhanced vigilance and proactive security strategies within the cryptocurrency sector, where the stakes are exceptionally high.
The connection between Kimsuky and the Lazarus Group
The Kaspersky report further unveils a nuanced connection between Kimsuky and another North Korean hacking consortium, the Lazarus Group. While historically distinct entities, the utilization of similar tools such as LazyLoad suggests a potential collaboration or tactical alignment between these crypto-threat actors.
This discovery underscores the interconnected nature of cyber threats, where alliances and partnerships can amplify the impact of malicious activities.
Resurgence of dormant crypto hacking groups
In parallel, the APT trends report reveals a resurgence of long-dormant threat actors, such as the Careto group, whose activities were last observed in 2013.
Despite years of dormancy, Careto resurfaced in 2024 with a series of targeted campaigns, employing custom techniques and sophisticated implants to infiltrate high-profile organizations. This resurgence serves as a stark reminder that cyber threats never truly disappear; they merely adapt and evolve.
Other crypto hacking groups terrorising the world
The Kaspersky report also highlights the emergence of new malware campaigns targeting government entities in the Middle East, such as “DuneQuixote”. Characterized by sophisticated evasion techniques and practical evasion methods, these campaigns underscore the evolving tactics of threat actors in the region.
There is also the emergence of the “SKYCOOK” implant utilised by the Oilrig APT to target internet service providers in the Middle East.
Meanwhile, in Southeast Asia and the Korean Peninsula, the activities of threat actors like DroppingElephant continue to pose significant challenges. Leveraging malicious RAT tools and exploiting platforms like Discord for distribution, these actors demonstrate a multifaceted approach to cyber espionage. The use of legitimate software as initial infection vectors further complicates detection and mitigation efforts, highlighting the need for enhanced threat intelligence and collaboration among stakeholders.
On the hacktivism front, groups like SiegedSec have ramped up their offensive operations, targeting companies and government infrastructure in pursuit of social justice-related goals. With a focus on hack-and-leak operations, these groups leverage current socio-political events to amplify their message and impact.

Peter Brandt Claims XRP’s Value Against Bitcoin Could Hit Zero | Cryptoglobe


                                
Peter Brandt, a seasoned proprietary trader with half a century of trading experience, recently made headlines with his stark forecast for XRP, particularly its performance against Bitcoin. 



Peter Brandt is a seasoned trader with extensive experience in the commodities trading sector. He first gained recognition in the financial world through his work with commodities, but over the years, he has also become well-known as a forex and cryptocurrency trader. Brandt’s expertise is often showcased in his ability to analyze market patterns and trends, which he frequently shares through social media and various trading publications.



He is perhaps best known for his application of classical charting principles to trading, a methodology he has refined over decades in the markets. Brandt has authored a book that delves into these principles, providing insights into his strategies and thought processes. His forecasts and analyses, particularly regarding significant market movements in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, have earned him a considerable following among traders who value his seasoned perspective on market dynamics. Beyond trading, Brandt also contributes to the trading community by offering mentorship and educational resources, aiming to help others navigate the complexities of various financial markets.



Brandt’s analysis, shared on social media platform X, indicates a potential plummet for XRP to zero when compared to Bitcoin. This prediction hinges on a detailed examination of the XRP/BTC price chart over an extended period.



In his post, Brandt showcased a candlestick chart on a 1-week timeframe, which is a type of financial chart used to describe the price movements of an asset. Each “candlestick” typically represents one week of price data in this context, including the opening, closing, high, and low prices. The chart displayed a long-term downtrend for XRP when valued against Bitcoin, with recent months showing a steep decline in value.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The XRP/BTC ratio currently stands at 0.00000803, a dramatic fall of 81.44% from its January level of 0.00001457. This underperformance is notable, especially given that Bitcoin has surged by 49.47% vs. USD year-to-date, whereas XRP has dropped (vs. USD) 18.74% in the same period.







Brandt’s bleak outlook has not gone without critique from XRP supporters.







In 2017, Brandt referred to XRP derogatorily while pointing out its poor performance, only to see it surge by an astonishing 1,418% shortly after his comments, reaching an all-time high of $3.84.







Despite this historical rally, Brandt remains skeptical of XRP’s prospects, particularly its performance relative to Bitcoin. He emphasized that his prediction of XRP approaching zero is specific to its Bitcoin comparative, not its value in USD. Brandt questioned the continued optimism among XRP supporters, noting the asset’s struggle to maintain significant value gains over the past years. According to his observations, XRP has rarely sustained levels above its current market position, finishing higher in just 6 out of the past 126 months.

Philippines begins Peso-backed stablecoin sandbox testing

The Philippines central bank will begin controlled trials of a national stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the local peso.Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) approved a pilot for PHPC, a Philippine peso-backed stablecoin, in partnership with crypto wallet provider Coins.ph. The grant was approved under BSP’s Regulatory Sandbox Framework. As part of the deal, Coins.ph will maintain cash reserves in pesos equivalent to the circulating supply of the PHPC stablecoin within the sandbox environment. The pegging of local currency aims to ease the transition of PHPC back to its physical fiat twin, the announcement said.Source: CoinsphThe sandbox testing is geared toward testing the real-world performance of the PHPC stablecoin and its impact on the local fiat ecosystem. “PHPC’s potential uses include domestic and cross-border payments, trading with other virtual assets, hedging against market volatility, and providing collateral and liquidity in DeFi applications.”The results will determine PHPC’s leap from a sandbox environment to real-world usage. However, a formal public deployment will be subject to final evaluations and approvals by the central bank. Local regulations suggest that the testing duration can range from three to 12 months from the pilot go-live date, depending on the project’s complexity. It is important to note that no official deadline was revealed when announcing the stablecoin experiment.Check out Cointelegraph’s guide to learn more about using stablecoins for everyday transactions.Related: It’s ‘clear’ the US government is going after Tether — Ripple CEOStablecoins backed by the Philippine peso first debuted in July 2019, led by Unionbank, a local commercial bank. UnionBank launched a payments-focused stablecoin pegged to the Philippine peso, PHX, to drive greater financial inclusion. The initiative was launched to support BSP’s drive to advocate digital financial inclusion for people and communities in the country.A related report from PhilStar Global revealed that PHX was being implemented on UnionBank’s i2i platform. The term i2i is an acronym for island-to-island, institution-to-institution and individual-to-individual.Like PHPC, PHX is also frictionlessly redeemable for pesos, which are then credited back to the users’ UnionBank accounts.Magazine: ‘Sic AIs on each other’ to prevent AI apocalypse: David Brin, sci-fi author

Shiba BONE Official Rebuilds ShibaSwap, Shibarium Telegram Group | Cryptopolitan

The Shiba Army has a new gathering place on Telegram. The new group launched with anti-bot features, while the old discussions will remain frozen. The SHIBA BONE OFFICIAL Telegram group is dedicated to ShibaSwap trading and the Shibarium ecosystem. The Telegram group requires verification to prevent bots, and has more than 5,000 members since its launch. The news arrives as Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on the verge of becoming a top 10 token again. SHIB benefitted from several trends in meme tokens and is seen as a close alternative to Dogecoin. The Shiba Inu project provides additional benefits with its Shibarium blockchain and various tokens for liquidity and decentralized trading. SHIB market prices also benefit from regular token burns, which have helped the token “eat” more zeroes in the past. Currently, SHIB is a more mature asset, and a 10X is harder to pull off, but additional assets and rewards aim to compensate. Token burns of SHIB come from fees, as well as from community projects, including NFT collections or gamified burns. The goal is to limit the SHIB supply and potentially drive scarcity. SHIB Benefits from Shibarium Hard ForkAlmost two weeks passed since a Shibarium upgrade, with improved speed and low fees. The use of Shibarium also affects BONE, one of the main staking tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. BONE owners can move the asset from Ethereum to the Shibarium blockchain for improved speed and lower fees. BONE currently trades at a much higher valuation of $0.55, and has nearly 100K holders on Ethereum. The token also exists as Shibarium Wrapped BONE, with just above 2,000 wallets with it. BONE is currently close to its lower range but has rallied close to $2 every few months in the past years. BONE’s performance adds to the ShibaInu exposure and helps retain the community of investors. Shiba Inu Aims for Growth by Holding and Token BurnsThe Shiba Inu community has shown a readiness to wait out bear markets and avoid selling to improve the performance of all tokens in the ecosystem. Shiba Inu relies on holding various ratios of SHIB, BONE, LEASH, and TREAT. The meme ecosystem also ties up with NFT collections and aims to draw in play-to-earn games as well. In late April, Shiba Inu drew attention with its TREAT token, which will have a greater role in the coming months. TREAT is currently trading at $0.0008 and is building up liquidity on UniSwap and ShibaSwap. ShibaSwap Aims to Revive InflowsWhile SHIB remains a highly active token, the native ShibaSwap is trying to grow TVL and lock more liquidity. The exchange currently carries around $23.2M, but suffers from stagnant inflows. BONE liquidity is around 3.48M, generating $1.18M in daily activity. The ShibaSwap exchange still manages to draw in $1.4M in annual fees, but has yet to achieve organic growth. Shiba Inu is also proactive in removing bots, hence the low organic activity on ShibaSwap. In 2024, the newly launched Telegram group is also trying to boost engagement and bring back trading.BONE tokens are key for reviving decentralized trading and making ShibaSwap more important among DeFi projects. BONE is also key to network security, as it can be locked for block production.Shiba Inu Among the Safest ProjectsThe Shiba Inu code is nearly three years old, and is among the safest decentralized projects. Regarding meme tokens, not all are made equal, and some hold significant risk. Shiba Inu is one of the few meme projects regularly audited by Certik, with the latest checkup being in February. According to Certik, the Shiba Inu platform has a 92.36% security score, which verifies technical issues as well as the community and operations. SHIB remains a good alternative to being exposed to meme-based trading while avoiding rug pulls or unverified tokens. Certik has focused on the ShibaSwap smart contracts, ensuring safety for liquidity providers. The given score puts Shiba Inu and ShibaSwap among the top 10% of safest and most transparent blockchain startups.

Why Chinese Workers Are Rushing To Convert Digital Yuan CBDC Payments Into Cash - Benzinga

Despite the Chinese government’s push for the adoption of the digital yuan, many workers are still hesitant to use it for their daily transactions.What Happened: Sammy Lin, an account manager at a state-owned bank in Suzhou, receives her monthly salary in digital yuan. However, she, like many others, prefers to convert it into regular cash due to the lack of interest and limited usability, reported South China Morning Post.“I prefer not to keep the money in the e-CNY app, because there's no interest if I leave it there,” Lin said. Changshu, a city in Suzhou, began paying its public sector workers in digital yuan a year ago, followed by other employers. However, the employees are not using the digital currency directly due to concerns about privacy and its limited functionality.Ye Dongyan, a researcher at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, highlighted the need to balance privacy and security, which has slowed the progress of promoting the digital yuan."Paper currency is used anonymously, but the digital yuan is different," Dongyan said. "The boundaries between information tracking and information security protection need more deliberation."See Also: Kevin O’Leary Responds To Cathie Wood’s Bitcoin Prediction: ‘The U.S. Economy Would Have To Collapse’Albert Wang, a government employee in Suzhou, noted that while the digital yuan could help reduce corruption by limiting cash bribery, its limited usability makes it uncompetitive with widely used payment tools like Alipay and WeChat Pay.Why It Matters: The Chinese government has been actively promoting the digital yuan, with Suzhou being one of the first cities to pay public sector workers in the new currency. Despite this, the slow adoption rate among workers raises questions about the currency’s future.Moreover, in the same month, Standard Chartered Bank (China) became the first foreign bank to join China’s CBDC pilot testing, offering digital yuan exchange services to its customers. This move signaled the increasing internationalization of the digital yuan.Furthermore, in March, SWIFT announced plans to launch a new platform connecting central bank digital currencies with the existing financial system. This development is expected to be a game-changer for the evolving CBDC ecosystem, given SWIFT’s crucial role in global banking.Read Next: Trump’s Next Vice President?

R. Kiyosaki warns US dollar to crash as ‘BRICS gold crypto’ emerges


Amid warnings of a major financial crash, famous investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ Robert Kiyosaki, has shared his views on why the United States dollar, in particular, might suffer as a new currency threatens its global domination.
Specifically, Kiyosaki was visiting South Africa, “watching and listening to rumors of what will happen when BRICS nations, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa produce BRICS crypto, possibly backed by gold,” as he told his followers in an X post published on May 12.
Hyperinflation on horizon
Indeed, according to the renowned finance educator, if the rumors are true, this would mean a loss of value to the US dollar and a hyperinflation in the US, and he recommended investing money in alternative assets instead, including gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC) to protect oneself against this crash:



“If BRICS gold crypto happens, trillions in fake money, fiat US dollars will come rushing back to home to America causing hyperinflation in America, ultimately destroying US dollar. Best buy real gold, silver, and Bitcoin now, and protect yourself from the crash of US dollar.”

As a reminder, Kiyosaki has lately intensified his doomsday warnings, stressing the crash has already started, signaling the end of the US dollar, and that the dire situation is only worsening “because our debt keeps going up,” with the dollar’s demise the primary reason to accumulate the above assets.
More recently, he said that most people were living in “Disneyland” instead of preparing for the crisis using a strategy he considers the best – starting their own business, using debt as money to buy cash-flowing assets like rental properties, and saving gold, silver, and the maiden cryptocurrency.
Robert Kiyosaki and Bitcoin
Interestingly, the ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ author has also admitted to being a latecomer to the crypto industry and not knowing much about the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, but he has been a fan nonetheless, including Bitcoin in most of his recommendations.
On top of that, he has agreed with the founder and CEO of ARK Invest, Cathie Wood, and her extremely bullish prediction that Bitcoin price in USD could hit $2.3 million. For now, Bitcoin is trading at $61,639, gaining 1.55% on the day, but declining 4.57% in the past week, and losing 8.58% on its monthly chart.

Tokyo-listed Metaplanet outlines Bitcoin plan amid rising economic pressure in Japan

Tokyo stock exchange-listed Metaplanet declared Bitcoin as its strategic reserve asset due to the current economic uncertainty pervading the Japanese economy, according to a May 13 statement.The firm said:“Metaplanet has adopted Bitcoin as its strategic treasury reserve asset. This move is a direct response to sustained economic pressures in Japan, notably high government debt levels, prolonged periods of negative real interest rates, and the consequently weak yen.”Metaplanet justified this shift by highlighting Bitcoin’s advantages over the Japanese Yen, including protection against currency devaluation, opportunities for speculative arbitrage in capital markets, and leveraging Bitcoin’s tax benefits.Meanwhile, the firm’s latest move has continued with several pro-BTC decisions in recent months. In April, the firm committed to Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, allocating ¥1 billion, around $6.56 million, to the flagship digital asset in a significant shift in its financial strategy.Since then, the Japan-based firm has accumulated approximately 117.72 BTC, valued at 1.2 billion JPY or $7.7 million. It has also appointed Dylan LeClair, a staunch Bitcoin advocate, as its Director of Bitcoin Strategy.Bitcoin-first approachMetaplanet said it would prioritize a “Bitcoin-first [and] Bitcoin-only approach” for its operations.According to the firm, this decision is rooted in its belief that the flagship digital asset is “fundamentally superior to any other forms of political currency, traditional stores of value and investment, and all other crypto-assets/securities.”It continued that BTC’s blockchain reliance on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism is advantageous as it “is intricately linked to real-world energy inputs, mirroring the cost conditions seen in traditional commodities.”Metaplanet furthered:“Bitcoin’s monetary policy is rigidly set in stone through 2140, setting it apart from both monetary metals and competing crypto projects operated at the whims of centralized developer teams. There will only ever be 21,000,000 BTC.”Consequently, the Japanese public company stated that it would initiate several financial options, including periodic share issuance and long-dated yen liabilities, to accumulate BTC instead of retaining the “ever-weaker yen.”Mentioned in this article

SBI’s XRPL Validator Launch Hints at XRP’s Wider Adoption


							

SBI VC Trade launches validator node on XRP Ledger (XRPL), revealing the firm’s support for XRP.



JackTheRippler reveals Japan’s use of XRP, highlighting the acceptance of XRP outside of the US.



Despite the major development, XRP is trading at a downward trend, marking a 2%+ dip over the last day.




Ripple’s native token, XRP, has secured a historic achievement with the SBI VC Trade’s validator node launch on XRP Ledger (XRPL). JackTheRippler, a prominent figure in the crypto sector, recently shared an X post, revealing Japan’s use of XRP as a bridge currency.







On May 10, SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, one of the leading financial institutions in Japan, announced the platform’s decision to become a validator on XRPL. The financial giant’s move demonstrates the industry’s unwavering support of XRP, hinting at the potential adoption of the token on a larger scale.



Despite the major development in the XRP ecosystem, the token, currently at $0.4925, is trading in a downward trend. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has seen a marginal decline of 2.99%. Meanwhile, the token has shown significant declines of 7.9% and 9.6% over the last week and month, respectively.









Notably, validators are crucial in verifying transactions and securing the network. Reinforcing the trust on XRP, SBI VC Trade is set to become a default Unique Node List (dUNL) validator on the Ledger. Reflecting on the XRP ecosystem’s new development, JackTheRippler wrote, “Ripple already conquered the financial system outside the United States of America!”



In a recent X post, JackTheRippler forecasted a potential uptick in XRP’s value, driven by the ecosystem’s major events, including financial institution integrations. He asserted that a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP is just a matter of time. Other major events spotlighted by JackTheRippler were the SEC-Ripple lawsuit’s final judgment, Ripple IPO, and potential XRP ETFs.

Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) to Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PEPEVIR will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Viral Pepe.



Currently, Viral Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PEPEVIR on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Viral Pepe by entering its contract address – AKN68pzqJzSDNfiv7nDFk27ny5TkgKFjmKEozcwYszVq – in the receiving field.



PEPEVIR currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Tether discredits Ripple CEO comments over US scrutiny

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has hit back at Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse over his recent comments that the United States government is “going after” the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, Tether.Ardoino took to social media platform X to clear the air around potential U.S. agency action against the firm and called out Garlinghouse for spreading “fear about USDT.” Ardoino suggested that Garlinghouse’s comments were hypocritical, given that Ripple is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is trying to launch a competing stablecoin to Tether’s (USDT).Source: Paolo Ardoino Ripple plans to enter the stablecoin market in 2024 amid its ongoing lawsuit against the SEC.The Tether CEO said that USDT is the largest stablecoin by market share, with millions of users across the world, and it has helped bank users in developing economies. He added:“USDT proved over time to have strong price stability, highly liquid reserves, top tier custodians and profound compliance.”Ardonio also listed several factors that make USDT compliant and one of the most widely used stablecoins. He said Tether has collaborated with 124 law enforcement agencies across 40+ countries and has blocked over $1.3 billion worth of assets linked to scams, hacks and money laundering since it launched. Of the $1.3 billion in blocked assets, Tether blocked more than $639 million by working with U.S. law enforcement.Related: Tether slams Deutsche Bank over suggestion its stablecoin could failArdonio also revealed that in the last 12 months, Tether has voluntarily complied with 198 requests from law enforcement to block wallets, 90 of which came from U.S. law enforcement agencies. It has complied with 339 requests in the last three years, of which 158 were from U.S. law enforcement.Ardonio concluded his tweet with a quip on competing stablecoin issuers. He said Tether cooperates directly with law enforcement agencies while other issuers only comply with judicial orders:“While other stablecoins, although they claim to be ‘more compliant,’ they require a judge order, allowing hackers, scammers and criminals a long time to move funds around.”The Tether CEO’s response came after Garlinghouse claimed a “100%” chance of another crypto-related black swan event during a podcast interview. The Ripple CEO said the U.S. government is going after Tether without elaborating on the reasons behind his assessment. However, Garlinghouse also acknowledged Tether's role in the crypto market.Many in the crypto community saw Ripple CEO’s comments as an ominous hint of the upcoming U.S. regulatory action. Others claimed it was just a competitive tactic as Ripple will launch a stablecoin soon.Cointelegraph reached out to Tether for comments but has yet to receive a response.Magazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom

Machine learning algorithm predicts Bitcoin price on May 31, 2024


After generating seemingly endless enthusiasm following its skyrocketing to a new all-time high near $73,000 in March and around the highly-anticipated halving event in April, Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen off somewhat.
The world’s premier cryptocurrency has, in more recent weeks, been struggling with lackluster performance and a string of violent corrections that saw it, at times, plummet as low as $57,000.
Though the most recent trading trends have been positive, as BTC is 3.18% in the green on the 24-hour chart and Bitcoin price today stands at $62,907, but a shadow casts large given its weekly and monthly shakiness.

Hoping to provide a modicum of clarity on whether Bitcoin is now set to surge toward previously predicted highs or if more bearish experts are correct and the current cycle has already topped, Finbold decided to consult the AI-driven machine learning algorithms of a platform specializing in forecasting asset prices – PricePredictions.
Machine learning algorithms forecast a gradual uptrend
As it turns out, the algorithms of PricePredictions estimate that the cryptocurrency market – at least when it comes to Bitcoin – is at the end of its highly volatile phase. 
Indeed, the platform forecasts that BTC is set to enter a gradual uptrend that will see the coin hit $63,991.20 on May 31 – a slight rise of 1.725% over the course of two and a half weeks.

Though the algorithms see some deviations from the generally steady climb, it would appear they also estimate these will have little bearing on Bitcoin’s performance through the rest of May.
Experts agree on volatility ahead
While algorithms consider a rather uncharacteristic steady rise lies ahead, several crypto experts foresee significant swings – trouble even – on the horizon.
In an analysis posted on X on May 12, Ali Martinez identified $64,290 as a price crucial for BTC to attain. According to the expert, should Bitcoin achieve this goal, it is likely it will experience a massive rally toward a new all-time high (ATH) of $76,610.
On the flip side, should it fail to achieve the climb to $64,290, it is likely that the world’s premier cryptocurrency will quickly lose its footing and find it again only at approximately $51,970.

Another prominent crypto expert, Michaël van de Poppe, advised caution as he believes that should Bitcoin again slip below $60,000, it would continue collapsing until it finds itself in the support zone between $52,000 and $55,000.

It is, however, possibly worth noting that on April 30, van de Poppe estimated that Bitcoin would find its bottom within a week indicating that the then-discovered levels just under $57,000 constitute the lowest BTC will go for the time being.

XREX Singapore Secures MPI Licence from MAS for Cross-Border Solutions | Coinspeaker



XREX Singapore introduces XREX Pay, offering businesses cross-border B2B payments and money transfer solutions. The platform will support traditional currencie­s like the Singapore Dollar (SGD) and US Dollar (USD) as we­ll as stablecoins like Tethe­r (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).

In a notable development, XREX Singapore, a blockchain-focuse­d financial group that helps cross-border payme­nts for emerging markets, secured a Major Payment Institution (MPI) Licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on May 12, 2024. This came after XREX got initial approval for the lice­nce in November 2023.
The­ MAS is known for its strict regulation, and this licence shows XREX Singapore­’s commitment to compliance and security. “Our engagements with the MAS have repeatedly shown us why they are internationally revered as a leading central bank and financial regulator,” said XREX Singapore’s CEO. He­ also said XREX will “bring blockchain-enabled digital payment currencies to ubiquity” with this licence­.




This strategic move by XREX fits with Singapore’s ambition to become a global le­ader in finance tech innovation. The­ city has worked to make regulations encouraging the growth of blockchain and digital assets. XREX Singapore’s focus on e­asy cross-border payments, espe­cially for small and medium businesses in ne­w markets, directly helps financial inclusion, a ke­y goal for both XREX and the MAS.
XREX’s Regulatory Commitment
“The MPI licence is a testament to our unwavering commitment to the highest regulatory compliance standards,” said XREX Co-founde­r and CEO Wayne Huang. This focus on rules goes be­yond just getting the licence­. XREX is working to make sure its service­s follow global best practices, including the Financial Action Task Force­’s (FATF) travel rule, which fights money launde­ring and terrorism funding.
This commitment to transparency is also seen in XREX Pay, a new platform that XREX Singapore­ will start. XREX Pay serves businesse­s with features like cross-borde­r B2B payments and money transfer solutions. The platform will support traditional currencie­s like the Singapore Dollar (SGD) and US Dollar (USD) as we­ll as stablecoins like Tethe­r (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).
XREX Singapore’s MPI licence cove­rs a wide range of payment se­rvices, including account creation, domestic and cross-borde­r money transfers, merchant acquisition, e­-money issuance, and digital payment toke­n services. This broad licence­ makes XREX a key player in Singapore­’s growing FinTech ecosystem.
Forging Partnerships in Singapore
XREX has obtained approval for six out of the seve­n payment services unde­r the MPI licencing framework, as state­d by XREX’s Co-founder and Group Chief Reve­nue Officer, Winston Hsiao. Additionally, the company aims to leve­rage its headquarters in Singapore­ to forge strategic partnerships with major banks, cre­dit card institutions, and other prominent payment provide­rs.
This collaborative approach is designed to build ne­xt-generation financial systems that se­amlessly integrate traditional banking and blockchain-base­d finance, ultimately creating a more­ inclusive and efficient financial landscape­. By securing the MPI licence­ and launching XREX Pay, XREX’s Singapore-based operations have­ taken a crucial step towards their obje­ctive of revolutionizing cross-border payme­nts.

BounceBit Mainnet Launches Amid Cybersecurity Alert


							

BounceBit advances with mainnet launch and BB token airdrop, bolstered by successful funding and exchange listings.



A phishing scam targeting BounceBit users underscores the need for vigilance, with official links provided to avoid potential fraud.



BounceBit’s unique Shared-Security Clients infrastructure introduces a dual-token system.




BounceBit, a Bitcoin restaking protocol, is set to launch its mainnet today, accompanied by the issuance of BB token airdrops. However, the excitement surrounding this milestone is dampened by a cybersecurity alert raised by 23pds, the Chief of Information and Security Officer at SlowMist.



According to 23pds, the first search result for “BounceBit” on Google leads to a phishing website, bouncbit[.]io, posing a serious threat to users. Hence, caution is advised to avoid falling victim to potential scams.







BounceBit, officially launches its mainnet at 02:30 UTC today, followed by a BB token airdrop from 08:30 to 10:00 UTC. Moreover, the protocol is poised for further expansion with the listing of BB tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges KuCoin and Gate.io, commencing trading operations at 10:00 UTC.



Despite the promising developments, the cybersecurity alert underscores the importance of vigilance within the crypto space. In response to the phishing threat, BounceBit has proactively shared official airdrop and customer support links via its X account to guide users safely.





The mainnet launch and BB token airdrop mark significant milestones for BounceBit, following its successful $6 million seed funding round earlier this year. Co-led by Blockchain Capital and Breyer Capital, with participation from other venture capital entities and angel investors, this funding solidified BounceBit’s position in the market.









Moreover, BounceBit introduces a novel BTC restaking mechanism through its Shared-Security Clients (SSC) infrastructure, initially focusing on the BTC Restaking Chain. This innovative approach involves a dual-token system where validators stake both BTC and BB, enhancing the platform’s security and stability.



As of May 13, DeFiLlama reports a total value locked (TVL) of $448.65 million in BounceBit. With such substantial backing and innovative features, BounceBit’s mainnet launch and BB token airdrop are expected to garner significant attention within the crypto community, attracting both genuine interest and potentially fraudulent activities.

Steven Nerayoff Slams US SEC's Crypto Stance: Calls For Clarity And Innovation | Bitcoinist.com


								As the debate over cryptocurrency regulation continues, former advisor to the Ethereum network Steven Nerayoff has become a public voice criticizing the approach taken by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) towards crypto, especially under the leadership of the agency’s Chairman Gary Gensler. N
erayoff’s criticism goes beyond regulatory policy to consider the wider ramifications for the cryptocurrency market, citing the harm done by Gensler and Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum.
Impact On Crypto From Bad Actors
Ethereum‘s security status has been a significant discussion in the crypto industry with the SEC planning enforcement proceedings to regulate ETH as a security. However, the former ETH advisor Steven Nerayoff believes the industry is not at odds with Ethereum, but rather with Joseph Lubin and other negative actors, particularly the SEC chair Gary Gensler.

According to Nerayoff, the Ethereum co-founder and other bad actors have seriously damaged the crypto sector with their actions over time. As a result, crypto’s total market capitalization has declined, hindering ecosystem expansion and defrauding the public of hundreds of billions, possibly trillions of dollars.
He explained that by putting their financial gain ahead of the creation of dApps and true value, the market cap has seen lesser growth in comparison to what Nerayoff had anticipated. “It is clear that if not for them, the market cap could easily be 10x or more of its current value,” he stated.
Nerayoff claims Lubin is the height of ambiguity and uncertainty, trying to play a victim card despite his litigation against the SEC regarding Ethereum and his response to the Commission’s questions concerning MetaMask.
Last month, the SEC filed a Wells Notice to Consensys while mainly aiming at its MetaMask wallet service, indicating a potential regulatory dispute. Lubin, responding to the SEC’s move, claimed that the agency is pursuing a strategic series of enforcement actions instead of having transparent rules and open communication, thereby endangering the crypto landscape. 
However, Nerayoff, dissatisfied with Lubin’s response, thinks it is nothing more than a devious scheme from the ETH co-founder, carried out in concert with Gary Gensler and the SEC. 
He further stated that it is evident that Lubin is afraid of his failure and the evidence is there. “From securities fraud to market manipulation, colluding with foreign governments and US government agencies, he has done it all,” Nerayoff stated. These actions, according to Narayoff, committed by Lubin could potentially send him to prison for a long time.
Need For Regulatory Transparency And Growth
Given the negative impact caused by these bad actors over the years, Nerayoff has stressed the need for appropriate supervision and clarity, which are vital for the development of the crypto landscape.

The Ethereum former advisor noted that investors have been harmed due to these wrong actions, and it is only proper that these dishonest people should be brought to justice. “It is time to demand transparency, the industry deserves better than what these bad actors have given it, and it is time to take action to ensure that crypto thrives for the better,” he added.

Severe crisis incoming? Expert Michaël van de Poppe questions 4-year Bitcoin cycle


With the recent Bitcoin (BTC) halving failing to make an immediate bullish effect on the price of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe has shared his doubts regarding the four-year cycle for the maiden crypto.
Specifically, van de Poppe observed that there was a widespread expectation that there would be a four-year cycle for Bitcoin but also argued that this might not be the case this time around, as “liquidity goes on both sides,” according to an analysis he shared in an X post on May 12.
In his view, the current cycle will be much shorter and may not even cross three years, after which the price of Bitcoin would enter a significant bear market, or as he noted, “this cycle is going to last until late ‘26, perhaps ‘27, and then, we’re facing a severe crisis.”



‘Opportunity cost’ strategy: Selling all BTC?
It is also worth mentioning that van de Poppe has recently announced he was selling all of his BTC “to swap it towards another asset class because I want to make more Bitcoin and because now is the actual best opportunity out there in terms of valuation,” as he explained in a YouTube video shared on May 12.

“I’m doing this and swapping my Bitcoin towards altcoins because I think that there is a huge opportunity cost out there and that there is a lot of ROI to be made by investing into altcoins.”

Describing his ‘opportunity cost’ strategy in detail, the crypto analyst made his main point, suggesting that investors shouldn’t hold onto this other asset – altcoins in his case – at all, but “trading them to make more Bitcoin and keep on having your Bitcoin.”

Bitcoin price analysis
Meanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $62,960, suggesting an increase of 3.11% in the last 24 hours, declining 3.35% across the previous seven days, and losing 6.63% over the past month, according to the most recent charts on May 13.

                        The Pudgy Penguins nonfungible token (NFT) project has achieved a remarkable milestone, with more than one million Pudgy Penguin toys sold over the past 12 months.According to CEO Luca Schnetzler, the popular NFT project has experienced a surge in sales, expanding its reach to retailers worldwide.In a recent post on X, Schnetzler expressed surprise at the Consumer Crypto revolution being led by “fat flightless birds.”The sales milestone comes on the heels of the recent news that Pudgy Toys with Pudgy World are now available in the prominent United States retail giant, Target.Pudgy Penguin Toys Continue to Gain Popularity
Pudgy Penguins, a collection of 8,888 colorful penguin avatars, gained popularity after its creation in 2021.The project faced initial challenges, with accusations of a rug pull against the former founder.However, in 2022, Schnetzler acquired the brand for $2.5 million, revitalizing its prospects.The success of Pudgy Penguins extends beyond the digital realm, as stuffed toy versions of the lovable penguins are now also available for purchase in retail giants like Walmart and Target.The move has contributed to the project’s ongoing triumph.One unique aspect of Pudgy Penguins is its model that allows NFT holders to earn 5% royalties on net revenues from sales of physical products featuring their unique Pudgy Penguin designs. The NFT versions themselves have gained significant value, with a floor price of 12.87 ETH (approximately $37,580 at current prices) on NFT marketplace OpenSea.The recent sales highlight includes the impressive transaction of Penguin #6873, which was sold for a staggering 400 ETH, equivalent to around $1.17 million, according to OpenSea.Sales activity for the Pudgy Penguins collection experienced a peak in mid-February, with 439 sales per day at an average price of 20 ETH.While sales volumes have slightly declined since then, the project still maintains a daily average of approximately 269 sales as of May 6.In terms of secondary sales over the past seven days, Pudgy Penguins ranks twelfth on the NFT sales tracking platform CryptoSlam, with a total value of $2.2 million.Pudgy Penguins Partners with Unstoppable Domains
Back in February, Pudgy Penguins partnered with Unstoppable Domains to introduce “.pudgy” domain names. The collaboration allows customers of Unstoppable Domains to purchase top-level domain names ending in “.pudgy,” which can be associated with Pudgy Penguin NFTs.The integration introduces numerous possibilities for domain holders, including the ability to send and receive web3 messages, make crypto payments between domain addresses, and collect exclusive utility badges through the new domains.“We are thrilled to welcome Pudgy Penguins, a true innovator and a strong brand, into the Unstoppable Domains family,” said Sandy Carter, COO at Unstoppable Domains.

Ethereum's Ether Supply Turns Inflationary for First Time Since Merge After Dencun Upgrade



                    

Two months after the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade, Ethereum has seen a shift in its Ether supply dynamics, no longer exhibiting deflationary characteristics. 



According to CryptoQuant data, the total supply of Ether grew slightly from 120 million on March 12 to 120.1 million by May 7, marking the first inflationary trend since the Merge transition in September 2022.




The Merge was a significant shift for Ethereum, moving from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus model. 



This change included a mechanism for burning transaction fees, which initially led to a deflationary supply of Ether. 



Since the implementation of the Merge, over 419,713 ETH has been permanently removed from circulation, based on data from ultrasound.money.



The recent Dencun upgrade, however, has reduced the median transaction fees by up to four times, despite maintaining the same level of network activity. 



This reduction in fees has resulted in a decrease in the amount of Ether being burned, contributing to the increase in total supply.

As noted in a CryptoQuant report from May 8, “The Dencun upgrade has made ETH inflationary again, potentially killing the narrative of ‘Ultra sound’ money as a structurally lower amount of transaction fees burned on Ethereum have had the corresponding effect of not decreasing the total supply of ETH to keep it deflationary.”




Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, emphasized on May 9 that the loss of deflationary status is not particularly critical for Ethereum’s broader ecosystem. 



He stated in an X post, “Post-Dencun upgrade, ETH lost deflationary status with reduced fees, departing from ‘ultrasound money.’ Ethereum’s strength lies in DApps; it’s wiser not to compare it to Bitcoin’s sound money narrative.”




This development signals a shift in the economic dynamics of Ether but does not undermine the foundational benefits of the Ethereum network, particularly its application in decentralized applications (DApps). 



While the narrative of ‘ultra sound’ money may be diminishing, Ethereum’s core utility and innovation in decentralized solutions continue to hold strong.

El Salvador launches $360M Bitcoin Treasury monitoring website

El Salvador has launched its own proof-of-reserve website, featuring various tools for monitoring the country’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings using on-chain data. El Salvador’s online Bitcoin Treasury provides real-time data on the nation’s BTC reserves. The Central American nation officially holds 5,748 BTC, which is currently worth approximately $360 million, with Bitcoin tradeiabove the $62,700 mark as of 8:20 a.m. UTC.El Salvador has bought seven BTC worth over $438,000 during the past week while adding a total of 31 BTC worth $1.94 million over the past 30 days, according to the website.Source: Bitcoin.gob.svThe purchases remain in line with El Salvador’s goal of adding 1 Bitcoin to its treasury every day.El Salvador was the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021.

Philippines’ central bank greenlights pilot for Peso-backed stablecoin - CoinJournal



                    

                    
BSP approves pilot for PHPC, a Peso-backed stablecoin, in collaboration with Coins.ph.
Sandbox testing to evaluate PHPC’s real-world performance and impact on local fiat ecosystem.
Transition to real-world usage subject to final evaluations and approvals by central bank.

The digital currencies landscape in the Philippines is set for a major shift after the country’s central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), granted approval for the commencement of a pilot program for a Philippine Peso-backed stablecoin (PHPC).
BHP’s move signals a progressive step towards exploring the potential of blockchain technology and stablecoins in the nation’s financial ecosystem.
Sandbox testing to evaluate PHPC’s viability
The pilot program, conducted within the framework of BSP’s Regulatory Sandbox, will see the collaboration between the central bank and crypto wallet provider Coins.ph.

#ICYMI: #CoinsPH has been granted @bangkosentral (BSP) approval to pilot PHPC, a Philippine Peso stablecoin 🇵🇭
Learn more about this milestone and the pilot here: https://t.co/zpQQvr7Pv9 pic.twitter.com/a2jWB8mSeJ
— Coins.ph (@coinsph) May 9, 2024

The primary objective of the pilot program is to assess the real-world performance of the PHPC and its potential impact on the local fiat ecosystem.
Under the terms of the pilot, Coins.ph will maintain cash reserves in pesos equivalent to the circulating supply of PHPC within the sandbox environment, ensuring a stable 1:1 pegging of the digital currency to the Philippine peso.
BSP’s choice Coins.ph is strategic. Being a licensed crypto service provider in the Philippines, Coins.ph dominates Philippines crypto space, especially after its partnership with Circle in 2023 for USDC remittances in the Philippines. It was the first to add BRC-20-support in the Philippines.
The sandbox testing phase is designed to explore various use cases for PHPC, including domestic and cross-border payments, trading with other virtual assets, hedging against market volatility, and providing collateral and liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
These trials will provide valuable insights into PHPC’s practicality and effectiveness in facilitating financial transactions and promoting financial inclusion in the Philippines.
Transitioning from sandbox to real-world usage
While the pilot program marks an important milestone in the development of PHPC, its transition from a sandbox environment to real-world usage is contingent upon the results of the testing phase and final evaluations by the central bank.
According to local regulations, the duration of the testing period can range from three to 12 months, depending on the complexity of the project. However, no official deadline has been disclosed for the conclusion of the stablecoin experiment.
The current initiative to launch a Peso-backed stablecoin builds upon previous efforts to introduce stablecoins pegged to the Philippine peso, such as the PHX launched by UnionBank in 2019. UnionBank’s PHX, aimed at driving greater financial inclusion, is also redeemable for pesos and implemented on the bank’s i2i platform.
The emergence of PHPC and other stablecoin projects reflects the growing recognition of digital currencies as viable tools for enhancing financial services and expanding access to digital payments in the Philippines.

Buy Bitcoin - BRICS gold-backed crypto to 'crash U.S. dollars:' Robert Kiyosaki - AMBCrypto



BRICS gold-backed crypto will severely affect the U.S. dollar, per Kiyosaki
However, BRICS member states still don’t have an official consensus on a common currency.

Robert Kiyosaki, author of “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” has underscored the severe impact of BRICS gold-backed crypto on the U.S. dollar. 
As part of their de-dollarization plans, the BRICS nations—originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—have explored various ways to conduct cross-border trades without relying on the U.S. dollar and Euros. 
Digital technology and blockchain are part of the plans. Additionally, a gold-backed currency has also been floated. 
According to Kiyosaki, should BRICS formalize gold-backed crypto, the U.S. dollar will crash, 
“If BRICS gold crypto happens trillions in fake money, fiat US dollars will come rushing back to home to America causing hyperinflation in America, ultimately destroying US dollar.”
BRICS move: A threat to USD and a win for Bitcoin?
In the past, U.S. dollars accounted for almost 100% of cross-border transactions, including oil purchases.
 However, a recent IMF report established that the U.S. dollar’s dominance has declined, dropping from 80% (2010) to 50% (2023).
On the contrary, China’s Renminbi (RMB), a member of the BRICS, has jumped from zero to 50% over the same period. 
If the BRICS gold-backed crypto follows RMB’s steps, it will further dent U.S. dominance on cross-border payments. 
That means BRICS countries could offload their USD reserves back to the U.S., and according to Kiyosaki, such an upsurge in supply could cause “hyperinflation in America.”
For diversification and investor protection in such a scenario, Kiyosaki urged his followers to buy Bitcoin [BTC] and metals, 
“Best buy real gold, silver, and Bitcoin now, and protect yourself from the crash of the US dollar.” 
However, an official BRICS gold-backed crypto could still be far away. 
In August 2023, India’s foreign secretary, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, underscored BRICS members’ preference for trading using respective currencies rather than a common one.  
Although Russia warmed up to a common currency in March 2024, with blockchain and digital technology in mind, all BRICS members are yet to communicate an official consensus. 
Perhaps more clarity could be shed during the upcoming BRICS summit in Russia, scheduled for October 2024.

US State Rep. Mulls 5% Bitcoin Investment In Rainy Day Fund


								Keith Ammon, New Hampshire State Representative for New Boston, Mont Vernon, Lyndeborough and Vice Chair of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, opened a discussion on the potential of diversifying the state’s financial reserves into Bitcoin ETFs. His comments, posted on X (formerly Twitter), highlight a dramatic what-if scenario that underscores the explosive growth of BTC over the last decade.
What Bitcoin Can Do For New Hampshire
Ammon’s reflection on the state’s financial decisions comes at a time when BTC and other digital assets are increasingly being acknowledged by major institutional investors. His detailed analysis posited, “Should the State of New Hampshire investigate allocating a small percentage of its reserves into a Bitcoin ETF? Of course, hindsight is 20/20, but had the State of NH put just 5% ($4.65M) of its 2016 $93M rainy day fund into Bitcoin and held it, that amount of BTC today would be worth nearly half a billion dollars ($473M), a 10,000% ROI.”
This assertion follows a surge in institutional interest in BTC as a viable asset class. According to recent insights from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, there has been a noticeable increase in Bitcoin ETF investors, which now includes entities like sovereign wealth funds and pensions.

Additionally, Ammon cites Manuel Nordeste, Fidelity’s Vice President of Digital Assets, who recently highlighted the growing trend among major pension funds and big banks towards spot Bitcoin ETF allocations, driven by an escalating interest in the digital asset market. “25% of pension managers present at a recent panel personally owned digital assets. If just 1% of state pension AUM ($5.5T) flowed into BTC, it would dwarf mining revenue, leading to a supply shortage relative to demand and a price increase for Bitcoin,” Ammon stated.
Reflecting on the potential future impacts, Ammon also referred to a prediction by Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, who has forecasted a significant rise in Bitcoin’s value. Wood speculates that Bitcoin could reach $3.8 million per unit by 2030 if institutional investors allocate more than 5% of their portfolios to the cryptocurrency.
Utilizing this prediction, Ammon extrapolated potential returns for New Hampshire, “If NH invested 5% ($14.5M) of its $290M rainy day fund balance into a Bitcoin ETF at today’s prices and held it until 2030, it would be valued at nearly one billion dollars ($900M), a 6,200% ROI.”

The implications of such investments extend beyond mere speculative gains. New Hampshire faces outstanding liabilities totaling approximately $1.45 billion, including $1.25 billion to the state pension system and around $200 million in bonds.
Ammon argues that exploring alternative investments like Bitcoin could be a viable solution to these financial challenges, suggesting, “How could we climb out of that hole? The answer may be staring us in the face, and it’s worthy of further investigation.”
Reactions from the BTC community and financial experts were prompt. James Lavish, a noted Bitcoin authority, underscored the importance of this consideration from a fiduciary responsibility perspective.
He remarked, “The simple answer is yes. A more involved answer is: To not at least investigate a possible allocation in Bitcoin would be a breach of fiduciary duty, considering the alarming deficit levels and exponentially expanding federal debt.”
Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Act, a non-profit advocating for Bitcoin mining in the USA, succinctly supported the notion with, “You know my answer.”
Ammon’s proposal underscores the growing politicization of Bitcoin in the US, highlighting a shift towards crypto becoming a significant electoral issue. This trend is further evidenced by former US President Donald Trump’s recent pivot towards a pro-BTC and crypto stance, aiming to leverage this position in his bid to return to the White House.
Trump’s change of heart marks a notable development, reflecting the increasing relevance of crypto in political strategies and national economic discussions.
At press time, BTC traded at $62,799.

                        SHIB has jumped by 5% in the past 24 hours, with the Shiba Inu price rising to $0.00002357 as the crypto market as a whole gains by 2% today.Shiba Inu remains down by 7% in the past week, however, as well as by 2% in the last 30 days.On the other hand, its medium- and long-term momentum remains solid, with the coin having gained 160% in the past year.And with SHIB’s price bouncing overnight and again this morning, today could be the beginning of a new growth spurt.Shiba Inu Price Prediction as SHIB Bounces 5% Suddenly Overnight – New Bull Rally Starting?
SHIB’s chart and indicators show some very strong momentum right now, largely as a result of the surge it has seen in the past hour or so.Its RSI (purple) has gone from under 30 very early this morning to just over 70 as of writing, and given that it had been suffering for several days prior to this, it could remain high for a few days yet.Source: TradingViewProviding support to this view is SHIB’s 30-day average (orange), which has begun climbing rapidly and could soon overtake the 200-day (blue).If it does climb over the longer term average, this could signal a breakout rally, which again may last for a few days.The reason why SHIB has attracted a sudden influx of interest is that CoinGate has just announced that it has integrated Shiba Inu with the Polygon and BNB Chain networks.In other words, it’s now faster and cheaper to use SHIB as a payment option online, something which could open up the famous meme token to more usage going forward.Because of this, and because the announcement coincided with a general uplift for the wider market, we could certainly see Shiba Inu price continue to climb in the near term.It’s also arguable that Shiba Inu’s fundamentals – which are strong for a meme coin – could help it appreciate over longer timeframes.For instance, it’s in the process of building a privacy-focused layer-three network, while it launched its own layer-two (Shibarium) in August of last year.Critics might point out that CoinGate integrated SHIB with Polygon, and didn’t use Shibarium, yet the fact that the coin’s developers are building this kind of stuff bolsters its long-term outlook.The Shiba Inu price could, therefore, reach $0.00004 in the next couple of months.New Meme Tokens Show Strong Potential
SHIB remains in a very good position, yet it isn’t the only promising meme coin around at the moment, with several new meme tokens looking ready to perform well in the coming weeks.Possibly the most promising is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme coin that has raised over $15 million in its token offering.Source: DogeverseWhat distinguishes DOGEVERSE above most of its rivals is that it’s the first-ever Doge-themed multi-chain crypto.As such, it will launch on Ethereum and then soon after bridge to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.This will give it wider application than most other meme coins, with DOGEVERSE potentially gaining traction and usage on multiple apps and platforms.In turn, more adoption will equal greater demand and a higher price, with the token also boasting a hard cap of 120 million tokens.This could make it deflationary over time, while the ability to stake the coin will further squeeze its circulating supply.VIDEOSuch features look ready to make DOGEVERSE one of the biggest token launches of the year, with newcomers able to join its sale at the official Dogeverse website.There’s limited time left to buy during the presale, which is due to end in the next few weeks, at which point the coin will list and potentially moon.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Dogecoin (DOGE) Hits Enormous 5.6 Billion Support


Dogecoin saw a significant support level emerging, marked by a massive 5.6 billion DOGE that could play a role in determining the asset's future trajectory.Analyzing Dogecoin's current positionAs observed on the latest charts, Dogecoin has been wrestling with a bearish trend but is now approaching a robust support level. This level, characterized by a substantial volume of Dogecoin, represents a point where historical buying interest has been strong enough to prevent further price declines. The presence of such a significant support zone suggests that there is potential for a reversal if the sentiment and market conditions align favorably.Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe chart shows Dogecoin trading below the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, indicating a current bearish bias in the short to midterm. However, the proximity to the major support zone could be an important factor in a reversal rally. This support level, reinforced by a high concentration of buy orders in the past, offers a glimmer of hope for bullish Dogecoin investors.Moreover, the RSI, a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, is hovering near the 44.4 mark. This level is close to the oversold territory, which typically suggests that an asset might be underbought and could be due for a potential rebound.Volume analysis further complements the picture, showing fluctuating trade volumes as Dogecoin approaches this critical support level. A spike in trading volume around this point could indicate growing interest from traders anticipating the asset to bounce back from these lows.If Dogecoin manages to maintain its stance above this significant support level and volume increases, there could be enough buying pressure to propel the price upwards, challenging higher resistance levels.

Bitcoin (BTC) Could Trigger 'Panic' If it Falls Below $60K as Selling Pressure Weighs Down Markets

BTC has largely remained range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000 since March, with the highly-anticipated halving event in April turning out to be a sell-the-news play amid a general lack of market catalysts. Inflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have waned in the past few weeks, as reported, adding to a bearish sentiment.

Ripple v SEC Lawsuit: Here's Why Today is Important for XRP


																TL;DR

Today (May 13), Ripple and the SEC will file important motions related to their ongoing lawsuit, with further legal responses due next week.
The resolution of this case is eagerly awaited, as it could significantly influence the cryptocurrency market, depending on the outcome.


What to Expect Today?
Ever since entering into the trial phase, the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has started offering developments quite frequently. 
The next key date in the case is today (May 13), when both entities and third parties are scheduled to file omnibus letter-motions to seal all materials relating to the remedies-related briefing, such as declarations, briefs, and supporting exhibits. Filing proposed reductions should also take place in the next several hours.
A week later, Ripple, the SEC, and all other related organizations must file letter-briefs in opposition to the omnibus letter-motions to seal. 
“Under the joint proposal, the parties would further be required to file public, redacted versions of all documents within 14 days of the Court’s rulings on the omnibus sealing motions,” the document reads.
The resolution of the lawsuit is much anticipated by the XRP army and the entire crypto community due to its possible impact on the industry. A decisive Ripple win may result in an overall market resurgence, while the opposite scenario could hamper the sector’s advancement due to the implementation of strict rules.

The Confrontation Over a Witness Testimony 
As mentioned above, the legal battle witnessed multiple actions in the past few weeks, with one example being the confusion surrounding the key witness Andrea Fox. Initially, Ripple insisted that her testimony (known as the “Fox Declaration”) represents an unsolicited expert opinion and should be taken into account.
However, the SEC described the process as “standard summary evidence in support of calculations for disgorgement.” 
“It’s not an expert report, does not rely on specialized experience, and does not render any opinions at all, let alone an “expert” one. Nor does it present the testimony of a percipient witness. Rather, it applies basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records to streamline the presentation of the evidence to Judge Torres… The court should deny Ripple’s motion,” the agency insisted. 
Additionally, the watchdog claimed that the “Fox Declaration” consists of data derived from documents generated by Ripple itself, including tax returns and financial statements, which can be helpful for determining the case’s outcome.
Not long ago, Ripple filed a letter in further support of its initial request. It maintained that the SEC failed to show that the declaration is summary evidence rather than expert testimony:
“Fox is an expert because she purports to use technical or other specialized knowledge to help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. She does not merely apply basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records, as the SEC contends.”
The company went further, arguing that even if Andrea Fox could be classified as a summary witness, the Commission failed to disclose her before the end of the discovery process.

Why is the Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Up Today?


																SHIB is giving hints it wants to go higher, so let’s have a quick look at a few reasons why and what may rest ahead.
Key Support levels: $0.000022
Key Resistance levels: $0.000025
1. SHIB Eyeing the Key Resistance
With the price holding well above the support at $0.000022, buyers appear keen to test the key resistance at $0.000025. The previous attempt in early May was rejected, but a second one could be successful, considering that momentum may be shifting bullish.
Chart by TradingView
2. Buyers are Returning
SHIB’s price increased by over 5% today on good buy volume. The last time this happened was when this meme coin tried to break the key resistance in early May. This is a promising sign and could lead to a breakout.




Chart by TradingView
3. MACD is Curving Up
The 2-day MACD histogram is making higher lows, and the moving averages could soon curve up toward a bullish cross. In lower timeframes, this has already happened after this latest push from buyers. If this trend continues, then SHIB could break above $0.000025.

Ethereum has been increasingly inflationary for over a month as fees hit all-time low

Since Ethereum moved from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in 2022, it has become a deflationary asset. The total circulating supply of Ethereum (ETH) currently stands at 120,105,358 ETH, representing a 415,680 ETH decrease from the supply levels observed before The Merge.However, over the past 30 days, Ethereum’s supply dynamics have shifted, with 35,548.72 ETH being burned (removed from circulation) and 75,072.43 ETH being issued as block rewards to validators. The net result is a supply increase of 39,523.71 ETH during this period. Data from Ultrasound Money show that, based on the supply change over the past 30 days, Ethereum’s current annualized inflation rate is approximately 0.4%.Ethereum deflationary trend (ultrasound money)In comparison, Bitcoin’s inflation rate stands at 1.068%, while Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work (pre-merge) inflation rate would have been significantly higher at 3.74%. If the current 30-day rate persists, projections for the next year indicate that around 433,000 ETH will be burned, and 914,000 ETH will be issued, creating a net gain of 481,000 ETH.Data from OKLink shows a continued decrease in ETH burned since March, when an average of around 6,000 ETH was burned daily. Since the start of May, only around 900 ETH has been burned daily, the lowest average levels since The Merge.Ethereum burn and supply trends (OKLINK)The recent Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum network has had a notable impact on the ecosystem. The upgrade has led to a decrease in layer-2 transaction fees and overall network activity. Consequently, this has seemingly resulted in a lower burn rate, pushing Ethereum’s supply back into an inflationary state.Data from Etherscan and Ycharts shows that gas fees have also plummeted to around 5 gwei, the lowest on record.Ethereum gas fees (yCharts)Interestingly, Ethereum’s inflation rate has drawn closer to that of Bitcoin, especially in the aftermath of Bitcoin’s halving event last month. As per data from the past 7 days, Ethereum’s inflation rate for the past week stands at 0.54%, just 0.29 percentage points higher than Bitcoin’s post-halving rate of 0.83%.Ethereum’s inflation rate has been steadily increasing since February when it reached a local low of -2%.Ethereum inflation rate over time (OKLINK)While Ethereum’s supply has become slightly inflationary in the short term due to reduced network activity and burn rate, its overall supply is still decreasing on a net basis. This can be attributed to EIP-1559, which introduced a burn mechanism for a portion of transaction fees.Looking ahead, Ethereum’s inflation rate and supply dynamics will likely be influenced by future network upgrades and adoption trends. If transaction fees and burn rate remain low, Ethereum may continue to experience inflationary pressure in the near term. However, the long-term trajectory will depend on the success of upcoming upgrades and the overall growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.The adoption of layer-2 networks and the recent increase in layer-3 network activity reduces load from the Ethereum mainnet, yet it does so at a cost. However, the current increase in L2 and L3 activity is not at a level to create sufficient L1 transactions to keep Ethereum deflationary. Only time will tell whether the ultra-sound money concept for Ethereum will be retained in a world dominated by L2 and L3s.

Chainlink (LINK) Integrates New Services for Six Blockchains | Cryptopolitan

Chainlink does not stop growing its influence as a data source, connecting even more blockchains and projects. In high-speed trading environments, Chainlink is the top choice for reliable oracle data, especially for pricing information. In the past weeks, Chainlink added new connections for services and projects on six major blockchains. The new batch of projects onboarded by Chainlink includes mostly DeFi and FinTech hubs, but also two new tokenized Web3 games. Chainlink also communicates directly with developers, offering testing and implementation tools. Unfortunately, the space has drawn scammers with fake platforms Chainlink Focuses on Tokenization InfrastructureChainlink offers scalable solutions for new tokenization, especially following the trend of real-world assets (RWA). A growing list of projects is already using Chainlink to generate valuable tokens connected to real-world assets or economic activity. The RWA trend expands ChainLink integrations, which are now more than 2,500, linked to 140 prominent projects in crypto space. Chainlink Labs, the development company that is expanding its influence, is also expanding its team with new hires, showing a bullish trend for crypto builders. Based on GitHub commits, Chainlink is among the top 10 most active projects. Chainlink automates decisions in the expanding crypto infrastructure, eliminating the need for human involvement. Chainlink solves the problem of gas fees by selecting optimal conditions for transactions. Using oracles, projects can handle transaction traffic based on optimal gas fees at any given time. Chainlink is also an ambassador for the growth of blockchain projects and favors more lenient regulation. The project’s supporters also note that Chainlink has a real application and is not the source of limited price feeds, as previously accused. Demand for reliable data services is also high, with many projects trying to copy the Chainlink model. Its annual network fees, which reach $2, reveal Chainlink’s usage of $39M. The protocol itself has annual revenues above $630K. Chainlink still has a first-mover advantage when it comes to facilitating inter-chain connections. One of the trends for 2024 is to build more bridges, asset swaps, and cross-chain smart contracts. Chainlink has positioned itself to provide reliable data for all of those operations. Additionally, Chainlink has built its CCIP protocol, now open to developers for multi-chain tasks and projects. Chainlink easily connects some of the most widely used blockchains and offers tools and guidance to builders.One of the driving narratives for Chainlink will be its promise to connect mainstream and crypto-based finance. It is possible to test Chainlink connectivity to the existing SWIFT banking system. Tokenization drives from mainstream financial firms may increase the need for Chainlink services.Is Chainlink an Undervalued Project?Project growth for Chainlink has previously translated into a series of price booms. Currently, LINK trades around $13.60, while the community awaits a more significant breakout. After a successful bull market in the first quarter of 2024, Chainlink is now awaiting a new direction. Current market conditions are seen as a crossroads, either leading to a correction, or to a new altcoin bull market. LINK peaked at around $47 during the 2021 bull market, and only recovered to a peak of $20.70 in 2024. Currently, around 58% of the LINK supply is unlocked and in circulation, though only a small part of the free unlocked coins are traded each day. Around 7.23% of the supply is also locked for staking, valued at around $577M. Some of the tokens are needed for node operations, but all LINK is movable and not locked in a smart contract. Chainlink only distributed 35% of all tokens during its public sale, leaving a generous allocation for the team and future development.Despite this, LINK supporters see the asset as somewhat undervalued and poised for more accumulation.

Bitcoin’s market dominance drives Layer 2 popularity


Bitcoin (BTC) has been leading the crypto market rally since late September 2023, with its dominance rising steadily from around 40% in 2022 to over 50% by May 2024. 
This surge is largely attributed to the approval of Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, driving increased trading volume on platforms like Bybit.
Consequently, Bitcoin’s popularity is fueling interest in Layer 2 solutions aiming to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality for faster and cheaper transactions. 


Understanding Bitcoin Layer 2
Bitcoin Layer 2 refers to networks closely linked with Bitcoin, designed to improve its scalability, reduce transaction costs, and enable programmability. 
These networks operate separately but connect to Bitcoin through bridges or other solutions. 
The rise of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions gained traction in early 2024, particularly with the popularity of projects like Ordinals and Stacks, coinciding with Bitcoin’s outperformance compared to Ethereum (ETH) and other alternatives.
According to BTCL2.INFO, there are 74 Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, with significant growth in the past two quarters. 
These solutions fall into three categories:


State Channels, which offer faster transactions and reduced fees through separate channels between parties. Their limitations, however, include limited capacity and lack of smart contract capability;



Sidechains, or independent networks with their consensus algorithms, which bridge with the main network. Examples include Stacks and Rootstock;



Rollups, which nhance transaction processing by batching transactions off-chain. Notable examples include optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, with projects like Merlin Chain.

dApps built directly on the Bitcoin mainnet, like Mirror, Runes, and Ordinals, provide additional functionality such as staking and NFT creation.
Companig Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions
Rollups are seen as more advanced and are likely to dominate Bitcoin Layer 2 in the long term. They offer better scalability and efficiency compared to state channels and sidechains.
Layer 2 solutions face risks including security vulnerabilities and interoperability challenges, while state channels and sidechains have specific risks such as counterparty risk and reliance on validators.
Bitcoin’s mainnet limitations, such as lack of smart contract functionality, pose challenges to Layer 2 development. 
However, advancements in technologies like ZK-rollups provide opportunities for growth.
Bitcoin Layer 2 Wrap-up
Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions are expanding Bitcoin’s utility beyond its status as digital gold. 
While challenges exist, innovations like ZK-rollups and new projects are driving development. 
More importantly, the community’s willingness to embrace change and new technologies will shape the future of Bitcoin Layer 2.

GameStop Stock Surges Premarket as Keith Gill Returns to X After 3 Years - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Keith Gill, the enigmatic figure known as ‘Roaring Kitty’ on X (when it was formerly Twitter) and for running a Reddit account that was at the center of the GameStop short squeeze in 2021, has made a return to the social media platform X after a three-year hiatus. 



 



His reappearance has coincided with a substantial surge in GameStop’s (NYSE: GME) stock price, a reminder of the meme stock frenzy he was instrumental in sparking during the pandemic. The stock was up an impressive 16% in premarket trading at the time of writing, a clear sign of the impact of Gill’s return.



GameStop Stock Price Soars in Premarket Trading



Following Gill’s reemergence on social media, GameStop’s stock experienced a notable 22% increase in premarket trading. At the close of the market on Friday, the stock was trading at $17.46, down 3.05% from the previous day.



However, the premarket surge saw the stock climb to $20.36, representing a more than 16% rise from Friday’s closing price. At the time of writing, GameStop shares are trading at $20.35, gaining over 16% during the session.





Revisiting the GameStop Short Squeeze of 2021



In January 2021, GameStop was the center of a remarkable short squeeze that captured the financial world’s attention.



At the time, approximately 140% of the company’s public float was sold short, setting the stage for an unprecedented surge in stock prices as short sellers scrambled to cover their positions. Driven by the coordinated efforts of individual investors on the subreddit r/wallstreetbets, the squeeze propelled GameStop’s stock to a pre-market peak exceeding $500 per share in January 2021, a staggering 30-fold increase from its valuation at the beginning of the month.



The short squeeze had far-reaching consequences, significantly impacting hedge funds and other short sellers who had bet against the struggling video game retailer. The event highlighted the power of retail investors and the influence of social media in shaping market dynamics, challenging traditional assumptions about investing and the role of individual traders in the financial landscape.



The return of ‘Roaring Kitty’ has reignited interest in the meme stock phenomenon and raised questions about the potential for another wave of retail investor-driven market disruption.







Can we see another 2021 short squeeze play out in the near future? Let us know in the comments below.

Pudgy Penguins NFT Collection Dominates Toy Market with Over 1M Plush Toys Sold | Coinspeaker



The sales activity for the collection surged around mid-February, with the number of sales per day hitting 439.

Pudgy Penguins, a popular NFT collection created in 2021, has attained the top ten ranking in terms of volume traded. It has revealed that more than a million Pudgy Penguin plush toys have been sold over the past 12 months.
Expansion and Retail Partnerships
Prior to the sales milestone, the NFT project initially revealed its expansion plan on its X page, announcing that Pudgy Toys with Pudgy World are now available at Target, a retail shopping market. In a video released by the CEO Luca Netz on his X page, he revealed that the company’s plush toy sales have increased in the past year as it keeps expanding around the world.






Luca went further by also revealing plans for upcoming partnerships that will include reordering from retail organizations such as Walmart, corporations like Target, Smiths, and Hot Topic, and specialists in Asia and different countries. He further acknowledged that this surge in sales is his biggest consumer product success ever, stating:
“From a unit basis, that’s my biggest consumer product success ever.”
Furthermore, while still speaking about the milestones the NFT project has achieved in the short term in comparison with others in the space, the CEO mentioned that while other NFTs might be relying on future potential, Pudgy Penguins have already achieved success in real-time. He further mentioned that their project has managed to gain interest from major retailers, which indicates the current success of the project rather than potential future success. He said in the video:
“I have a lot of respect for what other people are doing in space…This is happening now, in real-time; the little guy was able to put this stuff in some of the world’s biggest retailers.”
Pudgy Penguins was acquired by Netz in 2022 after it experienced a rocky start following accusations that the founder was carrying out various rug-pull activities. Since then, the NFT project has continued to grow. The ecosystem now allows holders of NFTs to earn 5% revenue from sales of physical products featuring their unique Penguin.
Outperforming NFT Rivals
The sales activity for the collection surged around mid-February, with the number of sales per day hitting 439. During this period, the items were sold at an average price of 20 ETH. However, following that, the sales volume decreased to around 269 as of the May 6 report. One of the important factors that have boosted NFT sales on its platform is the plush line and announcement of a developing metaverse, which has caused the NFT project to rise above the Bored Ape Yacht Club in floor price earlier this year.
Currently, Pudgy Penguin is ranked 16th on CryptoSlam, an NFT sales trading platform, in the list of the top NFT collectible sales in the last 24 hours.

North Korean Hackers Scammed South Korean Crypto Firms


                                North Korean Hackers Target South Korean Crypto Firms with New Malware                                What’s the newsA North Korean Hacker group known as Kimsuky, has been using a new type of malicious software called "Durian" to attack cryptocurrency companies in South Korea. This Durian malware’s function resembles an installer and installs other powerful tools on the victimized machines. These tools include the backdoor called "Appleseed" and the proxy tool called LazyLoad.Appleseed gives hackers the privilege to remotely control the infected computers and also steal private information, while LazyLoad allows them to use tools that can help them hide their tracks. It is worthwhile to mention that LazyLoad which is used by another North Korean hacking group called Andariel has been used by a larger group called Lazarus. Since 2009, Lazarus has been notorious for its role in cryptocurrency thefts. On 29 April 2024, an independent blockchain Sleuth ZachXBT, who is not affiliated with any governmental organization revealed that Lazarus laundered over $200 million in stolen cryptocurrency between 2020 and 2023. Lazarus has been reported to have stolen approximately $3 billion worth of cryptocurrency in six years, with the largest amount being taken in 2023. They were the ones who were responsible for the stealing of 17% of all the stolen cryptocurrency funds in that year, which was over $309 million in 2023. On December 28, hackers exploited around $1.8 million worth of crypto which was lost as per the previous year's report.Malicious Software that Exploited Cryptocurrency FirmsDurian MalwareThis is a new type of software developed by the North Korean hacking group known as Kimsuky which is used to attack the South Korean targets. The sanctions are imposed on cryptocurrency companies located in South Korea. Durian is like a program that installs other harmful programs on the targeted computers. These tools include the backdoor "Appleseed", a custom proxy tool known as "LazyLoad" and other authorized tools such as "Chrome Remote Desktop".AppleseedThis is a backdoor installed by Durian malware. A backdoor is a hidden way into a computer system that allows hackers to get into this system without authorization. Through the Appleseed exploit, the hackers may be able to remotely control the infected computer, execute commands, download additional files, and steal confidential data. The hackers take over the machine and steal everything stored on it through Appleseed.LazyLoadLazyLoad is a tool that Durian malware installs as well. This is a custom proxy tool that hides the hacker's activities. Another hacking group known as Andariel was also using it as well as a part of the Lazarus Group which is much larger and more established. LazyLoad is a way for them to keep their activities away from the public eye.The impact of these malicious softwareThe fact that North Korean hackers have been using malware such as Durian, AppleSeed, and LazyLoad against South Korean cryptocurrency companies should be a cause for concern. These tools enable hackers to get into a system without authorization, steal confidential information, and cause monetary losses.Prevention from malicious softwareKeep all software and safety systems up-to-date.Employ strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.Do not click on those emails and links that are not trustworthy and unauthenticFrequently store critical information.Implement cybersecurity best practices through firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.ConclusionThe essentialities that Coin Gabbar has pointed out from the news is that the Durian malware and the connection of this malware to North Korean hacking groups like Kimsuky and Lazarus is proof of the ongoing cyber threat to these firms. It highlights the necessity of strong cybersecurity measures and intensive scrutiny to counter such attacks. These organizations need to have robust cybersecurity mechanisms and keep a close watch against them. Partnerships among cybersecurity firms, governments, and cryptocurrency companies are necessary to realize an efficient way of tackling these concerns.Also Read: Musk’s Deepfake Video Leads To Crypto Fraud In Hong Kong

Bitcoin Runes Activity Plummets after Generating $135M in Fees | Coinspeaker



Activities on the Runes protocol have “dropped dramatically”, hitting their lowest level since May 10.

The Bitcoin Runes protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform introduced on April 19 to provide a new way of creating fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, has seen a significant drop in activity despite a promising beginning.
Initially, on April 24, activity on the Bitcoin-based protocol surged, making up about 57% of all transactions recorded in the ecosystem after the 2024 halving event. The protocol’s impressive launch led to record fees for Bitcoin miners as eager investors competed for block space during the halving event.




In its first week alone, Runes generated approximately $107 million in transactions in a single day and $135 million in Bitcoin transactions on a weekly basis.  However, after weeks of attracting investor attention, the enthusiasm surrounding the protocol appears to have waned amidst the current market downturn.
Runes Protocol Faces Decline since May 10
According to on-chain data from crypto analytics firm Dune, activities on the Runes protocol have “dropped dramatically”, hitting their lowest level since May 10. This decline could be attributed to various factors, including fewer new mints and a decrease in new wallets interacting with the protocol since its April debut, reducing generated fees.
Since then, the protocol has continued to experience low engagement, reducing its market share of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Data from Dune shows that despite recording thousands of transactions daily, Runes has struggled to reach another $1 million milestone in daily transaction fees. In the past 12 days, the protocol has only surpassed $1 million in transaction fees twice.
The data also revealed a significant decrease in total Runes minted, dropping from 23,061 on April 26 to just 62 this month. Similarly, fees earned from Runes plummeted from a peak of $321,263 on April 26 to only $970.
Until May 5, the protocol accounted for less than 30% of all transactions on the Bitcoin network in terms of transaction volume. In contrast, last month was the peak period for the Runes network, with the protocol recording a substantial 77% and 69% of transaction volume on April 20 and April 23, respectively.
Runes NFT Collections Hit Over $100M  Market Caps
Despite the recent decrease in activity on the Runes network, the protocol continues to stand out, with various non-fungible token (NFT) collections on the platform already surpassing market caps exceeding $100 million.
According to data from Magic Eden, an NFT marketplace, some of the Runes collections, such as DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, PUBS.WORLD.PEACE, and EPIC.EPIC.EPIC has market capitalizations of $2.44 billion, $171.60 million, and  $37.78 million, respectively.
On May 11, Casey Rodarmor, the developer behind both Runes and Bitcoin Ordinals, hinted at a new NFT project during an event in Asia. The software engineer said he is working on a new audioreactive generative art project.

Notcoin Set to Debut on Wallet App, Offering New Opportunities for Users



Per the announcement, users can already select Wallet in the Notcoin app to claim NOT tokens.

Notcoin (NOT) is arguably the rave of the moment in the crypto space following a series of reports about several major exchanges getting set to support it once it goes live on May 16. Notable crypto exchanges that are ready to support the NOT token rollout include Binance, OKX, and Bybit, who have all announced their intent to ride with the relative newcomer.
Interestingly, the Notcoin team has just shared a new update with users as the cryptocurrency is set to make its debut on the Telegram Wallet app, opening up new possibilities for users.




Notcoin Integrates with Wallet App to Bring Convenience and Versatility to Users
With its integration scheduled for May 16, the Wallet users will immediately begin to have access to Notcoin. This is not only expected to help their various transactions but also enhance their overall digital asset experience.
According to an X post from the official  Wallet account, users can look forward to several exciting features upon Notcoin’s integration into its app. These include the ability to buy and sell NOT tokens on the P2P Market, exchange them for other cryptocurrencies such as TON, USDT, and BTC, and easily send Notcoin to Telegram contacts.
Furthermore, users may also use the NOT token for payments within Wallet Pay, adding an extra layer of convenience to their financial transactions.
Per the announcement, users can already select Wallet in the Notcoin app to claim NOT tokens. But while that sets the stage for a smooth transition, it’s important to note that NOT tokens will only officially appear in users’ wallets on May 16. Even then, users will likely be required to verify their identity to mitigate fraud and ensure security and compliance.
Notably, this collaboration is a two-edged sword that benefits both Notcoin and the Wallet app. It affords Wallet the opportunity to expand its digital asset offerings. For Notcoin, leveraging Telegram’s user base of over 900 million individuals is nothing but a strategic entry into the crypto space.
As anticipation builds for the launch of Notcoin on Wallet, Coinspeaker will be covering any updates and announcements regarding the integration process. One key takeaway, however, is that Notcoin appears to be ready to make its debut on the crypto scene with a bang.

Bitcoin (BTC) Fails to Hold $63K, May Remain Range-Bound

Bitcoin (BTC) rose during the European morning on Monday, peaking at around $63,200, before retreating below $62,800. BTC may be again trying to rally above $64,000, of which there have been numerous instances this month, all of which have been sold off. This behavior, along with transaction numbers plummeting, points toward a consolidation in the market and the possibility of bitcoin being range-bound for the time being. At the time of writing, bitcoin is 2.34% higher in the last 24 hours at $62,543. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which measures the broader digital market, has added 1.1%, with the likes of ETH and SOL showing more modest gains, trading just below $3,000 and $150 respectively.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino defends USDt compliance record in wake of Ripple CEO's comments

Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, has responded to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse‘s claims that the US government was targeting the company, the issuer of the largest stablecoin USDt.During the weekend, reports emerged that Garlinghouse had suggested that a US government’s scrutiny of Tether could significantly affect the crypto industry. Garlinghouse said:“The US Government is going after Tether. That is clear to me. I view Tether as a very important part of the ecosystem and I don’t know how to predict the impact it would have on the rest of the ecosystem.”Tether’s responseIn an extensive May 13 social media post, Ardoino dispelled concerns about potential regulatory action against Tether and accused Garlinghouse of sowing “fear about USDT.” He said:“An uniformed CEO, leading a company being investigated by the SEC, launching a competitive stablecoin (cui prodest), is being reported spreading fear about USDt.”Ardoino asserted that Tether’s ecosystem remains robust and secure, emphasizing its price stability, ample liquid reserves, top-tier custodianship, and rigorous compliance measures. He added:“USDt is the most used stablecoin in the world, with hundreds of millions of users across primarily emerging markets and developing countries. Entire communities across these regions are unbanked, left behind by the traditional banking system because they are too poor to be of interest, and are using USDt daily as their checking and saving account.”Furthermore, the Tether CEO enumerated various factors contributing to USDt’s compliance and adoption worldwide.Ardoino disclosed that Tether has voluntarily honored 198 requests from law enforcement agencies to freeze wallets in the past year, 90 of which originated from the US. Over the last three years, Tether has complied with 339 such requests, with 158 coming from US law enforcement.Moreover, he pointed out that the firm has collaborated with 124 law enforcement agencies across more than 40 countries and has frozen over $1.3 billion in assets associated with fraudulent activities, hacks, and money laundering.Notably, a significant portion—over $639 million—was blocked in collaboration with US law enforcement agencies.Ardoino concluded his statement by saying:“Tether cooperates directly with law enforcement agencies, while other stablecoins, although they claim to be “more compliant” they require a judge order, allowing hackers, scammers and criminals a long time to move funds around.”Mentioned in this article

Solana's 23M token move raises eyebrows: Where to, SOL? - AMBCrypto



Data showed that participants are HODLing, but SOL fell by 6.16%.
An increase in volume with the current price trend could lead the token to $129.

On the 13th of May, 23 million Solana [SOL] was sent to undisclosed wallets, according to data from Whale Alert. From the post shared, the first transaction was worth $1.58 billion.
The second one, suspected to be the same participants, sent another 11 million tokens, valued around the same price, to another wallet.
Three hours later, another large transaction occurred. This time, it was 1 million SOL that was transferred.
One thing AMBCrypto noticed was that none of the transactions went into exchanges. If the tokens had gone into exchanges, it would have prompted the notion that they were for sale.
Source: X
$129 or $155? Where is the next target?
In this case, SOL’s price might have recorded a notable decline. Nonetheless, the performance of the token was not any better. At press time, the price of SOL was $140.
This value was a 6.16% decrease in the 24 hours, indicating the supposed HODLing strategy could not liberate the cryptocurrency from another downfall.
Where the Solana native token would head next could be a concern for both long-term investors and traders. As such, AMBCrypto analyzed the potential direction.
The first metric considered was Solana’s on-chain volume. Volume shows (in monetary terms) how much crypto has been traded over some time.
For SOL, Santiment’s data showed that the volume was $1.44 billion, which was an increase from the figure on the 12th of May. Rising volume while the price decreases might be good news for bears.
Source: Santiment
This is because the hike in the metric might offer strength to the downside. Therefore, if the value continues to increase, then SOL’s price could continue to fall.
As such, a decrease to $129 could be the next plausible target.
On the other hand, a reversal to the upside might change the direction. If this happens and the volume hits new peaks, the price of SOL could attempt to reach $155.
Bears are getting less confident
In terms of the perception the market has about SOL, AMBCrypto looked at the Weighted Sentiment. At press time, the Weighted Sentiment was negative, suggesting an increase in gloomy remarks.
However, one notable observation was that the sentiment was improving. Should this metric continue to rise, demand for SOL might increase.
An increase in demand could invalidate the bearish prediction to $129. Instead, a rise to $155 could be next for Solana. Furthermore, the total Open Interest (OI) was starting to increase.
Source: Santiment
As of this writing, the OI was $1.46 billion. OI increases or decreases depending on net positioning. In this case, buyers are getting more aggressive than sellers.

Read Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-2025

If sustained, this increase could lead to a SOL breakout. However, the interest did not seem large enough to confirm the pump into the overhead resistance.
As such, SOL might not be able to surge higher than $155 in the short term.

Parity Wallet Hacker Moves $9 Million in Ethereum, Leaving $246 Million in Limbo


In a development echoing one of the largest crypto heists in history, Cyvers Alerts has reported that a hacker, who exploited a vulnerability in Parity's multi-signature wallet in 2017, has now moved a substantial sum of Ethereum (ETH). The hacker, responsible for the theft of 150,000 ETH, valued at $30 million at the time, has initiated the laundering of a portion of their loot, transferring 3,050 ETH, equivalent to $9 million, through the eXch platform.This marks a significant chapter in the saga, underscoring the enduring impact of cyber breaches in the digital asset realm. Cyvers Alerts took to X to highlight the unfolding events, reminding followers of the 2017 incident that shook the crypto community. The vulnerability in Parity's Multisig Wallet version 1.5+ had allowed the perpetrator to abscond with a staggering amount of Ethereum, causing substantial financial losses. The latest maneuver by the hacker underscores a strategic and patient approach to their illicit activities. By utilizing eXch and consolidating multiple addresses under "0x5167052b," they have successfully laundered a portion of the stolen funds. However, what's more concerning is the sizable sum still under their control. With 83,017 ETH, valued at a staggering $246.6 million, remaining untouched at the primary address "0xb3764761," the hacker retains significant leverage within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Ongoing threatThis recent activity reignites discussions surrounding security measures within the crypto space and the persistent threat posed by vulnerabilities in blockchain platforms. Despite efforts to enhance security protocols and mitigate risks, incidents like the Parity Wallet breach are stark reminders of the ever-present danger of cyber attacks.As stakeholders assess the implications of this latest development, attention turns to broader implications for investor confidence and regulatory oversight within the crypto market. The ability of hackers to exploit weaknesses in infrastructure and maneuver substantial sums of digital assets shows the need for continued vigilance and collaboration within the industry to safeguard against such threats.

Legend Biotech Reports Q1: EPS Beat, Miss on Revenue with $93.99 M - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ: LEGN) has unveiled its financial outcomes and corporate milestones for the first quarter of 2024, showcasing significant advancements and strategic achievements.



The company’s performance this quarter underscores its leadership in developing innovative treatments for life-threatening diseases, mainly through its flagship product, CARVYKTI, which has seen remarkable net trade sales.



In the first quarter of 2024, Legend Biotech reported impressive CARVYKTI net trade sales amounting to approximately $157 million. This achievement is further accentuated by the regulatory nods received from the EC and US FDA for CARVYKTI label expansion, enabling its use in earlier lines of treatment for adult patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma.



Additionally, the company’s strategic collaboration with Johnson & Johnson, culminating in a Master Manufacturing and Supply Services Agreement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, indicates a robust commitment to enhancing CARVYKTI’s manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. With a cash reserve of $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, Legend Biotech is well-positioned for sustained growth and innovation.



Legend Biotech Posts Narrower Loss than Expected, Falls Short on Revenue for Q1



Comparing the first quarter’s performance against expectations, Legend Biotech has underperformed in the first quarter. Analysts had projected an EPS of -$0.19 and revenue of $143.81 million for the quarter. While the firm’s revenue growth was impressive, it still fell short of expectations, with a reported loss of $0.16 per share and revenues of $93.99 million for the quarter.





LEGN Plans to Reach a Goal of 10,000 Annual Doses of CARVYKTI By End of 2025



Looking ahead, Legend Biotech has provided optimistic guidance for the upcoming periods. The company’s financial runway, bolstered by a strong cash position, is expected to support its operations well into 2026, at which point Legend Biotech anticipates achieving an operating profit.



The planned increase in manufacturing capacity to reach a goal of 10,000 annual doses of CARVYKTI by the end of 2025 demonstrates the company’s commitment to meeting the growing demand for its therapies. Moreover, the recent regulatory approvals and label expansions for CARVYKTI in various global markets set the stage for increased adoption and broader patient access to this transformative therapy.

Bonk Price Prediction as Meme Coins Bounce After Sell Off - Is Now the Time to Buy?

                        The Bonk price has crept up by 0.7% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.00002312 while the market as a whole posts a 2.5% gain today.This move doesn’t do enough to clear BONK’s 16% loss in a week, although the Solana-based meme token remains up by 35% in the last 30 days.Even more impressively, the coin has also gained by a whopping 5,400% in the past year, making it one of the best-performing top-100 tokens over this period.And with BONK still in oversold territory for the past week, it could rally again very soon.Bonk Price Prediction as Meme Coins Bounce After Sell-Off – Is Now the Time to Buy?
BONK’s chart is showing signs of recovery, and what’s particularly bullish is that this recovery has only just begun, meaning that more gains are in store in the near term.Its 30-day average (orange) has only just begun rising again for example, meaning that the coin’s price has plenty of time left to rise before the 30-day overtakes the 200-day (blue) and rises significantly above.Source: TradingViewAt the same time, BONK’s relative strength index (purple) has risen from just under 30 very early this morning to around 60 as of writing, signaling a strong surge in buying pressure and momentum.Such momentum should carry the meme token for several more days yet, with the coin’s volume only just beginning to recover.Also bullish is the fact that the coin’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are honing in on each other, implying that the price is likely to be squeezed suddenly in either direction.Given that BONK has spent more than a week declining, it’s likelier that a big move will be more towards higher levels.BONK is likely to rise in step with the wider market, which after a difficult couple of months (relative to the highs of early March) is looking ready to return to growth.Such growth will speed up once financial markets gain a strong suspicion that the Fed will cut interest rates, which have so far remained at high levels this year.More generally, Bonk’s particular situation looks good insofar as it’s a rare example of a deflationary meme token, with its developers famously burning their entire allocation – some 5 trillion tokens – back in January 2023.Based on its tokenomics and general momentum, we can expect the Bonk price to reach $0.000030 by the end of the summer.Big Gains with New Meme Tokens
BONK is likely to remain one of the best-performing major meme coins for the foreseeable future, yet it may not be one of the best-performing if you also include newer coins.Certain new meme tokens have appeared in the past few weeks, including a wide variety of presale tokens that have been gaining plenty of momentum as they get ready to list.One of the best of these is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme coin which has raised just more than $500,000 in its increasingly popular token offering.That SEAL’s presale has crossed the $500,000 barrier is highly encouraging, with the offering having been open for only a few weeks.Investors are clearly interested in the possibility that it could become the latest Solana meme token to outperform much of the market once it lists, following in the footsteps of BONK and WIF.Also bullish is the fact that it will now be a multi-chain meme coin, with the token also launching an ERC-20 version.Interested parties can join in by going to the official Sealana website, where they can send SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.SEAL is available at an exchange rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which roughly equals $0.021.VIDEOThis is likely to prove a bargain, at least when judging by other meme token launches this year.And with its quirky meme mascot and memorable marketing, SEAL looks ready to take its place among the more successful launches.Buy SEAL Today

Machine learning algorithm predicts XRP price on May 31, 2024


As the long-standing legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs appears to be entering its final chapter, interest in and hopes about XRP are again mounting.
Indeed, there is widespread belief that the conclusion of the case – which has been weighing heavily on the token for years and has, arguably, prevented it from following the rest of the crypto market in its 2024 rally – investors are turning toward hopes that XRP might soon surge toward $0.62 and beyond – heights seen only briefly in mid-March.
Still, with uncertainty persisting for the time being with XRP battling to hold above $0.50, Finbold decided to seek at least some clarity by looking at the cryptocurrency forecasts offered by the AI-driven machine learning algorithms of a platform specilized in making asset price predictions – PricePredictions.


Predictive algorithms set XRP price for the end of May
While crypto traders are holding on to optimism, PricePredictions’ algorithms have little good news for the bulls. 
Indeed, while the platform estimates that the token has left its highly volatile days behind for the time being, the looming trend is predicted to be bearish.
Per the data retrieved on May 13, the algorithm’s forecast XRP is set for a slight but protracted decline – with limited and largely inconsequential volatility – that will see the token drop to $0.487329 by the end of the month.
XRP price forecast for May 31. Source: PricePredictions
Given that XRP price today stands at $0.505731, the platform is forecasting a 3.637% drop over the course of two and a half weeks.
Crypto experts see bigger moves ahead
Experts, however, apparently largely disagree with the algorithm’s prediction, with a prominent XRP analyst known on X as Dark Defender recently explaining that while the current situation remains challenging, the price targets for the upcoming supercycle waves run high at $1.88, $5.85 and $18.22.

1. Wave 1 started in Jan-23 @ $0.3000
2. Wave 1 ended in Jul-23 @ $0.9327
3. Wave 2 started in Aug-23 @$0.8534
4. Wave 2 ended in Apr-24 @$0.4294
5. Wave 3 targets $1.88, $5.85 and $18.22

Dark Defender also clarified that the listed targets are for the ongoing supercycle while the general ‘gigacycle’ will see the token surge even higher with one post indicating that the ultimate price target stands at $333 on the low end.
The XRP expert, in a separate post, also outlined the token’s 9-phase likely journey to new and unprecedented highs. 
These include an ultimate decision in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle, the arrival of the company’s stablecoin, developments such as Blackrock’s Larry Fink recently saying that tokenization will be ‘the next generation for markets,’ all leading up to XRP in ‘in Grand Wave 3.’
It is worth noting, however, that the journey also assumes a definitive decision that XRP is not a security – a decision that is not certain, at the time of publication.
Around the same time, another expert, Matthew Dixon, CEO of the crypto rating platform Evai, pointed toward another factor that might see XRP surge.

According to Dixon, the CPI report – scheduled for the ongoing May 13 to May 20 week – could also propel the token provided the figures are weaker than expected. 
While refraining from offering a price target, the analyst’s description of XRP as a ‘sleeping giant’ offers a strong bullish hint.

'Dogecoin Killer' Shiba Inu Pushes Mainstream Adoption And Is On The Verge Of '4X Breakout', Says Trader - Benzinga

Shiba Inu SHIB/USD is seeing fundamental developments that might lead to a potential price breakout.What Happened: Crypto trader Javon Marks foresees Shiba Inu reaching and surpassing its all-time high of $0.000088598, which would imply a price appreciation of over 282% from current levels. He suggests that the meme coin is currently in an "intermission" phase before continuing its upward trajectory.Marks draw sparallels to Shiba Inu’s previous breakout and run to its ATH, noting that the current price action appears to be setting up a massive bull flag pattern. This pattern, coupled with the confirmation of multiple hidden bullish divergences, indicates underlying strength in the existing uptrend."With this uptrend being such a significant one, with Shiba Inu making an over +810% move since mid-2023, another near 4X that these breakout(s), indications, and patterns can be calling for may just be more than feasible in these prices and could come in quickly!" Marks enthuses.Lithuania-based CoinGate, a Bitcoin and crypto payment gateway and processor, announced over the weekend that it added Shiba Inu support for Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. According to the tweet, SHIB can be used to book Airbnbs, grab the latest games from Steam & PS5 and purchase from Nike & Zalando.Price Action: In the past 24 hours, SHIB is trading 3.3% higher at $0.00002328. Since June 2023, Shiba Inu has managed to erase one zero from its price.Also Read: ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Shiba Inu Burn Rate Spikes Almost 400%, Marketing Lead Points Out ‘3x On SHIB’ If You Purchased Last YearWhy It Matters: The Data Nerd revealed a whale depositing 100 billion SHIB, worth $24 million, to Coinbase.

The presence of hidden bullish divergences, which occur when the price makes a higher low while the oscillator makes a lower low, further reinforces the notion of underlying strength in the uptrend.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: What Does Technical Analysis Say About Dogecoin And Shiba Inu?This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Is it good or bad that Bitcoin Price has been moving sideways for a while? Bernstein Analysts Announced! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While Bitcoin rose above $ 63,000 again during the day, it has generally exhibited horizontal movements lately.
At this point, Bernstein analysts argued that these horizontal and straight movements of BTC could be good for miners.


According to The Block, Bernstein analysts claimed that horizontal movements in BTC could be good for miners in this period when the economy is driven by the competitive hash rate.
Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra said in a note to clients today:






“Bitcoin price is trending sideways, but we are not afraid of a big drop here.
Here we expect Bitcoin to remain in a range and continue its upward adoption trajectory as Bitcoin ETFs see allocation from RIAs, asset platforms, and other institutional funds.
Overall, a temporary pause in Bitcoin price is actually good for existing low-cost Bitcoin miners, as hash rates remain limited and strong miners can implement aggressive capex and merger and acquisition plans to grow market share.
“When the Bitcoin price increases following horizontal movements, miners can earn higher income through higher production.”

As is known, Bernstein analysts stated in a report published last week that they expected $ 150,000 in this cycle and that they were insistent on their predictions and that Bitcoin would continue its rise.

Will Positive CPI Data Catapult Bitcoin to $72K?


							

Bitcoin maintains a steady $61K, with XRP and Solana taking 5% weekly losses.



Upcoming U.S. economic events, including PPI and CPI, are poised to influence crypto market trends.



Market commentators expect positive CPI data to send Bitcoin to $72K.




The crypto markets have been stagnant since last week. Bitcoin, for instance, has been maintaining a steady position around the $61K price level, often experiencing price declines in the past week. Bitcoin’s subdued performance is also reflected in the broader market sphere. Altcoins like XRP and Solana are registering over 5% losses in their weekly performance. 



Now, crypto investors are turning their attention to this week’s U.S. economic calendar, which is packed with events that could significantly sway the markets. The widely followed X account “The Kobeissi Letter” recently compiled the economic events expected to unfold this week.







One of the key inflation reports on the horizon is the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI), slated for release on Tuesday. This report is crucial as it provides insights into the input costs for producers and manufacturers, which is a direct precursor to consumer pricing. The PPI is often seen as an announcer of inflationary trends.



Meanwhile, insights into April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be unveiled on Wednesday. The Kobeissi Letter noted that if CPI inflation rises again this week, it would be the third consecutive monthly increase. 









Recently, a Conference Board survey revealed that a majority of U.S. CEOs anticipate only a single rate cut by the Fed this year. Of 136 CEOs surveyed, 31% expect no rate cuts, while 26% foresee two. 



The Kobeissi Letter observed that market expectations have settled on two rate cuts for the year, with the first anticipated in September. Meanwhile, the commentary highlighted the market’s fluctuating expectations. It noted that predictions have swung from six rate cuts to one and then back to two, all within four months.As the financial markets await vital events in the U.S. this week, the cryptocurrency market is exhibiting modest signs of recovery. At press time, Bitcoin has risen by 1%, with other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum also posting slight gains. Market commentators expect positive CPI data to send Bitcoin within the $67K and $72K range.

Tether Attacks Ripple CEO Over USDt FUD, Calls Him “Uninformed CEO”


							

Tether CEO refutes Ripple CEO’s claims of USDt being targeted by U.S.



Tether defends USDt’s role as a stablecoin for the unbanked and highlights its security measures.



Also, the CEO accused the media of bias, outlining Tether’s cooperation with law enforcement.




Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of prominent stablecoin issuer Tether (USDt), has fired back at the critical remarks of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. For context, Garlinghouse recently asserted that the U.S. government is targeting Tether. 



Garlinghouse expressed that while he considers USDt a significant player in the crypto scene, he doubts its future impact on the crypto landscape due to the supposed investigation he hinted at.



Ardoino, in his response on platform X, directly referred to Garlinghouse as an “uninformed CEO” of a company currently dealing with its own legal issues with the U.S. SEC. He accused Garlinghouse of spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about USDt, particularly as Ripple is preparing to launch its own stablecoin.



Accordingly, Ardoino presented some details regarding the security of the Tether USDt ecosystem.







Tether’s CEO defended USDt against skepticism by highlighting its role as the most utilized stablecoin globally, particularly in emerging markets and developing countries. According to him, USDt serves as a de facto checking and savings account for many unbanked communities.



Furthermore, Ardoino emphasized Tether’s commitment to fostering a secure global financial system that is accessible to all. He outlined vital attributes for stablecoin adoption: price stability, liquid reserves, reputable custodians, and strict compliance—all of which he asserts USDt consistently demonstrates.



Meanwhile, Ardoino claimed that despite his efforts to communicate these points through interviews, mainstream media has been reluctant to report on such positive aspects. He suggested that the media’s preference for sensationalism against stablecoin and cryptocurrencies might be an attempt to safeguard the interests of the established financial sector.









Furthermore, the CEO highlighted that the company respects and complies with OFAC/SDN lists. Ardoino added that Tether has collaborated with 124 law enforcement agencies from over 40 countries, blocking over $1.3 billion related to illicit activities, including $1.6 million tied to terrorism.



Moreover, he claimed Tether has responded to 198 law enforcement requests to block wallets in the past year, with 90 from U.S. agencies and 339 over three years, with 158 from U.S. agencies.

Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Slip On Regulatory Banana Skins - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced net outflows on Friday, highlighting some investor caution amid ongoing price volatility.What Happened: According to data from SoSoValue, total net outflows for Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $84.6581 million on May 10.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC alone saw an outflow of $103 million, highlighting a cautious or bearish sentiment among investors.Conversely, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust  IBIT and Fidelity’s Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC reported inflows of $12.4363 million and $5.3039 million, respectively.This mixed flow indicates a divergence in investor confidence across different funds, which could be attributed to the varied strategies and market perceptions surrounding each ETF.The outflows from GBTC, in particular, are significant as they contribute to a broader discussion on the health and stability of the cryptocurrency market. According to data from HODL15Capital, as of May 10, global Bitcoin ETFs held 949,756 Bitcoin BTC/USD, representing 4.5% of the total Bitcoin supply.Interestingly, while most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated an additional 1,318 bitcoin this week, GBTC stood out as the sole fund experiencing outflows.Also Read: Decoding Donald Trump’s Crypto GambitWhy It Matters: The timing of these flows is crucial as they come amid growing regulatory scrutiny.Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to reject an Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETF on May 23, with approval not anticipated until potentially the end of 2025.Such decisions are pivotal, as they reflect the SEC’s ongoing cautious stance under Chair Gary Gensler's leadership concerning cryptocurrency products.The potential regulatory shifts could be influenced by the upcoming U.S. presidential elections. Balchunas speculated that a win by Donald Trump could lead to a leadership change at the SEC, potentially ushering in a more crypto-friendly administration than Gensler’s.

According to local sources, the yen’s drop in value over the past three years came mainly from the gap between domestic and foreign interest rates and a growing trade deficit.Magazine: SEC, Ripple case nears conclusion, Grayscale withdraws ETF filing, and more: Hodler’s Digest, May 5-11

XRP Dips 2%+ As SEC Lawsuit Nears Final Judgment


							

A prominent XRP whale transferred 30 million tokens to an exchange.



The digital asset lost crucial support at the $0.5 price level.



The RSI indicator shows that the selling pressure is quite high in the market.




The protracted legal tussle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is nearing its final judgment as the two parties have submitted their briefs. Though the community anticipates a significant uptick in XRP’s price following the case settlement, the token is currently moving in a downward trend.



The legal issues surrounding Ripple and XRP can be traced back to the lawsuit filed by the SEC alleging the sale of unregistered securities. Following a series of developments, Judge Analisa Torres ruled XRP a non-security, securing a landmark victory for the crypto platform.



Nearing the lawsuit’s conclusion, Ripple and XRP filed their respective briefs in court. In the SEC’s response to the remedies brief, the regulators argued against Ripple’s statement regarding the certainty of XRP as a non-security. While the SEC demanded $2 billion in a settlement, Ripple claimed that the platform would not pay more than $10 million.









At present, XRP’s price is set at $0.4949, marking a marginal dip of 2.27% in one day. Over the last 7 days, XRP has seen a more significant decline of 7% while exhibiting a notable 9% downturn in one month.



Analysts anticipate a significant upturn in XRP’s price, poised to reach a new all-time high this year. For instance, JackTheRippler, a prominent figure, predicted a ground-breaking rise in XRP’s value in 2024 following the upcoming developments in the ecosystem. The major events include the final judgment in the lawsuit, XRP’s bank integration, Ripple IPO, and the potential XRP ETF launch.Another prominent analyst, KingXRP, hinted at the significant appreciation in XRP’s price following these events. According to KingXRP’s predictions, XRP is poised to reach $18.57 with the final judgment in the lawsuit.

D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS) Reports 56% Revenue Increase in Q1 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS), a trailblazer in the realm of commercial quantum computing systems, software, and services, has recently unveiled its financial outcomes for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024, which concluded on March 31, 2024.



The company has reported a significant year-over-year revenue, bookings, and gross profit increase, showcasing its strong performance and growing customer demand for its quantum and hybrid quantum solutions.



Specifically, D-Wave announced a 56% increase in its Q1 revenue, a 54% increase in Q1 bookings, and a staggering 294% increase in gross profit compared to the same period last year. These figures highlight D-Wave’s solid financial health and reflect the successful implementation of its strategic initiatives and the increasing adoption of its quantum computing technologies across various industries.



Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, attributed this remarkable performance to the company’s continuous innovation and technical advancements, including introducing the Advantage2 prototype and the new fast-anneal feature. These developments have significantly enhanced the speed and efficiency of quantum computations, further solidifying D-Wave’s position as a leader in the commercialization of quantum computing. Additionally, the company’s renewed partnership with the University of Southern California and its engagement in various quantum-powered optimization applications across different sectors underscore D-Wave’s commitment to driving measurable impact through its technology.



D-Wave Misses on EPS Forecast in Q1



Comparing D-Wave’s first-quarter performance against market expectations reveals a narrative of notable accomplishments and positive surprises. Analysts had projected an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.07 and revenue expectations of $3.03 million for the quarter. D-Wave slightly missed the revenue forecast with a reported $2.46 million and the EPS expectation with its reported $0.11 loss per share.



The company’s ability to maintain a consistent upward trend in bookings, now for the eighth consecutive quarter, alongside a significant reduction in net loss compared to the previous year, indicates a strong and improving operational efficiency.





D-Wave Reiterates Full Year 2024 Guidance



Looking ahead, D-Wave has reiterated its full-year 2024 financial guidance, which was initially set forth in its fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings press release.



The company remains optimistic about its future performance, expecting the fiscal 2024 Adjusted EBITDA Loss to be less than the fiscal 2023 Adjusted EBITDA Loss of $54.3 million. This guidance reflects D-Wave’s confidence in its strategic direction, ongoing product innovation, and market expansion efforts. Furthermore, the effective registration of D-Wave’s $175 million shelf registration statement and its Equity Line of Credit (ELOC) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, highlight the company’s strong liquidity position and its ability to raise additional funds to support future growth initiatives.

Bitpanda launches the Meme Coin Leaders Index to diversify the crypto-wallet

Bitpanda has formed a new partnership with MarketVector Indexes and has launched the new Meme Coin Leaders Index, to help investors diversify their crypto-wallets. To start, the index will contain top memecoins such as PEPE, FLOKI, WIF, BONK, DOGE, and SHIB. 

Bitpanda and the new Meme Coin Leaders Index: the tool to diversify your crypto-wallet
The famous European crypto broker, Bitpanda, has announced the launch of its new Meme Coin Leaders Index, with the aim of helping investors diversify their crypto portfolios. 

“Meme coins have become a staple in our industry, as they combine carefree fun with explosive growth potential. With the Bitpanda Meme Coin Leaders Index, it is now possible to get exposure to the best meme coins in circulation, with the same worry-free rebalancing package you know and love. BCIMEME includes: @dogecoin, @pepe, @RealFlokiInu, @Shibtoken, @dogwifcoin and @bonk_inu”
Basically, through the Meme Coin Leaders Index (BCI MEME), instead of choosing individual cryptocurrencies, users can invest in all included cryptos with just one click. 
The BCI MEME was created with the support of MarketVector Indexes, and extends the wide range of Bitpanda Crypto Index (BCI).
Currently, the new Meme Coin Leaders Index (BCI MEME) will contain the top six memecoins by market capitalization. These are: Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), PEPE, Dogwifhat (WIF), FLOKI, and BONK. 
Every month, when the market changes, the Index automatically adjusts the portfolio composition in a process called “rebalancing”. 
Bitpanda and its Meme Coin Leaders Index for investors who love fun cryptocurrencies
The new Meme Coin Leaders Index by Bitpanda aims to consider and highlight the category of fun cryptocurrencies. 
In this regard, Eric Demuth, co-founder and CEO of Bitpanda, commented as follows:
“Our range of Index products has just become larger on Bitpanda! Meme coins are a huge part of cryptocurrency culture and the demand from our users to have an easy way to invest in them has been huge. We listened and delivered. For all investors who love cryptocurrencies, dogs, and memes – such an index, much wow”.
The BCI Meme Coin Leaders index will be part of the popular BCI range from Bitpanda, originally launched in 2020 as the first true range of cryptocurrency indices. 
In fact, the BCI 5/10/25 are already available, which track the top 5, 10, and 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and specialized indices that give investors access to DeFi, Infrastructure, Smart Contracts, and Media & Entertainment. 
The BCI Meme Coin Leaders Index is the latest way Bitpanda makes investing in cryptocurrencies safe and easy.
Memecoin in red over the last seven days
Looking at the price trend of the crypto category “memecoin”, it seems that in the last seven days, there has been a noticeable red dump.
And indeed, starting from DOGE, the meme crypto with the largest market cap at $20.6 billion, the price has dropped by 11% in the last week. 
Even WIF, FLOKI, and BONK are in a price dump in the last seven days of 10-16%. The price dump of SHIB and PEPE, on the other hand, is milder and therefore below 10%. 
This general price decline has been justified as a change in interest by crypto traders who, at the moment, seem to be more focused on more established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Metaplanet Sets Up “Bitcoin First Bitcoin Only” Treasury Plan - DailyCoin


        

Metaplanet has announced an overhaul of its treasury management strategy.



The company incorporated a crypto asset into the strategy.



The company has started acquiring the crypto asset and plans to “continue accumulating.”




Early-stage investment firm Metaplanet has adopted Bitcoin (BTC) as its “strategic treasury reserve asset,” the company announced on Monday.



The company said the move to overhaul its treasury management strategy was a direct response to sustained economic pressures in Japan, notably a volatile yen, high government debt levels, and prolonged periods of negative real interest rates.



A “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only Approach”



According to a press release dated March 13, Metaplanet’s latest pivot prioritizes a “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only approach” for the company. The company plans to leverage long-dated yen liabilities and periodic share issuances to “continually accumulate more BTC instead of retaining the ever-weaker yen.”




“Metaplanet views bitcoin as fundamentally superior to any and all other forms of political currency, traditional stores of value and investment, and all other crypto-assets/securities. Bitcoin is an absolutely scarce digital synthetic monetary commodity, with no central issuer,” the company stated.



The company lauded Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, noting that it was not a liability but a “profound asset” that presented a programmatically rising marginal cost of production for the remaining 1.3 million BTC yet to enter circulation.



“This is one of the many features setting bitcoin the monetary commodity apart from its predecessors, whereas traditional commodities face headwinds in the form of increasing supply as investment is made into additional production.” The statement read.



Metaplanet’s move seems to embody the strategy employed by U.S.-listed MicroStrategy, which has since amassed 1% of the entire BTC supply following its latest acquisition of 9,254 BTC in March. As for Metaplanet, the company has reportedly acquired 117.7 BTC ($7.19 million) since April.

The Sandbox Metaverse Opens a New Reward Period with 300K SAND Tokens Set Aside | Cryptopolitan

The Sandbox has not stopped working to become the leading metaverse project. Backed by a solid game studio, it has become one of the leading blockchain projects, boosting token adoption and multiple NFT collections. The Sandbox launched another reward period, setting aside 300k SAND tokens. The Sandbox Metaverse also supports growth with a new game generator. Most of the big land plots also boost Web3 and blockchain brands. Additionally, The Sandbox organizes mini-challenges with 100 SAND rewards for using its game generator tool. About a month ago, The Sandbox introduced its newest game-making tool. The metaverse platform also relies on special events, meetups, and themed NFT collections to drive engagement. The Sandbox bridges the gap between mainstream gaming and Web3. Most NFT, avatars, and Sandbox projects aim to popularize digital ownership with a lower risk of speculation or rug pulls. For that reason, even Ubisoft chose The Sandbox for a recent collection launch. Early owners of The Sandbox assets will receive exclusive access to Ubisoft’s new metaverse experience, ChampionsVerse. The NFT will be free and not go through the usual minting and bidding process. The Sandbox Still Offers Top Virtual WorldsThe Sandbox is ranked 128 among Web3 games, with versions on Ethereum and Polygon. Currently, daily active players are in the dozens or hundreds, far from peak activity during the 2021 NFT and gaming boom. Despite this, The Sandbox retains value, trading NFT at around $390 floor price. The project has created multiple scarce items, including skins and decorations, which are used within its metaverse locations. SAND Token Trades Under $0.50The native token of SAND is still among top gaming assets, despite trading at around $0.42 in May. SAND peaked above $7.50 during the best times for metaverse games in 2021. The Sandbox remained close to Axie Infinity in terms of market capitalization, with a valuation of $983M. SAND tokens almost evened out with their competitor, Decentraland (MANA), another metaverse hangout. MANA traded at around $0.41.SAND remains a high-profile token, mostly due to its social media activity and engagement through metaverse events. SAND is now actively used for rewards, as an addition to the free NFT, and there are no concerted efforts to pump the token. Trading volumes have leveled out at around $55M in 24 hours, boosted by Binance, Upbit and HTX trading.Gaming tokens as a whole are consolidating, with no breakouts seen recently. Currently, SAND is under its 100-day moving average, and sees some accumulation along with other Web3 and gaming tokens. Owning SAND may also mean eligibility for additional rewards through staking, or NFT drops.Metaverse Land Plots Retain ValueSome of the land plots on The Sandbox still retain value, starting out at 0.1349 ETH for a basic plot. Several exclusive land plots are on sale for 1M ETH, while high-profile plots are offered between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH. The most common sales happen at around 0.15 ETH. Digital land is still needed for the full Sandbox experience, especially for players using the VoxEdit service. The goal of The Sanbox is to distribute relatively accessible NFT and items, to make a richer experience in the metaverse. The Sandbox remains one of the best-developed games in Web3 space for a graphic-rich metaverse experience.In addition to land plots, The Sandbox collections include special branded editions and claimable avatars. Some NFT also include musical effects, as well as additional branded skins.

Tether's Paolo Ardoino publicly slams Ripple's Brad Garlinghouse | Cryptopolitan

Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, stirred up a storm on Twitter by calling out Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, amid SEC investigations and the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin. Ardoino branded Garlinghouse as “an uninformed CEO,” accusing him of spreading unnecessary fear about Tether’s USDt. His fiery tweets aimed to set the record straight about USDt’s standing and reliability.Spotlight on USDt’s Global ImpactUSDt isn’t just another stablecoin. It’s a financial backbone for millions in developing areas. Unlike traditional banking systems that often overlook the financially less fortunate, USDt serves as both a transactional and a savings medium for entire unbanked communities.Ardoino took this opportunity to reaffirm Tether’s commitment to fostering a secure global financial ecosystem. He outlined that USDt has consistently demonstrated strong price stability, ample liquid reserves, and adherence to high compliance standards with premier custodians.Despite such achievements, Ardoino lamented the mainstream media’s continued negative portrayal of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, suggesting a bias intended to protect traditional financial entities. He criticized the sensationalism that shadows the real benefits cryptocurrencies bring to global finance, emphasizing Tether’s role in pushing for transparency and adherence to legal standards.Tether’s Compliance and Collaboration EffortsDiving deeper, Ardoino shared that Tether respects the OFAC/SDN lists and has a dynamic internal investigation team equipped with diverse tools for monitoring both primary and secondary markets.Tether’s partnership with Chainalysis equips its teams with top-notch software and proactive monitoring capabilities. Since its inception, Tether has cooperated with 124 law enforcement agencies worldwide, showcasing its commitment to regulatory compliance and crime prevention.Ardoino highlighted the proactive measures taken by Tether, including blocking over $1.3 billion related to scams and hacks, and around $1.6 million linked to terrorist financing. He also noted Tether’s response to 198 law enforcement requests in the past year alone, with significant collaboration with U.S. law enforcement to block harmful transactions totaling over $639 million.Paolo Ardoino, CEO of TetherFurthermore, Tether has built strong relationships with international bodies such as Israel’s NBCTF and Ukraine law enforcement, showcasing its global outreach and cooperative stance. Unlike other stablecoins which require judicial orders for action, Tether takes immediate steps to mitigate risks, providing a quicker response to threats and illegal activities.In another revealing tweet, Ardoino spoke about Tether’s latest initiative, ‘Pioneering Progress’ in Tbilisi, attended by 150 stakeholders including central bank members, regulators, and government officials. This event showcased Tether’s leadership in shaping the future of finance, AI, and resilient infrastructure through collaborative discussions focused on regulation, compliance, and technological advancements.

Bitcoin Price Bounces Back Above $63,000 Ahead of US CPI Data | Coinspeaker



Bitcoin’s daily trading volumes surge by 76% in the last 24 hours just a day before the US reports PPI and CPI inflation numbers. Any positive development could lead to a breakout above $64,000. 

After facing some selling pressure over the last weekend, the world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) bounced back above $63,000 earlier today. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading 2.96% up at $62,715 with a market cap of $1.235 trillion. 
The interesting thing is that Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has jumped by 76% to over $23 billion. This surge in the BTC trading activity comes ahead of the release of the US inflation data numbers ahead of this week. 




As per the current economic data, America has been experiencing a slowdown in the economy in comparison to its robust performance last year. For the month of April, the US employment numbers highlighted weaker growth than the market estimates. 
If this situation continues further, it could force the Federal Reserve to cut down on interest rates to prevent any major downturn in the US economy. As a result, investors are looking for confirmation regarding the ongoing presence of inflation. This data could offer additional clarity on the scale, timing, and probability of interest rate reductions throughout the year.
All Eyes on the US CPI Numbers
This week, the market will get more insights into the US inflation numbers. On Tuesday, the United States will be releasing the Producer Price Index (PPI) data while a day later on Wednesday, they will share the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Before this week’s inflation reports, the CME’s FedWatch tool predicts a 24.6% possibility of a rate cut at July’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and a 48.6% chance at September’s meeting. Interest traders anticipate a 96.5% likelihood of unchanged rates at June’s meeting. Analysts at QCP Capital wrote:

“Unless the Fed clearly rules out rate cuts or hints at rate hikes, it seems like the markets will continue to price in cuts. These expectations are likely to keep a bullish tone in the market for a while.”

So far the Bitcoin price has managed to stay above the crucial support levels of $60,000. However, on the upside, it has always failed to surge past $64,000, and thus trading in the narrow range.


However, if the BTC price fails to give a convincing breakout above the resistance of $64,000, it can see further pullbacks under $60,000. Popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe stated that losing $60,000 can lead to a further 15% correction in BTC price.

SHIB Recovers From Early Shock Following 100 Billion Whale Transaction


							

SHIB experienced a price slump in the early hours of Monday amid investor interest.



A SHIB whale transferred 100 billion SHIB tokens to Coinbase early Monday morning.



The memecoin recovered from the slump to gain 6.4% a few hours later.




SHIB, the native cryptocurrency of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, experienced a price slump in the early hours of Monday, May 13, amid investor interest. Onchain data showed that a whale transferred 100 billion SHIB to Coinbase, one of the leading centralized exchanges (CEX).



The whale’s action attracted the interest of the memecoin’s community members, triggering speculations over the short-term impact of the transaction. Furthermore, the significant transfer added more energy to the already-existing bearish sentiment in the Shiba Inu community.



While the identified SHIB transfer to Coinbase does not necessarily indicate a sell transaction, the speculations around it stem from the current plunge in SHIB’s price. Users of the dog-themed memecoin appear to be pondering about the implications of this transfer.









It is essential to note that in many cases, crypto users consider transferring digital assets to CEXs a sign that the holder may be planning to sell. They see it as an attempt to introduce the assets into an ecosystem where they can be exchanged easily for fiat or other crypto assets, unlike holding them in isolated portfolios.



Considering the available data, the whale purchased the said SHIB tokens at an average price of $0.00002408. Selling them at the current price would amount to a loss of about $178,000. The data also revealed that the wallet behind the SHIB transfer did not hold any other token, showing that all of its past transfers revolved around SHIB.The transaction led to a 4% drop in SHIB’s price on Monday morning. However, the flagship memecoin has recovered from the slump and pushed towards higher levels. Data from TradingView showed that SHIB traded for $0.00002370 at the time of writing, reflecting a 6.4% profit for the trading day.

Blockdaemon Bags Approval in Abu Dhabi to Expand UAE Presence



By making its Web 3.0 infrastructure solutions available locally in the UAE, Blockdaemon hopes to pioneer the success story of other similar companies in the region.

Blockdaemon has announced its plans to spread its tentacles and gain more foothold in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This follows after it recently got a nod of approval from the local Registration Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).
As a result of this approval, Blockdaemon is now licensed to begin its operations in Abu Dhabi, starting with a new office in the region.




Blockdaemon Shares Its UAE Expansion Plans
With its new approval, Blockdaemon is looking to set the pace for other Web 3.0 companies to emulate. By making its Web3 infrastructure solutions available locally in the UAE, alongside its self-hosted MPC wallet technology, the firm hopes to pioneer the success story of other similar companies in the region.
Interestingly, ADGM has also issued a statement that seems to align with Blockdaemon’s ambitions for securing the approval. The regulator’s chief of market development, Arvind Ramamurthy, noted that the move is part of a calculated attempt to create a foundation for the growth and success of other web3-based firms. Ramamurthy said in a statement:
“The decision of a prominent institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure company to expand in this region with ADGM underscores the progressive regulatory environment offered by our international financial center.”
Ramamurthy is fairly certain that the latest approval could unlock certain opportunities within the region. Besides, with Blockdaemon developing institutional-grade infrastructure for blockchain protocols and traditional financial institutions, the anticipation might not be exactly far-fetched.
Previous Expansion Efforts
The latest approval signals Blockdaemon’s keen interest in the UAE region. However, even before now, it has been making several strategic expansion efforts in the past.
In February 2022,  it forayed into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region before making its first move to the Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region less than a month later.
By September 2021, the firm had achieved unicorn status following a $155 million raise that brought its valuation to 1.255 billion at the time. More recently, Coinspeaker reported that the firm now has a valuation of about $3.25 billion after completing a series C funding round

How would Trump’s ‘biggest tax cut’ impact crypto


Not long after expressing his support for the cryptocurrency industry, at the same time accusing his opponent in the United States presidential race, Joe Biden, of the perceived animosity towards the sector, former US President Donald Trump has announced major taxation cuts if elected.
Indeed, Trump was referring to President Biden’s latest budget proposal, which would introduce new and increased capital gains tax and which could impact crypto investors, stating he would, on the other hand, impose the “biggest tax cut” for all social classes, he said at a campaign rally on May 12.

“Instead of a Biden tax hike, I’ll give you a Trump middle class, lower class, business class, big tax cut. You’re gonna have the biggest tax cut. And we were set to do that, we were all set to do it.”



As it happens, in line with the standard Republican approach, the Trump campaign’s proposal plans to lower the maximum capital gains tax rate to 15%, which would follow his previous term, during which the administration dropped this rate to a maximum of 20%, as Finbold reported on May 2.
Impact on crypto
Still, the previous tax bill that Trump signed into law in December 2018 fails to clarify matters for crypto investors, traders, issuers, and miners, as it doesn’t directly address digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and tokens issued through initial coin offerings (ICOs). 
However, it does have an indirect impact, as certain attorneys believe that capital gains taxes might still apply to crypto assets. On the contrary, at least some crypto investors consider the sale of Bitcoin for Ethereum, for instance, as a like-kind exchange that is exempt from section 1031 of the tax code.
Specifically, as Jeremy Naylor, a partner at Proskauer Rose LLP, explained, taxpayers who treat crypto-for-crypto exchanges as like-kind are “taking the risk that if they got audited, the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] would disagree,” considering that “it’s clear now that you can’t do that” under the new law.
Moreover, the exemption that section 1031 previously applied to “property of like kind” only applies to “real property of like kind,” which excludes crypto assets. By following this logic, crypto is subject to capital gains tax, and Trump’s promised cuts would mean lower capital gains taxes for crypto traders and investors.
Donald Trump and crypto industry 
Meanwhile, the former President has recently stated that he was “fine with” crypto, promising that he would let crypto businesses, which he believes are currently leaving the US because of “hostility toward crypto,” exist in the country, as well as accepting crypto contributions to his campaign.
As a reminder, Trump had gradually modified his crypto stance, shifting from arguing that “Bitcoin is a scam” to launching his own non-fungbible token (NFT) collection called Trump Digital Trading Cards, to an even more openness regarding paying with Bitcoin and other crypto assets.

Ethereum-Based Layer 3 Blockchain Degen Halted for Over 12 Hours | Coinspeaker



While Degen grapples with its recent network downtime, the platform is not the only blockchain protocol facing such challenges lately.

Degen Chain, an Ethereum-based layer 3 blockchain network, has suffered a major setback, highlighting one of the key challenges in the blockchain industry. For over 12 hours and counting, the protocol has been unable to produce blocks, halting all activities on the chain, including buying and selling cryptocurrencies.
According to the network explorer, the outage caught users off guard on Sunday evening, as the protocol abruptly ceased validating new transactions at the block height of  #15524774.




Working to Restore the Network Activities
Due to the sudden downtime, many decentralized applications (dApps), including blockchain bridges operating on the Degen Chain, have become inactive. As a result, users interacting with these projects, such as DegenSwap, Mint Club, and Frogswap, have completely lost access to their assets on the platforms until the network is fully back online.
In response to the network outage, the protocol developers took to X (Twitter) on Monday morning to acknowledge the issue and reassure users of their efforts to restore the chain. According to the post, the team has partnered with the rollup infrastructure platform Conduit to bring the network back online.
Currently, the cause of the halt remains a mystery, with no clear explanation for the sudden outage. For now, the network’s issues have not spread to other chains, notably Base, which continues to function without any disruption.
Degen’s TPS Milestone
As a blockchain network, Degen was built using the Arbitrum Orbit technology stack. It primarily relies on the layer-2 scaling solution Base for operations and ensures data availability through the AnyTrust protocol.
Despite its Ethereum roots, Degen operates differently by using its native token, Degen, for gas fees instead of Ether. The digital asset follows the ERC-20 standard and was minted within the Degen channel on Farcaster back in January 2024.
Before the recent network hiccup, the protocol had quite a winning streak. In April, the Degen Chain hit a major milestone by clocking the highest Transaction Per Second (TPS) count in a single day within the Ethereum ecosystem.
According to L2BEAT, Degen’s TPS count soared by an impressive 62%, hitting 35.7, leading other projects such as Base and Arbitrum. Base only recorded 29.7 TPS, coming second on the top five list of projects in Ethereum with high throughput
That same month, Degen also emerged as the largest and most vibrant meme coin within the Farcaster network.
Not the First
While Degen grapples with its recent network downtime, the platform is not the only blockchain protocol facing such challenges lately. Solana (SOL), a prominent player in the industry, has had its fair share of network outages, with the most recent one occurring in February.
The latest downtime marked the first hiccup for the network in over a year, dashing users’ hopes that network outages were a thing of the past.
Similarly, Avalanche (AVAX), another popular blockchain, experienced a network outage in February earlier this year. The disruption lasted for several hours before the bug was identified, and activities resumed as usual.

Historical Data Shows Bitcoin Price Could Rebound Soon If This Happens: CryptoQuant


																Bitcoin has continued to experience volatility after the long-awaited halving event, with prices continuing to wobble. Despite the sideways movement, however, analysts remain optimistic about bitcoin’s price action in the current market cycle.
According to an analyst from the blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium trend could have a positive effect on bitcoin’s price once it turns negative.
The Coinbase Premium Index is an indicator that represents the percentage difference between the BTC/USDT pair on Binance and the BTC/USD pair on Coinbase Pro. Since Binance has a global user base while Coinbase is more focused on the US market, the difference between the prices on these two large crypto exchanges provides insight into the trading behaviors of both demographics.
Coinbase Premium Index Close to Zero
When the Coinbase Premium displays a positive trend, it indicates that bitcoin’s price on Coinbase is higher than on Binance as there is greater buying pressure on the former. However, a negative trend suggests that Coinbase is seeing a greater selling pressure, as the price listed on Binance becomes higher.
Per the analysis from CryptoQuant, historical data indicates that bitcoin’s price typically rebounds when the Coinbase Premium trend is negative and reverses from a downtrend to an uptrend. One such occasion was when Grayscale won the lawsuit against the SEC regarding the conversion of its GBTC product to a spot Bitcoin ETF, and it positively affected BTC’s price.
The Coinbase Premium Index is currently hovering in the positive zone, close to zero. However, if the trend shifts to negative, bitcoin’s price is expected to rebound.
“If the historical pattern repeats itself, we may have a better chance of success if we wait a bit longer and invest in the rebound after the trend turns negative,” the analyst said.
Accumulation Continues Amid Price Fluctuations
Bitcoin has continued to see increased interest from investors despite price fluctuations. The latest approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs have further improved inflows into the market.
Earlier this month, Coinbase released its Q1 earnings report, with the total revenue surging 72% to $1.6 billion.

SoftBank subsidiary to develop semiconductor chips, reports profits after AI shift

SoftBank-owned processor designer Arm has announced plans to develop its own in-house artificial intelligence (AI) chips on the back of AI-related profits.On May 13 a report from Nikkei Asia said that Arm is setting up a division for developing AI chips, with its first protocol to be released by spring 2025 and mass production anticipated by autumn of the same year. It was reported that Arm will be taking up the initial costs of development, estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of yen, with contributions from SoftBank which owns a 90% stake. After mass production is up and running, there is a possibility for the AI chip business to spin off under SoftBank itself. SoftBank is reportedly already in negotiations with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, among others, to secure capacity for producing the chips en masse. Arm is responsible for providing the technology that is used in the main chips of “almost all smartphones and tablets,” according to the company. It holds a share of more than 90% in architecture for processors used in smartphones.Additionally, Arm supplies architecture to Nvidia - one of the market’s leading AI chip developers. In developing their own chips for high-level AI models, Arm aims to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. Related: Elon Musk’s AI spinoff is seeking $4B that could level up Grok: ReportThis comes after SoftBank reported a net profit in the final quarter of its financial year for 2024 after the company shifted its focus toward AI. Arm was a major part of the company’s outlook for the upcoming year. SoftBank chief financial officer Yoshimitsu Goto told a press conference in Tokyo that growing interest and development in the AI sector is a key focus for the group:"Arm is at the core of SoftBank Group's AI shift which will create a new ecosystem, along with the various assets we've held for a long time that are using AI, centered on the Vision Fund.”Arm’s stock surged by 30% this February due to its forecasted ambitions in AI. It is among one of the many technology developers looking to develop AI chips in-house and wean off of a reliance on Nvidia. On April 15, ​​Samsung said it secured a $6.4 billion grant to expand its Texas facility for semiconductor chip manufacturing, with an anticipated $45 billion invested by the end of the decade. In February, it was reported that OpenAI, the company behind one of the world’s most powerful AI chatbots ChatGPT, is seeking trillions of dollars in investments from investors worldwide to begin manufacturing its own chips.

Bitcoin layer-2 landscape "set to boom" as BTC keeps outperforming: Bybit - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin (BTC) layer-2 (L2) blockchains will continue to grow as BTC continues to outperform other major crypto in 2024, according to a report by crypto exchange Bybit.Bitcoin’s market dominance has surged to 51.1% as of May 7, signaling a robust uptrend since late September 2023. This growth is largely attributed to the US approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has bolstered Bitcoin’s trading volume. Bybit reports an 18% increase in BTC holdings month-over-month from March to April 2024, with Bitcoin’s trading volume now representing 31.8% of the total.The L2 landscape is enhancing the utility of BTC and leveraging the security of Bitcoin mining. While they face challenges due to the Bitcoin blockchain’s architecture and community resistance to change, the success of projects like Ordinals and Runes suggests that innovation can drive community growth. As Bitcoin maintains its proof of work (PoW) status and outperforms other blockchains, the potential for Bitcoin L2 development remains vast.This growth has catalyzed the development of Bitcoin L2 solutions, designed to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and introduce programmability to the Bitcoin network. These solutions include state channels, sidechains, and rollups.State channels like the Lightning Network facilitate faster, more cost-effective transactions by allowing off-chain updates between parties. However, they face limitations in capacity and lack smart contract functionality. RGB, a new project, aims to overcome these challenges by integrating smart contract capabilities with the Lightning Network.Sidechains operate independently but maintain a connection to the Bitcoin mainnet through bridges, enabling asset transfers. Projects like Stacks and Rootstock are well-established, while newcomers like AILayer boast the highest total value locked (TVL) due to its AI integration and anticipated airdrop.Rollups, which batch transactions for settlement on the mainnet, are divided into optimistic and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups. ZK-rollups, in particular, are favored for their lower transaction costs. Merlin Chain leads the ZK-rollup space with a TVL of $1.1 billion, thanks to its early launch and vibrant DApp ecosystem.Despite these advancements, Bitcoin L2 solutions face inherent risks, including security vulnerabilities, interoperability challenges, and counterparty risks, Bybit points out. These risks mirror those encountered by early Ethereum L2 solutions.

China's Digital Yuan: A Currency No One Wants To Use?


								China’s ambitious plan for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY or digital yuan, is facing a test of adoption. While the government boasts billions of dollars in transactions and enthusiastic city trials, a closer look reveals a hurdle – a lukewarm reception from the very people it’s meant to serve.

Digital Yuan: Early Adopters Turn Away
A recent report by the South China Morning Post throws cold water on the e-CNY’s immediate success. State employees in some cities, receiving a portion of their salaries in digital yuan, are quickly converting it back to cash. The reasons? A lack of incentive and practicality.
Sammy Lin, an account manager at a Chinese state bank, said:

“There’s no interest if I leave it there […] there aren’t many places where I can use it.”

This sentiment echoes concerns about limited use cases. Unlike established digital payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay, the e-CNY seems to lack widespread merchant adoption, both online and offline.
Privacy Concerns Cloud the Picture
Adding to the apprehension is the specter of government surveillance. China’s digital ecosystem is already closely monitored, and citizens are wary of the potential for intrusive tracking with the e-CNY.

“Paper currency offers anonymity,” says Ye Dongyan, a researcher at Beijing’s Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. “The boundaries between information tracking and security need more clarification.”

The government, however, maintains that the e-CNY prioritizes privacy through “controllable anonymity.” This system, according to Yi Gang, the former governor of the People’s Bank of China, protects small transactions while monitoring larger ones to prevent financial crimes.
But can this appease citizen anxieties?

Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Numbers Tell A Different Story?
Despite the reported low usage among initial recipients, China boasts a different narrative. Yi points to over $250 billion worth of e-CNY transactions conducted as of July 2023.
This suggests some level of adoption, but the details remain unclear – is it organic growth, or a result of government-led initiatives?
Incentivizing The Switch
China is actively promoting the e-CNY. Several cities have conducted trials, handing out millions in digital yuan subsidies and consumption coupons. This approach aims to encourage people to experiment with the new currency and potentially discover its benefits.

The Road Ahead
The future of the e-CNY remains uncertain. While the government pushes for wider adoption, user behavior suggests a need for more than just financial incentives. Addressing the limited use cases and building trust around privacy protection are crucial steps.
China’s digital currency project may yet see widespread adoption, but for now, it seems to be stuck in a conversion cycle – from digital yuan back to cash.

The Big Day Has Arrived: Crucial Bitcoin-related Data to Be Released on Wednesday - Bitcoin Sistemi


The cryptocurrency community is eagerly awaiting the announcement of investors behind Bitcoin ETFs as May 15th approaches. This important date marks the deadline for investors managing assets over $100 million to file “13-F Filings” with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and reveal their holdings in publicly traded assets.
These applications, which must be made 45 days after the end of a quarter of the year, can give an idea about the investment strategies of large companies in the market. Although they do not cover every investor and represent just a moment in time, the upcoming announcements are expected to bring positive surprises regarding institutional participation in Bitcoin ETFs.


13F filings are defined as documents required quarterly by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in eligible assets. If you're big enough to be in this lane, you have to disclose to the world your U.S.-traded stocks, options, and now Bitcoin ETFs as of the last day of the quarter.
But here's the kicker: not all 13F applications are equal. Not all of them signal true investment confidence.






Take, for example, market makers and high-frequency trading firms such as Citadel Securities, Susquehanna International Group (SIG), Renaissance Technologies, and Virtu Financial. For example, unlike Berkshire Hathaway indicating a bullish outlook on an announced position, Citadels and SIGs often trade swings to profit from small differences between bid and ask prices. Their holdings generally reflect high-volume trading rather than a long-term belief in the assets. Therefore, it pays to be careful when examining 13Fs.
*This is not investment advice.

Contextualizing Crypto Volatility: History of Bitcoin Crashes

Cryptocurrency has raised exposure to innovative concepts and opportunities, changed economic paradigms, and become the “new economy.” Although cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly familiar in every corner of the world, crypto volatility is just like nothing before. Currency can play for bigger profits or, on the other hand, greater losses in a very short time. Understanding the nature of Bitcoin and other crypto volatility is important.  
Crypto volatility means the unpredictable price nature of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has a history of great price volatility in bursts with periodic crashes. Market sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic factors cause sudden big drops in its price.
What is Crypto Volatility?
Volatility measures the amount of an asset’s price that has fluctuated over time. In general, the volatility of an asset indicates how risky the investors perceive it to be and how much potential it exhibits for delivering higher returns or bigger losses over time horizons of shorter duration than the relatively less volatile money.
As cryptocurrencies are a relatively new asset class, they are commonly viewed as having potentially huge gains and losses in short periods. The digital assets possess high volatility, as in the case of “penny stocks,” to relatively quieter large-cap corners. On the other hand, bonds show lower volatility, where they normally move less sharply up or down over long periods.
Measurement of Crypto Volatility
When measuring volatility, it commonly refers to “historical volatility,” resulting from the analysis of prices on a given period, usually 30 days back, a year or more. Because the future is impossible to predict with certainty, the science of “implied volatility” — which offers an educated guess about what’s to come – stands as far less exact even as it serves as the foundation for such popular financial tools as the Cboe Volatility Index, often termed the “fear index” because it predicts stock market volatility over the next 30 days.   
There are two methods for quantifying crypto volatility:

One way to do this is to employ beta, The beta measures how volatile a stock is relative to the entire market (usually using the S&P 500 for that gauge).
The standard deviation of an asset, which indicates how much its price has deviated from its historical average, can be calculated.

The Importance of Crypto Volatility
Volatility is among the main elements used to determine a particular investment’s risk. Normally, investors take on quite a bit of risk if the potential gain from an investment is such that there is an equal chance that the investor might lose some of the initial investment. (Everything they’d invested is gone — as in the case of high-risk hedge-fund manager Bill Hwang, whose entire $20bn fund vanished in two days.)

5 Proven Tips to Protect Your Money During a Crypto Crash.

If anything, the retail investor usually has it as a mantra that they should be aware that they should diversify risk by spreading their holdings within an asset class. One typically well-liked way is investing in an index fund or a basket of stocks instead of buying a select few. This may also be coupled with diversification of investments in low volatile assets, such as bonds, at the same time as they have investments in more volatile asset categories, such as stocks, to minimize even further the chances of any investment giving negative returns.
Despite the cryptocurrency asset class being only a bit over a decade old, which has led to numerous very sharp run-ups followed by retrenchments and considered as, on balance, more volatile than stocks the increased trading volumes and greater institutional participation witnessed in Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, appear to be diminishing its volatility over time. When trying emerging crypto assets like DeFi tokens or cryptocurrencies with lower trading volumes, it’s best practice to risk amounts you can afford to lose, as these are usually experiences with higher volatility. 

Crypto volatility arises from positive or negative news coverage and better or worse than estimated quarterly results. Crypto volatility is primarily attributed to irregular spikes, such that the level of trading volume can be exceptionally high. Low volume normally means high crypto volatility, such as dealing with smaller cryptocurrencies or penny stocks not traded on major markets.
Can We Reduce Crypto Volatility?
And while its crypto volatility has been decreasing of late, bitcoin often moves by double-digit percentage amounts in a single week, presenting ample opportunity for tactics such as “buying the dip.” Moreover, its high crypto volatility makes it attractive to some cryptocurrency investors as it gives the potential for big returns.

What Happens to Crypto if Binance Goes Bankrupt?

Dollar-cost averaging can reduce the negative effects of crypto volatility for less risk-tolerant people. Longer-term investors generally do not pay as much need to concern themselves with short-term fluctuations because they have every reason to believe that an investment will eventually rise over time.  Stablecoins, such as USD Coin and Dai, are less volatile cryptocurrencies – their value is set to some reserve asset, such as the US dollar.
An Overview of Bitcoin Crashes in The Past 
In 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) saw one of the worst crashes in history, with the price of BTC falling below $20,000 in June 2022, following a peak of $68,000 in November 2021. Since September 2011, June 2022 has been the worst month for Bitcoin due to monthly losses that have reached 40%.
Additionally, the cryptocurrency reported its worst quarterly losses in eleven years. Nevertheless, bear markets and Bitcoin crashes are not limited to 2022 due to the present market sell-off. In fact, since the genesis block—the first block of Bitcoin—was mined in January 2009, the cryptocurrency has witnessed its fair share of crypto winters. When we pan out the Bitcoin price chart, we can find the following five most significant price drops in its history.
Bitcoin Crashed From 32 USD to 0.01 USD in 2011
In April 2011, the price of Bitcoin broke through its first significant psychological barrier of $1, igniting the first-ever rally that saw it reach $32 on June 8, 2011. Happiness, however, was short-lived as the value of Bitcoin then crashed, bottoming out at just $0.01 over a few days.
The sharp sell-off was mainly instigated by security flaws at the now-defunct Mt. Gox, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange that conducted the majority of Bitcoin trades then. The theft of 850,000 BTC was a security breach in the exchange’s platform, raising serious questions about the safety of Bitcoin that it staked on exchanges.

The flash crash in June 2011 kept that part of the significant Bitcoin history when BTC lost almost 99% of its value through a very short period, measured in a few days. The event started long before Bitcoin bounced its price back to the previous high of $32, and new all-time highs were reached in February 2013.
Trying to follow pre-2013 Bitcoin price charts is akin to comparing them with more recent ones. Established lineament price tracking services or websites such as CoinGecko, for instance, or CoinMarketCap did not track prices of the Bitcoin before April 2013.
Bitcoin Crashed From $1,000 to $200 in 2015
Data on BTC price depicts that Bitcoin peaked in mid-April 2013 at $100. Riding up ever since for the first time in history, it touched $1,000 in November of 2013.

Top 5 Tips For Newbie Bitcoin Investors: Here’s What You Need To Know

Less than a month after crushing the $1,000 barrier for the first time, Bitcoin embarked on one of its most savage bear market runs in history. The decline in value coincided with the crackdown on Bitcoin by the Chinese central bank in late 2013, which prohibited regional financial institutions from processing transactions involving the said cryptocurrency.

Prices of the cryptocurrencies continued to spiral down in the ensuing two years, hitting a low of $170 in January 2015 after first bottoming out at around $360 in April 2014.
December of 2013 ushered in the extended cryptocurrency winter of 2014, linked to the compromised Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange that was refusing Bitcoin withdrawals during the first few days of February 2014 – any trades made with the platform stopped after this point and ultimately ended in bankruptcy between the US and Tokyo.
Several other leading financial authorities around the world also aired concerns regarding Bitcoin. In 2014, late in the year, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission claimed its authority over “Bitcoin price manipulation.”
Before a long-term trend started a reversal in August 2015, the general sentiment concerning Bitcoin was mostly bearish. In January 2017, between a healthy bull market, for the first time since then, the price of Bitcoin reached $1,000 again. In the history of Bitcoin, this was the longest price recovery period from an all-time high.
Bitcoin Falls Below $3,200 After Reaching $20,000 in December 2017
In January 2017, Bitcoin recovered to $1,000, and by the end of the year, it had reached a high of $20,000.

However, similar to the $1,000 high in the history of Bitcoin, its triumph of $20,000 was short-lived as the cryptocurrency plummeted and lost over 60% of its value in just months.
So, the Bitcoin market decided to continue its way down in 2018, and the year with lightning speed soon was christened on exchanges as “crypto winter” – by December 2018, bitcoins fell only to a low of about 3,200 dollars.
Alarm bells for the commencement of the crypto winter were ringing over security concerns at Coincheck, another Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange. Coincheck was hit by a massive hack in January 2018, which resulted in the loss of around $530m NEM (NEM) cryptocurrency.

The bear market worsened when the tech giants Facebook and Google issued bans on ads for initial coin offerings and token sales in March and June 2018, respectively.
One of these initiatives contributing to the bear market was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to reject applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.
Bitcoin Drops From $63,000 to $29,000 in 2021
However, until 2020, the cryptocurrency market was mostly bearish, as with the retracing of Bitcoin to $20,000 – and more so in the latter half of 2018 to $3,000 – it started a new massive bull run that outpaced every other run before it and peaked at above $63k in April 2021.

Despite the slight setback, it became one of the crucial years for Bitcoin in which the cryptocurrency crossed the $1 trillion market cap.
After hitting new highs in mid-April, Bitcoin drew back a little but dropped its price to as low as $29,000 in three months.
The 2021 mini-bear market came with a growing media narrative insinuating that there are some environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) problems posed by Bitcoin mining.
The global ESG-related FUD around Bitcoin became even louder when Tesla, Elon Musk’s electric car company, dumped Bitcoin as payment in May on ESG concerns. Just three months later, Musk admitted that about half of Bitcoin mining was powered by renewable energy.
The bear market was short-lived despite a major crackdown on local mining farms that followed China. The bullish trend had returned by the end of July, and eventually, Bitcoin would go up to its still-unbroken all-time high of $68,000 set in November 2021.
Bitcoin Plummets From $68,000 to Below $20,000 in 2022
Bitcoin failed to break through above $70,000 and started declining in late 2021. Since the November season of last year, cryptocurrency has been experiencing a bear market with its largest historical crashers during December 2022.
In June, the cryptocurrency fell below $20,000 for the first time since 2020, fueling market panic.
The crisis of algorithmic stablecoins happens with the TerraUSD Classic (USTC) stablecoin being held to a 1:1 peg against US dollars through blockchain algorithms instead of equivalent cash reserves.

USTC, a major algorithmic stablecoin, lost its dollar peg in May. One of the most violent de-pegging saw USTC end as it skyrocketed to break into the podium of the third-largest stablecoins before it faced its demise.

Trading Bitcoin vs. BTC Futures: A Comprehensive Guide

A cryptocurrency lending crisis fueled huge liquidations and uncertainty caused by the Terra consortium, and the former had a domino effect on the rest of the cryptocurrency market. 

Conclusion
The history of Bitcoin crashes is a crypto volatility story and has elements of resilience, adaptation, and growth. In creating one’s path through the cryptocurrency markets’ bumpy ride, treading with some nuance on how they come about will be critical. Learning from the past, appreciating the impact of human behavior, and vigilantly standing in touch with regulatory and technological shifts can provide investors with more confidence and resilience in navigating the crypto landscape.

WBTC thief returns $71 million worth of stolen funds

$71 million worth of stolen cryptocurrencies from a recent wallet poisoning scam has been returned to the victim in a fortunate but mysterious turn of events.The unknown attacker returned $71 million worth of Ether (ETH) tokens on May 12, after the high-profile phishing incident caught the attention of multiple blockchain investigation firms. On-chain security firm Lookonchain unpacked the details in an X post on May 13:“SlowMist_Team released a report on this incident 3 days ago, tracking multiple attacker’ IPs possibly from Hong Kong (the use of VPNs has not been ruled out). After that, the attacker replied to the whale and returned all the funds.”Source: LookonchainThis comes as a surprising development to the attack from May 3, when an investor sent $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to a bait wallet address, falling victim to a wallet poisoning scam. The scammer created a wallet address with similar alphanumeric characters and made a small transaction to the victim’s account.Related: El Salvador launches $360M Bitcoin treasury monitoring websiteLike most investors, the victim validated the wallet address by matching the first and last few characters and transferred 97% of their assets to it. However, the difference would have been noticeable in the middle characters, often hidden on platforms to improve visual appeal.White hat hacker, good samaritan, or scared thief?Despite returning all the stolen funds, on-chain transactions leading up to the event suggest this was not the exploiter’s initial intention.After receiving the stolen funds, the attacker immediately converted the 1,155 WBTC to approximately 23,000 ETH — a popular move by malicious hackers that can help launder stolen funds via privacy protocols and crypto mixing services such as Tornado Cash.On May 8, the attacker started spreading the funds across over 400 crypto wallets, which ultimately ended up in over 150 separate wallets, before returning the assets.Source: PeckshieldThe return of the funds came shortly after on-chain security firm SlowMist published an analysis on the attacker’s potential Hong Kong-based IPs, suggesting that the thief got scarred by the potential consequences.Source: SlowMistThe $71 million theft is only a small part of the phishing attempts associated with the WBTC tief, according to a May 10 incident report by SlowMist:“Upon investigating this fee address, we observed that from April 19 to May 3, this address initiated over 20,000 small transactions, distributing small amounts of ETH to various addresses for phishing purposes.”The amount of crypto stolen from hacks and scams fell to $25.7 million in April, markings the lowest historical figure since 2021 when on-chain intelligence firm CertiK started tracking the data.Related: Ether turns inflationary for the first time since the Merge

Tether Defends Transparency Amid Ripple Critics


In a striking development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino publicly challenged Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse following comments about potential SEC scrutiny of USDT. 
This confrontation underscores the regulatory complexities facing stablecoin issuers and the intense competition within the cryptocurrency sector.
Tether CEO Confronts Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse Over FUD
Paolo Ardoino responded to Garlinghouse’s comments by taking to social media. He accused people of spreading “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” (FUD), particularly as Ripple prepares to enter the stablecoin market.
At a pivotal moment, Tether, the issuer of the world’s most utilized stablecoin, USDT, stands. With a user base mainly in emerging markets and developing countries, USDT is a crucial financial resource, offering access to financial services from which many are otherwise excluded. 

Amid these accusations, Brad Garlinghouse aired his concerns on the “World Class” podcast with Chris Vasquez. He discussed the severe implications for the broader crypto market if the U.S. government were to act against Tether, emphasizing Tether’s critical role.

In response to the FUD accusation, Tether reiterated its dedication to compliance and transparency. The company complies with regulatory standards and collaborates with global law enforcement to block and report illicit transactions. These efforts ensure the safety and stability of Tether’s operations. They block over $1.3 billion tied to scams, hacks, and money laundering, as Ardoino highlighted.

“The real facts show how Tether USDt, leveraging the transparency of the blockchain technology and working with global law enforcement is able to comply with requirements,” he said.

Moreover, Tether supports a highly skilled internal investigation team. Ardoino noted that this team uses advanced tools to monitor both primary and secondary market transactions. Their work is enhanced through partnerships with analytics firms like Chainalysis, which supply cutting-edge software to bolster monitoring and compliance.
This dispute not only points to the SEC’s potential actions but also to the competitive dynamics in the cryptocurrency industry, where the launch of new stablecoins by companies like Ripple could alter market dynamics and regulatory focus. As Ripple gears up to introduce its stablecoin, the stakes are considerable, putting Garlinghouse’s actions and words under intense scrutiny.
As the cryptocurrency sector evolves, the interaction among competition, regulatory challenges, and market stability grows increasingly complex. Tether and Ripple must navigate these waters carefully, balancing aggressive business tactics with strict compliance and ethical standards.

                        El Salvador, renowned for its move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021, has now introduced a cutting-edge online platform for tracking the country’s Bitcoin Treasury.The initiative, spearheaded by The Bitcoin Office, a Salvadoran government agency dedicated to overseeing Bitcoin-related projects, aims to offer public access to data on the country’s BTC investments through a specialized mempool.El Salvador Launches Public Platform for Transparency on Bitcoin HoldingsThe official announcement from the Bitcoin Office stated,“EL SALVADOR NOW HAS ITS @MEMPOOL WHERE ANYONE CAN CHECK OUR BITCOIN TREASURY HOLDINGS.”The introduction of this platform signifies a significant step towards enhancing the financial transparency of government operations in El Salvador. The newly launched website, akin to a mempool, offers public access to data regarding El Salvador’s BTC investments.According to the website, the country holds 5,748.76 BTC, valued at over $352.8 million. The platform also reveals that the Salvadoran government acquired an additional 31 BTC in the past month and 7 BTC in the previous week.El Salvador Bitcoin Balance History Source: Bitcoin.gob.svThe recent addition to its BTC reserves aligns with President Nayib Bukele’s visionary strategy, announced in November 2022, in which El Salvador aims to accumulate “1 bitcoin per day.” By actively increasing its Bitcoin reserves, El Salvador continues to position itself as a leader in Bitcoin and blockchain technology.With the launch of this new website, El Salvador continues to lead the way in embracing Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Some proponents speculate that these strategic initiatives could position El Salvador as one of the wealthiest and most innovative nations globally within the next few decades, fueled by Bitcoin adoption.El Salvador’s Bitcoin Experiment: A Steadfast Journey Amidst Volatility
El Salvador made headlines in September 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The move aimed to foster financial inclusion, streamline remittance payments, and promote financial innovation.President Nayib Bukele’s decision faced criticism, particularly after Bitcoin’s price plunged from its all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. Despite volatility, El Salvador has remained steadfast in its Bitcoin strategy, dollar-cost-averaging into the cryptocurrency since 2021, with an average buying price of $43,097 per BTC.With Bitcoin currently trading above $62,000, El Salvador’s holdings have yielded an unrealized profit exceeding $57.4 million, per the Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker website.In a recent commentary, Bukele, who secured reelection in February, has aimed at mainstream media narratives surrounding the government’s economic policies. He criticized the media’s focus on El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings, highlighting the contrast in coverage between periods of low and high Bitcoin market prices.Bukele emphasized the significant increase in Bitcoin’s market value, suggesting that if El Salvador were to sell its holdings now, it would realize a profit of over 40%. He reiterated the government’s stance of holding onto Bitcoin, emphasizing that “1 BTC = 1 BTC” regardless of market fluctuations. Bukele pointed out the silence of media critics who previously highlighted potential losses during lower Bitcoin prices.Despite the attention garnered by El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin, it stands as a singular example among nation-states in adopting a “Bitcoin standard.” While rumors circulate about other countries potentially following suit, no official announcements have been made.However, there are speculations that if Bitcoin reaches $100,000, El Salvador could pay off its loans to the International Monetary Fund, paving the way for financial independence.

Parity Wallet Hacker Launders $9M After Seven Years Hiatus - DailyCoin


        

Parity Wallet hacker has resurfaced after seven years of inactivity.



The hacker has laundered some of the stolen funds.



The attacker’s primary address still holds hundreds of millions in stolen ETH.




The hacker suspected to have stolen tens of thousands of Ethereum from Parity Multisig Wallet has resurfaced after seven years of inactivity.



In July 2017, the attacker exploited a vulnerability on Parity Multisig Wallet version 1.5+ to drain over 150,000 ETH (valued at $30M) from three high-profile multi-signature contracts used to store funds from past token sales.




While blockchain infrastructure platform OpenZeppelin issued a post-mortem of the attack, detailing how it could have been prevented, the stolen funds were never recovered.



Hacker Launders First Batch of Stolen Loot



On May 13, blockchain security firm Cyvers issued an alert on X, noting that the hacker behind the Parity Multisig wallet theft had leveraged multiple consolidated addresses to initiate the laundering of 3,050 ETH ($9 million) at automatic crypto exchange eXch.



“The hacker behind this theft has demonstrated remarkable patience, marking a significant chapter in crypto history. Today, the hacker has initiated the laundering of 3050K ETH,” Cyvers wrote.



Following the first batch transfer, the hacker still retains control of a staggering 83,017 ETH, valued at approximately $246.6 million, Cyvers said, sharing the attacker’s primary address.



While the funds were still intact at the attacker’s primary address as of press time, an anonymous party had left an odd on-chain message, inviting the hacker to provide liquidity for perp DEXs.




“Hey, I am searching for a liquidity provider. I have some hft strategies for perp dexes and amms and can prove it cryptographically, answer with an email or tg if you are interested. If you do so, I will send a signed message (with this address first) and then we can take it from there,” the message read.



The hacker has yet to respond to the message.

Bitcoin Wallets Dormant For Almost 11 Years Just Reawakened, How Much Have They Made? | Bitcoinist.com


								Two Bitcoin whale addresses that had laid dormant for almost 11 years have suddenly sprung to life, taking the market by surprise. The anonymous whale wallets have initiated large-scale Bitcoin transactions, reaping substantial profits from their early investments in the pioneer cryptocurrency. 
Early Bitcoin Whales Move 1,000 BTC
Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain took to X (formerly Twitter) recently to unveil two Satoshi-era whale wallets which have been inert for 10.7 years suddenly showing signs of activity. The on-chain data analysis tool disclosed that the anonymous whale wallets, identified as “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH” had cumulatively transferred a total of 1,000 BTC valued at $60.9 million in the span of 20 minutes. 

According to Lookonchain, the two previously dormant Bitcoin whale wallets had purchased about 500 BTC each as early as September 13, 2013, just four years after the cryptocurrency’s inception. At the time, the price of BTC was about $124, thousands of dollars less than its current price today. 
Each of the BTC whale wallets had previously held 500 BTC, worth approximately $62,000. Now with the price of Bitcoin slightly above $61,200 at the time of the transfer, these anonymous Bitcoin whales have realized significant profits. Over the past 10 years, Bitcoin has skyrocketed by an astonishing 47,873%, resulting in each wallet’s initial BTC investment of $62,000 now yielding a profit of $30,387,372. 
This substantial profit can be attributed to the Bitcoin whale’s long years of hodling the pioneer cryptocurrency. Back in BTC’S early days, when only a fraction of today’s crypto community recognized its potential, a few smart investors had purchased significant amounts of the cryptocurrency at a low price. They held onto their holdings as BTC evolved, witnessing its gradual price increase over the years. 
Following Bitcoin’s rise to a record high of $69,200 in March, another Satoshi-era Bitcoin whale wallet had executed a large-scale BTC transaction, selling off 1,000 BTC and reaping profits of over $69 million. Following the transfer, the price of BTC had fallen significantly, underscoring the strong influence large-scale BTC transactions have on the present market. 
BTC Price Sees Slight Uptick
Following the 1,000 BTC transferred by the two previously inactive whale wallets, Bitcoin’s price, which was initially trading slightly above $60,000, surged by 2.92% in just 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is presently trading at $62,800, displaying bullish signals as its daily price chart depicts mostly green candles.

Bitcoin’s daily trading volume of about $18.1 billion has also witnessed a significant increase of 41.23%, highlighting the sudden rise in interest and demand from investors. It’s presently uncertain if BTC will keep this bullish momentum, considering that the cryptocurrency was previously experiencing substantial declines following the halving event on April 20. 
Over the past month, CoinMarketCap has reported an 8.45% decrease in Bitcoin and another 4.15% drop in the past seven days. With the market showing new signs of interest in BTC, the cryptocurrency’s price correction may be over, indicating the onset of a potential recovery.

Ethereum sees $12M whale transfer: What about ETH's price? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s Netflow got more positive.
ETH was close to entering the $3,000 price zone.

Recent data indicates that one of the early Ethereum [ETH] holders has transferred millions of dollars worth of ETH to an exchange. 
While this movement was relatively small, it could contribute to the positive Netflow trend that ETH has been experiencing recently. 
Early Ethereum holder sells most of their holdings
According to data from Spot on Chain, a significant transfer of 4,153 Ethereum coins to Coinbase occurred in the early hours of the 13th of May. 
This transfer, valued at over $12 million at the current ETH price, caught attention because the originating wallet is among the asset’s early holders. 
Further analysis revealed that since 2021, this wallet had deposited over 9,000 ETH—worth more than $21 million—to exchanges. 
As of press time, the wallet retained 2,566 ETH, valued at over $7 million. This recent transfer has contributed to the increased positive Netflow observed in Ethereum transactions.
Ethereum inflow increases 
The Ethereum Netflow chart analysis indicated a notable increase in positive flow over the last three days. However, it appeared poised to be the highest observed in recent days. 
While the Netflow stood at around 4,600 and 3,000 in the preceding two days, it has surged to over 18,000 at the time of this writing. 
This surge suggested a significant increase in exchange inflow over the past 24 hours.

Further analysis of the ETH inflow chart revealed that over 83,000 ETH had entered exchanges at the time of this writing. 
Considering the 94,000 inflow recorded yesterday and the ongoing inflow, we will likely observe further increased activity by the end of the day.

Analysis of the Ethereum volume indicated a pickup at press time.

No, Hong Kong's Crypto ETFs Aren't Available in Mainland China

Adding some fuel to the fire was a piece in the SCMP that said these ETFs would be available to mainland traders who have Hong Kong residency and brokerage accounts. That’s certainly true, but there’s a massive caveat: it's like saying that mainlanders with U.S. residency can open an American brokerage account and trade New York-listed stocks (which they can’t). This doesn't mean that they are available in mainland China, as the trading, by mainlanders with Hong Kong residency, is done in Hong Kong.

Degen Chain Halts Block Production: What's Next for DEGEN Token?


							

Degen Chain’s halt in block production for over 11 hours raises concerns about its operational stability.



Despite the setback, DEGEN token has shown resilience in its market performance, with a 3.69% increase in the past 24 hours.



Technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest a neutral to bullish sentiment for DEGEN, indicating a potential price recovery.




Wu Blockchain, a crypto news reporter, brought to light that the L3 blockchain Degen Chain has halted block production for more than 11 hours, with the reason behind it still undisclosed. Degen Chain, developed by Syndicate and formerly supported by a16z, operates on Arbitrum Orbit. Degen Chain’s Gas token, DEGEN, serves as the principal currency of Farcaster.







Despite the fallout, the DEGEN token’s market performance remains resilient. DEGEN’s current price is $0.018955, and its 24-hour trading volume exceeds $26 million. This is a 3.69% growth in the last 24 hours. Concurrently, it has fallen 13.61% in the previous seven days. 



Moreover, its market cap stands at $268.77 million, backed by a circulating supply of over 14 billion coins. Investors are closely monitoring the situation, as Degen Chain’s status directly influences DEGEN’s market dynamics.



Analyzing DEGEN’s technical indicators provides insights into its current market sentiment and potential future trends. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour price chart sits at 51.86, signaling a neutral stance among traders.

However, the KST indicator, at 8.1201, indicates that additional investigation is required to determine the stock’s performance trajectory. In addition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator signals a positive trend reversal, providing traders with optimism in the face of uncertainty.



Delving deeper into the price action, DEGEN experienced a volatile start. Witnessing a sharp decline early in the morning, it bottomed out around 7:30 AM. However, the token staged a remarkable recovery after that, steadily climbing for several hours. 



Around 9:00 AM, the pace of recovery accelerated, propelling DEGEN to surpass its initial price, reaching a peak of $0.019 before 11:00 AM. Following the peak, a minor correction ensued, though the price remained significantly higher than both its starting point and the day’s low.

MakerDAO and Aave’s DeFi conflict reopens over DAI’s perceived risk growth

The once-symbiotic relationship between decentralized stablecoin issuer MakerDAO and lending protocol Aave is fraying. As new innovations are being tested within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, tension has started building up. The perceived risk of these innovations puts the two major protocols at a crossroads. At the center of the controversy is a controversial stablecoin mirroring what’s known as a “basis trade” and Maker’s Direct Deposit Dai Module (D3M), Ethena’s USDe.MakerDAO launched its Dai (DAI) token in 2017 as an overcollateralized decentralized stablecoin backed by Ether (ETH). Users had to mint tokens on the MakerDAO platform by locking up ETH. In November 2019, Maker launched multicollateral DAI, allowing DAI to be backed by multiple cryptocurrencies, including centralized stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC).Aave (formerly known as ETHLend) launched around the same time as a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency lending platform and integrated DAI as collateral on its platform from an early stage. Both platforms collaborated throughout the 2021 DeFi boom. The launch of D3M, in cooperation with Aave, allowed Maker to directly interact with its secondary market by actively enforcing a maximum variable borrow rate.Things took a turn during the 2022 bear market as the collapse of then-major DeFi protocols and major cryptocurrency lending firms, as well as the banking crisis that led to the collapse of Credit Suisse, put unprecedented pressure on these protocols.Alarm bells ring as stablecoins depeg The 2022 bear market was marked by a series of bankruptcies and high-profile collapses, starting with the Terra ecosystem in May. Terra collapsed after its algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg.The collapse saw Terra (LUNA), previously a top 10 cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of over $40 billion, become nearly worthless in days as it entered a “death spiral” that led to the minting of trillions of tokens.The collapse of the Terra ecosystem had cascading effects that ultimately led to the collapse of lending platforms Celsius and BlockFi, among others. As a result, MakerDAO voted to temporarily cut off Aave’s D3M in a bid to protect itself.The bear market later saw the centralized stablecoin USDC briefly lose its peg after the now-defunct Silicon Valley Bank collapsed with $3.3 billion of the stablecoin’s reserves held there. The peg was restored only after regulators stepped in to ensure that depositors were made whole.That depeg rang alarm bells for MakerDAO, which shortly after requested an “urgent executive proposal to mitigate risks to the protocol” to address its then over $3.1 billion exposure to USDC. At the time, Maker also moved to eliminate its exposure to Aave, stating its “overall risk-reward of depositing funds into the D3M are not favorable under current conditions.”Speaking to Cointelegraph, Becky Sarwate, head of communications at cryptocurrency exchange Cex.io, said that the decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO) next move was then to purchase real-world assets in the form of U.S. Treasurys to “strengthen market confidence in DAI by bringing the network’s value composition into greater harmony.”Recent: Despite Bitcoin price volatility, factors point to BTC’s long-term successIndeed, real-world assets, including U.S. Treasurys and short-term loans, currently represent a large portion of DAI’s backing, making up 20% of all generated stability fees in March.According to Sarwate, the protocol has since moved to extend its credit back into stablecoins. This decision has worried some market participants, especially given its new exposure to what some deem a risky stablecoin mirroring a hedge fund trade.Tensions rise between MakerDAO and AaveMakerDAO and Aave became more direct competitors over time. In early 2023, MakerDAO introduced Spark Protocol, a fork of Aave’s version 3 that allows users to borrow, lend and stake DAI directly. This fork is linked to Maker’s D3M, effectively offering DAI users an Aave competitor.Later that year, Aave launched GHO, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. It described it as a “decentralized, overcollateralized” asset backed by a “multitude” of digital assets, including Ether — effectively making GHO a competitor to DAI.Market data suggests neither platform was successful enough to threaten its competitor. Spark Protocol currently has around $2.4 billion in total value locked, down from a peak of over $4 billion, while Aave has over $10.6 billion locked on its smart contracts across 12 chains.On the other hand, DAI’s circulating supply is over $5 billion, dwarfing GHO’s near $50 million.The tension between these two protocols surged in early April 2024 after AaveDAO debated limiting the amount of MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin allowed as collateral on its lending platform, potentially completely removing it.While the case was ultimately settled with a loan-to-value reduction of 12%, Aave Chain initiative founder Marc Zeller had proposed to altogether remove DAI as collateral on Aave, which now stands as decentralized finance’s leading lending platform with over $10 billion in total value locked.The smaller-than-expected reduction came after a detailed analysis from Chaos Labs called for a more conservative approach. Cex.io’s Sarwate says:“In many ways, Aave was put in a very difficult position, as on the one hand MakerDAO extended DAI’s line of credit from 100 million to a possible short-term ceiling of 1 billion tokens, which introduces significant risk.”She added that this risk was compounded by the organization’s decision to put some of the newly minted DAI into Ethena’s synthetic dollar USDe. This algorithmic stablecoin has sparked skepticism in the market as it aims to replicate a common hedge fund strategy.Boiling pointMakerDAO’s indirect exposure to USDe, coupled with the extended line of credit, was seemingly a boiling point for the Aave community, with the stablecoin being particularly controversial.Ethena’s USDe essentially takes advantage of price differences between spot and futures markets to generate yield through what’s known as the cash-and-carry trade. It works with a Staked Ether (stETH) position and a corresponding short position on ETH, hedging that exposure to the cryptocurrency.The trade is essentially market neutral and generates yield through the staked ETH and the funding rates perpetual futures contracts charge traders with open positions. This helps align the perpetual futures contract’s price with the underlying cryptocurrency’s spot price.When there’s more buying demand, the funding rate is positive, and those with long positions pay short sellers, while when supply outstrips demand, the opposite happens. Since Ethena’s launch, funding rates have mostly been positive, allowing USDe holders to earn double-digit yields through what has been a “delta neutral” trade.Critics, however, have argued that the stablecoin can become under-collateralized during a cryptocurrency bear market in which the price of perpetual ETH futures contracts drops below the spot price of ETH, which would turn funding rates against USDe holders.The founder of decentralized finance protocol Yearn.finance, Andre Cronje, has suggested on social media that things are now going well and funding rates are positive, but he added that “eventually that turns, funding becomes negative, margin/collateral gets liquidated, and you have an unbacked asset.”Cronje noted other risks, including external risks related to the oracle used to keep stETH pegged to ETH, exchange custody risks and potential spread risks. Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute, mentioned on social media platform X that key risks were related to execution and custody.Sarwate said, “If USDe were to go into freefall, it could push DAI toward a similar tipping point.” She added: “On the other hand, Aave choosing to remove DAI completely could run the risk of exacerbating such potential underlying conditions. When not approached thoughtfully, delistings can be turbulent and fracture communities that once enjoyed a freer range of motion.”John Lo, a former key contributor at popular decentralized exchange SushiSwap and now head of digital assets at cryptocurrency fund Recharge Capital, told Cointelegraph that Aave’s move to reduce the loan-to-value ratio was prudent but noted that “removing DAI as collateral completely would be extreme.”Lo called for more research on the limits of the D3M module and “its ability to be utilized as a flash loan vector — as rapidly inflating the price on any oracles poses a risk to all lending protocols.” Flash loans are loans taken and repaid within a single transaction.He said the risk of flash loans being used to manipulate oracles to mint more tokens should always be evaluated. The minting of tokens — as mentioned above — was part of Terra’s death spiral.The ghost of stablecoin’s pastOn Aave’s proposal to drop the loan-to-value for DAI, Aave Chan founder Mark Zeller references the Aave protocol’s “previous experience” with the “consequences of reckless minting policies” on a smaller scale, such as that of Angle’s agEUR, a stablecoin pegged to the euro minted into Euler that was hacked within a week.Lo said Ethena’s USDe stablecoin is “centralized, and therefore, there exists a slight security risk in the ability to mint more USDe at will,” a risk that could be “potentially offset by USDe’s reputational constraints.” He added that the most important risk was cascading liquidations and slippage incurred from growing redemptions in a bank run scenario.He explained that runaway redemptions during low or negative funding rates “would force exists from short perpetual future positions,” and slippage could be incurred “at size if ETH and BTC prices are increasing during that time.” On top of that, Lo added that slippage incurred on selling staked ETH over low liquidity should also be considered, as even a 5% decrease in a stablecoin’s net asset value “is enough to trigger a crisis in confidence.”Cex.io’s Sarwate commented that to some in the cryptocurrency space, “USDe’s yield structure raises specters of stablecoin’s past” and pointed out that USDe’s popularity is but one of the factors at play“This is leading some critics to recall the old adage about the downstream effects of burning twice as bright should the network’s delicate balance start to wobble. While high returns can be cause for excitement, negative effects could domino across all vested chains if conditions on the core asset falter,” she added.Lo, on the other hand, revealed he doesn’t believe USDe poses “unique risks to DeFi,” as it is a “size-constrained tokenized delta neutral strategy that has been commonly deployed by funds.”According to Lo, various similar tokenized projects should start appearing in the future, and a larger question to ask is whether USDe itself will continue to be attractive for users once perpetual funding rates fall and potentially turn negative, which could affect USDe’s on-chain liquidity. “Many tokens and stablecoin have low liquidity on-chain, and the risk that arises in that scenario is economic exploits, in particular, oracle price manipulation as a result; however, I don’t believe these would cause systemic risks in the way Luna and its UST mechanism functioned,” he said.Nevertheless, the former SushiSwap contributor saw a silver lining in the rising tensions between both protocols and the controversy surrounding USDe, noting that the discussions and attention on these issues are getting “shows governance at DAI is alive and well and most importantly widely known.”Recent: Blockchain adoption in healthcare faces serious obstacles in GermanyTo him, this activity should be seen as the “number one signal of confidence in a decentralized protocol,” and while mitigations will ultimately be implemented, one can ask how much in governance “is related to security and how much is to prevent competition for established incumbents.”What’s “generally lacking in crypto,” he said, are “consolidated independent reviews of collateral risks and asset risk,” something he believes the ecosystem would greatly benefit from.MakerDAO and Aave’s latest spat was seemingly resolved with Chaos Labs’ analysis of DAI for the Aave DAO, leading to the 12% loan-to-value reduction. On social media, Zeller concluded the matter with a simple “DAI stays in Aave, we move on. Onwards.”Whether Ethena’s USDe will ultimately collapse, fall behind competition or suffer some other fate is unclear, but with the presence of Spark Protocol and Aave’s GHO, what is likely is that these two protocols will eventually bump into each other down the road again.

Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week? - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD is carefully maintaining the $60,000 support level, navigating a delicate balance between bullish optimism and bearish caution.What Happened: This week, as traditional financial sessions commence, Bitcoin remains anchored in a familiar range, yet poised for potential volatility influenced by impending U.S. macroeconomic data and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Market analysts are closely monitoring Bitcoin's performance, particularly the stability around the $60,000 mark, which has been sustained since early May. Mark Cullen, a noted analyst, emphasized the significance of this level, stating, “Bitcoin still holding above 60k and the down trend break. That blue OB is going to be the key in the short term, lose it & we revisit the lows & likely much lower. Hold and another leg to take liquidity above the highs at 64-67k is likely.”This precarious balance comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market could be influenced by several macroeconomic triggers. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on May 14 is anticipated to be a critical indicator for Bitcoin's immediate financial trajectory. “If CPI inflation rises again this week, it will mark the third STRAIGHT monthly increase,” noted The Kobeissi Letter in a post, underscoring a bustling week ahead.Further adding to the intrigue, Powell is scheduled to speak on economic issues in Amsterdam, which could provide further cues to the market. Cryptocurrency markets have historically shown heightened sensitivity to Powell’s tone, particularly as it relates to future policy directions.Simultaneously, seasoned Bitcoin holders are demonstrating patterns reminiscent of the 2021 bull market, choosing to increase their holdings amid lower prices, potentially to capitalize on future market highs.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $62,897, up 3% over the past 24 hours.Also Read: How Much Did Donald Trump’s Crypto Portfolio Pump After He Said He’s ‘Fine With It’?Why It Matters: This cyclical behavior underscores a broader trend of growing long-term holder influence over Bitcoin’s available supply, which could have long-term implications for the market’s structure.In the derivatives markets, neutrality prevails with funding rates remaining balanced, suggesting that the market is in a state of watchful waiting. This sentiment is echoed in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which oscillates between fear and greed, indicating a market that is collectively unsure about the direction of the next big move.What’s Next: As Nov. 19 approaches, the insights from Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event will be crucial in potentially clarifying the path forward for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market, providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between macroeconomic policies and digital asset valuations.Read Next: Donald Trump Says ‘You Better Vote’ For Him If You’re Pro-Crypto: But Has He Always Been ‘Fine With It’?Image: Shutterstock

Digital Asset Investment Products Witness Inflows After 5 Weeks Of Decline - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Digital asset investment products break a five-week streak of outflows, attracting $130 million globally.



Despite the influx, ETP volumes declined to $8 billion, notably in the US, where Grayscale sees its lowest outflows since January.



Bitcoin sees a resurgence with $144 million in inflows, but Ethereum faces uncertainty as US regulators’ lack of action on spot Ethereum ETFs sparks speculation.




In a notable turn of events, digital asset investment products have recorded inflows for the first time in five weeks, amassing a total of $130 million. 





Digital Asset Investment Products Break Outflow Trend



However, despite this positive uptick, Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) volumes continued their descent, with a weekly figure of $8 billion, notably lower than April’s average ofS$17 billion. This decline underscores a waning participation of ETP investors in the crypto ecosystem, constituting only 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges, down from 31% the previous month.



The United States emerged as a key player in digital asset investment products, witnessing the lion’s share of inflows at $135 million. Notably, Grayscale, a prominent incumbent, experienced its lowest weekly outflows since January, amounting to $171 million. Meanwhile, Switzerland saw inflows totaling $14 million.



Contrary to previous weeks, Hong Kong experienced a significant drop in inflows, with just $19 million recorded, signaling that the surge in inflows following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs may have been largely driven by seed capital. On the other hand, Canada and Germany continued to grapple with outflows, totaling $20 million and $15 million, respectively, bringing their year-to-date outflows to a combined $660 million.




Bitcoin Resurgence Amid Ethereum Uncertainty



Bitcoin itself saw an encouraging influx of $144 million, reclaiming lost ground from what had been a lackluster month. Conversely, short-Bitcoin ETPs witnessed outflows totaling $5.1 million, continuing a trend of outflows over the past 8 weeks amounting to $18 million.



Moreover, the subdued response from US regulators regarding spot Ethereum ETF applications has fueled speculation about delayed approvals, potentially contributing to Ethereum-related outflows totaling $14 million last week.

El Salvador Bitcoin Tracker Spearheads Govt Transparency - DailyCoin


        El Salvador stunned the world in 2021 by becoming the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. This decision exposed President Nayib Bukele to criticism from economists, global institutions, and political opponents. Despite the backlash, Bukele continues to double down on making his country a beacon for Bitcoin adoption.
The Central American country has amassed a sovereign Bitcoin reserve of around 6,000 BTC through direct buys, mining revenue, and its residency program. To boost transparency around these holdings, the government recently launched an on-chain tracker documenting the wallet flows.Opting for Bitcoin TransparencyEl Salvador, in conjunction with Mempool, has launched an on-chain tracker showing real-time visibility into the nation’s Bitcoin holdings. The details show El Salvador is currently holding 5,749 BTC, valued at around $362.8 million based on the price at the time of writing.The most recent transactions consist of daily purchases of 1 BTC, in line with Bukele’s pledge to buy one Bitcoin every day from November 18, 2022. According to nayibtracker.com, El Salvador’s dollar cost average buy price is $43,098 per coin, equating to an unrealized profit of $114.8 million.The recent upturn in Bitcoin’s price in the run-up to the approval of US spot Bitcoin ETFs pushed El Salvador’s Bitcoin investment into profitable territory. This was met with an impassioned celebration from Bukele, who clapped back at critics who had slammed his radical approach to government.
Bukele’s unorthodox governing style has been highly polarizing, particularly regarding the country’s crackdown on suspected gang members and what this means for human rights in El Salvador. However, Bukele has also earned plaudits from those who believe other governments worldwide should take cues from his playbook, especially on Bitcoin and publicly tracking holdings.El Salvador Leading the WayIn support of El Salvador’s move to publicly track Bitcoin holdings, the Lightning Network X account stated, “One day residents of every country will demand full financial transparency of their governments.” With billions being sent to Ukraine and Israel, when many are suffering economic hardship at home, the issue of government overspending and the lack of transparency around public spending has become a political hot potato.Commenting on this, Being Libertarian warned that things will not improve domestically until the funding of conflicts stops. Being Libertarian called for an audit of the Fed and for followers to support politicians who “get this.”Meanwhile, in response to the arrest of El Salvdaor’s presidential commissioner for strategic projects over bribery allegations, Bukele declared that his entire executive branch would be investigated for corruption. Bukele stated, “I want to be remembered as the President who didn’t steal and didn’t let anyone else steal either.”On the Flipside
Bitcoin adoption among everyday Salvadorians is low, mainly due to fear of losing value on downside moves.



El Salvador’s unrealized BTC gains can potentially disappear overnight.



The exception stock trading performance of some US politicians has become a meme at this point.
Why This MattersBy voluntarily exposing its Bitcoin holdings to public scrutiny, El Salvador is pioneering a new frontier of financial transparency and accountability that is lacking in governments worldwide. This sets a refreshing precedent in an era marred by widespread financial corruption.El Salvador attempts to lure highly skilled workers with citizenship offer.Bitcoin Pioneer El Salvador Is Offering 5,000 Free PassportsCongressman Emmer supports bills for SEC reform.SEC’s Gensler Under Fire as Emmer Launches Crypto Defense

Japanese Cryptocurrency Company Announces That It Accepts Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Metaplanet, a major crypto investment and advisory firm operating in Tokyo, has made a strategic decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, marking a significant move amid the economic challenges facing Japan.
Japan's Metaplanet Accepts Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Amid Yen Declining Environment
In an announcement on Monday, the company cited Japan's ongoing economic woes, including high government debt levels, prolonged periods of negative real interest rates and the resulting weakness of the Yen, as the primary motivation for Bitcoin adoption.


Japan, which has the highest government debt/GDP ratio among developed countries at 254.6%, is currently grappling with significant economic challenges, as reported by the International Monetary Fund.
Despite the government's efforts to address economic woes, including its decision to raise interest rates in March, the Yen has fallen to its lowest level in 34 years, according to Reuters.






Explaining its rationale, Metaplanet emphasized Bitcoin's role as a “non-sovereign store of value” that is resilient to fiat currencies.
The company emphasized Bitcoin's distinct monetary policy, which is immutable and finite, with its maximum supply capped at 21 million coins, unlike traditional fiat currencies and other cryptocurrencies subject to central control.


“Bitcoin's monetary policy is rigidly set in stone until 2140, distinguishing it from both monetary metals and rival crypto projects operated at the whims of centralized developer teams,” Metaplanet said.
Additionally, the company has taken a strategic approach to asset management, revealing its intention to leverage the “full spectrum” of capital markets instruments to strengthen its Bitcoin reserves.





According to data from Bitcointreasuries.net, as of May 10, Metaplanet reportedly held 117.7 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $7.2 million.

Solana (SOL) Skyrockets 1,966% in Fund Flows: Is Solana ETF Possibility?


As became known, Solana (SOL) has experienced an unprecedented surge of 1,966% in fund inflows in the past week, firmly establishing itself as a standout leader in alternative cryptocurrency-focused investment products over the past week. According to the latest report from CoinShares, a substantial $5.9 million was directed toward SOL-related products within this short time frame. This surge not only reaffirms SOL's dominance but also marks a nearly twenty-fold increase in inflows into Solana ETPs, totaling an impressive $17 million since the beginning of the year.Contrary to this notable uptrend in SOL, the broader market landscape paints a different picture. While investment products for digital assets witnessed a commendable $130 million inflow, volumes for ETPs experienced a significant decline, dropping from April's $17 billion to $8 billion. Source: CoinSharesThis trend suggests a diminishing involvement of ETP investors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, now constituting only 22% of the total volume on global reputable exchanges.When Solana ETF?Amid growing interest from traditional investors in SOL, speculation arises regarding the feasibility of a Solana ETF. However, the potential for such an ETF is closely tied to the fate of the Ethereum ETF. With it facing regulatory obstacles, the path to a Solana ETF appears equally challenging. Notably, regulatory ambiguity surrounds Ethereum ETF status, with the SEC's classification of SOL as an unregistered security in last year's case against the Kraken exchange adding to the uncertainty.As investors await clarity on the ETF front, the prospect of a Solana ETF remains speculative, contingent upon regulatory developments and the resolution of Ethereum's ETF dilemma.

Europe's Crypto Rise: Insights from CME Group's Payal Shah | Cryptoglobe


                                
Payal Shah from CME Group highlights the significant role European investors play in the global cryptocurrency landscape. Europe, comprising Central, Northern, and Western regions, now stands as the world’s second-largest crypto economy, trailing only North America. 



Payal Shah is a key figure at CME Group where she serves as the Director of Equity and Cryptocurrency Product Development. She is deeply involved in leading the creation of innovative products across various markets, including crypto, equity, and alternative investments. 



In a recent opinion piece published in The Wall Stree Journal (WSJ), Shah points out that from July 2022 to June 2023, Europe was responsible for 17.6% of the global cryptocurrency transactions as detailed in Chainalysis’s 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.



Shah suggests that Europe’s enhanced position in the crypto sphere is primarily due to the stringent regulatory climates in Asia and the ongoing regulatory hurdles in the U.S., which have indirectly favored the European markets. She explains that the eurozone’s relatively lenient regulatory environment makes it a conducive hub for crypto-related activities, noting the euro’s status as the second most traded fiat currency in crypto transactions after the U.S. dollar. According to Shah, the shift of trading volumes from Asia, particularly after stringent bans in places like China, has benefited the European markets.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Shah emphasizes that for institutional adoption of assets, ample liquidity is essential, and European markets are well-positioned in this regard. She observes that European institutions have broad access to diverse crypto financial instruments such as ETFs, ETNs, and a variety of derivatives, bolstered by strong support from European exchanges that have expanded through substantial funding and global outreach.



Moreover, Shah points out that decentralized finance (DeFi) has become particularly attractive in Europe, where it represents the majority of the cryptocurrency value received. She describes how, in a low to negative interest rate environment, European institutions are increasingly drawn to DeFi platforms as viable alternatives for securing better yields, leveraging the technological advances that DeFi offers.



Finally, Shah comments on the technological proficiency of European financial institutions, which she believes have historically prioritized IT infrastructure more than their U.S. counterparts. This technological edge, Shah notes, has accelerated the adoption of blockchain and crypto technologies within the European financial sector. She adds that numerous European banks and exchanges are actively exploring both centralized and decentralized blockchain applications, anticipating a blend of traditional and digital asset trading in the near future.



In her closing remarks, Shah underscores that as the eurozone’s economy progresses, the importance of tailored risk management tools, such as CME Group’s euro-denominated futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ether, will grow, highlighting these tools’ roles in managing exposure to cryptocurrencies and strengthening Europe’s stance as a dominant force in the global crypto market.

What is phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) and how to defend against it?

                            Phishing and phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS), explained                                        Phishing is a prevalent hack that aims to trick people into disclosing private information, including credit card numbers, passwords and personal identities. A staggering 300,497 phishing cases were reported to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2022 alone. These attacks resulted in victims losing over $52 million. Usually, it entails sending phony emails that seem authentic, duping recipients into opening harmful links or requesting sensitive information. Phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) is an alarming development in the world of cybercrime. With the use of a subscription-based web service called PhaaS, even non-technical criminals may easily execute complex phishing attacks. These firms offer pre-made phishing kits, editable templates and server infrastructure to create fake web pages.A cybercriminal may, for instance, sign up for a PhaaS platform, create an email template that seems like it comes from a respectable crypto exchange, and distribute it to thousands of possible recipients. A link to a fake login page intended to steal users’ credentials might be included in the email. Cybercriminals may swiftly launch extensive phishing campaigns with PhaaS, posing a greater threat to both individuals and enterprises. The accessibility of PhaaS reduces the entrance barrier for cybercrime, which is a major worry for internet consumers and cybersecurity experts globally.                                                                    How PhaaS works                                        PhaaS makes it easier for fraudsters to start phishing attacks by giving them access to extensive toolkits and infrastructure. It operates as follows:PhaaS kitsPre-packaged phishing kits with all the tools, infrastructure and templates needed to carry out phishing attacks are available from PhaaS suppliers. Email templates, fictitious login pages, domain registration services and hosting infrastructure are all included in these kits.CustomizationThe degree of customization offered by various PhaaS systems varies. Phishing emails, websites and domains may all be altered by con artists to look genuine and trustworthy. Phishing campaigns can be customized to target particular people, businesses or sectors.TargetingPhishing attacks made possible by PhaaS are getting more complex. Cybercriminals have the ability to design highly targeted advertising campaigns that imitate the branding and communication strategies of reputable companies and their offerings. Attackers can create persuasive communications that have a higher chance of tricking recipients by utilizing personal information gleaned from social media, data breaches and other sources.For instance, attackers often pose as support staff from popular wallets, exchanges or projects on social media (Telegram, Discord, Twitter, etc.). They offer help and trick users via false claims of giveaways or airdrops into giving up private keys or seed phrases or establishing connections with compromised wallets to siphon off their funds.                                                                    Dangers of PhaaS                                        PhaaS has dramatically reduced the entry barrier for hackers, which has resulted in a discernible rise in the quantity and sophistication of phishing attempts.Even those with no technical experience can simply launch complex phishing attacks with PhaaS using pre-packaged toolkits, customizable templates and the hosting infrastructure offered by PhaaS providers.The possibility of suffering a large financial loss is the main risk associated with PhaaS. The goal of phishing scams is to obtain users’ private keys, seed phrases or login credentials. These can be used to access their accounts and drain their cryptocurrency wallets for nefarious purposes. For instance, attackers altered BadgerDAO’s front-end in 2021 after fooling users into providing permissions that let their money be drained.PhaaS attacks have the potential to undermine confidence in the crypto community. Scams that are successful can discourage people from using even reputable projects and services, which prevents widespread adoption. These attacks are especially vulnerable to novice cryptocurrency users. They can be more susceptible to falling for social media impersonations or websites that look authentic because they lack experience.Phishing attacks are getting more and more complex; they frequently use social engineering strategies and imitate genuine platforms. This makes it challenging for even experienced users to recognize. PhaaS is not just for large-scale email campaigns. Spear-phishing attacks are directed at well-known people or companies in the cryptocurrency industry. Such attacks use personalized information to trick specific individuals or organizations into giving up sensitive data or taking actions that lead to financial loss or security breaches.                                                                    How to defend against PhaaS                                        An ideal way to protect against PhaaS is to practice constant vigilance: Double-check everything (URLs, sender addresses), never click unsolicited links, and never share your private keys or seed phrases.Multilayered security approach and technical defensesInstall firewalls, network monitoring tools, endpoint security and robust email filtering. These technological safeguards aid in the identification and blocking of risky attachments, phishing emails and questionable network activity.User awareness trainingTeach staff members on a regular basis how to spot and report phishing attempts. Inform them of the typical signs of phishing attempts. This entails instructing people to examine sender addresses closely, determine the urgency of messages, stay away from dubious links, and desist from sending private information over email.Security policiesImplement security measures like best practices for passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA). To avoid unwanted access, encourage the use of strong, unique passwords that are updated on a regular basis.DMARC implementationTo assist in removing spoof emails, make use of email authentication methods such as domain-based message authentication, reporting and conformance (DMARC). By assisting in email authenticity verification, DMARC lowers the success rate of phishing attempts.It gives domain owners insights into email authentication statistics on their domain and lets them set policies to handle unauthenticated emails.Threat intelligenceSign up for threat intelligence services to receive information on the newest phishing attacks and PhaaS techniques. To better defend cryptocurrency platforms against evolving cyberthreats, keep up with new developments in the field of cyberattacks and emerging online risks.

Changpeng Zhao has 'nothing else to do' during jail time so may write a book


Jailed former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao says he may use his upcoming four months of ‘quiet time’ to write a book on his tenure as the leader of the world’s biggest crypto exchange.
Zhao tweeted on Sunday that he’s considering embarking on a literary career after a Binance supporter said they were “Waiting for the CZ book, the book for crypto upcoming leaders.”
“I got some ‘quiet time’ coming up. Will use that to write something,” the disgraced exchange boss replied.

Zhao received a four-month prison sentence last month after pleading guilty in the US to several charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Prosecutors recommended he receive a three-year sentence while Zhao’s defense pushed for zero jail time.  
In response to another user, Zhao said that he’s “Got nothing else to do.” Indeed, it appears that Zhao will need to find something to occupy the entire four months as, due to sentencing laws, he’ll likely be required to serve his entire sentence.
Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu also received four months in prison after he tried to flee the country, violating a court order. He described his time in jail as an ‘enjoyable experience overall’ and said “I think it’s definitely good for you.“

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also received a relatively small sentence of just six months house arrest after failing to implement anti-money laundering protocols in the operation of his exchange. FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried, on the other hand, received a far heftier 25-year prison sentence for his high-profile crimes.  
During his prison stay, Zhao will also have time to work on his ‘Giggle Academy,’ a recently-announced ‘platform for online education for underprivileged kids.’

CEO Seat Changed in Popular Altcoin, Was the Price Affected? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Antonio Juliano, founder of decentralized cryptocurrency exchange dYdX, announced that he has resigned as CEO of the parent company.
Stating that he has resigned as dYdX CEO in a blog post, Antonio Juliano stated that he will continue to be president of dYdX Trading.



“I will always be the leader of dYdX. I have no idea what will happen next for me.
We have achieved a lot, but we have not yet achieved our goals. There is more to be done and many more years to build it. I look at what we've been building for decades. dYdX is a long-term play and we will not stop.
I too have come a long way on this journey. Since founding dYdX on my own at the age of 24, I feel like I have been gifted a lifetime of adventure and growth. Chris Dixon once told me that “founding is an emotional challenge disguised as an intellectual challenge.” Now I've lived it and I know it's true.
dYdX gave me a rollercoaster of intense experiences ranging from fear to excitement, from joy to loneliness.
But now it's time to step down as CEO. Over time, I realized that I didn't actually need to run my own company. I am the founder of dYdX and always will be. I also became the CEO, as most founders find themselves doing. But I discovered that these are two different roles.”

It was seen that there was no change in the DYDX price after this news.

Tesla, Ford, GM Gain After Reports that US Will Hike Chinese EV Tariffs to 102.5% - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



According to Bloomberg, President Joe Biden will announce a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese goods, focusing on electric vehicles (EVs) and related sectors. The move has drawn criticism from former President Donald Trump and sparked a response in U.S. auto stocks, with Ford (NYSE: F), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and General Motors (NYSE: GM) seeing gains over the trading session today.



US to Increase Tariffs on Chinese EVs to 102.5%: Report



Under the new measures, tariffs on Chinese EVs can rise from 27.5% to 102.5%. Other sectors, including batteries, solar cells, steel, and aluminum, will also see tariff hikes, though specific rates will vary. The Biden administration has framed these actions as a defense of American workers and an effort to protect the U.S. market from subsidized Chinese goods.



During a recent campaign rally, former President Donald Trump criticized Biden’s tariff increases, arguing that such measures should have been implemented years ago. He also pointed out a potential loophole involving Chinese companies building cars in Mexico to bypass U.S. tariffs under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).



“I will put a 200% tax on every car that comes in from those plants, and they’re not going to do that,” Trump said. He reiterated his call for a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, which the Biden administration has avoided, likely due to concerns about fueling inflation.





US Auto Stocks Rise After the News



Following the news, U.S. auto stocks experienced significant gains. Tesla Inc., trading at $173.99, saw a 3.27% increase, although its year-to-date performance remains down by 29.91%. Despite recent challenges, Tesla’s market cap remains substantial at approximately $555.654 billion.



Ford Motor Company’s stock price increased by 3.06% to $12.36, with a year-to-date performance up by 5.54%. In response to changing trade policies, the company has been adjusting its executive team and focusing on expanding its electric vehicle lineup.



General Motors Company experienced a 3.42% increase, with its stock price reaching $45.90. The company’s year-to-date performance is significantly positive, with a 28.15% increase. GM’s strategy includes ending production of specific traditional models like the Chevy Malibu and pivoting more towards electric vehicles, which could benefit from the changing tariff landscape.







Would this move benefit US-based EV firms like Tesla in the long run? Let us know in the comments below.

This Week's Agenda in Bitcoin and Altcoins: US Inflation Data! While Inflation Remains Strong, Famous US CEOs Lost Hope on the FED! - Bitcoin Sistemi

As we enter an important week where critical data for Bitcoin and altcoins will be announced, US CPI and PPI data will be announced this week.
Apart from these data, the statements of FED President Jerome Powell and many FED members will also be followed in crypto money and global markets.


While the predictions in the market are for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to remain strong in April; Inflation remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% annual target in the first half of this year, even as higher interest rates dragged it down.
FED officials generally state that it is too early to reduce interest rates and that inflation is still well above the 2% target.





At this point, while expectations for the FED's interest rate cut have decreased since the beginning of 2024, a leading commentary platform, The Kobeissi Letter, stated in its latest assessment that the general expectation is that the CPI will remain high and said, “If the CPI rises again this week, this will indicate the third consecutive monthly increase.” ” said.
The Kobeissi Letter also included the thoughts of the CEOs of leading US companies about the possibility of a rate cut by the FED.


Stating that according to the April Conference Board CEO Confidence survey, the majority of US CEOs expect the FED to cut interest rates only once this year, Kobeissi said, “31% of the 136 CEOs who participated in the survey said they do not expect any interest rate cuts this year; % “26 of them said they expected only two interest rate cuts,” he said.

“38% of famous CEOs expect only one interest rate cut in 2024, while markets are pricing in only 2 interest rate cuts this year, the first of which will be in September.
“The markets dropped from the expectation of 6 interest rate cuts in 2024 to the expectation of 1 or at most 2 interest rate cuts in just 4 months.”

Finally, according to CME FEDWatch, the probability of the FED reducing interest rates in September is priced at 49.6 percent, while the inflation data to be announced on Tuesday and Wednesday this week is expected to have an impact on asset prices such as BTC.

Bitcoin whales hold steady amid short-term holder sell-off: Bitfinex - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders are behind the recent pullbacks in price, as the negative economic indicators from the US and cautious Federal Reserve statements make them panic, according to the “Bitfinex Alpha” report latest edition. Short-term Bitcoin holders are investors who have held their positions for less than 155 days.Despite the sell-off by short-term holders, on-chain data reveals that long-term holders are not following suit. The “Long-Term Holder Spending Binary Indicator” indicates that these investors have maintained their positions, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics and a possible resolution to the upside for Bitcoin’s price range.Image: Bitfinex/CryptoQuantAmidst this trading behavior, the Bitcoin network has surpassed one billion transactions, highlighting its foundational strength and potential for future value appreciation.The decrease in mining difficulty presents an opportunity for miners to stabilize the network’s hash power and reduce the need to sell mined Bitcoin for operational costs. This is further supported by the commitment of long-term holders, who are demonstrating confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value.Bitcoin’s network fundamentals remain robust, with over 625,000 on-chain transactions recorded on May 6th alone. The network’s ability to handle a high volume of transactions showcases its scalability and security. As the network continues to grow, the challenge will be to scale efficiently to accommodate a larger user base.Image: Bitfinex/BitinfochartsThe recent 6% reduction in mining difficulty is one of the most significant developments, offering relief to miners post-halving. This adjustment allows remaining miners to earn more Bitcoin with the same computational effort.Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced significant volatility, reflecting mixed investor sentiment towards the asset. Last week, Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows, while Ethereum ETFs experienced net outflows, with the BTC price reflecting some of this sentiment.

Crypto investment products see first inflows in over a month - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Digital assets investment products saw $130 million in inflows, the first after four weeks of outflows.
Bitcoin remains above $62k and saw inflows of $144 million this past week.

As Bitcoin shows fresh resilience above $62,000, latest market data reveals that digital asset investment products recorded inflows for the first time in over a month last week.
On Monday, digital assets manager CoinShares published its weekly report on crypto investment products. 
The details showed the industry saw $130 million in inflows for the week ending May 10. It’s the first time the metric reads positive since the first week of April – a run of four weeks of outflows.

Notably, Bitcoin saw inflows of $144 million, while short-Bitcoin ETPs recorded outflows of $5.1 million.
The majority of the inflows were seen in the US, with $135 million. Hong Kong saw $19 million in inflows. Elsewhere, Canada and Germany recorded outflows of $20 million and $15 million respectively.
ETP volumes remain low
While the week saw inflows overall, CoinShares’s head of research James Butterfill wrote in the company blog that ETP volumes have continued to decline.
For instance, the market saw ETP volumes of $8 billion last week, while it averaged $17 billion in April.
“These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges relative to 31% last month,” Butterfill noted.

Brad Garlinghouse Sees SEC Losing Against Crypto in the Long Run, Calls Enforcement Actions ‘Speed Bumps’ - The Daily Hodl


								The chief executive of Ripple Labs says that he sees the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) losing its battle against crypto in the long term.
In a new interview on the World Class podcast, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says that in the grand scheme of things, the SEC’s anti-crypto stances and enforcement actions don’t mean much.










“They’re going to lose in the long run. If you look at the continued growth of crypto as a multi-decade arc of time, this is nothing. It’s a speed bump because I’m so optimistic about what the future of crypto looks like. We’ll look back in 20 years and be like ‘God, that sucked. But you know what, little bump.’
 In my opinion, the market will be measured in many, many, many, many trillions, it will change the way many, many transactions work because it’s a way to reduce friction, reduce cost, [and] make things more efficient. It’s going to win in the long run, the best technology usually wins in the long run.”
Garlinghouse goes on to say that the crypto industry thriving is set in stone because even one of the best-managed fiat currencies – the US dollar – is losing its purchasing power over time.
“It’s inevitable. Right now, we’re talking about a $2.5 trillion [crypto market cap]. Look do I think this is an easy 10x over the next five to 10 years? Yeah, no problem…that feels safe.”

Keith Gill, the stock trader and analyst known on social media as “The Roaring Kitty” and who largely fueled the GameStop frenzy in late 2020, has signaled his return to the markets after three years of silence.
While the financial analyst nicknamed “The Roaring Kitty” shared from his X account after a long break, a Solana-based meme token experienced a significant rise after this post.


Although there is no clear statement about Keith Gill's return, his post increased speculation about Gill's return. At this point, the price of Roaring Kitty (KITTY), a Solana-based meme token, has increased by more than 6000%.
This increase in KITTY allowed one lucky investor to make a 32x profit. According to Lookonchain's post, before Keith Gill's post, this investor spent 21.1 SOL (worth 3 thousand dollars) to buy 17.4 million KITTY.





While the price of KITTY increased after Gill's post, the investor sold for 41 thousand dollars and still holds KITTY, whose approximate value is 56 thousand dollars.

“Memecoin KITTY increased by over 6000% after TheRoaringKitty shared on Twitter.
One lucky guy spent 21.1 SOL ($3k worth) to buy 17.4 million KITTY before TheRoaringKitty tweeted.

Paolo Ardoino flexes 'top-tier custodians' in Tether v. Ripple stablecoin beef


Ripple chief exec Brad Garlinghouse recently expressed his view via the World Class podcast that the “US Government is going after Tether” before emphasizing how important it is to the ecosystem.
This comment received a response from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino on X (formerly Twitter), who attributed the comments from Garlinghouse to “An uniformed [sic] CEO, leading a company being investigated by the SEC, launching a competitive stablecoin (cui prodest).” 
Ripple announced last month that it intended to launch a US dollar-pegged stablecoin.
In his lengthy tweet, Ardoino also emphasized that Tether has “proved over time to have… top-tier custodians and profound compliance.”

For context re these ‘top-tier custodians,’ Tether once gave nearly a billion dollars of commingled client and corporate funds to an unlicensed money transmitter accused of money laundering for the cartels without even signing a contract.
Additionally, when considering Tether’s profound compliance, it’s important to note that it has previously settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over allegations that it failed to maintain advertised reserves, issued tethers against funds it hadn’t received, and used bank accounts of Tether associates to send and receive funds related to Tether.
Ardoino additionally emphasized that Tether had “onboarded the FBI and USSS for reissuances” and has worked “with 124 law enforcement agencies” over “198 requests from law enforcement to block wallets.” 
He also drew further comparisons between his firm and other stablecoins, pointing out that Tether “cooperates directly with law enforcement agencies, while other stablecoins, although they claim to be ‘more compliant’ they require a judge order, allowing hackers, scammers, and criminals a long time to move funds around.”
Ripple isn’t the only stablecoin issuer who has implied that Tether is among the targets of law enforcement. Indeed, Dante Disparte of Circle accused Tether of “counterfeiting the US dollar.”

SHIB Rebounds Despite Coinbase Getting 100B SHIB Coin Dump - DailyCoin


        
Top American crypto exchange Coinbase gets injected with 100B SHIB.



Derivatives markets return with abundant activity in SHIB & 1000SHIB.



Shiba Inu whips up 6% gains despite $52M in sales on Spot markets.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is bouncing back after a week of trading in a downward parallel channel. Starting the week at a new 7-day low of $0.00002164, SHIB picked up 6% immediate gains after the leading digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) increased from $60,800 to over $63,000 on Monday morning.Right before the price trend reversal kicked in for SHIB, one holder decided to inject Coinbase with a whopping 100 billion SHIB worth $2.24 million at stamped transaction time. This whale action has drawn attention, as depositing large amounts of cryptocurrency is usually deemed a bearish sign due to the high chance of a sell-off.While the aforementioned big player accumulated those SHIB tokens in a matter of weeks for an approximate price of $0.00002408, the trader would make $2.35 million for the same amount, incurring a loss of under $50K. The current SHIB price is slightly below the buying range at $0.00002343. 
Upon further investigation by DailyCoin, it was found that the sender’s cryptocurrency address held no other assets except ‘dust’ amounts of Ethereum (ETH).Here’s Why SHIB Bounced Back Despite 100B DumpAmid the hefty whale action, Shiba Inu’s Derivatives markets have rapidly increased 146% over the latest 24-hour period. Totaling $156.44 million in Derivatives trade volume, the Open Interest (OI) rating has also picked up 10.33% gains, indicating that Futures traders have a renewed interest in the popular meme coin.Meanwhile, the 1,000 times multiplied 1000SHIB contract has also seen similar revitalization with a 161% hike in trading volume, topping $331.31 million over the past 24 hours. While Derivatives traders have placed more short SHIB positions than longs in the last 24 hours, OKX users are the most bullish on SHIB with a 2.65 long versus short ratio. Judging by liquidations, SHIB’s long position holders had a hard time with $1.1 million in long SHIB liquidations over the past 24 hours. Short sellers incurred a $635K combined deficit in SHIB and 1000SHIB smart contracts on the Crypto Derivatives markets.On the Flipside
Despite SHIB’s rejuvenation in Derivatives markets, the newly piqued interest in the token has yet to transform into Shiba Inu’s Spot markets.



According to CoinPaprika, the #12 ranked Shiba Inu plunged by 10% in trading volume, while SHIB sales outweighed the bids by over $11 million.
Why This MattersShiba Inu is a long-term TOP 10 contender with a rapidly growing community and yearly return of 164.5%, based on the latest 365-day timeframe.

XRP Ledger Attracts The Next Asian Institutional Validator


								Infinite Block, a Korean virtual asset service provider (VASP), has joined the XRP Ledger as a validator, according to a statement released by the company on May 13. The Seoul-based firm, led by CEO Jung Gu-tae, aims to foster the stable expansion of the ledger within Korea’s stringent regulatory framework.
XRP Ledger Gets Another Institutional Validator From Asia
Infinite Block, established by a group of Korea’s foremost regulatory and financial experts, notably secured a VASP license after being the sole qualifier among approximately 50 applicants in 2023. This credential underscores its compliance with Korea’s robust virtual asset regulations, including the international Travel Rule and anti-money laundering standards.

The XRPL, a decentralized open-source protocol active since 2012, has processed over 2.5 billion transactions. Among the prominent contributors to the ecosystem are Ripple, the XRPL Foundation, and XRPL Labs. XRP, the native token of the ledger, is currently ranked seventh globally in terms of market capitalization among virtual assets.
The entry of Infinite Block as a validator is seen as a significant step in both bolstering the domestic blockchain environment and enhancing Korea’s position on the international stage. The company plans to engage in stable governance, expand the ecosystem, and offer services to corporations, all while adhering to domestic and international compliance standards.
CEO Jung Gu-tae emphasized the strategic importance of this move. “As a fully regulated custodial business operator, we will provide blockchain regulatory support infrastructure suitable for the institutional characteristics of the Korean virtual asset industry,” he said. “We will contribute not only to user protection but also to enhancing the reliability based on thorough regulatory compliance, both domestically and internationally.”

Emi Yoshikawa, Ripple’s Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, welcomed the development. “Hot off the press from Korea. Infinite Block, a VASP licensed custody company in South Korea, is now running a validator on the XRP Ledger. Great to see more and more institution-grade validators are participating in the ecosystem from Asia!” Yoshikawa stated via social media platform X.
The announcement by Infinite Block coincides with other institutional engagements, noted lawyer Bill Morgan, who speculated on the timing relative to similar news from SBI Holdings. “Can’t be a coincidence so soon after the SBI entity became an validator,” Morgan commented, hinting at a possibly coordinated expansion of institutional support within the ecosystem in Asia.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.5045.

Bitcoin Regains $63K as Japan Public Firm Migrates to BTC-only Reserve


							

Metaplanet adopts Bitcoin as its main treasury asset in response to Japan’s economic challenges.



The company boasts a Bitcoin portfolio of 117.7 BTC worth $32.71 million.



Bitcoin value reclaimed $63K amid Metaplanet’s new BTC-only reserver policy.




Metaplanet, a Japanese public company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has unveiled a white paper detailing its decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. This strategic pivot comes as a response to Japan’s persistent economic challenges, which include high levels of government debt, enduring negative real interest rates, and a weakening yen.



Metaplanet’s white paper outlines a “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only” approach, departing from traditional treasury management strategies. The company strongly believes in Bitcoin’s fundamental advantages over traditional currencies, other stores of value, and different crypto-assets. 



Furthermore, Metaplanet hails Bitcoin as an “absolutely scarce digital synthetic monetary commodity” with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. According to the paper, this feature sets Bitcoin apart from other monetary systems and commodities.



Contrary to widespread criticism, Metaplanet champions Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism as a critical advantage. The white paper highlights the mining difficulty adjustment, which ensures that the cost of producing new bitcoins increases over time, as a unique attribute that distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional commodities.









Looking ahead, Metaplanet plans to leverage various capital market instruments to grow its Bitcoin reserves. This strategy seeks to protect the company’s balance sheet from the yen’s devaluation and establish Metaplanet as a forward-thinking investment vehicle on the global stage. 



By capitalizing on Japan’s unique position with low global capital costs, the company aims to enhance its competitive edge internationally. According to public records, Metaplanet holds 117.7 BTC, valued at $32.71 million. The news of Metaplanet migrating to a Bitcoin-only reserve has had a notable impact on the value of BTC. At press time, Bitcoin has increased by over 3% to reclaim the $63K threshold following the news.

Bitcoin miner Bitfarms CEO to depart immediately in response to lawsuit

Geoffrey Morphy, the now former President and CEO of cryptocurrency mining firm Bitfarms, will be stepping down immediately after filing a lawsuit against the company in Canada.In a May 13 notice, Bitfarms said it had terminated Morphy as CEO and president ahead of a previously announced plan to have him continue leading the company until a replacement could be found. According to the mining firm, Morphy filed a $27 million lawsuit against Bitfarms on May 10 in the Superior Court of Ontario, claiming “breach of contract, wrongful dismissal and aggravated and punitive damages.”“The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously,” said Bitfarms. “Nicolas Bonta, Chairman and Co-Founder of the Company, has been appointed interim President and Chief Executive Officer, and will lead the Company until the executive search is completed and [Morphy’s] successor is appointed.”Bitfarms announced in March that it planned to seek a replacement for Morphy, who had been with the company since 2020. According to the mining firm, it will appoint a new CEO “in the next several weeks.” Cointelegraph reached out to Morphy for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Related: Bitcoin miner Bitfarms purchases additional 51,908 ASICs amid bull marketFounded in 2017, Bitfarms has 11 Bitcoin (BTC) mining facilities in the United States, Canada, Paraguay and Argentina.

                        MoonPay confirmed to Cryptonews on Monday that it has donated $1 million to the digital advocacy group Stand With Crypto ahead of the 2024 elections.“Today, two things are abundantly clear: this year’s election will define the future of our industry in the United States, and it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that want to positively advance crypto innovation for everyone,” the crypto payment service said in a statement.MoonPay Makes Big Stand With Crypto Donation
Founded by Ivan Soto-Wright and Victor Faramond in 2019, MoonPay donated because of “mounting regulatory pressure” on the blockchain industry.The digital asset company’s announcement comes just days after news broke that Stand With Crypto launched its own political action committee (PAC) slated to fund pro-crypto politicians running for office across the U.S.“In solidarity with Stand With Crypto, we are supporting elected officials to create a clear regulatory framework for crypto that fosters innovation while protecting consumers,” MoonPay’s statement continued.Crypto Heats Up Amidst 2024 Elections
Stand With Crypto has backed several political candidates so far this year,  including Congressional candidates Eddy Morales (D-OR), Shomari Figures (D-AL), and Troy Downing (R-MT), as well as Senatorial hopefuls Jim Justice (R-WV) and Jim Banks (R-IN).“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November,” Nick Carr, Chief Strategist for Stand With Crypto, told Reuters last week.But Monday’s donation is far from the first time MoonPay has been tied to the U.S. political scene.Last year, Soto-Wright made headlines for a $500,000 donation to Bitcoin-friendly Miami Mayor Frances Suarez made via an LLC owned and controlled by the MoonPay founder, prompting a complaint to be filed with the Federal Election Commission.Critics argue that his mayoral donation may have violated straw donor laws since the funds were provided by the MoonPay founder instead of the money his LLC generated. Soto-Wright has since denied any wrongdoing.The digital asset payment services provider’s Stand With Crypto donation comes as tensions rise over the 2024 U.S. presidential election, with recent polls showing Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden nearly tied.Trump has long been known for his positive stance toward digital assets and announced just last week that his campaign will be taking donations in cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, Biden has advocated for increased regulation within the sector, recently announcing he would veto any attempts to overturn the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s SAB 121.

In response, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino criticized Garlinghouse’s comments as fear-mongering on Twitter, reminding that Ripple was undergoing an SEC investigation itself. Ardoino’s tweet accused Garlinghouse of spreading fear about USDT.



According to Paolo Ardoino, Tether has blocked over $1.3 billion in illicit transactions over the past three years, including around $1.6 million related to terrorist financing. 





Tether has cooperated with law enforcement, blocking wallets upon 339 requests, 158 from the U.S., and has blocked over $639 million in collaboration with U.S. law enforcement.



Ripple CEO Clarifies Tether Comments



Garlinghouse later defended Tether on Twitter, reiterating its importance in the ecosystem and his belief that the U.S. government’s actions stem from a desire for more control over dollar-backed stablecoin issuers. 




My point was that the US govt has clearly indicated they want more control over USD-backed stablecoin issuers, and thus, Tether, as the largest player, is in their line of sight.

Crypto Howls as Circuit Breakers Restrain Red-Hot GameStop (GME) Rally

But it was a stilted rally, halted repeated by the U.S. stock market's famous – or infamous, depending on one's perspective – system of "circuit breakers" designed to prevent prices from getting out of control.

The broader crypto ecosystem is in recovery mode, a trend that is currently being led by Bitcoin (BTC). At the moment, the combined crypto market cap has soared by 1.44% in 24 hours with the valuation coming in at $2.29 trillion. Of this reboot, the XRP price is subtly in the spotlight as it has joined the rally to flip its most important resistance in the short term.At the time of writing, the coin is changing hands for $0.5047 atop a 0.2% surge in 24 hours. While XRP is still down by 5.09% for the week, market watchers believe the current flipping of the $0.5 resistance point's support might suggest the worst of the drawdown is over.After soaring as high as $0.72 this year, XRP backtracked and fell as low as $0.48. The coin has been struggling from this low price level and the $0.57 point since at least mid-April. Breaking the $0.5 level now serves as a litmus test for XRP as analysts anticipate what the next moves will be.Overall, XRP has maintained relatively poorer-than-expected volatility; however, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) now pegged at 43.15, the overselling may soon be in reverse mode. There has been a lot of network development around the XRP Ledger protocol that might impact the outlook of XRP in the long term. With new validators being onboarded, XRPL now stands as one of the L1 protocols with a massive enterprise backer, including SBI and Infinite Block.The outcome of the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit may also shape the future growth prospects of XRP in the long term. Should Ripple Labs be charged a minimal deterrent fee for violating securities laws as concerns sales of XRP to institutional investors, there may be a boom in the price of the coin overall.

Antonio Juliano steps down as CEO of dYdX

The founder of the decentralized exchange dYdX is stepping down as CEO after seven years of heading the crypto derivatives platform.In a May 13 blog post, Antonio Juliano announced his decision to move from the exchange's daily operations to the position of chairman and president. "I’m stepping down as CEO of dYdX Trading In., transitioning to Chairman & President," wrote Juliano. The company is now led by Ivo Crnkovic-Rubsamen, dYdX’s former chief strategy officer. According to his LinkedIn profile, Crnkovic-Rubsamen is a former trader who has worked at the decentralized exchange since 2022.“As I realized I did not need to be CEO, I worked to shepherd other leaders at the company on their own leadership journeys, until one of them was ready to run the company himself,” said Juliano in reference to Crnkovic-Rubsamen. Juliano did not mention his future professional goals but suggested a “next step” for his career: “I have no plans for what comes next for me, and no idea what I’ll do.” Prior to founding dYdX, Juliano was a software engineer at companies such as Coinbase, Uber and MongoDB.According to data from DefiLlama, dYdX has seen a surge in activity in recent months as the crypto markets rebounded. The DEX has a market capitalization of more than $1.1 billion at the time of writing, and $463 million in total value locked. The DEX's annualized revenue is at $35.4 million. In total, derivatives activity generated over $1.31 trillion of trading volume since 2021. Derivatives volume at dYdX. Source: DefiLlama.Much of the recent trading activity could be linked to ongoing developments surrounding the protocol, such as the launch of dYdX's own layer-1 blockchain in October 2023. Based on the native DYDX token for network transactions, the network enables returning gas fees back to validators and stakers as rewards. In addition, dYdX rolled out its v4 upgrade in January, moving the DEX from Ethereum to the Cosmos network. Magazine: 1 in 6 new Base meme coins are scams, 91% have vulnerabilities

Amid Biotech Pitfalls, this Stock Has Outperformed NVDA in the Last 3 Months - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Biotech stocks, especially of smaller companies, are notoriously risky investment exposures. Because their bread and butter is drug development, its complexity cannot be easily accounted for. 



Although the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 86% of new molecular entities (NMEs) in 2022, they must pass multiple clinical phase trials. According to a study from Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) Industry Analysis and BioMedTracker (BMT), the FDA, on average, approved nearly 9% of Phase I in the early 2000s. 



Additionally, the probability of success (PoS) shifts depending on the use of biomarkers in patient selection, according to the 2019 Biostatistics study. During those trying times, biotech companies must carefully balance their limited budgets until a drug pipeline hits the jackpot, as recently happened with Legend Biotech’s (NASDAQ: LEGN) CARVYKTI for bone marrow cancer.



The added complexity of biotech investing is financial. By the time Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) paid $43 billion for oncology firm Seagen (SGEN) in December 2023, the stock had gained 70% value on a yearly basis, from $124 to $212 per share. This indicates that behind-the-scenes dealings can cut short potential upside for retail investors.



Given these factors, what is ImmunityBio (NASDAQ: IBRX) ‘s status as a prospective biostock candidate?



ImmunityBio’s Claim to Fame



Founded in 2014 in San Diego, California, ImmunityBio is a clinical-stage biotech firm. As its name suggests, it specializes in immunity-enhancing therapies and vaccines. In particular, the FDA approved ImmunityBio’s Anktiva this April. The drug is designated an FDA Breakthrough Therapy, as it activates the body’s T-cell immune system to attack tumor cells.



In combination with ImmunityBio’s Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, Anktiva (N-803) is set to treat non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) from mid-May. For investors, bladder cancer is fairly common, at an average rate of 18.2 per 100,000, with 75-80% of newly diagnosed cases classified as NMBIC.



In 2024, Anktiva’s addressable market in the US is 83,190, as estimated new cases by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program under the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Of course, this doesn’t account for cases in which life expectancy varies according to stage. For example, stage 0 has a 98% five-year survival rate, while stage III bladder cancer has a 46% five-year survival rate.



The new drug’s recommended dosage is once per week for six weeks, with a potential follow-up after three months. Anktiva’s pricing strategy is set at around $35,800 per dose, potentially generating around $1.1 million in revenue, including course and maintenance. 





ImmunityBio’s Financials



On May 9th, ImmunityBio delivered its Q1 2024 earnings. Typical of smaller biotech startups, the firm reported a $134.1 million net loss, substantially higher than the $116.6 million net loss in the year-ago quarter. In share terms, this was a $0.20 net loss per common share (basic and diluted).



However, operating expense losses decreased from $111.9 million to $95.2 million during the period. ImmunityBio left the quarter with $133.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash ($334k). 



The company’s liabilities remained flat at $1.091 billion from the year-ago quarter. This puts the debt-to-equity ratio at a high negative 1.161, confirming that the company has more debt than assets. However, this is not that surprising for the capital-intensive biotech sector.



Against the industry average of 24.83, ImmunityBio’s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio was -8.2 in 2023 and estimated -10.83 for 2024, per Nasdaq data. With the rollout of Anktiva and BCG, the P/E growth forecast in 2024 is 24.75. The latter PEG value is determined by dividing the P/E ratio by the expected future earnings growth rate.



ImmunityBio’s Price Moves and Forecast



Over a one-year period, IBRX stock is up 165%, or 62.8% year-to-date, firmly leaving the penny stock territory in March. From the 52-week low of $1.25, IBRX shares are now 550% up at $8.12 per share.



However, this is still 23% lower than the 52-week high of $10.53, suggesting some room for growth ahead of the Anktiva launch. Nasdaq’s aggregated forecast data suggests an average price target twelve months ahead of $6 per share. WSJ’s average price target is more optimistic at $7.50 per share.

OKX surpasses 50% of Bitcoin Runes market share

Crypto exchange OKX now accounts for 51.08% of Bitcoin Runes' daily trading volume through its Web3 marketplace. According to data from Ordinals analytic platform GeniiData, Runes' trading activity on other platforms, such as UniSat and MagicEden, has steadily declined since April, holding a combined 48.83% market share. Almost all Bitcoin Runes' trading activity is conducted through the three aforementioned firms and their platforms. Bitcoin Runes' trading activity by exchange. Source: GeniiDataRunes is a new protocol for issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network that launched on April 20, the day of the Bitcoin halving. Less than one month after its inception, the protocol has generated a staggering 2,287 BTC ($143.6 million) in transaction fees and now forms the basis of the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem along with Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which were invented last year. It's not just Bitcoin Runes that are gaining traction within the ecosystem. Since its launch in April, Omnichain yield-generating protocol SolvBTC, which allows users to earn yields on their Bitcoin through minted derivatives on Arbitrum, Merlin, and BNB Smart Chain, has accumulated $920.62 million in total value locked. The protocol currently has over 12,000 BTC staked among 30,000 participants and generates annual returns of 5% to 10% on users’ BTC deposits. On April 30, the firm announced it would introduce re-staking yields for its users’ Bitcoin through a partnership with Babylon. The Babylon protocol allows users to self-custody their idle BTC and earn rewards from using the underlying BTC to verify transactions on proof-of-stake networks. Fisher Yu, co-founder of Babylon, said that he hopes that Bitcoin can become more than a store of value but also a “source of dynamic, secure yield” for DeFi. Babylon explaining the mechanism of its BTC staking protocol. Source: BabylonSimilarly, Bitcoin smart contract developer MicroVisionChain plans to enact a Proof of Build model to incentivize ecosystem developers to build Bitcoin interchain asset bridges, Bitcoin decentralized exchanges, wallets, and support for BRC-20 assets on the protocol. Under the proposal, 65% of its native SPACE token would be distributed to builds according to their respective contribution. The project currently has a diluted market cap of $166 million.On May 6, the Bitcoin blockchain surpassed 1 billion in transactions. During its 5,603-day existence, Bitcoin has had an average of 178,475 daily transactions. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s biggest rival, Ethereum, has processed well over two billion transactions since it launched in July 2015. Related: El Salvador launches $360M Bitcoin treasury monitoring website

Base has been receiving increasingly more attention since its launch – and may be on its way to surpassing Solana. This would be very beneficial for the coins it houses.There are several reasons why this may occur. Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 blockchain is expecting significant ecosystem developments, but also on-chain metrics are nothing to ignore.Important developments include Base Chain Smart Wallet and a smart contract called ‘Magic Spend.’As for on-chain metrics, looking at Base’s 24-hour trading volume, we find it at $125.47 million today, according to DeFiLlama.At the beginning of this year, that number was just 21.63 million.Furthermore, its total value locked (TVL) stands at $1.508 billion, nearing its $1.65 all-time high.Again, at the beginning of the year, TVL stood at $437 million.

Meme coin BONK announced several developments this week.On Wednesday, the project’s teams revealed that it joined hands with TipLink, a lightweight wallet designed to make transferring digital assets as easy as sending a link.BONK said its users can now use only email login on BONKrewards and lock their coins.There are currently over 3.28 trillion BONK locked there.Per TipLink’s documentation, a crypto user can create a TipLink and send that link to anyone over any platform, be it a text, discord, email, or something else.“The amazing thing is, the link is the wallet,” it said.TopLinks can hold SOL, SPL tokens (tokens that operate on the Solana blockchain), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and semi-fungible tokens (SFTs).Therefore, TipLink offers decentralization and self-custody without seed phrases, key management, apps, and browser extensions, the project stated.Then, on Saturday, BONK announced that it launched BONKmark E-cards ahead of Mother’s Day.Thanks to the collaboration with TipLink, it allows users to send BONK anywhere with email only, and “have moms all over the world use their BONK.”BONK said it would show the recipients how to send the BONK to a CEX, change it to fiat, or deposit it to BONKrewards.E-cards include several designs for Mother’s Day, celebrations, and milestones.

Arthur Hayes: 'Major Economies To Print Even More Money' In The Next 24 Months - Benzinga

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, on Monday laid out a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency market, fueled by factors including the upcoming US presidential election and continued expansion of the monetary base.What Happened: Hayes believes the election will lead to looser monetary policies as the Biden administration seeks re-election, a scenario historically correlated with crypto rallies.Discussing the potential catalysts for Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD price movement, Hayes stated, “You can look at the previous halvings and anywhere between 4 to 18 months later you get a new all-time high. More important thing is that the major economies around the world are going to print even more money between now and, say, the next 18 to 24 months.”He pinpointed the U.S. presidential election as a pivotal event, explaining, “It’s the global empire, its financial policy influences with the Chinese, the Japanese, the Europeans all do.”Hayes elaborated on the strategies likely to be employed by current U.S. leaders to secure an election win, suggesting significant monetary easing could be on the horizon. “Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury secretary, and Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, are doing everything they can to make sure that Joe Biden gets reelected. And that basically means how do I reduce the cost of government borrowing so that him and his Democratic Party can hand out more goodies to the electorate and get reelected?”Also Read: ‘Republicans Smell Blood In The Water:’ Uniswap CEO Warns Democrats Of ‘Swing States Level Miscalculation’ On CryptoWith the election approaching, Hayes predicts both parties will promise financial incentives to voters, funded by increased national borrowing and monetary expansion. “Regardless of who wins, whoever wins there are campaigning on. I’m going to give you something that you don’t have to pay for, and I’m going to pay for it by borrowing my money. I’m going to pay for it by using the central bank to print money.”Hayes also touched on the M2 money supply indicator, noting its significant correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. “The problem with M2 is that it doesn’t capture all the things that are used as credit money in the economy. And every time there’s a new problem, the elites in charge come up with a new way to confuse people about how they’re going to print money.”What’s Next: The implications of the U.S. presidential election on the global financial landscape, including cryptocurrencies, will be a significant theme at Benzinga's upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event is set to explore how geopolitical and economic policies might shape the future of digital currencies and assets.Read Next: Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week?Image: Shutterstock

MoonPay Backs ‘Stand With Crypto’ Group with a Donation - DailyCoin


        

MoonPay has donated to a crypto advocacy group.



The company said the donation was on behalf of everyone on its team.



The donation comes a few days after the advocacy group created a new political committee.




Web3 infrastructure firm MoonPay announced on Monday that it has donated to the Coinbase-led digital assets advocacy group Stand With Crypto.



MoonPay’s donation comes after the advocacy group formed a new Political Action Committee (PAC) on May 10. The PAC aims to raise money from over 400,000 members to support crypto-friendly candidates in U.S. elections.



“In Solidarity with Stand With Crypto”



On March 13, MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright shared a note with his team members, informing them that the company had “made a donation on behalf of everyone” to Stand With Crypto.




The CEO emphasized the importance of the upcoming U.S. elections to the crypto industry, noting that MoonPay is supporting like-minded elected officials in creating a clear regulatory framework that fosters crypto innovation and consumer protection.



“Today, two things are abundantly clear: this year's election will define the future of our industry in the United States; and, it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that genuinely wish to positively advance this innovation for everyone,” Ivan wrote.



While MoonPay CEO’s note to employees did not specify how much was donated, Fox Business Journalist Eleanor Terret claimed that the donation amounted to $1 million.



In the meantime, the Coinbase-led initiative has recruited 479,975 advocates and 165,330 policymaker contacts to fight to keep crypto in the U.S. According to the group’s website, Stand With Crypto advocates have donated over $86 million so far.
