Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests a potential bullish surge for Shiba Inu (SHIB), the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, predicting a 20% upswing if it manages to breach the upper boundary of a descending parallel channel at $0.00002444. Martinez's analysis, depicted in a chart attached to the post, indicates SHIB's trajectory aiming at surpassing this crucial resistance level.Today's cryptocurrency market saw a notable uptick, particularly for meme-based digital assets. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the meme cryptocurrency sector experienced a significant 5.56% surge in capitalization, amounting to a staggering $52.94 billion. Trading volumes for the meme-inspired tokens surged by over 118%, underscoring the heightened interest and activity within this niche.Source: Ali MartinezLeading the charge alongside SHIB are other meme coins like Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE). This surge in meme coin activity coincides with the resurgence of interest in the crypto space, possibly fueled by the return of Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill to the limelight. "Roaring Kitty" is backGill, notable for his involvement in the GameStop (GME) stock short-squeeze saga in 2021, has once again become a prominent figure in financial discussions.  A former financial advisor and investor, Gill became widely known for his bullish stance toward GameStop. His enthusiastic and persuasive posts attracted a large following in the online trading community, influencing many retail investors to buy shares of GameStop, creating a sort of cult.While SHIB stands out among its meme coin counterparts, Martinez's forecast injects a renewed sense of optimism into its trajectory. The potential 20% upswing, contingent upon breaching the resistance level, could herald a significant bullish trend for the SHIB community.

Dogecoin Gets 62% Boost on Derivatives as Bulls Regain Control - DailyCoin


        
Dogecoin approaches $0.15, tacking on a high price correlation with Bitcoin.



DOGE’s daily volume on Derivatives nears $2 billion amid reiterated interest.



The top dog meme coin faces stiff competition from PEPE coin on Derivatives.
Dogecoin (DOGE) embarked on a micro rally to start the week, clinging 3%  to briefly approach $0.15 resistance. However, these gains have yet to provide the strength needed for DOGE to soar above $0.15.Can Bulls Spurt DOGE Back to $0.20?This particular price barrier is crucial for DOGE to clear on the way up, as 11.35B DOGE coins are held in 261.78K cryptocurrency addresses at an average price of $0.142. If Dogecoin surges past this support cluster, the next barrier between $0.149 and $0.181 consists of 13.31B Dogecoins split between 340.45K crypto addresses.Judging from the volume held at the aforementioned price barriers, Dogecoin’s $0.20 price target could come into play if it continues to highly correlate with Bitcoin (BTC) and no extra sell pressure arrives. At the current Dogecoin price levels, the DOGE combined order book is favorable for crypto bulls, with $82 million in DOGE bids over the past 24 hours compared to $76 million in completed DOGE 24-hour sales.DOGE Banks on the Rapid Hike in DerivativesAlongside the high price correlation of 0.9 with BTC, another upside for Dogecoin is the 62% upswing in Derivatives trade volume. As depicted in the graph below, Dogecoin’s Derivatives market trading volume is nearing $2 billion, as both long and short DOGE traders partook in position placements that boosted the Open Interest (OI) rate by 4.86% over the past 24 hours.While the general long versus short DOGE position ratio is slightly on the short-selling side, it shall be noted that OKX customers are the most bullish on DOGE, on a 3.61 ratio between long and short positions. Secondly, long Dogecoin Derivatives traders on Binance outsource the short-sells more than twice, at a 2.0452 ratio based on DOGE positions.While Dogecoin couldn’t gain the same popularity on Spot markets this Monday, the overall DOGE trading volume on Spot still exceeded $1 billion. DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) dwells around 50, which means that DOGE is neither in an oversold nor an overbought condition. Finally, a positive Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) index above 0.10 shows a renewed interest in trading the token on Spot markets.On the Flipside
While Dogecoin is the clear leader by global market cap in the meme coin department, Pepe Coin (PEPE) challenges its popularity in derivatives.



According to the real-time on-chain data by CoinGlass, PEPE’s trading volume on Derivatives has breached $2B with a positive long versus short ratio at 1.0259.
Why This MattersDogecoin’s status as the second largest Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain aside from Bitcoin (BTC) puts the original memecoin at the top of the list of the most talked-about alternative currencies.

Will the Law to Determine the Fate of Cryptocurrencies in the US Pass? Is It Favorable for the Sector? - Bitcoin Sistemi

TD Cowen, one of the leading investment banks in the USA, recently shed light on the future of the Financial Innovation and Technology Act for the 21st Century (FIT21), a comprehensive crypto market structure bill. Although the bill has a slim chance of becoming law in the current Congress, it is seen as a critical cornerstone for future legislative efforts.
The Republican-led FIT21 bill will be voted on in the House of Representatives at the end of the month. The bill proposes a comprehensive approach to regulating the emerging crypto market and aims to impose greater regulatory responsibility on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC is described as a softer regulator for cryptocurrencies.


But TD Cowen's Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, warns against getting caught up in the details of this legislation. “There is no chance of it becoming law in this Congress,” they wrote in a memo. The group cites the Senate Banking's lack of preparatory work and Democrats' focus on investor protections as the main reasons for this.
Despite these obstacles, TD Cowen sees FIT21 as a critical cornerstone for Congress when a new effort to enact crypto market structure legislation is expected in 2025/2026. The bill brings together members of the House of Representatives and shifts the focus to the Senate, allowing it to introduce its own bill.





The FIT21 vote could also shed light on how Democrats and Republicans view critical issues like anti-money laundering and investor protections. TD Cowen expects FIT21 to pass the full House.
FIT21, which passed the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee last summer, faces a tougher challenge than a bill regulating stablecoins. Announcing the vote on FIT21, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry called the bill a bipartisan effort “to finally provide clarity.”



Former President Donald Trump recently expressed his support for crypto. However, it is unclear whether he will maintain this pro-crypto stance if he wins the presidential election later this year.
TD Cowen notes that Trump could be a “problem” in the future. They believe Trump risks further polarizing crypto oversight, which could make it harder to find bipartisan consensus. “We will monitor this closely,” the investment bank concluded.

Is Bitcoin A 90% Surge Incoming? Analyst Sees Bottom As Inflation Data In Focus


								Bitcoin prices are moving sideways when writing and are generally firm. Even though there are marks of strength, the world’s most valuable coin is still swimming against ferocious downstream currents and could risk plunging below $60,000 and May 2024 lows. 
Is The Bitcoin Bear Run Over? Prices Retest The 100-Day Moving Average
Though there are risks, one analyst on X is upbeat. In a post, the trader noted that prices have retested the 100-day moving average. Historically, whenever Bitcoin has dipped to or slightly below this level, it has marked a local bottom, followed by a significant upward rally. 
BTC retesting 100-day moving average | Source: Analyst on X
Looking at the daily chart, the analyst notes that the most recent instance occurred in January, where a price test of the 100-day moving average preceded a 90% surge. 
Now that prices have once more retested this level, if history guides, it is likely that Bitcoin has found a local bottom, and a bullish outcome, last seen in January 2024, could be on the offing.  

Though traders are hopeful, there is no guarantee that prices will surge as expected. As mentioned earlier, the coin remains under immense liquidation pressure, and sellers have been soaking in attempts for higher highs.

The daily chart shows local resistance and support are at $66,000 and $56,500, respectively. As prices move sideways, the trend direction established will largely depend on the breakout direction. 
A conclusive close above $66,000, buoyed by rising participation, might surge BTC prices. However, whether it will spike by 90% or higher like in the past remains to be seen.
Inflation Data: A Catalyst For Bitcoin Growth?
With traders upbeat, this week promises to be pivotal, with inflation data taking center stage. On May 14, the United States Producer Price Index (PPI) will be released. A day later, on May 15, the public will know where the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading stands. 

While economists anticipate a slight decrease in inflation compared to previous readings, volatility is expected. If inflation slows down in the United States, the greenback could weaken. Subsequently, Bitcoin may edge higher as investors seek alternatives to store value.
Inflation data versus Oil prices | Source: Analyst on X
In a post, one analyst believes falling oil prices and a robust labor market point towards an overall softening of inflation in the United States. If this trend guides, it aligns well with the expectation of lower PPI and CPI readings this week; a net bullish for BTC.

What's a BFG Token? | 100% Project’s Revenue for BFG Support



                    

Countless tokens appear in the crypto world nowadays. However, only some cryptocurrencies effectively combine earning opportunities and strategic vision for strengthening a token from the inside. Such projects build long-term prospects for token utilities and have a loyal community of holders. 



The BFG token can be classified as one of these tokens. It has taken on these qualities and shown clear tokenomics, aligning with the idea of sharing revenue with users in both the project and the token.




This article will reveal the primary BFG utilities, exclusive benefits for its holders, and token price prediction. We will also share how the BetFury project allocates 100% of its revenue to sustain the BFG token.



What is a BFG Token?



BFG is a native token of the BetFury ecosystem, launched on a BSC Chain (BEP-20) in June 2021. It has over 67,000 holders who use BFG for trading, gaming, sports betting, getting passive income from staking, etc. More about BFG: https://betfury.com/about-bfg. 



BFG has become integral to the BetFury project, constantly moving towards new achievements. It plays a vital role in the ecosystem and rises in market value due to the robust deflationary strategy. One of the fundamental points of this strategy is the direction of GGR (Gross Gaming Revenue) to the BFG Staking pool, the main crypto utility.Do you know other projects that spend 100% of the team’s revenue to support the native token? Moreover, BetFury seasons it with permanent BFG buybacks that positively affect the BFG price. Therefore, having stable revenue, the platform spends it on token development and its long-term perspective.




History Behind BFG Growth



The BFG token was launched to distribute the platform revenue and passive income to its owners. Gradually, as the project scaled, the number of collaborations increased, providing additional utilities for the BFG token, including exchange options and additional income opportunities for users.Tokens were mined by playing in a one-to-one ratio for the user and team. After the end of BFG mining in June 2023, the total supply amounted to 5 billion tokens. Simultaneously with the mining process, the primary utility of the BFG token was launched – revenue share. Users who became BFG holders began to participate in this distribution mechanism. After listing on top exchanges like PancakeSwap, BFG increased its liquidity and market circulation, taking a well-deserved place among the most popular tokens in the crypto-iGaming niche.



Strategic BFG Deflationary Mechanism



After the end of BFG mining, BetFury took on the most critical mission – escalating the value of BFG. Stable and healthy tokenomics allowed the team to create a new deflationary strategy to accomplish this task. The new deflationary mechanism involves repurchasing tokens from the market using the BetFury team’s revenue. 



BFG Buyback & Burn Mechanism



The team uses funds from the platform’s revenue streams to buy back BFG tokens from the market and conduct a monthly BFG token burn, reducing the circulating supply. These revenue streams include:




crypto staking penalty fee;



crypto swap fee;



borrowing liquidation and fee;



Futures fee



staked BFG by the BetFury team;




BFG Buyback & Lock



Each month, BetFury’s team buys back tokens from the circulating supply using funds generated from the mentioned revenue streams and stores them in a dedicated wallet known as the Treasury. Periodically, these repurchased BFG tokens will be distributed as incentives to stBFG/BFG holders and active platform users. 




This transparent and innovative deflationary strategy demonstrates that the BetFury team will focus all its efforts on boosting the token and supporting BFG holders.



How to Earn with BFG?



BFG has many utilities that reveal the token’s full range of usefulness.



Staking BFG



It’s the primary tool for passive earning. BetFury offers BFG Staking with an opportunity to double rewards by converting BFG to stBFG (a special native token) with zero fees. It provides up to 70% APY and daily payouts in BTC, ETH, BNB, USDT, and TRX.According to the mechanism for replenishing the BFG Staking pool, the part of GGR is distributed among BFG and stBFG holders in the BFG Staking pool. This way, the BetFury team can consistently support the pool’s profitability for users by providing a high APY. Additionally, the BetFury team has locked 1 billion BFG tokens for three years, opting not to benefit from the x2 APY but to earn from a regular APY in the BFG Staking pool. Such a lock ensures the team’s serious commitment to token development and its deflationary model.



Trading BFG



Everyone can trade assets on BetFury using Crypto Swap. It’s an internal exchange that provides fast transactions and low fees. Besides, you can trade BFG on top exchanges like Pancake Swap, Biswap, etc.



Holding BFG tokens



By holding a BFG token, you also gain benefits: 




High passive income from BFG staking;



Access to exclusive features and bonuses on BetFury;



Potential to get the high-value token thanks to strategic deflation mechanism and smart tokenomics (link);



Additional huge rewards for all holders are available in different formats.




Playing BFG



BetFury has over 8,000 slots and 20 Original games. Therefore, players can easily place bets and multiply their BFG assets.



Betting BFG in Sports



The platform offers over 80 sports betting options in BFG. Users also can get beneficial bonuses by placing BFG bets.



BFG Bonuses & Events



BetFury has a profitable Welcome Pack with up to a $10,500 Deposit bonus and 225 Free Spins. Moreover, each user can receive pleasant bonuses for activity and participate in various large-scale events with huge rewards:




Rise your Rank on BetFury to receive up to 25% Cashback in BFG;



Loot fantastic Rakeback and Weekly & Monthly Bonuses from Rank 1;



Get the BFG tokens during Coindrop, Rain, etc;



Choose great Bonus Packs in your Bonus Cabinet;



Join regular battles, events, and tournaments to multiply BFG;



Gather Weekly and Monthly Bonuses in BFG based on your wager and lost deposit funds between accrual periods;



Be an active VIP user to earn BFG regularly;



Receive a boosted TG Monthly Bonus in BFG after connecting the BetFury Telegram Bot to your account.




The different uses of the BFG token help it stay strong in changing markets, and its strategy of reducing supply makes it more valuable over time.



Is the BFG token secure?



BFG got a CertiK certification on September 17, 2021. This report showed the token’s reliability and security. Moreover, BetFury also received a Curacao gaming license. As a result, the platform gained users’ trust and assured all BFG holders.



BFG Token Price Prediction



According to Coincodex forecasts, the BFG price may increase by 228% and reach $0.0567 by June 6, 2024. Based on historical cycles, the platform also determined the minimum and maximum value of the token for 2025: $0.017284 and $0.081670. The upgraded tokenomics and deflationary strategy can support these positive dynamics. Therefore, such predictions have a good chance of coming true. In any case, remember that the crypto market is very volatile. Experienced traders should keep their finger on the pulse and always conduct their own research.



Conclusion



Ecosystem upgrades are essential for any crypto platform competing for a leading position in the industry. That is why BetFury has updated its tokenomics and introduced a new transparent deflationary model to empower its BFG token. The platform has directed 100% of iGaming revenue to support BFG tokens in the BFG Staking pool, thus granting users favorable conditions and stable APY rewards. The other part of the non-iGaming income will be used for BFG buybacks to fill the Burning and Treasury funds. As an outcome, the BetFury team is committed to fostering a healthy token economy and facilitating the continuous growth of the ecosystem.

Big Brother surveillance dystopia is now reality at Binance


When Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), it agreed to allow two government agencies to appoint compliance monitors within the company.
As a result, Binance agreed to let the DoJ monitor its operations for three years and FinCEN for five.
After a lengthy bidding process, the DoJ picked Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) to operate its monitorship while, according to Bloomberg, law firm Sullivan & Cromwell will likely fulfill FinCEN’s.
Never before in the history of Binance has such an expansive surveillance apparatus existed. Indeed, as the world’s largest crypto exchange and hub for tens of millions of crypto traders around the world, these DoJ and FinCEN monitorships are arguably the most powerful and comprehensive government surveillance operations in the history of crypto.
US crypto surveillance backend for almost all crypto trades
For the first time in crypto’s 15-year history, the US government has workers installed within the world’s largest operating crypto exchange. It’s a leap in surveillance by orders of magnitude. The increased power above its prior data sources — such as one-off historical subpoenas, widely neglected suspicious activity reports, or Chainalysis blockchain analytics — cannot be overstated.
According to Binance’s sworn settlement, it must provide FRA, as DoJ’s authorized contractor, access to “all information, documents, records, facilities, and employees, as reasonably requested,” including “direct observation of selected systems and procedures of the company, including those related to know-your-customer, customer due diligence, US sanctions screening, real-time transaction monitoring, law enforcement notifications, internal accounting controls, record-keeping, and internal audit procedures.”
Monitorships probably explain CZ’s prison getaway
Given the immeasurable quantities of data to which the US government now has access — including tens of millions of people and untold criminal acts by Binance users for the next five years — it’s somewhat unsurprising that its CEO Changpeng Zhao was able to get off with such a short prison sentence.
Like Binance the company, Zhao, its founder and CEO, also pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws. However, he received only a relatively short, four-month prison sentence.
Many observers attribute the judge’s leniency in Zhao’s prison sentence to the expansive, dual monitorships to which he agreed. For the first time, the US government has guaranteed, court-enforced oversight of Binance’s global operations. According to Dennis Kelleher speaking to Law360 reporters, the monitorship plea agreement made it “preordained that he was not going to get a very serious sentence.”

All other crypto surveillance tools in distant second place
Binance is by far the world’s largest crypto exchange and for years, it has facilitated multiples of the transactions of any of its closest competitors. Therefore, from a crime-fighting perspective, these years of surveillance will prove invaluable for US law enforcement efforts against crypto-using criminals.
According to a commentator, “It means bad actors going forward need to be really careful with their operational security practices to make sure they don’t pull in funds from an address which was incidentally doxxed because of an interaction with Binance.”
Binance has not settled the SEC’s multi-billion dollar lawsuit — that litigation regarding unregistered securities continues — and the crypto giant also faces continued law enforcement abroad.

Former CEO Turned Author? Binance's CZ Teases What’s Next - DailyCoin


        

Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has hinted at an upcoming adventure.



The former Binance CEO was recently sentenced to a four-month prison term.



Changpeng Zhao vowed to focus on new projects in the future.




The legal tussle involving Binance and the United States Department of Justice has recently concluded, culminating with the long-awaited sentencing of founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. However, contrasting the broader expectation of a lengthy stay behind bars, CZ bagged a mere four-month jail time. 



With ample free time now at his disposal, the former Binance CEO may now be exploring new ventures.



Binance CZ Taps Into Author Era?



Joining in a books-themed thread initiated by Binance co-founder Yi He on May 12, Changpeng Zhao hinted at the possibility of authoring a book in the upcoming months. 




Zhao, who has been spending more time on social media since his sentencing, cheekily responded to X user Omobola Oduntan’s tweet, which expressed anticipation of the former Binance CEO’s book. “I got some “quiet time” coming up. Will use that to write something,” he stated.







The former Binance CEO’s words follow his post-sentencing vow to focus on more educative ventures following his legal challenges, including establishing a learning platform for young underprivileged students to access free basic education.



While CZ’s statements were lighthearted, Yi He co-signed his message, hinting at the details the potential book will cover.



Changpeng Zhao’s Memoir-y Lane?



Despite CZ’s recent history being marked by rocky regulatory challenges, he undoubtedly remains an influential figure in the crypto industry.




From humble beginnings in Jiangsu Province to founding Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Zhao’s journey to success is an inspiring tale that solidifies his status as one of the crypto industry’s heroes.



If he does write a book, Zhao could offer insights into his journey to becoming one of the most influential figures in crypto, valued at approximately $33 billion. Additionally, CZ’s book may provide valuable guidance to aspiring industry leaders on navigating regulatory challenges by drawing insights from real-life experiences.



Zhao is arguably the third most influential person in crypto after Satoshi and Vitalik, and a memoir or autobiography will likely receive a warm reception from most of the industry.



On the Flipside




While most of Zhao’s follower base has offered a warm reception, others are fixated on his regulatory woes.



CZ recently shared the launch of a non-crypto education-driven platform, Giggle Academy. 



Following the six-month tussle with the DoJ, Binance‘s global market share dropped to 55%.




Why This Matters



Changpeng Zhao’s little to no time behind bars allows him ample time to try out new ventures. If successful, writing could become his next passion, particularly in the absence of an executive role at Binance.



CZ’s exchange Binance is still embroiled in regulatory challenges in other regions.

U.S. Senators Question Justice Department's Pursuit of Crypto Mixers Such as Tornado Cash

The DOJ also argued in a court filing that FinCEN's guidance addressing crypto mixers didn't address the idea of "control," a stance that the senators' letter took issue with. In its filing from last month, the DOJ said anything that facilitates the transfer of funds would meet the legal definition of a "money transmitter," likening the wallet to a USB cable that transfers data or a frying pan that transfers heat.

Macro Events and Interest Rate Updates Impacting Crypto Market



This week’s significant macro events include notable Consumer Price Index (CPI) news. Bowman recently stated that there are no expectations for a rate cut this year, making this week’s remarks worth noting.

Despite no significant crypto events impacting the market, the FTX claim and numerous hearings are worth tracking. The cryptocurrency market, especially Ethereum and other altcoins, has been weak recently.

The vision of Infinex to revolutionize DeFi

In an era where decentralized finance (DeFi) is transforming the traditional financial world, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick has launched a new platform called Infinex. 
The new project aims to further revolutionize the DeFi sector by eliminating some of its most significant barriers: wallet configuration, asset bridging, and gas fees. With this innovative initiative, Warwick intends to simplify access to and use of decentralized finance, making it more accessible to a wider audience.

Infinex’s vision to revolutionize DeFi
Infinex was born out of the need to make DeFi more inclusive and less intimidating for novice users. Currently, one of the biggest obstacles users face is the complexity of managing digital wallets and inter-chain transactions, often accompanied by high transaction fees, known as “gas fees”. 
These elements can discourage many potential users who find the existing system too complex or too expensive.
Warwick’s vision for Infinex is clear: to eliminate these complexities and create a DeFi ecosystem that is as simple as it is effective. “We want to break down the barriers that prevent many people from entering the world of decentralized finance,” Warwick stated. 
Infinex introduces various innovative features to reduce the complexity of DeFi. First and foremost, the platform promises a simplified wallet setup that can be completed with just a few clicks, eliminating the need for complicated security procedures or private key management, often seen as intimidating by new users.
Furthermore, Infinex aims to facilitate the bridging of assets between different blockchains. Traditionally, transferring assets from one network to another is a process that can be both costly and subject to delays, due to the different speeds and capacities of blockchain networks. Infinex uses proprietary technology that allows for fast and low-cost transfers, making interoperability between different blockchains a more seamless and accessible reality.
Another significant innovation of Infinex is the elimination of gas fees, which are often a major deterrent for frequent transactions or for users operating on limited budgets. Infinex has developed a mechanism that allows to manage these fees more efficiently, potentially subsidizing or completely eliminating the cost for end users.
Expected Impact on the DeFi Sector
The introduction of Infinex could have a significant impact on the DeFi sector, especially in terms of accessibility and mass adoption. By reducing the complexities and costs associated with DeFi operations, Infinex not only attracts a new segment of users but also promotes greater financial inclusion. This expanded accessibility could result in increased liquidity and transaction volume within the DeFi ecosystem, further enhancing its growth and stability.
Despite the optimism, the road to success for Infinex is not without challenges. Security remains a predominant concern, especially when simplifying processes that traditionally require rigorous security measures. Additionally, the platform will need to demonstrate its reliability and scalability in an environment that is constantly under siege from new and sophisticated cyber attacks.
In conclusion, with the launch of Infinex, Kain Warwick not only continues to consolidate his position as a leader in the field of DeFi but also paves the way for potential transformations in the way users interact with decentralized financial technologies. If Infinex manages to overcome its initial challenges, it could very well become a fundamental pillar in the increasingly inclusive and accessible architecture of decentralized finance.

More crypto AI alliances emerge following $7.5B token merger

On May 13, blockchain AI platform ChainGPT will hold the initial dex offering (IDO) of its launchpad project, Wisdomise AI, in conjunction with KuCoin and Gate.io. Wisedomise is an AI-powered crypto adviser and investment assistant that helps users learn, predict, and execute digital asset trades. Ilan Rakhmanov, CEO and Founder of ChainGPT, said that the tool allows users to use "advanced AI algorithms" for engaging in digital asset marketplaces. Wisedomise is currently targeting an IDO with a fully diluted valuation of $20 million. Meanwhile, ChainGPT uses language learning models (LLM) to build AI-powered chatbots and news aggregators and is currently valued at $236 million, based on its native token. Similarly, on May 3, web3 base layer KIP Protocol said it would partner with GPU cloud infrastructure provider Aethir to accelerate AI development on both networks. Through the collaboration, KIP would deploy its KnowledgeFi monetization system and decentralized retrieval augmented generation (dRAG) framework, used by AI models to dynamically gather information after user prompts, to Aethir. Likewise, Aethir will allow KIP Protocol to access its fleet of 40,000 GPUs and 3,000 NVIDIA H100s for generating AI prompts. Julian Peh, co-founder and CEO of KIP Protocol, stated that the two protocols are in alignment over the firm's use of Aethir's computing resources for powering its AI asset deployment and monetization tools. Last month, the three biggest players in the crypto AI industry, SingularityNet, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, approved a $7.5 billion token merger, creating the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) project. The ASI is currently examining three distinct product pipelines: deployment of AI agents in commercial settings, neural symbolic language learning models (LLMs), and AI data sharing and utilization. “In the near term, we anticipate generating revenue as we launch the agentic network for deployment,” Humayun Sheikh, chairman of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and CEO of Fetch.ai, told Cointelegraph in a statement. “In the short term, we’ll focus on deploying numerous commercial products that breathe life into AI applications.”Despite the hype, scammers have also begun taking advantage of unsuspecting users drawn by the crypto AI frenzy. On May 5, blockchain security firm CertiK reported that the Genius Crypto Token GNUS.ai was exploited for $1.27 million. After exploiting the developers' private wallet on Discord, an attacker allegedly created a fake GNU token on Fantom blockchain and copied the code from GNUS.ai's Ethereum Chain, thereby converting the fake GNU tokens to genuine GNUS.ai tokens on Fantom. Afterward, the attacker bridged 500,000 worth of illicitly minted GNUS.ai tokens from Fantom to Ethereum and sold them for $1.27 million. Related: OKX Ventures invests in Web3 ‘play ARPG to train AI’ game Blade of God X

                        President Joe Biden’s stringent crypto policies could jeopardize his re-election bid, according to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams. On May 13, Adams warned of the potential consequences that the administration could face at the November polls.Adams expressed concerns about President Biden and other Democrats’ perceived anti-crypto position, which could reduce the incumbent US president’s likelihood of re-election.Uniswap Founder Tags US SEC as Catalyst for Biden’s Potential Loss
He advised that anyone close to President Biden or within his leadership circle “should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto.”This is not the first time experts will predict how Biden’s stringent crypto policies could undermine his re-election chances.Shark Tank billionaire and crypto evangelist Mark Cuban joined the long list of critics that have blasted Biden’s crypto stance as a potential election killer. He pointed to SEC chair Gary Gensler’s aggressive crackdown and lawsuits against major crypto firms as a liability to the president’s bid.Cuban believes the 2024 US presidential election will take a new turn as crypto voters will influence the outcome, limiting Biden’s chances of a second term.Since becoming president, Biden has taken a hardline stance against the crypto sector. An Executive Order was signed in 2022, which referenced Terra’s $50-billion crash and “the wave of insolvencies” as reasons to “harness” crypto potential responsibly.Ever since, influential figures such as Senator Elizabeth Warren have advocated for stringent crypto industry regulations, as she claimed in March 2024 that crypto threatens US security and helps terrorists.Additionally, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has classified nearly all cryptocurrencies as securities, further complicating regulatory clarity regarding the crypto industry amid the recent probe of Uniswap.Meanwhile, the Republican candidate in the November 2024 election has been wooing crypto community members.In a recent speech, former US President and Republican Presidential candidate in the November 2024 election, Donald Trump, expressed support for crypto, criticizing Biden for his skeptical views and accusing him of being uninformed about crypto.Uniswap Founder Asserts that 40% of US Adults Own Crypto
Hayden Adams had previously highlighted the ongoing shift in the financial sector due to the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. He noted that 40% of adults in the US already own crypto, which could potentially threaten Biden’s election prospects given the growing influence of cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, the political tides seem to be shifting in favor of Trump. David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, revealed a month-long collaboration with Trump on a “comprehensive executive order.”Bailey also mentioned that other players in the crypto space are seeking to raise about $100 million to aid Trump’s campaign to ensure his return to the White House.

New Development in the Tether-XRP Conflict: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Steps Back - Bitcoin Sistemi


Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, the company behind XRP, claimed in his recent statement that the US government was going after Tether (USDT).
On the other hand, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino published a long response and said that an 'uninformed' CEO was spreading fear about USDT, referring to Garlinghouse. He also reminded that Ripple is under investigation by the SEC and intends to launch a USDT rival stablecoin.


However, Garlinghouse also said in the podcast program in which he made his controversial remarks that he saw Tether as very important for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. He added that he did not know how to predict what impact potential US regulatory action against Tether would have on the crypto ecosystem.
Garlinghouse published a response and took a step back after Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino lashed out at him.





Ripple CEO said that his intention was not to attack Tether. In addition, he also reminded that his next words in the podcast were that Tether was very important for the ecosystem.

Garlinghouse said that his statement was intended to remind that the US government demands more control over dollar-based stablecoin companies and that Tether, the largest company in this field, is also in its targets.

Bernstein Argues Bitcoin's 'Flattish' Price Action is Great for Public Miners - Benzinga

Analysts at research and brokerage firm Bernstein aren't worried about the "flattish" price action of Bitcoin BTC/USD, arguing that it can be great for miners — when economics are driven by competitive hash-rate wars. "Bitcoin price action has been flattish, but we don't fear any major drawdown here" Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "We expect Bitcoin to remain range bound (high 50Ks to low 60Ks) and break out on the upside to continue its upward adoption trajectory, as Bitcoin ETFs see allocation from RIAs, wealth platforms and other institutional funds." Bitcoin is currently trading for around $62,800, according to The Block's price page.Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Strong start, slowing demand: The first 4 months of US spot bitcoin ETFs - Blockworks


The financial world prefers quarterly reviews. But US spot bitcoin ETFs have been alive for one-third of a year, and now seems as good a time as any for a look back.  
The sample size captures bitcoin hitting a new all-time high and seeing some corrections since the Jan. 11 ETF launches.
Oh yeah, and adding a fourth month captures the demand (or lack thereof) for bitcoin ETFs after per-block rewards for mining the asset were cut in half last month.
One headline number: US spot bitcoin ETFs have notched net inflows of about $11.7 billion.
Another noteworthy stat: Those inflows occurred despite the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) enduring net outflows of $17.6 billion.
Profit-taking by ETF investors, as well as the Federal Reserve’s likely higher-rates-for-longer posturing, have resulted in a demand drop-off for BTC in recent weeks, according to analysts. Bitcoin’s price (BTC) — at roughly $63,000 Monday at 12 pm ET — is down about 6% from a month ago.
Industry watchers had said it would be hard to sustain the pace of some of the most successful ETF launches of all time.
Read more: Macro headwinds could spur a ‘boring’ bitcoin summer — or something worse
The category’s inflow total once stood above $12.5 billion before a month-plus of outflows brought the category back down to Earth.
Net money exiting the funds over the last five weeks (since April 8) stands at $931 million, according to Farside Investors data. Last week’s positive flows of $117 million broke a four-week bleeding streak. 
Crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) volumes — the majority of which come from US spot bitcoin ETFs — have continued to slide, CoinShares research head James Butterfill wrote in a Monday report.The offerings saw volumes of roughly $8 billion last week, compared to the $17 billion average in April.“These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges, relative to 31% last month,” Butterfill added.
Even BlackRock, Fidelity see demand slow 
Perhaps as expected, products by BlackRock and Fidelity were able to capitalize on their renowned brands and deep client networks out of the gate to attract the most investor assets.
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) so far have net inflows amounting to $15.5 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively.
Both offerings enjoyed unprecedented inflow gains for new ETFs.
FBTC saw net inflows during its first 63 days before the streak ended on April 12. The takeaway: It saw about $8 billion of net money enter the fund in those first 63 days, and just $94 million in the 21 trading days since. 
IBIT’s run lasted 71 days, before the fund notched a zero in that category on April 24.   
So, the fund’s net inflows were nearly $15.5 billion in the first 71 trading days. They are $24 million in the last 13 trading days.
BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF looked poised to pass GBTC in assets under management weeks ago. But the recent demand slowdown has kept Grayscale’s fund in the lead — at about $17.6 billion to $16.6 billion, as of market close on Friday.
IBIT’s trading volumes were roughly $3.6 billion last week, a Blockworks analysis of Yahoo Finance data shows. That gave it a daily average of $720 million, down from a nearly $1.1 billion daily volume average the week before.  
GBTC saw its lowest weekly outflow since January from May 6 to May 10, at $171 million. The fund saw its first daily net inflow, gaining $63 million on May 3. 
Read more: Bitcoin ETF snapshot: GBTC surprise helps end sector’s seven-day outflow run 
Still, like IBIT, the Grayscale fund’s daily volumes average dipped to $338 million last week, according to Yahoo Finance data — down from a daily mark of $446 million from April 29 to May 3.
Financial advisers are expected to contribute massively to future inflows, with some revealing in recent filings that they already hold millions of dollars worth of positions in various BTC funds.

Christopher Jensen, crypto research director at bitcoin ETF issuer Franklin Templeton, told Blockworks in an April interview that more institutional investors are considering including bitcoin within long-term investment portfolios.
“There are lots of platforms, there are lots of institutions that are interested and are doing work,” Jensen said at the time. “So we don’t think the flows for the ETPs are done even though they’ve cooled off in recent weeks.”

Why Bitcoin holders may need to wait a bit longer for $70K - AMBCrypto



Buying momentum on Coinbase decreased, suggesting a further decline for Bitcoin.
The negative Sharpe Ratio indicated that BTC might not produce good gains in the short term.

Bitcoin [BTC] might experience another downturn, according to signals from the Coinbase Premium Index.
This index shows the level of buying pressure among investors in the U.S.— especially as the nation has a high number of Bitcoin holders.
High premium values indicate an increase in buying pressure. On the other hand, a low reading of the Coinbase Premium Index suggests a surge in sell-offs.
The big players are letting go
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis using CryptoQuant, the index was -0.050 at press time. This was a sign that many U.S. Bitcoin holders were selling instead of accumulating.
Source: CryptoQuant
Signal Quant, a wallet profiler and author on CryptoQuant commented on the trend.
According to the handle, the state of this leading indicator means that Bitcoin’s price might experience another correction before a significant bounce.
“The current Coinbase Premium trend is currently positive, close to zero. So if the historical pattern repeats itself, we may have a better chance of success if we wait a bit longer and invest in the rebound after the trend turns negative.”
At press time, the price of BTC was $62,785 — a 2.94% increase in the last 24 hours. Coming from the analysis above, this price increase might not last long.
But if users in the U.S. start to buy in large numbers, this bearish outlook might be invalidated. However, AMBCrypto considered other metrics to confirm it a rise beyond Bitcoin’s current peak could take more time.
Risky season is here
To do this, we looked at the Sharpe Ratio. In simple terms, this metric tells you whether to take a risk with an investment or not.
If the Sharpe Ratio is positive, it means that the potential Return On Investment (ROI) might be great compared to the risk involved.
Furthermore, a negative Sharpe Ratio indicates that the possible reward might not be worth the risk. This was the case with Bitcoin, as blockchain analytics tool Messari showed that the reading was -2.22.
Source: Messari
However, returns for BTC might start to rise once the metric rises to the zero midpoint. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s total supply in profits was 87.03%.
For a significant bounce to occur, the percentage might need to decrease. And a reasonable point for it to drop to could be 78.20%. This was the same profit supply Bitcoin had before it rallied back in March.
If the supply declines to a similar level, BTC might begin a run that could take it above $75,000.

In addition, the one-day circulation was down to 17,600, indicating that the number of coins engaged in transactions has decreased.
Should the circulation increase, Bitcoin might begin another trip down the charts.

Hyperinflation Warning: US Bizman, Author Tells Businesses To Stack Bitcoin


								Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the bestselling personal finance book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” has fired another financial warning shot, this time targeting the US dollar and a potential challenger – a gold-backed stablecoin from the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).

Kiyosaki, a longtime advocate for “real money” like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, fears the BRICScoin could trigger hyperinflation in the US, causing the dollar to lose its global dominance and ultimately collapse.
Hyperinflation Or Hyperbole?
While Kiyosaki paints a stark picture of a dollar deluge flooding the US economy, experts remain divided on the BRICScoin’s true impact. The very existence of the stablecoin is still under discussion within the BRICS alliance.
If it does materialize, its primary purpose would likely be to facilitate internal trade between member countries, potentially reducing their dependence on the US dollar for international transactions.


This shift could undoubtedly chip away at the dollar’s global hegemony, but financial experts are more cautious than Kiyosaki when it comes to predicting hyperinflation. The US economy, despite its challenges, still holds significant weight. A complete dollar collapse seems unlikely in the immediate future.
On Hyperinflation And Stablecoins
So, what exactly is a BRICScoin, and why does Kiyosaki fear it so much? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a real-world asset, like gold, to prevent the wild price fluctuations often associated with traditional cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $62.584. Chart: TradingView
A gold-backed BRICScoin would theoretically offer stability and potentially challenge the dominance of the US dollar in international trade, particularly for commodities like oil currently priced in dollars.
Kiyosaki: A Prophet Or Provocateur?
Kiyosaki is no stranger to bold financial predictions. While his “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” series has sold millions of copies, some of his past forecasts haven’t materialized.
His dire warnings about the US dollar and hyperinflation should be taken with a grain of salt, especially considering his vested interest in promoting alternative assets like gold and Bitcoin.
Beyond The Hype: Building A Resilient Portfolio

The BRICS stablecoin, if it materializes, is unlikely to be an overnight revolution. But it could signal a shift in the global financial landscape. The US, facing a potential erosion of its dollar dominance, might have to focus on strengthening its own economic fundamentals.

Uniswap CEO warns US President to reverse course on crypto policies

Hayden Adams, the founder and CEO of decentralized exchange Uniswap, called on United States President Joe Biden to consider how voters think about crypto when they enter ballot boxes in November.In a May 12 X post, Adams claimed there was “not much time” for President Biden to change the perception many crypto-focused voters had of his administration’s policies on digital assets. According to the Uniswap CEO, the U.S. President was making a “miscalculation” of assuming crypto would be irrelevant in the 2024 elections and allowing Senator Elizabeth Warren and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to “wage total war” on the technology.“Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto,” said Adams. “Not much time for Biden to save it. Anyone close to him or [Democratic] leadership should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto (public support/plan and reigning in sec + warren).”Source: Hayden AdamsIn November, U.S. voters will choose whether to elect President Biden to a second term. Since taking office in 2021, he signed one of the first executive orders to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and nominated Gary Gensler as the SEC Chair. Under Gensler, the SEC has ramped up enforcement actions against crypto firms offering services or products to U.S. residents, resulting in many criticizing the commission for a seemingly inconsistent approach to digital assets. The regulator has civil cases pending against Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple and Binance. Related: Neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump are crypto championsOn May 8, a majority of members of the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of a resolution that would overturn an SEC rule placing restrictions on banks holding customers’ crypto. Before the vote, President Biden said he intended to veto the resolution, letting the SEC’s Special Accounting Bulletin 121 stay in place.With fewer than six months until U.S. Election Day, many in and out of the crypto space have called out the Biden administration for its policies on digital assets — some as a warning like Adams, others as a criticism. Members of Congress are also moving forward with legislation to clarify the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would play in regulating crypto.Magazine: Opinion: GOP crypto maxis almost as bad as Dems’ ‘anti-crypto army’

Bitcoin price shows strength as investors anticipate return of money printing

Bitcoin (BTC) rose by 2% in the last 24-hours, recovering after two days of difficulty in surpassing the $61,500 resistance. By sustaining price levels above $62,500, the current upside movement demonstrates that Bitcoin can still experience positive price fluctuations regardless of the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows, which saw $100 million in net outflows over four days.U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF daily flows, USD million. Source: Farside InvestorsSeveral factors have improved sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, beginning with China's announcement of issuing $138 million in long-term bonds to boost the economy. Although this was expected since the announcement in March, it reaffirmed that governments are acknowledging increased risks of recession. This was in response to data indicating that China's aggregate credit decreased in April for the first time in seven years.Zou Wang, an investment director at Shanghai Anfang Private Fund Management, told Reuters that the market now anticipates further liquidity injections from China's central bank, possibly including cuts to interest rates. Such actions would exacerbate issues stemming from recent expansive measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), which led to an increase in the U.S. monetary supply in March for the first time in two years.U.S. M1 monetary base, USD. Source: Fed Saint LouisAt first glance, injecting more money into the economy seems beneficial, but it can lead to higher inflation over time, especially as companies and individuals might delay spending and investment. As fixed-income investors begin to recognize that their returns are barely keeping pace with rising inflation, scarce assets like Bitcoin could become more attractive.Ultimately, investors are likely preparing for a continuous trend where governments will need to keep providing liquidity to forestall economic crises. While some might argue that the stock market would primarily benefit from this added liquidity, high interest rates adversely affect companies by raising their capital costs. Any debt issued in the past 16 years will encounter significantly higher rates upon refinancing.Last week, Fed officials hinted that interest rates might stay elevated for an extended period, according to Yahoo Finance. Minneapolis Fed Chair Neel Kashkari notably stated, "I think it’s much more likely we would just sit here for longer than we expect,” and Chicago Fed Chair Austan Goolsbee remarked, "I think now we wait." This strategy, while seemingly contradicting the push for increased liquidity, is carefully designed to delay inflationary pressures.In essence, the U.S. central bank's actions are intended to encourage more borrowing by companies and individuals to support employment and consumer markets. However, what the Fed cannot foresee is how much of this borrowed money will be spent on scarce assets to hedge against inflation, rather than stimulating the economy. It appears too early to fully evaluate such risks, but Bitcoin investors are skeptical about the Fed’s chances of achieving a soft landing.Related: Japanese listed firm adds Bitcoin as reserve asset with 117 BTCAdditionally, Bitcoin's value was influenced on May 13 by an unexpected factor: the return of social media influencer "Roaring Kitty," a former marketer who played a pivotal role in the GameStop (GME) stock rally in 2021. Having been inactive on the X social network for nearly three years, the Bitcoin community appears hopeful for some form of remarkable influence from this personality.Cryptocurrency investors anticipate a positive shift in sentiment toward digital assets, fueled by a growing distrust in banks and traditional finance, especially in light of recent government bailouts, including the rescue of Philadelphia-based Republic First Bank. These investors believe that these developments may drive more participants toward cryptocurrencies.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Crypto ETPs See First Institutional Inflows in Five Weeks, With $130,000,000 Hitting Markets: CoinShares - The Daily Hodl


								Digital assets manager CoinShares says institutions resumed investing in crypto products last week after a five-week break.
In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares finds that digital asset investment products brought in $130 million in inflows last week after four weeks of outflows.










“Digital asset investment products saw inflows for the first time in five weeks totaling $130 million. ETP (exchange-traded product) volumes continue to subside, though, with $8 billion for the week compared to $17 billion average in April. These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges relative to 31% last month.”
Source: CoinShares
Regionally, the US led inflows with $135 million. While Switzerland and Hong Kong also saw crypto ETP inflows of $14 million and $19 million, Canada and Germany saw outflows of $20 million and $15 million.
“Hong Kong, after a prior week of record inflows, saw just US $19 million inflows, suggesting the majority of the first-week post-Bitcoin ETF launches were seed capital.”
Bitcoin (BTC) ETPs, per usual, led crypto products with $144 million in inflows. Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), XRP and Litecoin (LTC) also enjoyed inflows of $5.9 million, $1.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively, Ethereum (ETH) products suffered $14.4 million in outflows.
“Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF (exchange-traded fund) issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent, this has been reflected in outflows which totaled $14 million last week.”

Tether CEO Dismisses SEC Probe Rumors as Malicious FUD - DailyCoin


        
Brad Garlinghouse warned of impending enforcement action against Tether.



Tether’s CEO wrote off the claim as fear-mongering.



Ripple is planning to launch a competing stablecoin product.
Tether has carved out a dominant position as the world’s leading stablecoin provider, with USDT boasting the highest trading volume and largest market capitalization. However, the company has faced persistent doubts over the years, particularly on the matter of its reserves being sufficient to cover all of the tokens it has issued.Playing on these doubts, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently warned that Tether is currently under investigation by US authorities. However, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has since pushed back, dismissing Garlinghouse’s claim as intentional fear-mongering and malicious misinformation from a rival.Tether is Number 1 For a Reason: ArdoinoArdoino fired back at Garlinghouse by deriding his comments as baseless fear-mongering from an “uninformed CEO,” whose own company is currently engaged in a high-profile legal battle with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).
Doubling down, the Tether chief asserted that USDT has rightly earned its status as the leading stablecoin thanks to its proven track record, solid backing from top-tier custodians, and robust compliance measures, which included respecting OFAC sanctions lists, training investigators monitoring blockchain activity, and working hand-in-hand with law enforcement agencies globally to stamp out criminality.Ardoino also emphasized USDT’s vital role in underbanked emerging markets, where millions rely on the stablecoin for spending and saving. Turning the tables, the Tether boss alleged that Garlinghouse’s alarming statements were likely motivated by Ripple launching a competing stablecoin product, with the comments being an attempt to undermine Tether’s reputation. Industry-Wide RiskGarlinghouse’s alarming statements about Tether came from a recent interview in which he expressed concerns about the impact of a US authorities’ Tether probe. The Ripple boss stated that the crypto industry has demonstrated a high degree of resilience following the imprisonment of Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao.
However, Garlinghouse warned that another “black swan” type event is inevitable, with US investigations into Tether’s operations a foreseeable event that worries him the most."The US govt is going after Tether. That is clear to me," claimed Garlinghouse. Given that Tether is deeply rooted across the crypto ecosystem, Garlinghouse expressed apprehension about the potential industry-wide impact of any major regulatory actions against the stablecoin.On the Flipside
Garlinghouse did not provide a source for his claim that the US government is coming for Tether.



The SEC has objected to Ripple‘s plans to launch a stablecoin.



Tether offers near real-time data on its circulating tokens and quarterly audited reports on its reserves.
Why This MattersTether’s persistent challenges have highlighted the stablecoin industry’s struggles to establish credibility and build public trust amid increased scrutiny. Although an SEC probe into Tether remains unconfirmed, such an investigation may be disastrous given USDT’s roots across the market.Tether set to launch smartphone to rival Google’s Android dominance.Tether’s “Pear Phone” to Battle Google as Tech Giant StrugglesEl Salvador takes government transparency to another level with new Bitcoin tracker.El Salvador Bitcoin Tracker Spearheads Govt Transparency

Tether CEO Claps Back At 'Uninformed' Ripple CEO's Criticism - Benzinga

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino on Monday targeted Ripple XRP/USD CEO Brad Garlinghouse, labeling him “an uninformed CEO” and criticizing his commentary on its stablecoin, USDT/USD, during ongoing SEC investigations and Ripple’s own stablecoin launch.What Happened: Ardoino’s tweet vehemently defended USDT’s credibility and emphasized its crucial role in global finance, especially in developing regions where traditional banking services often fail to reach the unbanked population.Ardoino used the platform to underline the stability and reliability of USDT, describing it as key for communities in unbanked regions.He pointed out that USDT serves as both a transactional and a savings medium, providing essential financial services where conventional banks have not.“USDT has consistently demonstrated strong price stability, ample liquid reserves, and adherence to high compliance standards with premier custodians,” Ardoino tweeted, countering the negative portrayal of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies often seen in mainstream media. He argued that such biased reports protect traditional financial interests while overshadowing the substantial benefits that cryptocurrencies like USDT offer to global finance.Further delving into Tether’s operational practices, Ardoino highlighted the company's rigorous compliance measures, including adherence to OFAC/SDN lists and a robust internal investigation framework that utilizes advanced tools for monitoring market activities.Also Read: Arthur Hayes: ‘Major Economies To Print Even More Money’ In The Next 24 MonthsTether's proactive approach is evidenced by its collaboration with 124 law enforcement agencies globally and the use of sophisticated software from partnerships with companies like Chainalysis, he said.Ardoino noted Tether’s aggressive stance against illegal activities, having blocked over $1.3 billion related to scams and hacks, and approximately $1.6 million linked to terrorist financing. “Tether has responded to 198 law enforcement requests in the past year alone, significantly collaborating with U.S. law enforcement to block harmful transactions totaling over $639 million,” Ardoino shared, emphasizing Tether's commitment to safety and regulatory compliance.The CEO also highlighted Tether’s international cooperation, citing strong relationships with entities like Israel's NBCTF and Ukraine law enforcement. Unlike other stablecoins that often require judicial orders to act, Tether's policy allows for immediate responsive measures to threats and illegal activities.What’s Next: As discussions about cryptocurrency’s role in global finance continue to evolve, these themes will likely be explored further at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event will delve into the impact of regulatory actions, the role of stablecoins, and the technological advancements shaping the financial landscape, providing a platform for critical dialogue on these pressing issues.Read Next: ‘Republicans Smell Blood In The Water:’ Uniswap CEO Warns Democrats Of ‘Swing States Level Miscalculation’ On CryptoImage: Shutterstock

OpenAI Shows Off Voice Chatbot, Touts New GPT-4o AI Model - Decrypt

ChatGPT developer OpenAI today announced its latest AI model, GPT-4o—the “O” stands for “omnimodel”—during a spring product update live stream, along with a slew of product updates, including a voice chatbot.OpenAI updated its mobile apps immediately following its announcements and also launched a desktop app for ChatGPT. The company emphasized improvements to its user experience, which it says allows people to better focus on the conversations they have with ChatGPT.“For the past couple of years, we’ve been very focused on improving the intelligence of these models, and they’ve gotten pretty good,” OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati said. “But this is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to ease of use.”The livestream emphasized a simplified and more holistic approach to generative AI. An “omnimodel”—or natively multimodal—system does everything within its core application instead of coordinating among GPT for text, GPT Vision for images, and so on.“We think it's very, very important that people have an intuitive feel for what the technology can do, so we really want to pair it with this broader understanding,” Murati said.She noted that GPT-4o will be available to both paid and free ChatGPT users, as well as users of ChatGPT’s API. Paid ChatGPT subscribers, Murati added, will continue to have access to up to five times the system capacity of free users. Everyone, she said, should be able to access OpenAI tools.”We're always finding ways to reduce that friction, and recently, we made ChatGPT available without the signup flow,” she noted. In April, OpenAI allowed users to access ChatGPT 3.5 without signing up for an account. OpenAI then showcased ChatGPT’s ability to hold a real-time casual conversation with users, demonstrating a variety of tones and emotions. The demo included ChatGPT singing, laughing, and joking with the OpenAI engineers. The company also claimed that ChatGPT can now determine a user’s emotional state using the mobile phone’s front-facing camera.A new blog post outlined the major developments announced today, leading with “much more natural human-computer interaction.”“It accepts as input any combination of text, audio, and image and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs,” the company wrote. “It can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in a conversation.”Even before today's announcements, AI and tech enthusiasts suggested a voice chatbot powered by a next-generation AI model would make the personal companions depicted in the sci-fi movie “Her” a reality—including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a cryptic, one-word Twitter post.Using the ChatGPT desktop application, the OpenAI engineers showed that software code could be copied into ChatGPT, allowing the engineer to chat with ChatGPT about it. In the demo, OpenAI also showcased ChatGPT’s ability to perform real-time language translations. ChatGPT was additionally shown explaining a math problem after a photo of the equation was submitted to the app.OpenAI and the broader generative AI industry have publicly committed to fight the use of their technology in the creation of AI-generated deepfakes. OpenAI acknowledged today that GPT-4o presents new safety challenges given its real-time audio and vision capabilities.“Our team has been hard at work figuring out how to build mitigations against misuse,” Murati said. “We continue to work with different stakeholders out there—from government, media, entertainment, red teamers, and civil society—to figure out how to best bring these technologies into the world.”Rumors had been circulating since the beginning of the month about OpenAI’s big announcement, ranging from the release of GPT-5, ChatGPT powering Apple’s new version of Siri, and AI-powered search ahead of Google’s anticipated announcement on May 14. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI and Apple closed a deal that would bring OpenAI’s technology to the iPhone.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to Twitter to calm the waters on Friday, tweeting, “Not GPT-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love! Feels like magic to me.”Launched in 2015 by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, OpenAI and its wildly popular ChatGPT released in November 2022 have dominated the conversation surrounding generative AI. With close ties and investments from Microsoft, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Dall-E 3 have been integrated into Microsoft's suite of Office 365 tools and the new Copilot AI assistant.In March, Musk sued OpenAI and Altman, claiming that the AI developer had prioritized Microsoft’s commercial interests over the public good.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Andrew Tate seems confused as he dumps bitcoin to buy GameStop


Andrew Tate claims he’s cashed in a portion of his bitcoin holdings and invested the funds into GameStop following a new wave of hype around the controversial stock. However, he can’t seem to decide on a figure. 
Tate initially said he made a $50,000 investment into GameStop before changing this to half a million. He then upped the ante even more, claiming that he’d actually allotted $6 million worth of his crypto to destroy hedge funds.
The hype around GameStop was fuelled by the return of investment-focused social media personality Roaring Kitty, who helped inspire the initial GameStop rally in 2021.

When Kitty posted on X (formerly Twitter) for the first time in three years today, GameStop’s price reportedly doubled. In response, Nasdaq has halted the trading of the stock 18 times today, likely due to the sudden price swings. 
However, these swings apparently haven’t deterred Tate, who claims he’ll hold onto the stock regardless as “PERMA DONATIONS TO THE CAUSE AGAINST THE SYSTEM.” 
The controversial influencer then described the investment as a ‘spiritual battle’ and claimed that it’s about “pissing off some dork somewhere on wall street with a fucking vaccine and a tiny Johnson.”

Tate still faces legal troubles in a number of court cases, including four women in the UK suing him over alleged rape and assault and the continuation of his human trafficking case in Romania.

                        Chinese workers are showing a lack of enthusiasm towards the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC). A report on May 13 revealed that some workers who received their salaries in digital yuan (e-CNY) converted the asset into fiat currency immediately after they were paid, indicating a clear preference for physical cash over the digital alternative.Despite the Chinese government’s efforts to promote the adoption of the digital yuan, a report from the local media outlet South China Morning Post indicates that many workers are hesitant to use it in their daily transactions.Chinese Workers CBDC Concerns Leans on Lack of UtilityThe report surveyed responses from local workers and detailed the reason behind China’s slow uptake of the digital yuan.Ye Dongyan, a researcher at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, highlighted the need to balance privacy and security, which has slowed the progress of promoting the digital yuan.“Paper currency is used anonymously, but the digital yuan is different,” he said. “The boundaries between information tracking and information security protection need more deliberation.”Workers in the Chinese civil service also expressed their thoughts on the use of the CBDC.Andrew Wang, a civil servant, said he wasn’t too worried by the idea of digital cash as it was only a small part of his salary being paid in digital yuan. His wife, who receives her full salary in digital yuan, however, withdraws the full amount as regular cash the moment she’s paid due to a lack of utility with the digital currency.He explained that she couldn’t deposit the funds or buy financial products with the e-CNY wallet, which limits the use cases and makes cash a better alternative.It could be recalled that China started trials of the digital yuan in selected cities in 2019, looking for a nationwide rollout amidst fierce global competition to establish a state-backed digital currency. While no specific timeline has been announced for the national launch, the country has actively promoted the currency since the trials began.China’s Digital Yuan Recorded $250B in Processed Transactions
Yi Gang, the former governor of the People’s Bank of China, told the South China Morning Post that over $250 billion in transactions were processed using the digital yuan as of mid-2023.He highlighted that privacy was still a major issue despite the substantial volumes, however.Unlike traditional cash, which allows for anonymous transactions, digital yuan is traceable, giving the government a high level of visibility into individuals’ financial activities. The lack of privacy raises concerns about surveillance and the potential abuse of personal financial data.While Gang’s concern borders on privacy, a top Chinese law firm analyzed the anti-money laundering (AML) challenges posed by the digital yuan. It highlighted the cross-border nature of digital currency transactions, which can complicate traditional AML monitoring methods.Regardless, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world’s largest bank by total assets, revealed in its annual report that over 15 million e-CNY wallets were newly created by individuals in 2023, with an additional creation of 1.3 million wallets by business entities, while over 2.7 million businesses joined the list of those accepting the digital currency.Crypto News reported in February that over 29.16 million digital yuan wallets have been opened in Suzhou, China, as individuals and firms transacted over $416,811,390,000 worth of CBDC in 2023.The digital yuan is now utilized in various public services, including tax and social security payments, which are in addition to personal expenditures.

Bitfarms Sees Stock Dip Following CEO Termination


Bitfarms announced the termination of Geoffrey Morphy as its interim President and CEO. 
This decision came shortly after Morphy filed a lawsuit against the company, seeking $27 million in damages for claims including breach of contract and wrongful dismissal. 
Bitfarms Shares Fall Over 6%
The company has dismissed Morphy’s claims as baseless and has vowed to defend itself vigorously in the Superior Court of Ontario.
Morphy’s termination marks a tumultuous period for Bitfarms, which is currently navigating various challenges in the crypto-mining sector. The industry suffers from rising energy costs and intense competition, compounded by the recent Bitcoin halving that has significantly cut revenue from mining operations. 

As Bitfarms continues its search for a CEO, Nicolas Bonta, co-founder and chairman, has stepped in as the interim leader. The company expressed confidence that the executive search is nearing completion, with an appointment expected in the coming weeks.

“The CEO executive search is nearing completion and that the Company will be appointing a new CEO in the next several weeks,” the company wrote.

The market reacted negatively to Morphy’s firing, with Bitfarms’ shares falling over 6% on the announcement day. Such price action reflects concerns over the company’s stability and future direction, according to Javier Bastardo, Bitcoin Ambassador at Bitfinex.

“Companies in this sector must have a solid structure and know how to navigate different market conditions. However, disputes like this reduce their competitiveness, so beyond the negligible influence I believe this news will have on the industry, it raises questions about the company’s business and leadership,” Bastardo told BeInCrypto. 

Last year, Bitfarms CEO Emiliano Grodzki resigned and was replaced by Geoffrey Morphy, who was fired this year. This comes amid a disastrous year for Bitcoin miners, which caused some large companies to declare bankruptcy.

Stand With Crypto PAC launches as industry interest in campaign funding ramps up - Blockworks


There’s a new crypto Political Action Committee (PAC) on the scene. 
Coinbase-initiated nonprofit Stand With Crypto announced it is launching a new PAC Friday. 
The associated PAC, which means only individual Stand With Crypto members can contribute up to $5,000 each, plans to back “candidates who support the crypto community,” the nonprofit said on X Friday. 
Stand With Crypto, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, launched last summer as an effort to give crypto fans more access to information about policy makers and candidates, leaders said. 
“This is a grassroots, organic bottom-up effort,” Kara Calvert, Coinbase’s head of US policy, said in August 2023 when announcing the new initiative. 
“It can provide a lot of tools to people, they can learn about the members of Congress, they can access a scorecard, they can access a legislative action portal…it will really give them the tools that they need to engage with their members of Congress,” Calvert added. 
Read more from our opinion section: Only a fool would vote on crypto alone
While federal law makes contributions to the PAC tricky, companies and individuals are free to make donations to the nonprofit itself. Crypto payments operation Moonpay on Monday announced a $1 million pledge, an effort the company said was inspired by upcoming elections. 
“Today, two things are abundantly clear: This year’s election will define the future of our industry in the United States, and it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that want to positively advance crypto innovation for everyone,” Ivan Soto-Wright, Moonpay CEO, said in a statement Monday. 
Stand With Crypto’s PAC comes on the scene as crypto-focused Super PAC trio Defend American Jobs, Fairshake and Protect Progress continue to dish out cash. The three groups have collectively deployed $31,752,033.81 so far this calendar year, according to Federal Election Commission filings.

The PACs made a big financial push during the March Congressional primary cycle, doling out more than $10.1 million to fund advertisements against Rep. Katie Porter, the incumbent Democrat from California who ultimately lost her bid for the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat. 
The trio is also backing Alabama Democrat Shomari Figures, who is vying for a US House seat in November. Protect Progress donated close to $2 million during his primary campaign in March and April, filings show. 
Stand With Crypto has not yet filed contribution and disbursement forms with the FEC, but has revealed its first five endorsements: Figures; Jim Banks, a Republican running for Senate in Indiana; Jim Justice, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia; Eddy Morales, a Democrat running to represent Oregon’s Third District; and Troy Downing, a Republican running to represent Montana’s Second District.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Pumped And Retraced After The Last Inflation Data Release - What To Expect This Month? - Benzinga

With key inflation data scheduled for release this week, Benzinga takes a look at what cryptocurrency traders predict its impact to be.What Happened: CrypNuevo predicts an aggressive market move in response to impending inflation data. He states, "I have the feeling that we’ll just push towards one direction in an aggressive way," acknowledging the possibility of being wrong in his assessment.Considering Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD recent price action, he notes the fact that range lows are acting as support after a deviation, which he considers a good sign.Another, crypto trader Kevin shares his thoughts on the current market sentiment, the impact of macroeconomic factors and potential scenarios for Bitcoin and altcoins. He sees the current Bitcoin price action as "okay" but "not great and not bad." Kevin attributes this ambiguity to the influence of macroeconomic policy and data, which could potentially sway the market in either direction. "It’s a toss-up on which way it breaks due to Macro policy and data," he notes.While the altcoins chart looks "hideous" on the daily timeframe, the weekly and higher timeframes for Total 2-3-Others still lean more bullish than bearish.He cautions, "If CPI comes in bad this week, I think Altcoins are in for a very bad time and I believe BTC will break down and we could see 50K. If it comes in better than expected I see the opposite occurring."Also Read: Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week?Why It Matters: The crypto traders’ comments highlight the significant influence that macroeconomic factors, such as PPI, and CPI data, can have on the cryptocurrency market.As investors eagerly await the CPI and PPI data, the market remains in a state of uncertainty, with the potential for a sharp move in either direction. While the last three consecutive releases of inflation rates surpassed expectations, traders are awaiting the CPI report on May 15, which is forecasted (3.4%) to come in below the prior month (3.5%). The CPI index is predicted to decelerate from 0.4% to a 0.3% monthly pace.Goldman Sachs economists Manuel Abecasis and Spencer Hill predict a 1.6% rise in car insurance prices, while health insurance costs are expected to stabilize. Rent inflation has slowed to 0.37% while owner's Equivalent Rent (OER) inflation is expected to remain strong at 0.45%  Following the last inflation data (CPI) in mid-April, which saw a marginal increase in CPI data while PPI data saw a significant increase, Bitcoin traded 2.4% higher one day after the meeting, while Ethereum ETH/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD gained 0.71% and 0.91%, respectively. However, after the PPI data on the next day, there was a drop across the crypto board.At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $62,800, up 1.9% on the day. Ethereum and Dogecoin are up 0.1% and 6%, respectively.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class are topics expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Pumped After The Last FOMC Meeting—Will History Repeat On Wednesday?Image: Shutterstock

Ripple, XRPL Labs Eye Mass Adoption With DeRec Partnership - DailyCoin


        

Ripple and XRPL Labs have joined the DeRec Alliance.



Ripple has tipped the move to help bolster XRP and broader crypto adoption.



Ripple and XRPL Labs are joining over ten projects to standardize the crypto asset recovery system.




The crypto industry is always harping on mass adoption; however, the technology remains niche amid its complexity.



As part of efforts to make the technology more user-friendly, on January 11, 2024, the Algorand Foundation and Swirlds Labs introduced Decentralized Recovery (DeRec), a solution to simplify crypto asset recovery and interoperability backed by the DeRec Alliance, which includes several leading crypto firms working to standardize the solution across the industry. 




This Alliance has now received a significant boost from Ripple and XRPL Labs as they tip the effort to drive mass adoption for XRP and crypto.



Ripple XRPL Labs Join DeRec Alliance as Founding Members 



On May 9, Ripple and XRPL Labs announced they were joining Swirlds Labs and the Algorand Foundation as founding members of the DeRec Alliance, touting it as a step toward greater adoption of the XRP Ledger and crypto.



"The DeRec Alliance addresses one of the biggest challenges facing mainstream crypto adoption—secure and user-friendly management of private keys. Together, we can revolutionize how users manage their private keys, representing a major step forward for user security and adoption – not just for XRP Ledger users, but for everyone in crypto," RippleX Senior Vice President Markus Infanger noted.



For the uninitiated, DeRec is a system for storing and recovering sensitive information like crypto wallet private keys by breaking it into multiple pieces that are shared with a group of trusted “helpers,” such as friends or organizations. Users gather half of the shared pieces from helpers to recover the information. The DeRec Alliance, formed by multiple crypto projects, helps to standardize the process across various blockchains.



Alliance members nominate and vote for members of a Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), participate in quarterly meetings, and provide input on policy to be voted on by the elected TOC.




Per a press statement shared with DailyCoin, Ripple and XRPL Labs will serve two years on the TOC as founding members of the DeRec Alliance. On the TOC, they will provide input on the organization’s governance structure and core policies.



DeRec Another Step Closer to Industry-Wide Impact



Commenting on the importance of the Ripple and XRPL Labs membership, Algorand CTO John Woods enthused that DeRec inched closer to having an industry-wide impact with each notable partnership.



"I'm thrilled with the addition of these new members to the DeRec Alliance. As more and more influential projects join the Alliance, we reach the critical mass required for DeRec to yield its hugely positive impact on the industry," Woods noted.



The DeRec Alliance already boasts over ten members working across sectors like health and finance. These members include The HBAR Foundation, Casper Association, Acoer, BankSocial, and The Building Blocks.



On the Flipside 




The Ethereum network achieves some of the benefits DeRec does with EIP-4337.




Why This Matters



Crypto technology’s complexity continues to pose a hurdle to its mass adoption. DeRec promises to address a vital part of this problem by standardizing and simplifying the storage and recovery of crypto assets across blockchains. The recent entry of Ripple and XRPL Labs into the DeRec Alliance provides a significant boost to the project.

Crypto Price Predictions For 2024: Dogecoin To $2 And XRP To $3 | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Kyle Chasse has given his price predictions for different crypto tokens. His price targets for Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP were eye-catching, considering the heights he expects these coins to reach. 
Dogecoin To $2 And XRP To $3
Chasse mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin will climb to $2 and XRP to $3. His prediction for Dogecoin stands out given that other crypto analysts like Altcoin Sherpa have predicted that $1 is the highest level the crypto token can attain in this bull run. As such, Chasse’s prediction undoubtedly increases expectations for the meme coin in this cycle. 

Interestingly, Chasse’s prediction for Dogecoin still feels conservative, considering that crypto analyst Kevin (formerly Yomi OG) predicted that the meme coin could rally above $3 in this bull run based on its price action in previous bull markets. Unlike Chasse and Kevin, some are still skeptical of Dogecoin even rising to just $1. 
One of them is Pav Hundal, lead analyst for Australian exchange Swyftx, who explained why Dogecoin might not reach $1, stating that some bought the meme coin at the peak of the last bull and would want to take profits as soon as Dogecoin hits a new all-time high (ATH). He believes this category of investors can add significant selling pressure, affecting Dogecoin’s journey to $1. 
Meanwhile, Chasse’s prediction of XRP rising to $2 looks more conservative than ambitious, given other price predictions for the crypto token made so far. For instance, crypto analyst Ash Crypto predicts that XRP will reach as high as $5 in the next 12 to 16 months, while crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto claims that XRP can rise as high as $20. 
Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto is the most bullish of these analysts. He predicts that XRP can climb to $27 in this bull run. Egrag noted that the price target is feasible given XRP’s parabolic run in 2017, when it saw a 61,000% gain in 280 days. 
Price Predictions For Other Crypto Tokens
Chasse also outlined his price targets for other major crypto tokens, including Bitcoin. He expects the flagship crypto to reach $150,000 at the peak of this bull run. Chasse shares a sentiment similar to that of Tom Lee, co-founder of research firm Fundstrat, who predicts that Bitcoin will surge to $150,000 by year-end. 

Meanwhile, Chasse predicts that Ethereum will climb to $9500, another conservative prediction since crypto analysts like Mikybull Crypto predict that the second-largest crypto will climb to $20,000 in this bull run. Cardano also made Chasse’s list, with the crypto analyst predicting it would rise to $7. Chasse joins a growing list of crypto analysts who have made bullish predictions for Cardano despite its unimpressive price action.

Trader Who Called May 2021 Collapse Updates Bitcoin Outlook, Says Bottom Likely In for BTC - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								A trader who accurately called the beginning of the 2021 bear market meltdown says that the low for Bitcoin (BTC) is likely already in, based on historical patterns.
Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 190,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s monthly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator has slightly contracted, which traditionally signals that a bullish trend has at least temporarily lost steam.










The MACD is a momentum indicator that traders use to spot potential points of trend reversals.
But Dave the Wave says he doesn’t think the signal suggests that BTC’s price is headed much lower, as the MACD has not ascended anywhere near the same levels as previous bull runs.
“Yes, there is a contraction on the BTC monthly histogram, with momentum slowing, but I don’t count this definitive for price going significantly lower given:
1] the MACD had not reached the height of the line
2] a maturing market
It wouldn’t at all surprise me to see something different develop, pattern-wise, over the longer time frame.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that the monthly MACD of BTC has yet to come close to the diagonal resistance, indicating that the bull market is likely far from over.
On the weekly timeframe, the trader says that Bitcoin’s current MACD structure is reminiscent of July 2016, which was also right after the halving and just before a massive bull run.
“If I had to make a comparison of the current BTC weekly MACD to previous, I’d put it here.
Note that on the MACD cross highlighted, the price low was already in.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,448.

Bitcoin Has Officially Left the ‘Danger Zone’ As BTC Starts Week in the Green, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst believes Bitcoin (BTC) is entering into a bullish reversal phase after a post-halving correction.
The pseudonymous analyst known as Rekt Capital tells his 466,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin seems to be following a 2016 cycle pattern when Bitcoin dipped after the halving event – during the so-called ‘danger zone’ – and then soared to new all-time highs (ATHs).










He says Bitcoin now appears to have exited the historic correction period on the weekly chart after April’s halving event when miners’ rewards were cut in half.
“The post-halving Bitcoin ‘danger zone’ (purple) is officially over. And Bitcoin is celebrating with a good bounce from the re-accumulation range low support.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
The analyst believes that Bitcoin has likely already reached its cycle post-halving bottom when it touched the $56,000 mark.
 “If $56,000 was not the bottom then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days. History, however, suggests that this current pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
According to the analyst, key support for Bitcoin is holding around $60,000 as momentum builds to the upside, which could send BTC to $68,000 again.
“Bitcoin is showing early-stage signs of slowing down in its sell-side momentum, slowly developing a curl against the ~$60000 support. ~$60000 needs to continue to hold as it has been holding thus far for this curl to progress and eventually lift up.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
Bitcoin is trading for $62,971 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

CertiK discovered $5M security flaw in Wormhole bridge on Aptos

A security flaw in the Wormhole bridge on Aptos network could have resulted in $5 million worth of losses had it not been discovered, according to a social media post from blockchain security platform CertiK. The platform claimed to have discovered the bug and reported it to the Wormhole team before it could be expl. The flaw has been patched, and the bridge is no longer vulnerable.Source: CertiK.Aptos is a blockchain network that uses the MOVE programming language, which was originally developed by Facebook for the Libra project. Supporters of MOVE claim that it is a safer language to write smart contracts when compared to Ethereum’s Solidity or other alternatives.The CertiK report was posted in the form of a video. It claimed the flaw “arose from an incorrect implementation of the ‘public(friend)’ and ‘entry’ modifiers in the MOVE programming language.” The ‘public(friend)’ modifier allows a function to be called by other functions within the same module or by external accounts specified on a “friends list,” but not by other callers. On the other hand, the ‘entry’ modifier specifies that a function can be called by any external account.The bridge contained a function called ‘publish_event,” which was used to announce events such as token transfers. It was only supposed to be callable by other functions within the same module or by certain “specified external entities.” However, in the version of the bridge that CertiK studied, the function was modified by both ‘public(friend)’ and ‘entry.’ This made it possible for anyone to call ‘publish_event,” even if they were not an approved caller.Because of this flaw, an attacker could have created fake transactions that appeared to move tokens from one account to another, even though no actual tokens were being moved. These “events” could have caused the Ethereum version of the bridge to mint or unlock tokens without having any real deposits backing them on the Aptos side. As a result, the attacker could have drained up to $5 million worth of funds from the bridge, CertiK stated.CertiK informed members of the Wormhole team about the flaw on Dec 5, 2023. After investigating the report, the team developed and tested a patch to close the security loophole and informed the protocol’s Guardians of the issue. Via a multisignature vote, the Guardians approved the patch to be implemented, and the protocol’s Aptos contract was upgraded to implement the new code. Once the flaw was reported, the process of fixing it took approximately three hours, and the new version of the bridge is no longer vulnerable to this exploit.Wormhole Aptos exploit timeline. Source: CertiK.In addition to removing the ‘entry’ keyword from the publish_event function, the new patch also restricted the value of the “governor rate limits” on Aptos from $5 million to $1 million, effectively preventing withdrawals from Aptos of greater than $1 million per day. This was done to limit losses in case of a future exploit. Current usage is below $1 million per day, CertiK claimed, implying that the rate limit shouldn’t affect most users.Wormhole also performed a “retrospective analysis” to determine whether any user funds had been affected by the issue. They concluded that no funds had been illicitly transferred and that users’ balances were safe.Wormhole hasn’t always managed to catch security flaws before they are exploited. In 2022, it lost more than $321 million when a bug in the Solana part of the bridge allowed an attacker to mint unbacked tokens. However, the team later patched the bug and compensated users. In January, Wormhole reclaimed $1 billion in total value locked for the first time since the incident, showing that some users feel its security practices have improved.Related: Bugs in Gains Network fork let traders profit 900% on every trade: Report

Another New Memecoin Trend Emerged Today - A Whale Got FOMO - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Onchain data, a trader made significant purchases and sales on the Solana network in the company's memecoin imitation, which is on the agenda today.
This token is a memecoin that has the same name as GameStop shares traded in the United States, but has no connection to the company.


Today, GameStop shares in the USA showed an incredible rise. The reason for the rise was that Keith Gill, nicknamed Roaring Kitty, one of the architects of the short squeeze on GameStop shares in 2021, returned to Twitter.
As GameStop shares rose, the memecoin called GME also recorded significant increases. GME price has climbed 1365% in the last 24 hours.





During this rise, a trader bought GME with SOL coin for $ 65 thousand after Roaring Kitty's Twitter account became active. Then, 14 hours later, he sold them for 336 thousand dollars. So this trader earned $271 thousand in just 14 hours.

On the other hand, a second whale wallet was caught by the FOMO effect of the increase in the GME token 3 months ago and bought a large amount of GME tokens by paying 408 thousand dollars. Even though the price of GME has fallen more than 90% since then, this whale never sold his assets. Today, thanks to the re-emergence of Roaring Kitty, it has compensated for its losses and has an unrealized profit of 282 thousand dollars at the time of writing this article.


However, many new memecoins emerged after their rise in GameStop. Another altcoin named GME has appeared on the Ethereum network this time. Cryptocurrency analysis platform Lookonchain, in its statement about this altcoin, found that someone who was previously aware of the project bought 34% of the total supply of the token with 17.7 thousand dollars. Analysts have warned that this whale has current assets of $1.96 million and could make a dump.

Bitcoin's bullish trend reinforced as 'danger zone' signals fade | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin is seeing a strong upward push, shaking off earlier fears of a downturn. This comes as technical signals strengthen and key indicators reset, suggesting a bright road ahead for Bitcoin’s price.Bitcoin Market Indicators and Breakout SignalsBitcoin’s price chart is showing an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a strong indicator that often predicts a reversal of a previous downward trend. Crypto investor Quinten Francois pointed out this pattern, saying, “Inverse head and shoulders pattern spotted on the $BTC chart. Not the most beautiful I’ve ever seen, but I’ll take it.” He suggests that breaking the neckline of this pattern could pave the way for further price recovery.The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), a tool used to spot changes in the strength and direction of Bitcoin’s price, is also showing positive signs. According to crypto analyst Jelle, “Bitcoin has nearly completed a full reset. Back to the 100-day EMA, a bullish MACD cross below the zero line—and the first higher low in a long time. It’s looking good.”Current Trends and Potential MovementsAs of the latest updates, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures whether it is overbought or oversold, stands at 49—up from 33 on May 1. This suggests that Bitcoin is currently valued fairly according to market conditions.Crypto trader Mags, following the bullish sentiment, expects a breakout based on these technical indicators. However, the broader market sentiment remains cautious. The upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and comments from Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, might bring additional volatility, impacting Bitcoin’s short-term movements.Source: MagsRising Through ResistanceBitcoin’s trajectory faced resistance around the $63,500 and $63,700 marks. If Bitcoin pushes above $63,700, it could potentially liquidate over $516 million in cumulative leveraged short positions, providing a substantial boost to its market position.Source: TradingViewAt the same time, Bitcoin’s price has rebounded from a recent low of $56,000, which many analysts believe was the local bottom for this cycle. Rekt Capital, a well-known analyst, suggests, “If $56,000 was not the bottom then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days. However, history suggests that this pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days.”Moreover, with a morning star pattern forming at the $60,000 support zone, there is a high potential for a short-term rally. The technical setup, coupled with increasing buyer interest, points to a possible bull run challenging the overhead trend line.With Bitcoin currently trading at $63,010 and seeing an intraday rise of 2.52%, the momentum is building. There’s a growing consensus among analysts that a mix of technical strength and renewed investor interest could push Bitcoin toward a new resistance level at $68,283. Conversely, should the momentum falter, we could see a drop to around $58,451, marking the lower bound of the current trading range.

Solana Overtakes Ethereum DEX Volume: Is Ethereum Slipping? - DailyCoin


        
Solana’s DEX trading volume hits $1.3 billion, briefly outpacing Ethereum.



Ethereum quickly reclaims its lead in DEX volume.



Memecoin trades spur Solana’s temporary volume boost.
Thanks to its early start and network effects, Ethereum has long been the frontrunner in decentralized finance (DeFi). However, recently, Solana has experienced its own growth in that area, fuelled by its low fees and developer-friendly environment.
Last week, Solana once again exceeded Ethereum’s volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX), leading investors to ask questions about Ethereum’s long-term outlook. Solana’s DEX Lead Over EthereumOn Friday, May 10, Solana briefly surpassed Ethereum in DEX trading volume, recording $1.3 billion compared to Ethereum’s $1.29 billion. The flipping was primarily due to increased trading activity on Solana, thanks to a renewed interest in memecoins.
https://twitter.com/degeneratenews/status/1788746606197498093
In recent months, Solana has attracted a significant community of memecoin enthusiasts. Tokens like Bonk and DogWifHat have seen increases of upwards of 1000% since their launch. As noted in a recent analysis by Franklin Templeton, memecoin airdrops have received huge attention among the community. They also generated significant wealth effects, further contributing to interest. However, despite Solana’s temporary lead in DEX volume, Ethereum quickly regained its top position by the end of the day, closing the day at $1.39 billion in volume. Conversely, Solana’s trading volume dropped to $943 million. Solana’s DEX Volume Is Not What It SeemsThis was not the first time Solana flipped Ethereum in DEX volume. The last time this happened was on April 21, when Solana’s DEX volume was $1.4 billion, compared to Ethereum’s $1.16 billion. Before that, on March 16, Solana’s DEX volume was even higher, at $3.4 billion, against Ethereum’s $2.4 billion. 
It is important to note that high network volume does not mean the same thing for Ethereum and Solana. Due to its low fees, Solana attracts a significant number of high-frequency trades, which boost its overall volume. On the other hand, Ethereum’s higher gas fees mean that its users will only trade when it is advantageous. While their DEX volume is comparable, Ethereum still holds significant dominance regarding the network’s total value locked (TVL). Currently, Ethereum has a TVL of $52 billion, dwarfing Tron’s $8 billion and BSC’s $6 billion. Solana is only in fourth place in this metric, at a TVL of $4 billion. Even if Solana were to take the first spot in either DEX or network volume for good, it would still need to come a long way before it can grow to the size of the On the Flipside
Solana has faced significant network issues in the past. Most recently, the chain has experienced network congestion, leading to a high transaction failure rate. 



The reliance on memecoins and speculative trading may not be sustainable in the long term.
Why This Matters Even if Solana is still far behind, its rise challenges Ethereum to continue improving, particularly around scalability and transaction costs, two critical areas for user experience. Read more about Solana’s prospects to take third place among blockchain networks:Here’s How Solana Can Outpace BNB and USDT: Franklin TempletonRead more about SBF’s life in prison and his legal defense: Sam Bankman-Fried Still Claims He’s Innocent From Prison

Tokenized funds could chip away at stablecoin market, Polygon exec says - Blockworks


The growth of tokenized financial products likely represents the tip of the iceberg, as the world’s biggest financial players continue to investigate the potential of blockchain technology.
This interest could lead to the proliferation of on-chain funds that might challenge the dominance of stablecoins, according to Colin Butler, Polygon Labs’ head of institutional capital.
Franklin Templeton launched its OnChain US Government Money Fund in 2021. It uses the Polygon and Stellar blockchains to process transactions and record share ownership.
BlackRock debuted its own tokenized offering — the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund — on the Ethereum Network in March. The world’s largest asset manager then led a funding round by Securitize, a firm focused on bringing physical and traditional financial assets onto the blockchain.
The BlackRock and Franklin Templeton funds had amassed $375 million and $368 million in assets under management, respectively, as of April 30.
Their future asset growth will depend on how investors use them, Butler noted.
Franklin Templeton got regulatory approval to allow institutional investors to transfer shares of its on-chain fund to other shareholders.
“What you could do is have a venture capital firm on one side sending yield-bearing digital assets to one of their crypto-native portfolio companies that don’t have banking relationships,” he said. “That’s one idea; I don’t know what sort of adoption that receives.”
Read more: A stablecoin with yield? Tokenized fund perhaps just the start for fund giant
The stablecoin market is currently sized at about $160 billion. But unlike the Franklin Templeton fund, for example, stablecoins don’t offer users a yield. 
“To the extent you can make them more permissionless and fit certain use cases, I can see these products chipping away at that existing [total addressable market], let alone the future TAM,” Butler said.
Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Butler. 

Blockworks: What sorts of conversations are financial institutions having with blockchains as they mull their presence in the tokenization space? 
Butler: Trust and credibility are the most important factors for any Wall Street transaction. The entity looking to collaborate really needs to understand that the chain doesn’t go down. 
Virtually 100% reliability is what they’re looking for, because you can’t have a transaction just kind of disappear and fall through the cracks.
When you’re a big player thinking of coming on-chain, you also have to think about future-proofing your solution. Because if you spin something up that’s kind of a sandbox or walled garden, and there’s no future connectivity, then you have a product that’s limited in scope and you’re going to have to re-engineer everything at some point.
Read more from our opinion section: The future of tokenization? Permissioned blockchains
Blockworks: How might BlackRock’s entrance into the tokenized fund space affect how others move ahead here?
Butler: They are a thought leader, a technology leader and an innovation leader, and so when they make an action there tends to be a lot of replication.
You should just assume that almost everybody in the top 20 globally [in assets under management] has a plan for blockchain adoption. I can’t tell you when those plans will be realized, but there’s only — from my personal knowledge — one or two of the top 20 that aren’t really materially invested…without a team or a roadmap.
When BlackRock comes, it accelerates the plans for all of these other players because now they know they have air cover to do it.
And each one has a different angle on it. It’s not just BlackRock did this and now everybody replicates. Everybody’s looking to do something slightly different or build on what’s been done before, because nobody wants to be the third fund to do the exact same thing.
But broadly speaking, fund tokenization on blockchain is a huge conversation at most of the large players.
Blockworks: Private markets investment firm Hamilton Lane and hedge fund manager Brevan Howard have tokenized funds on Polygon. Do you expect more where that came from?
Butler: Longer term the vision is for everybody from banks to large RIAs, and everyone in between, to distribute these tokenized assets. 
Why it’s interesting is that these assets are not available in any other format. So they’re going to go with both hands after that, because it enables a growth trajectory that they currently don’t have. 
There’s deep financial incentives for the providers of financial products and the distributors, such as banks, to participate in this new ecosystem. That’s why people are so motivated to participate and come on-chain.
Blockworks: What do you make of the latest effort by Visa, Mastercard, JPMorgan, Citigroup and others aimed at using a shared ledger technology to settle tokenized assets? 
Butler: Many of the players listed in that announcement have been working on this for so long. I would say mentally they’ve been very serious about it for the last two years, and to me, it takes about two years to get to the point of approval for production use cases at major financial institutions.
That’s why I think that while you may have seen announcements similar to this maybe two years ago, qualitatively it’s very different because of the stage that a lot of the global financial institutions are at internally.

Sens. Lummis, Wyden oppose Justice Dept. stance on Tornado Cash charges

United States Senators Cynthia Lummis and Ron Wyden have sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland voicing their concern over the Justice Department’s (DOJ’) interpretation of money transmission licensing. As the bipartisan authors indicate in a footnote, this interpretation is being applied in the case against Roman Storm, co-founder of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, who has been charged with operating an unlicensed money transmission operation and other serious crimes.Sens. Lummis and Wyden's letter to the attorney general. Source: Senator Cynthia Lummis on XThe Bank Secrecy Act and the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) clearly define money transmission as the acceptance and transmission of currency and other forms of value. Non-custodial crypto service providers do not meet the established definition of money transmitters, and the DOJ is thus acting contrary to the Treasury, muddying policy enforcement, the senators said. In their words:“Bitcoins have a clear unilateral owner at all times. At no point in the [transfer] transaction process is there uncertainty over where ownership resides. […] Custody and control are, therefore, the logical touchstone of where ‘acceptance and transmission’ occurs on Bitcoin and other crypto networks.” FinCen is the “primary interpretive authority” of money transmission registration requirements. The standard suggested by the DOJ could be applied to a broad range of services, from internet service providers that process bank transfers to the post office, the senators wrote. Crypto advocacy groups filed a joint amicus brief in April with the Southern New York District Court making a similar argument. Source: Senator Cynthia LummisLawyers for Storm filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him in March, saying Tornado Cash did not meet the definition of a money transmission business and Storm was unable to prevent sanctioned groups from using the service because it was “immutable.”Related: DOJ’s Tornado Cash arguments show ‘obvious disdain for privacy’ — LawyerProsecutors countered that Storm was accountable for operating the service and claimed he designed software to aid criminality. They said Tornado Cash was “involved the transportation and transmission of funds known to the defendant to have been derived from a criminal offense.” Storm was arrested in August on charges of sanctions violations and facilitating money laundering in addition to unlicensed money transmission. He could be punished by up to 45 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is free on $2 million bail with travel restrictions.Magazine: Tornado Cash 2.0: The race to build safe and legal coin mixers

Andrew Tate Says He’s Cashed $500K in Bitcoin to Go ‘All In’ on GameStop - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFormer professional kickboxer turned social media provocateur Andrew Tate claims that he has cashed out $500,000 in Bitcoin to invest in GameStop and  meme coins to spite hedge funds.“There’s a hedge fund manager who, when he wakes up tomorrow morning—if GameStop opens at the current price—he’s gonna lose $13 billion dollars,” Tate said in a Twitter video. “His entire hedge fund!”His Reddit-inspired hypothesis is similar to the 2021 theory surrounding the same stock. With the return of Roaring Kitty—the internet figure who spearheaded the movement—it seems meme stock mania is in full swing.“I’m cashing half a million dollars of Bitcoin right now and I’m going all-in, maximum leverage, all-in on all these stocks,” Tate claimed. “We’re losing all the money, we are taking down Wall Street, we’re going to take them down ourselves.“I’m taking Wall Street down, watch me,” he continued. ”Fuck ‘em. Fuck ‘em all.”Tate says he doesn’t care if he loses it all—his motivation is the downfall of the unnamed hedge fund manager.The flurry of activity surrounding GME stock has more than doubled its value in the last 24 hours—prompting exchanges to halt trading at least six times on Monday—meanwhile triggering $1.4 billion in liqudiations for investors who had bet against its rise, according to Bloomberg. GME is trading for $32.50 as of writing, compared to $10 a month ago.An unofficial Solana meme coin named in honor of Game Stop has posted even more astronomical gains.Tate has since gone further, shouting out the Occupy Wall Street movement, which initially sparked the first wave of interest in meme stocks. Some investors blame hedge funds and other financial institutions for the 2008 financial crisis. Investing in stocks that will trigger hedge fund losses is one way of exacting revenge. Tate has gone on a Twitter tirade, touting GameStop stock and invoking the WallStreetBets vow that he’ll never sell his stocks, no matter the price.“This is about pissing off some dork somewhere in Wall Street with a vaccine and a tiny johnson,” Tate exclaimed in another video.This all comes amid the influencer’s trial for alleged human trafficking and rape. A couple of weeks ago, a court in Romania said that his trial can officially go ahead 10 months after Tate and his brother were charged. A few days ago, the same court extended restrictions that prevent Tate from leaving Romania for another 60 days. A trial date is yet to be set.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Unexpected Development in Cryptocurrency Regulation in Turkey: Leveraged Trading is Expected to be Banned - Bitcoin Sistemi


The bill prepared on the legal regulations and definitions of crypto assets is ready to be presented to the Parliament with its final touches. The proposal, which is expected to be presented to the Parliament this week, will ban short selling and leveraged transactions regarding crypto assets.
Crypto assets will be defined as “intangible assets” for the first time, and thus transactions can be carried out in a more transparent and reliable manner. The bill to be presented to the Parliament will harmonize the broad definition of crypto assets with the definitions of international organizations.


The authority to determine the issuance principles will be given to the Capital Markets Board (CMB). The licensing and auditing processes of trading platforms will also be managed by the CMB. Minimum operating requirements similar to financial institutions will be introduced for service providers.

All transfer transactions made on the platforms will be recorded and compliance with the regulations determined by the Financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAK) will be ensured. Since sudden and large fluctuations may occur in the prices of crypto assets, margin transactions, short sales and leveraged transactions that increase risk will be prohibited.





It is stated that similar prohibitions and restrictions have been introduced in practices abroad. Secondary regulations will be made on investment consultancy and portfolio management and the CMB will be authorized in this regard.
Due to the risky nature of crypto asset investments, no insurance mechanism will be created for trading transactions. These transactions will be exempt from investor compensation. In the draft law, the crime of “unauthorized crypto asset service provider” is defined and penalties are foreseen for those who operate without permission from the CMB.

Bitcoin ETF Weekly Investments Grow For First Time In Over a Month - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFresh cash has started hitting Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) again after five weeks of outflows. A Monday report from European asset manager CoinShares shows $130 million entering the funds last week. CoinShares tracks all crypto funds from the U.S. to Europe and Australia. Most of last week's movements entered American funds, particularly the new spot ETFs that give traditional stock investors exposure to Bitcoin.The report added that European investors pulled $14 million out of Ethereum-related funds due to bearish sentiment surrounding the approval of an Ethereum ETF.A number of high-profile investment firms are hoping to get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Ethereum ETF, but experts think the regulator will drag its heels in giving such products the green light—if they're approved at all.“Low interaction by the U.S. regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent,” CoinShares wrote. “This has been reflected in outflows which totalled $14 million last week.”Perhaps the best news for investors who are long on Bitcoin is that the amount of money leaving Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) last week was the lowest it has been since its conversion to an ETF in January. Since shifting from a closed-end fund model to an ETF, investors have aggressively redeemed shares to cash out of the product—either to look for a cheaper ETF or take home gains. As the fund sells its Bitcoin to pay customers cash, these massive outflows have put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.But at the start of this month, for the first time, more investors started buying GBTC shares than redeeming them.GBTC inflows could lead to the price of the asset going up if more investors want exposure to the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, CoinShares said.Bitcoin is now trading for $62,810 per coin, CoinGecko says. It touched a new all-time high in March of nearly $74,000 but has since struggled due to dying ETF hype.

House overturns SEC’s anti-crypto guidance, Biden to veto: Law Decoded

The United States House of Representatives has voted to pass a bill overturning controversial Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance preventing banks from owning crypto. The House voted to pass a bipartisan bill titled H.J. Res 109, overturning the SEC’s Special Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) requiring banks to hold their customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets, which is not the case for traditional assets such as securities.Republican Party Representative Mike Flood — who introduced the resolution — said SAB 121 was unfair for banks looking to custody crypto, as custodial assets are “always considered off-balance sheet.”However, before the vote, U.S. President Joe Biden’s office issued a statement informing lawmakers and the public that his administration plans to veto a joint resolution affecting crypto policy at the SEC if it comes to his desk.The White House said it “strongly opposes” members of the House of Representatives seeking to pass a joint resolution it claims would disrupt the SEC’s efforts “to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.” Australian Tax Office seeks data from 1.2 million crypto usersThe Australian Taxation Office (ATO) seeks personal data and transaction details from up to 1.2 million cryptocurrency exchange users for a potential crackdown on crypto tax obligations. The tax officials believe the data will help identify traders who may have failed to pay their taxes on their crypto trades. The ATO will seek personal data, including users’ date of birth, social media accounts, phone numbers, transaction-related details like wallet addresses, type of coin trades and bank account details.For Australian regulators, cryptocurrencies are taxable assets, unlike other foreign currencies. This requires traders to pay a capital gains tax on the profit from selling crypto assets.Continue readingSouth Korea’s ruling party will press for Bitcoin ETF tradingThe Democratic Party of Korea will request that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) reconsider its interpretation of the legal status of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). An unnamed official of the Democratic Party policy committee told the local paper that the party would make the request after the opening of the National Assembly in June. The opposition party was swept into power in the April elections in South Korea and holds 175 of 300 seats in the legislative body.Previously, after the approval of spot BTC ETFs in the U.S., the FSC issued a statement saying Korean securities firms could violate the Capital Markets Act by listing foreign spot ETFs.

Bitcoin ETFs Break 4-Week Outflow Sorrow with $117M Inflows - DailyCoin


        

Bitcoin ETFs have overturned their weeks-long trend of outflows.



The crypto market recorded a similar wave of inflows in signs of recovery.



The ongoing rebound suggests reignited interest in crypto funds.




The crypto market has witnessed mixed sentiment over the past weeks, marked by rollercoaster performances across assets and fluctuating interest among market participants. Negatively impacted, Bitcoin ETFs took a downward spiral of outflows, shedding over half a billion on May 2, 2024.



Now, in a reversal of fortunes, the market is displaying signs of recovery.



Bitcoin ETFs Signal Recovery



According to Farside Investors data on May 11, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. recorded a total of $116.8 million in the recently concluded week.




Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge with a dominant $111.3 million, surpassing Ark Invest’s ARKB, which saw a total of $82.8 million in inflows. FBTC and ARKB surpassed the once best-performing BlackRock’s IBIT, which continued its trend of underperformance with only $48.1 million in inflows.







In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC reverted to its infamous lackluster performance. Despite commencing the week with a promising $67 million inflow, Grayscale ended the week on a sour note with a total of $175 million outflows.



Bitcoin ETFs such as VanEck’s HODL and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, among others, recorded minimal inflows, contributing to a total record for the week of $11.7 million. The recovery witnessed across the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market mirrors the uptick observed across global crypto investment products.



Crypto Funds Reverse Negative Trend



According to CoinShares data on Monday, May 13, the crypto market recorded $130 million in inflows in the past week. This marked the funds’ first set of recovery inflows, following an unimpressive performance that saw the market consecutively bleed for nearly five weeks




Being the primary focus, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled $144 million, followed distantly by Solana (SOL), which saw a total of $5.9 million in inpour. Litecoin, XRP, Polkadot, and other assets also closed the week with an uptick, registering a cumulative $3.2 million.



Source: CoinShares



However, the optimism didn’t extend to others, which bucked the trend with outflows. One notable loser was Ethereum (ETH), which led the negative train of approximately $23.3 million.



This brought the inflows to $130 million, marking an approximate 430% increase from the previous week’s $435 million outflow record.

Uniswap CEO: Biden's Crypto Stance Echoes Hillary's Past Errors - DailyCoin


        

Uniswap Labs CEO Hayden Adams has asserted President Joe Biden is making a deadly mistake with his handling of crypto as elections near.



According to the Uniswap founder, Republicans are already taking advantage.



Adams’ sentiments add to a chorus of opposition to the Biden administration within crypto circles.




Despite being widely seen as the home of technological innovation, the U.S. has proven rugged terrain for the crypto industry.



Amid uncertain regulations and a flurry of enforcement actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), several industry leaders have espoused the view that the President Joe Biden-led administration is out to stifle crypto. With the November 2024 elections approaching, the president’s recent vow to veto any legislative attempt to overturn a perceived anti-crypto accounting rule from the SEC has only strengthened these views.




According to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, Biden’s continued alienation of the crypto industry could cause his campaign to face the same fate as Hillary Clinton’s in 2016.



“Republicans Smell Blood in the Water”



On Monday, May 13, Adams asserted that the Biden administration was underestimating the influence of crypto “both in terms of voters and money” in the coming elections. He likened it to Hillary Clinton’s failure to campaign in swing states when she ran for office in 2016.



"Hillary campaigning in red states states [sic] instead of swing states level miscalculation from Biden camp thinking crypto will be irrelevant in 2024 election and letting SEC + Warren wage total war - both in terms of voters and money," he wrote.



According to the Uniswap Labs chief, whose protocol faces the threat of enforcement from the SEC, while the Biden administration and Democratic party fumbled the ball on crypto, the Republicans were catching on.



"Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto."



This sentiment comes as former President Donald Trump has increasingly pandered to the crypto community in recent weeks, noting that his campaign is now open to receiving crypto donations.




Adams noted that the Biden administration had to act fast to stand any chance of changing the tide.



"Not much time for Biden to save it. Any one [sic] close to him or dem leadership should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto (public support/plan and reigning in sec + warren)."



While Adams’ sentiments suggest that there may be room for redemption, several other leaders appear to have lost all hope.



Crypto Industry Leaders Rally Against Biden



In an X post on May 8, Messari Crypto founder Ryan Selkis argued that several aspects of the crypto industry will suffer if Biden is re-elected. Recently, Selkis has become an active part of the Trump campaign. On May 9, he shared the stage with the leading Republican candidate during a 60-minute Q&A at Mar-a-Lago.







Echoing Selkis’ sentiments, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson asserted that “a vote for Biden is a vote against cryptocurrencies” in a message to followers on May 8. Unlike Selkis, however, the Cardano founder has pitched his tent in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s camp.



Meanwhile, on May 10, the Coinbase-led Stand With Crypto advocacy group formed a Political Action Committee (PAC) to raise funds for crypto-friendly candidates.



On the Flipside 




Uniswap faces the threat of an enforcement action from the U.S. SEC.



An April 2023 Pew Research survey found that only 17% of Americans say they have ever invested in crypto.



Crypto industry participants should also consider the policy stances of candidates beyond crypto.




Why This Matters 



Uniswap’s Hayden Adams statements highlight crypto’s hot-button topic status in the U.S. presidential election.

Going for Gold on Blast Jackpot | Bankless


Blast has done a pretty stellar job of courting attention as a place for degens to earn big. The main way the network has accomplished this is through its native yield, as ETH and stablecoin holders can annually earn 4% and 5% respectively on Blast. The L2 also aims to make good on its reputation thanks to its ongoing Blast Points and Blast Gold program. Half of Blast’s upcoming airdrop is going to Points holders, and half to Gold holders. Note that initially, only ETH and USDB holders earned Points, and only Blast app users earned Gold. Yet with the early makings of memecoin and NFT scenes starting to rise on Blast, the L2’s team decided to offer passive token and NFT holders a way to rack up Gold rewards, too.Here, cue in Blast Jackpot. The Blast Jackpot is a recently launched game that periodically rewards token and NFT holders on Blast. Every block mined on the network has a basic chance to trigger a jackpot, and when this happens, a random token or NFT is selected as the winner. Everyone who entered the winning asset will receive a cut of the latest Gold prize pool. The odds of selection favor tokens over NFTs, but all assets on the platform, except for WETH and USDB, are eligible.The initiative gets Blast users to diversify their holding on the network for a chance at the jackpot.If you’re interested in trying it out, entering is straightforward, but you will need to onboard to the Blast Airdrop dashboard first if you haven’t already. If you need an invite code, dozens of users have dropped theirs as comments in the Blast “Referral Link” quest in our Airdrop Hunter hub!Once you’re set up on Blast, transfer some ETH in through the native bridge or a fast 3rd-party bridge like Relay, and then you’ll be ready to start acquiring assets so you can enter into Blast Jackpot. For example, I recently joined by acquiring some of the $PAC memecoin on Thruster, a decentralized exchange, and some Skellies NFTs on the NFT orderbook platform Mintify. Once you have whichever assets you want ready in your wallet, just head to the Blast Jackpot page, scroll down and select the “Add Token or NFT to your Deck” option, and then select your desired asset. You can enter as many as eight different assets in the available deck slots like this!At this point, it’s just a waiting game—you can check back on this Jackpot page to manage your entries over time and track if any of your assets are winners going forward. If you’re lucky, you’ll win at least one nice chunk of Blast Gold before the official Blast airdrop, and if you’re really lucky you may win multiple—they’re are only so many assets on the young L2 right now, after all.

Nibiru COO highlights grants as a magnet for TradFi talent in crypto - Crypto Briefing




The presence of crypto among institutional investors is on the rise, especially after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Companies such as JPMorgan, UBS, and Wells Fargo declared Bitcoin ETF holdings in their recent 13F filings.This rise in institutional interest can also be seen in the professional area. Executives with backgrounds in traditional finance (TradFi) are rotating to crypto as the market matures. Former Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Jonathan Chang, is one of these executives, now in the role of COO at layer-1 blockchain Nibiru.He shared insights with Crypto Briefing on valuable TradFi skills that can be used in crypto, how grants are a powerful tool to attract more of the traditional market, and how those professionals can help solve crypto issues.Crypto Briefing – What was your biggest challenge when pivoting from traditional finance to crypto? What set of skills learned from TradFi were most valuable when joining this new market?Jonathan Chang – Crypto is known for its unique complexities. Traditional Finance (TradFi) offers a more relatable framework for understanding decentralized finance due to its familiar concepts. However, there is still a learning curve, particularly with the specialized terminology used in crypto.For instance, while the principles of lending, including borrowers, underwriting, credit assessment, and lenders are well-established in TradFi, the application of these concepts in crypto—built on smart contract platforms and enhanced with tokenomics—introduces a new layer of complexity.In fintech, the ledger is fundamental for recording bank transactions. This concept closely parallels the blockchain ledger used in crypto, which also records transactions but does so in a decentralized way.I’ve noticed that fintech and crypto startups often share similar goals, particularly in speeding up payments and financial services. The main difference lies in the technology stacks each uses to achieve these goals.Now that I’m more involved in crypto, my background in traditional finance is proving beneficial. My experience in equity research enhanced my analytical and writing skills, and deepened my understanding of how markets moved.In investment banking, I refined my abilities in structuring transactions, managing teams, and general soft skills. Venture capital and growth equity offered opportunities to meet diverse founders, understand market mapping, and appreciate business differentiation. These skills were invaluable, aiding in process management, quality control, and leveraging a broad network in new environments.Often, creative problem-solving is essential, and having a variety of experiences from high-pressure situations has become increasingly valuable. These reference points from my past work are helpful tools in navigating and innovating within crypto.Crypto Briefing – Are grants a valuable way to attract talent to crypto? Do you think of grants as just a money incentive, or do you think of a proper introduction to the market and its technologies?Jonathan Chang – Grants play a crucial role in drawing talent to the crypto and DeFi sectors, providing much more than just financial incentives. In a time when funding is limited and developers and entrepreneurs urgently need resources to bring their ideas to life, grants offer vital early support.Equally important, however, is the comprehensive ecosystem support that a well-designed grant program provides. This includes access to mentorship, technical resources, and a network of like-minded innovators, fostering an environment ripe for learning, experimentation, and growth.At Nibiru, our grant program is crafted to achieve these goals. We offer financial assistance and leverage our extensive network and expertise to enhance our grantees’ success. This support includes connecting them with VC partners, offering mentorship opportunities, and providing access to our advanced developer suite. Our objective is to give a complete introduction to the market and the tools needed to succeed.The Nibiru ecosystem is dedicated to empowering developers, helping them become catalysts for positive Web3 transformation. Our grants initiative not only supports through partnerships and mentorship but also boosts the visibility of projects within our ecosystem with targeted marketing support.Our grants are structured with Total Value Locked (TVL) milestones in mind, aiming to find partners committed to long-term growth within the chain. During our diligence process, the chemistry between the founder and our team is a key factor in ensuring aligned goals and collaborative potential.Crypto Briefing – Despite being better, crypto UX is still a threshold to capture more users and talent. Do you believe that non-native crypto talent’s point of view is an important piece to solve this problem?Jonathan Chang – Absolutely. A major challenge in the crypto industry today is the complexity of the user experience. Despite significant innovation, many blockchain applications remain too complex for the average user.This is where non-native crypto talent becomes crucial. These individuals may not possess deep technical knowledge of blockchain but offer fresh perspectives and a strong focus on user-centric design.They are key to bridging the gap between sophisticated technology and the seamless, user-friendly experiences that people expect. At Nibiru, we see this in action. Our team, drawn from a mix of backgrounds, including traditional finance, technology, and consumer industries, brings diverse viewpoints that are critical in developing relatable products.They challenge us to simplify and humanize our offerings, urging us to prioritize the user journey over technical details. As a result, they help us create not just functional but genuinely enjoyable experiences. So, to directly answer your question—yes, I firmly believe that non-native crypto talent is essential in addressing the UX challenges in crypto.

Bracebridge Capital Becomes Largest Bitcoin ETF Holder, Investing $380 Million In All-In Bet | Bitcoinist.com


								Last week, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced a notable shift in investor sentiment. Positive inflows were reported, breaking a streak of outflows that had persisted for almost a month. The week concluded with a significant $116 million positive inflows, indicative of growing interest in the newly approved index funds.
Notably, a new player entered the market and made substantial investments, quickly becoming one of the largest holders of Bitcoin ETFs.
Bracebridge Capital Nets Major ETF Holdings
Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund, reported owning $262 million worth of Ark Invest’s ARKB ETF. Additionally, they emerged as the largest owner of Blackrock’s IBIT with an investment of $81 million. 

Bracebridge Capital also holds $20 million of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which experienced negative outflows of $103 million during the same period. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas described Bracebridge Capital’s investment as a “wild” move, noting the firm’s significant acquisitions.

It is also worth mentioning the growing number of holders for each ETF, with IBIT boasting 250 holders in the first quarter alone, which is notable for a recently launched product.
Bitcoin ETF Outflows In Hong Kong Persist
In contrast, the Bitcoin ETF market in Hong Kong has been experiencing slower but consistent outflows. On Friday, May 10, 2024, there was an outflow of $6.3 million, followed by an $18.5 million outflow on Monday, May 13, 2024. However, it should be noted that Bosera and Harvest are yet to report for Monday, according to Farside data. 
These outflows come amidst rumors that Bitcoin ETFs listed in Hong Kong could soon become accessible to investors from mainland China.
As previously reported, Richard Byworth, Managing Partner at SyzCapital, sparked speculation about integrating Hong Kong-listed Bitcoin ETFs into the Stock Connect system, potentially allowing mainland Chinese investors to access these funds. 
Byworth’s remarks on social media highlighted ongoing discussions surrounding this potential integration, which could lead to a significant influx of capital from mainland China into the Bitcoin ETF market. 
The initial performance of the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF, which gathered $121 million on its first trading day, has fueled optimism about the future of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. 

Samson Mow, a prominent figure in the industry, expressed bullish sentiments. At the same time, Brian HoonJong Paik, Co-founder & COO at SmashFi, emphasized the potential socio-economic benefits of mainland Chinese interest in Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs. 
Paik highlighted the vast amount of Chinese wealth in real estate, suggesting that alternative investment opportunities could help stabilize the socio-economic landscape and mitigate social unrest.
As discussions continue, market participants are closely monitoring its potential impact on capital flows and the overall adoption of digital asset funds in the region.

Brazil leads LATAM crypto trading with $6B volume in 2024

Crypto trade volumes in Brazil have spiked in the first months of 2024. According to data from Kaiko Research, crypto trading activity in the country is up 30% year-over-year.From January to early May 2024, crypto trading volume denominated in Brazilian real reached $6 billion, marking a 30% increase from the previous year. Thus far, in 2024, the country has ranked as the largest market in Latin America and the seventh-largest worldwide in terms of fiat currency trade, said Kaiko.In the first four months of 2024, crypto trading volume in the Mexican peso was $3.7 billion, while the Argentine peso volume was approximately $300 million.“Despite the recent market correction, BRL trade volumes are still up 30% compared to last year,” reads the report, adding that BRL trade volumes have been growing faster than United States dollar trade volumes since late January.Breakdown of trading activity by asset. Source: Kaiko ResearchStablecoins are becoming more and more popular over Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in the country. Almost half of all trades in 2024 involved stablecoins, according to Kaiko, with Tether’s (USDT) market share rising by nearly 20% since the 2021 bull market.According to data from B3, a primary financial market infrastructure provider in the country, the Brazilian crypto market now has 13 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including popular funds from Hashdex and BlackRock. Bitcoin ETFs have been traded in the country since 2021, managing about 2.5 billion reals (~ $500 million) as of March.“BTC and ETH accounted for a combined 43% of BRL trade volumes. For context, they make up more than 70% of USD-denominated volumes.”Binance currently holds the largest market share in Brazil at 79% of transactions, though its dominance has been shrinking. In contrast, the largest Brazilian exchange, Mercado Bitcoin, along with Mexico-based Bitso, have seen their combined market share climb to 21% by early May, reaching its highest point in over three years, Kaiko reported.

Shiba Inu Adoption: People Can Now Book Airbnb or Buy Nike Clothes via SHIB


																TL;DR

CoinGate, a blockchain payment processor, has added Shiba Inu as a payment method, integrating it with Polygon and Binance Smart Chain.
SHIB’s price experienced an uptick lately, while its market capitalization neared $14 billion.


Enabling SHIB Payments
CoinGate – a blockchain payment processor headquartered in Lithuania – became the latest entity to embrace the popular meme coin – Shiba Inu – as a payment method. To do so, it integrated SHIB with Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. 

The payment gateway enables businesses to buy, sell, manage, and accept cryptocurrencies. It acts as a bridge between crypto and traditional finance, facilitating transactions for goods and services. 
Popular companies that collaborate with the payment processor in some way include Airbnb, Nike, Spotify, Walmart, IKEA, Uber, and many more.
Besides the thumbs up from CoinGate, SHIB made the headlines today (May 13) thanks to its substantial price increase. As CryptoPotato reported, it spiked by 7% on an hourly scale while its market capitalization neared the $14 billion mark.




Previous Support for SHIB
The self-proclaimed Dogecoin-killer saw the light of day in the summer of 2020, capturing the attention of numerous industry participants and exchanges in the following years.
Not long ago, the crypto lending platform Nexo enabled users to buy Shiba Inu, explaining that card transactions can be accepted “in seconds.” It also allowed swaps with rewards, borrowing against the token, and sending assets to a friend via a phone number or email.
Other leading crypto firms that have already embraced the meme coin include Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Gemini, OKX, KuCoin, GroveX, and many more.

Memestock Mania Returns | Bankless


Memestock Pop-Off. GameStop Corporation (GME) shares soared as much as 126% off their Friday close, the stock’s largest single-day spike since the height of the memestock frenzy in January 2021! Why has GME surged in such dramatic fashion, and could this development be a harbinger of good tidings for your crypto bags?While wild swings in GME triggered circuit breakers to halt trading numerous times this morning, highlighting the immense amount of realized volatility from this move, GME had been displaying unexpectedly high volatility throughout May after a short squeeze at the start of this month already sent the stock rallying by 40%.Monthly options on US-listed stocks are set to expire this Friday and market participants were heavily long in-the-money GME call positions for this expiration, forcing the dealers who sold these calls to repurchase stock as the price rose to hedge their exposure, a textbook example of a short squeeze.
This explosion in GME has also been marked by the return of Roaring Kitty (aka Keith Gill) to Twitter, an investor who championed short squeezes throughout 2021 only to vanish from the internet shortly after GME’s third pump in July of that year.His account tweeted out a picture of an individual leaning forward in a chair as if to indicate that it's time to pay attention on Sunday, following up the initial post with a series of inspirational clips from popular movies.Popular American movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, another primary beneficiary of the 2021 memestonk craze, has not experienced triple-digit daily returns like GME, but still managed to pop over 50% on the day.The last memestock short squeeze catalyzed by a historic GME run-up was followed by a near 12-month uninterrupted streak of gains for broader equity markets before the Federal Reserve’s interest rate raises sucked liquidity out of the market.Although market participants are uncertain about the timing of future rate cuts, their eventual occurrence has been accepted with near certainty given the steadily deteriorating global economic condition, eliminating rate increases as a future risk factor for bulls.With year-over-year growth in the monetary supply as measured by M2 turning positive for the first time since 2022 and animal spirits seemingly taking control of TradFi, it is certainly feels possible that prices of crypto assets prices could continue to run, drawing an increased amount of investors and their capital into the space as they seek return.

Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times

I understand that, ideally, voters should care more about things like abortion, environmental and immigration policy than crypto. (Most probably do.) I understand Zuckerman and Albus’ distaste for Trump, his sexual assault charges, alleged fraud and election denialism. I understand why, optically, crypto casting itself as conservative is a dubious proposition, an expedient way to get 40+% of the population to turn their minds against it, as Laura Shin astutely pointed out.

Annoying News from Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs: Seen for the First Time Since Launch - Bitcoin Sistemi

There were significant outflows in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed in Hong Kong today, after Bitcoin fell below $61,000 on Friday.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs from issuers ChinaAMC, Harvest Global, Bosera and Hashkey saw an outflow of $32.7 million on Monday, according to data from Farside Investors. This figure is significantly more than previous debuts, which generally hovered around $6 million.


Today was a first in the history of these funds. All six cryptocurrency ETFs, including both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), reported negative flows for the first time since their launches on May 2. Notably, Harvest Global has never seen an outflow for its spot Bitcoin fund.
Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw significant outflows, with $6.6 million outflows from the funds. This figure is also significantly higher than past figures.





After eight days of trading, investors had withdrawn nearly $13 million from six ETFs. This result was disappointing for Asia-based ETFs, especially when compared to the exciting initial period for their US-listed counterparts.

Many industry enthusiasts point out that the Hong Kong-based ETF market is relatively small, with around $50 billion in assets. In stark contrast, the ETF market in the US is estimated to have approximately $9 trillion in assets under management.


Rumors had spread that mainland Chinese investors were gaining access to funds through Stock Connect, which would open the doors to a much larger investor base. However, the Hong Kong stock exchange denied these rumors early on Monday, stating that they were false.

Uniswap founder says Biden's indifference toward crypto could cost him elections

Uniswap founder Hayden Adams criticized President Joe Biden’s approach to crypto regulation and said his administration’s perceived indifference to crypto could be a significant miscalculation in the 2024 election.Adams warned in a May 13 post on social media that the administration is ignoring a key issue for many Americans and compared the decision to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign strategy. He said:“Hillary campaigning in red states instead of swing states level miscalculation from Biden camp thinking crypto will be irrelevant in 2024 election and letting SEC + Warren wage total war — both in terms of voters and money.”The Uniswap founder’s comments reflect growing frustration within the crypto community over what they see as aggressive regulatory actions led by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and vocal critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).Adams suggested the Biden administration’s current stance could alienate a crucial voter base and financial backers. He pointed out that Republicans are increasingly embracing crypto, seeing an opportunity to attract disillusioned voters and donors from the crypto sector. He wrote:“Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto.”This shift, he argued, could have significant implications for the 2024 election, potentially swaying votes and financial support away from Democrats.Adams urged those close to Biden and the Democratic leadership to recognize the seriousness of the situation and advocate for a more favorable stance toward digital assets.Key voter issueAmerican voters’ views toward crypto are evolving rapidly, with a recent Harris Poll revealing that nearly 60% of Americans have some familiarity with digital assets, and about 20% have invested in crypto.Younger voters, particularly those in the 18-34 age bracket, show a higher propensity for crypto investment and support for pro-crypto policies. The demographic’s growing influence could be pivotal in upcoming elections.Moreover, the poll highlighted a partisan divide in attitudes toward crypto. Republicans are generally more supportive of crypto adoption and innovation, viewing it as a symbol of free market principles and technological advancement.In contrast, many Democrats advocate for more robust regulatory oversight to prevent fraud and protect consumers, reflecting broader concerns about financial stability and systemic risk.The Biden administration’s approach to crypto has been a contentious issue, with proponents arguing that tighter regulations are necessary to protect consumers and the financial system. At the same time, critics contend that excessive regulation stifles innovation and economic growth.As the 2024 election approaches, the debate over crypto regulation will likely intensify, with both parties vying for the support of a rapidly growing and increasingly influential industry.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Bitcoin Deja Vu: Metric Mirrors Pattern That Led To 2021 Top


								On-chain data suggests a Bitcoin indicator is currently mirroring the same trend that led to the top of the bull run in 2021.
Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Distribution Appears To Be Ending
As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the BTC long-term holders are currently showcasing a trend that’s reminiscent of 2021.
The “long-term holders” (LTHs) are Bitcoin investors who have been keeping their coins dormant (that is, not transferring or selling them from their wallet) for more than 155 days.

Generally, the longer a holder keeps their coins still, the less likely they are to move them at any point. As such, the LTHs, with their long holding times, are considered the market’s resolute hands.
These investors usually don’t react to events in the wider market, like a rally or crash, but this year’s price surge towards the new all-time high (ATH) has forced even these HODLers into selling.
The chart below shows the trend in the total Bitcoin supply held by the addresses belonging to the LTH cohort over the last few years:

Looks like the value of the metric has observed a drawdown in recent months | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As the graph shows, Bitcoin LTHs were accumulating between the May 2021 crash and this year’s rally. With this rise towards the new ATH, though, the supply of these HOLDers has started observing a downtrend instead.
Something to keep in mind is that the indicator has a 155-day delay when it comes to buying, as only mature supplies can count under it.
Thus, when the metric goes up, it doesn’t mean that there is accumulation in the present but rather that some buying occurred 155 days ago, and these coins have just now aged enough to count under the LTHs.
For selling, though, no such delay is attached, as coins exit the group as soon as they are transferred on the network. As such, the latest decline would correspond to a selloff that has been happening in the present.
Recently, as the Bitcoin price has fallen prey to stagnation, the LTHs have slowed down their selling, with the supply more or less moving sideways. As Maartunn has highlighted in the chart, this trend is similar to what was observed in 2021.
The LTHs ending their distribution then meant a top for the cryptocurrency. A similar pattern was also witnessed during the 2017 bull run. Therefore, going by these historical precedents, the latest flat movement in the LTH supply could also suggest a potential peak for the latest bull run.

This is only if, of course, the LTH distribution has truly ended. The chart shows that in each of the last two bull markets, the initial sharp selling from the LTHs was followed up by a phase of slower-paced distribution.
This slowed-down decline continued for months before the metric reached the consolidation phase and the asset’s top occurred. It now remains to be seen if the latest trend shift in the Bitcoin LTH supply corresponds to the former or the latter phase.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $62,700 level, down almost 2% over the past week.

Mark Cuban Urges CFTC Regulation of Crypto and Suggests Impact on 2024 Election



                    

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban recently voiced strong opinions about the need for clearer regulatory frameworks within the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, urging the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to oversee all crypto-related activities. 



In a post directed to his 8.8 million followers on X on May 10, Cuban emphasized the urgency of legislative action prior to the 2024 presidential election, suggesting that it could influence the re-election of President Joe Biden.




Cuban stated, “You could solve this problem for Biden by passing legislation that defines registration that is specific to the crypto industry just as other industries have registration that is defined for them.” 



His comments reflect a broader concern within the crypto community about the need for tailored regulatory measures that can foster both innovation and consumer protection.



Highlighting the potential political repercussions of regulatory decisions, Cuban pointedly mentioned Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), known for his stringent stance on cryptocurrencies. 




Cuban argued that Gensler’s approach could alienate crypto voters, implying that this could be a decisive factor in the upcoming election. 



“If Joe Biden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank Gary Gensler and the New York SEC,” Cuban said, suggesting that a more crypto-friendly regulatory approach could be more advantageous.



He proposed a more effective alternative, advocating for the CFTC to take charge of all crypto regulations.



This idea aligns with the growing consensus among younger and independent voters who perceive crypto as a significant part of their financial interaction and are critical of the SEC’s handling under Gensler’s leadership.

Cuban harshly criticized Gensler’s record, saying, “Crypto is a mainstay with younger and independent voters. Gensler HAS NOT PROTECTED A SINGLE INVESTOR AGAINST FRAUD.”



Data from litigation consulting firm Cornerstone Research indicates that the SEC undertook 46 enforcement actions against crypto firms in 2023 alone, underscoring the aggressive regulatory landscape. 



Meanwhile, Rostin Behnam, Chair of the CFTC, anticipates another wave of enforcement within the next six to 18 months, hinting at ongoing challenges for the sector.



The discourse around cryptocurrency regulation is poised to be a significant issue in the 2024 U.S. election. 



A recent poll reported by Cointelegraph on May 7, conducted among 1,201 registered voters, found that over two-thirds resonate with the sentiment that “crypto is for people like them, and more equitable than the financial system.”



This unfolding narrative captures the complex interplay between politics, regulatory actions, and the vibrant dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, reflecting a critical juncture in the regulatory oversight of digital assets in the U.S.

Solana Price Prediction as SOL Trading Volume Soars to $2.5 Billion – Are Whales Buying the Dip? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Solana (SOL) price has jumped back up to test $150 from earlier session lows under $140 amid a surge in trading volumes, as traders await a barrage of upcoming US economic data releases later in the week.As per Yahoo Finance, trading volumes on major exchanges surpassed $2.5 billion on Monday. That was the highest since last Tuesday.The impressive price rise still leaves the Solana price lodged well within its $120-$160 range over the past month.Wednesday’s US CPI and Retail Sales could shake things up, as traders assess the interest rate outlook.But ahead of then, the focus is on meme coins (and meme stocks) following Roaring Kitty’s sudden return.His return comes with gas fees very low across major blockchains like Ethereum.Solana has marked itself out in 2024 as the number one meme coin blockchain.If Roaring Kitty’s return coupled with low gas fees can start a new meme coin season, Solana could be a key beneficiary.Solana Price Prediction – Are Whales Buying the Dip?
Bitcoin (BTC), last at $63,000, also remains stuck within multi-month ranges and isn’t likely to see a major breakout soon.The macro backdrop remains uncertain, with traders unsure how soon and fast Fed rate cuts are coming.Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have crawled to a halt. The April halving proved to be a sell-the-news event, with post-halving rallies typically not coming in for 4-6 months.And we are heading into summer, typically a subdued/bearish time for Bitcoin.So Bitcoin could easily remain stuck within recent ranges for the foreseeable future. And that suggests that Solana might also be stuck within recent ranges.But say meme coin season returns and Solana meme coins take center stage.A break above $160 would open the door to a swift move back to $200.If it can break above $160 resistance, the Solana price is in with a shot of quickly rallying back to $200. Source: TradingViewHowever, should meme season fail, and the market’s broader malaise turn into a sell-off, Solana could break lower.$120 is key long-term support. Should this level break a quick test of $100 or lower would be on the cards.Alternatively, the Solana price would likely dip under $100 if it breaks below $120 support. Source: TradingViewSuch a sell-off would likely see short-term holders with a low tolerance for riding a drawdown, often referred to as “crypto tourists”, panic sell into the hands of higher conviction dip-buyers and whales.Such capitulation isn’t yet obvious. But you can bet that under $100 the Solana whales will come piling in to scoop up more.And this would be a great sign of a near-term bottom.Solana Alternative to Consider – Slothana (SLOTH)
An exciting new Solana meme coin called Slothana (SLOTH) has seen an amazing start to life since its recent launch.The Sloth-themed meme coin is up 550% since its May 1 launch, with a market cap now near $100 million.Slothana aims to supplant its Sloth-themed meme coin predecessor Slerf (SLERF), which at one point had a market cap of close to $500 million.But Slerf has since dropped back to $145 million. Slothana could soon take the crown as the biggest Sloth meme coin.As meme coin risk appetite returns, it could become a multi-billion-dollar coin. Slothana is a good bet to the next GME stock.

GameStop Meme Coins Are Taking Over Solana as Pump.fun Sets Record - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe return of Keith Gill, a man closely linked to GameStop’s stock rally in 2021, has unleashed a massive flood of Solana-based meme coins through the pump.fun protocol. GME Stonks, GameOver, and KiethGillWifHat are just a few examples of tokens launched through pump.fun in the last 24 hours after Gill—a financial analyst and investor also known as Roaring Kitty—posted a meme on Twitter, resurfacing for the first time in years.Allowing anyone to launch a meme coin for only 0.02 SOL ($3), pump.fun notched its busiest day of deployments on Sunday after Gill posted an image of a man hunched forward in a chair with a video game controller in hand. In all, 14,500 different meme coins were launched via pump.fun that day, setting a new record, according to a Dune dashboard.Appearing to match Sunday’s pace of new Solana tokens, over 7,400 were also created through pump.fun on Monday, as of this writing. On Twitter, the pump.fun account appeared to reference Gill’s cat-themed moniker and an influx of associated tokens when it said, “Today is a good day for cats, that's for sure.”Pump.fun also acknowledged the not-so-good side of meme coins as well, such as how the value of the volatile assets can plummet due to “rug pulls.” The pump.fun team asked Gill on Twitter if he was “interested in grifting [on his] followers with a coin launch,” effectively inviting him to join in.Whether anonymous developers simply added an image of a hat to Gill or employed a popular misspelling of words, Monday’s Gill- and GameStop-themed coins added to the growing list of 512,000 tokens deployed using the Solana protocol. Since pump.fun’s January release, those launches have resulted in around 127,000 SOL or $19 million in revenue for the protocol in the form of gas fees.Some Solana-based tokens drew inspiration from videos Gill posted Monday after his initial reappearance. For example, playing off of the inclusion of the Marvel superhero Wolverine in one, a token named Roaring Wolverine was launched—and appears to have already crashed. Once known for making frequent, top-rated posts on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets, Gill is credited with corralling thousands of traders in 2020 to bet against Wall Street through one of its most shorted stocks. Following a historic short squeeze that sent GameStop share price skyrocketing to $483, however, the figure of modern financial folklore largely faded from the public’s view.As GameStop’s stock surged on Wall Street Monday following Gill’s reemergence, trading was halted several times. Meanwhile, a Solana-based token that borrowed GameStop’s ticker name increased nearly 1,700% along with others inspired by the meme stock craze.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Hard to Believe Statement from Fund Manager: "Solana Price Could Rise to $400, Here's Why" - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Ryan McMillin, Chief Investment Officer of cryptocurrency fund manager Merkle Tree Capital, Solana is predicted to rise to $400 during the US elections in November, riding on the wave of election-themed memecoins.
Two Solana-based altcoins, Jeo Boden and Donald Tremp, named after mashed-up versions of the last two US presidents, were instrumental in this prediction. These memecoins helped Solana surpass Ethereum in trading volume this Thursday.


“Memecoins will move deeper into the bull market,” said McMillin, suggesting that these two altcoins will be actively traded in the coming months. The rise of these memecoins coincided with former US President Donald Trump's strongest-ever support for crypto and current President Joe Biden's threat last week to veto a pro-crypto bill, thus making cryptocurrencies an election issue.
According to the analyst, the volatility experienced in Solana due to this news is expected to restore investors' confidence in the blockchain, which has been marred by outages over the years. “While Memecoins are a ridiculous and short-term speculative tool, they pave the way for other, more sustainable use cases, such as the tokenization of real-world assets,” McMillin added.






Currently, Solana is trading around $136, which is still far from the all-time high of $260 set in November 2021. But according to McMillin, the increased transaction volume served as a real stress test for the Solana network.
Additionally, the analyst suggested that Solana's price will be supported by more liquidity entering the market as the US Treasury takes steps to strengthen the economy.

Here are some that might be the best crypto to buy now.
Best Crypto to Buy NowDogecoin (DOGE)Dogecoin’s Potential for GrowthMonday saw a 5% surge in Dogecoin (DOGE) price as traders speculated on the potential arrival of a new meme coin season. As the largest and oldest meme coin by market capitalization, Dogecoin currently sits just under $0.15, boasting a substantial market cap of $22.2 billion.Despite its current price, many enthusiasts believe DOGE could reach the coveted $1 mark, propelling its market cap to over $140 billion.This potential for exponential growth, representing a 6.5x increase from its current value, positions Dogecoin as one of the best cryptos to buy today for investors willing to embrace the volatility inherent in the meme coin market.Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Shiba Inu (SHIB), currently the second-largest meme coin by market cap, also presents itself as a compelling investment opportunity.The recent 4% price increase, coupled with a potential upside break from its pennant structure, suggests a possible surge toward its March highs above $0.000045.Shiba Inu could be the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewSuch a rally would represent a near 100% increase from its current price, hovering around $0.000024.With a market cap exceeding $14 billion, Shiba Inu mirrors Dogecoin’s strength in its dedicated and vast community of over 3.8 million followers. This strong community support suggests that Shiba Inu is well-positioned to be the best crypto to buy today.Pepe Coin (PEPE)
Pepe Coin (PEPE) pumped to new record highs on Monday above $0.000011 per token.While it has since retraced lower to $0.000010, PEPE is still up 13% in 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.If it retraces to $0.000009, this could be a great support zone to buy at.Pepe could be the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewA still modest market cap of $4.2 billion suggests Pepe has some more room to run.PEPE could easily become a $20 billion meme coin in the years ahead. Potential 5x gains make it among the best cryptos to buy now.
Exciting Meme Coin Presale to Consider – Dogeverse (DV)
The above-noted meme coins could all post solid 3-5x gains.But if meme coin investors want to lock in 50-100x gains, they need to target newer/lesser-known coins.Analysts at Cryptonews are excited about a new meme coin, Dogeverse (DV), which is available in presale and has novel cross-chain capabilities.Dogeverse distinguishes itself from other meme coins through its multi-chain approach, launching on six of the most widely used blockchains (excluding Bitcoin) and incorporating multi-chain bridge capabilities. The strategic decision could position Dogeverse as a frontrunner in the competitive meme coin market, capitalizing on the diverse blockchain ecosystem.The project has already attracted considerable attention, raising over $15 million in presale funding. Its multi-chain accessibility and ambitious vision suggest Dogeverse possesses the ingredients for viral success, attracting investors eager to participate in its presale phase.Visit Dogeverse Here

According to the CME’s FedWatch tool, market analysts forecast a 72% chance of rates remaining the same at July’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with the possibility of rate cuts pushed later in the year, at 48.6% at September’s meeting.

CFTC announces $1.8M settlement against brokerage firm FalconX

The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that it had both filed and settled charges against cryptocurrency brokerage firm Falcon Labs for roughly $1.8 million in disgorgement and penalties.In a May 13 notice, the CFTC said Falcon Labs, owned by FalconX, had failed to register as a futures commission merchant, “inappropriately facilitat[ing] access to digital asset exchanges.” The settlement required FalconX to cease offering services to U.S. residents and pay roughly $1.2 million in disgorgement and $600,000 in civil monetary penalties.“The CFTC’s enforcement program has made clear it will not tolerate digital asset exchanges that fail to register with the CFTC or comply with the agency’s rules that maintain integrity in the derivatives markets,” said Enforcement Director Ian McGinley. “And now the CFTC is taking the fight one step further by, for the first time, charging an intermediary that inappropriately facilitated access to those exchanges.”The settlement alleged that FalconX facilitated orders for digital asset derivatives for U.S. users from October 2021 to March 2023 through its ‘Edge’ product. According to the CFTC, the brokerage firm voluntarily improved its practices after its lawsuit with Binance and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. In that case, the CFTC and other U.S. authorities settled for $4.3 billion in November 203.Related: Mark Cuban advocates for CFTC to regulate ‘all crypto’ ahead of US election dayThe regulator said that FalconX had provided “substantial cooperation and remediation,” resulting in the firm receiving a lower penalty. The CFTC order included that the firm was not “admitting or denying” any of the regulator’s findings or conclusions. Cointelegraph reached out to FalconX but did not receive a response at the time of publication.On May 6, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said crypto firms operating in the U.S. could expect “another cycle of enforcement actions” within two years.

OpenAI introduces GPT-4o model, promising real-time conversation

OpenAI announced a new model, GPT-4o, which will soon allow real-time conversation with an AI assistant.In a May 13 demo, OpenAI members showed that the model can provide breathing feedback, tell a story, and help solve a math problem, among other applications.Head of Frontiers Research Mark Chen noted that, although users could previously access Voice Mode, the new model allows interruptions, no longer has a multi-second delay, and can recognize and communicate in various emotional styles.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the update in a separate blog post, calling it the “best computer interface I’ve ever used,” adding that it “feels like AI from the movies.”He said:“Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”In addition to improved text, video, and visual capabilities, GPT-4o is faster and offers the same level of intelligence as GPT-4.Full availability pendingInitially, GPT-4o will have limited features, but the model can already understand and discuss images “much better than any existing model.” In one example, OpenAI suggested that the model can examine a menu and provide translations, context, and recommendations.Each of the company’s subscription models includes different access limits. Starting today, ChatGPT Free users can access the feature with usage limits. GPT-4o to ChatGPT Plus and Team users can also access GPT-4o with five times greater usage limits.The company also plans to extend the feature to Enterprise users later with “even higher limits.”OpenAI will introduce the updated “Voice Mode” in the near future. It plans to release an alpha in the coming weeks, with early access for Plus users.Competitive AI sectorOpenAI’s updates follow other upgrades from competing companies.In March, Anthropic released an upgrade to Claude that it called superior to OpenAI’s GPT-4. Meta, meanwhile, announced Llama 3 with an improved parameter count in April.Other industry developments are yet to occur. Google is set to host its I/O conference on May 14, featuring AI within several keynotes. Apple is expected to announce iOS 18 in June, which is expected to include various new AI features.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Led by Bitcoin, why is the crypto market up today? - AMBCrypto



Crypto markets are in the green once again, thanks to factors like CME, U.S. economy and long-term holders.
Bitcoin bulls are facing the stress of pulling prices back to the immediate support level of $68,000.

The global cryptocurrency market cap has seen an increase of 1.8% in the past twenty-four hours, coming up on what can be seen as a modest recovery from the start of the weekend. 
By this time yesterday, Bitcoin [BTC] was barely hanging onto $60,000. At press time, it was worth $63,111, up by 4% on the daily chart. But is there any special reason for this minute surge? And will it hold firm?
Why Bitcoin is up
Examining data from Coinglass, Bitcoin is the most liquidated asset over the past day. It has seen over $36 million gone, mostly from Binance [BNB]. 
Overall, the data suggests that traders are actively responding to price changes with corresponding changes in their market positions, indicating a market highly sensitive to both external influences and internal sentiment changes.
Source: Coinglass
Still. Bitcoin is in the green and going up. Looking at reasons for the abrupt resilience, Coinglass data also tells us that Bitcoin’s CME open interest has increased by over 3% in twenty-four hours.
 Moreover, spot netflow has seen nearly $140 million over the same timeframe.
Source: Coinglass
 
Another reason why Bitcoin is holding firm is the U.S. economic data getting released on the 14th of May. 
Going by the negative pattern Jerome Powell has established this year, interest rate decisions have proven to be bullish for Bitcoin, seeing as rate cuts aren’t coming anytime soon.
Meanwhile, experienced Bitcoin holders are echoing the 2021 bull market vibe, as suggested by some on-chain data. 
Currently, long-term holders (LTHs) are increasing their BTC holdings after having sold off early this year.
The data suggests that, similar to mid-2021, these long-term holders are trying to acquire a larger share of the BTC supply. 
They view the low Bitcoin prices as a chance to buy more coins at a bargain, to then sell them when market excitement picks up. 
A pattern can be traced from 2018 and 2021, showing a recurring cycle where long-term holders purchase during market lows and sell during highs. 
Despite these cycles, there’s a noticeable, persistent trend where an increasingly majority portion of Bitcoin is being held by long-term holders.
Bitcoin’s current stand
AMBCrypto’s dissection of TradingView data for the BTC/USDt pair reveals a strong resistance level around the $68,000 mark, which BTC has tested multiple times over the past month without a sustained breakthrough. 
Conversely, a clear support level is evident near the $60,000 level, below which, if Bitcoin falls, further corrections to $55k and beyond could be witnessed.
The frequent and relatively large price swings within short periods (as seen from the candlestick sizes) highlight the ongoing volatility in the Bitcoin market. 
This pattern suggests a trader’s market, where short-term gains can be captured based on swift movements.

As of the latest data point, the price is experiencing another pullback towards the upward support level. 
This could be indicative of another potential buying opportunity if the pattern holds as previous instances suggest. All in all, the bears are very much in control.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 3,000% Surge For Shiba Inu - Here’s The Timeline | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Davie Satoshi has dropped a bullish prediction for Shiba Inu as part of what might be the future outlook for major meme coins. According to the analyst, SHIB is one of the meme coins with the potential to go on a 1,000% to 3,000% price surge amidst a flurry of cryptocurrencies in the meme coin niche. SHIB, on the other hand, is currently struggling with bearish price action as the bulls find themselves outnumbered by the bears.  
Surge Potential For Shiba Inu
The crypto market is full of different meme coins, each with its own community. Particularly, meme coin demand has shot up this year, with many new meme coins shooting up in value. However, investing in meme coins has its own demerits. This is because the value of these cryptocurrencies is driven by hype and sentiment, as most of them do not have a real-world utility to back up their value. As a result, some of them can tank quickly and go back to zero as easily as they shot up.

Despite this risk, some of these meme cryptocurrencies have established themselves as major industry players over the years. According to Davie Satoshi, SHIB is one of the few cryptocurrencies that fall in this safe category and can “never go to zero.” 
From his viewpoint, SHIB can go on a 10x to 30x journey in the current market cycle. This translates to a 1,000% to 3,000% surge to a price range of $0.0002250 to $0.0006750. Interestingly, this prediction is way above the current SHIB all-time high, which is at $0.00008616.
How Feasible Is This Price Target For SHIB?
SHIB is no stranger to price rises of epic proportions. After the last halving, SHIB went on an 800,000% price surge and turned many of its early holders into crypto millionaires overnight. However, the crypto landscape has evolved since then and SHIB would need to gain a better mainstream adoption and develop utility before a similar price surge can occur. 
SHIB has grown over the years from its early days as a meme cryptocurrency and now stands behind only DOGE in terms of meme coin market cap. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is now home to its own community projects including a layer-2 scaling solution (Shibarium), other tokens like BONK and LEASH, and many others. 

Shiba Inu’s team members are actively working to transform the cryptocurrency into a utility-based cryptocurrency. According to a similar prediction from crypto analyst Xanrox, Shiba Inu will definitely go higher later this year. Per his analysis, the best price to get in and catch the bounce to the upside is $0.00002249. 
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002181 and is down by 3.45% in the past 24 hours. Davie Satoshi also mentioned DOGE, PEPE, WIF, and COQ as meme cryptocurrencies with the potential to grow by 10x to 30x.

50,000% Return? Bitcoin Whale Starts Moving Decade-Old BTC Investment | Cryptoglobe


                                
A long-dormant Bitcoin whale has seemingly resurfaced after nearly 11 years and has now moved 1,000 BTC worth nearly $61 million to new cryptocurrency wallets, at a time in which the price of the cryptocurrency started recovering.



According on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the whale made two transactions after being inactive for 10.7 years, moving funds from two wallets that received 500 BTC each back in September 2013, when Bitcoin was trading at just $124 per coin.



In total, the whale received $124,000 worth of the flagship cryptocurrency and remained dormant since then, allowing the price of BTC to appreciate around 50,000% to now trade at $63,000 per coin, which the whale moved to two new addresses.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The whale’s movements come at a time in which the price of the flagship cryptocurrency has been seemingly stuck in a range between the $59,000 and the $67,000 marks over the past month, after dropping from an all-time high of over $73,000 earlier this year over the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US.



As CryptoGlobe reported, Wall Street behemoth Susquehanna International Group, known for its vast trading volume across global financial products, has significantly increased its exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin, amassing a $1.2 billion position on it in Q1 2024.



According to a recent 13-HR filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Susquehanna International now holds a massive17,271,326 shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), valued at roughly $1.09 billion as of March 31, as well as 1,349,414 shares of Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), valued at approximately $83.74 million.

                        Rain cryptocurrency exchange experienced a potential exploit on April 29, which transferred approximately $14.1 million worth of various cryptocurrencies to a new wallet under suspicious circumstances, according to a May 13 report from on-chain analyst ZachXBT.ZachXBT shared the information via their Telegram channel, noting that the exploit occurred on April 29. It entailed suspicious outflows from Rain’s Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP wallets. Funds from these wallets were swiftly transferred to instant exchanges, exchanged for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and then transferred to two addresses on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin address ending in “prp2” holds 137.9 BTC, valued at $8.6 million.Arkham Intelligence data reveals that the Ethereum destination address received its funds from an address ending in “d609,” which, in turn, received the funds from various Bitgo multi-signature wallets. Arkham has not explicitly attributed these wallets to Rain, however.BitGo MultiSig wallets are allegedly related to suspicious outflows in Rain. Source: Arkham Intelligence.Although these wallets have not been explicitly identified as belonging to Rain, they were involved in sending over 590 ETH ($1.7 million), approximately 20 billion Shiba Inu ($481,000), 12,500 Chainlink ($169,000), $240,000 Tether (USDT), and $500,000 USD Coin (USDC). These tokens were promptly swapped for ETH on Uniswap. Additionally, the Uniswap account received funds from a Binance hot wallet.Rain, a centralized crypto exchange based in Bahrain, primarily serves customers in Southwest Asia and the Middle East. Since its establishment, Rain has facilitated trading volumes exceeding $1 billion, according to regional news outlet The National.The exchange’s “pro” version has been intermittently down since May 5, according to Rain’s website, however.In 2023, Rain obtained approval from Abu Dhabi‘s financial regulator to operate as a virtual asset brokerage and custody service provider.
ZachXBT Alleges Lazarus Group’s Crypto Laundering
In recent posts, ZachXBT has made other substantial claims, including allegations that North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundered $200 million worth of cryptocurrency into fiat currency over a four-year period.According to ZachXBT’s analysis, at least $44 million worth of stolen crypto has been laundered through Paxful and Noones, utilizing two usernames, “EasyGoatfish351” and “FairJunco470,” which exhibited deposits and trading volumes corresponding to the stolen funds.The stolen funds were reportedly converted into Tether (USDT) stablecoin before being exchanged for cash and withdrawn. The Lazarus Group has historically relied on China-based over-the-counter traders for crypto-to-fiat conversions.Additionally, ZachXBT reported that a holder of Bored Ape Yacht Club tokens fell victim to a phishing attack, losing three rare NFTs – BAYC #7531, BAYC #6736, and BAYC #2100.Crypto investors lost $2 billion to hacks and exploits in the crypto industry last year, and an additional $333 million was stolen in the first quarter of this year.

Aptos Posts Triple-Digit Gains In Key Metrics, Yet APT Price Struggles At $8.40


																According to a report by Messari, Layer 1 (L1) blockchain Aptos experienced substantial gains in key metrics during the first quarter (Q1) of the year. The growth was driven by the surge in Bitcoin prices to new record highs and increased capital inflow in the market. 
However, Aptos’ native token, APT, has struggled with price performance, recording modest gains compared to other top cryptocurrencies.
Aptos Network Activity Surges
The report highlighted that Aptos’ circulating market cap increased 127% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to $6.6 billion.
This growth outpaced other projects with similar market caps, improving market cap rank from 33 to 22. Despite this growth, APT’s price experienced a more modest increase of 76% QoQ. 
Aptos’ market cap increase was recorded during Q1. Source: Messari
Aptos revenue, which encompasses all fees collected by the protocol, grew by 37% to $475,000. However, when denominated in APT, the revenue decreased by 10%. All revenue generated by Aptos is burned, but these burned tokens have not significantly reduced inflation.

APT inflation started at a 7% annualized rate and is set to decrease by 1.5% each year until it reaches 3.5%. By mid-October, the inflation rate had reduced to just under 6.9%. Additionally, there was inflationary pressure from the genesis supply unlocks, with almost 31% of the genesis supply distributed by the end of Q1.
Looking at network activity, Aptos witnessed a significant increase in transactions and active addresses in Q1. Average daily transactions and addresses saw 66% and 97% QoQ growth rates, respectively. 
Despite the increased transaction activity, the average transaction fee decreased by 45% QoQ to 0.0006 APT ($0.007). Furthermore, average daily new addresses grew by 91% QoQ to 44,000, and the weighted average one-month retention rate increased by 82% QoQ to 14%.
APT Staked Tokens Decrease 5%
Regarding staking, APT staked decreased by 5% to 861 million tokens. However, when denominated in USD, the staked market cap grew by 68% QoQ, surpassing $14 billion.

As seen in the chart above, Aptos also experienced growth in its decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), which increased by 376% QoQ to $573 million. 
According to Messari, this increase was not solely due to APT price appreciation; TVL also grew by 170% QoQ in APT terms. Additionally, Aptos’s stablecoin market cap nearly doubled QoQ, reaching $97 million.
APT Struggles To Break $8.80 Resistance
Despite these positive developments, APT’s price performance has faced challenges. The native token has declined over 16% in the past month, resulting in a modest 2.7% surge year-to-date. This contrasts with the double or triple-digit gains seen by other top cryptocurrencies.

Keith Gill, Known as Roaring Kitty, Sparks Meme Stocks Rally


GameStop’s shares have seen a rally of more than 70%, reminiscent of a few years ago. This time, it was due to the return of trader and investor Keith Gill, better known as “Roaring Kitty.”
The stock market was set ablaze on Monday as Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” suddenly returned to social media, reigniting the meme stock frenzy that captivated the world in 2021. 
Speculation Mounts Around Meme Stocks
Gill’s post on X, depicting a video gamer intently leaning forward — a stance known to signal serious gameplay — was enough to send GameStop and AMC Entertainment’s stocks through the roof, with increases of 77.5% and 77.9%, respectively.
This dramatic market reaction marks the first time Gill has been publicly active since his last appearance roughly three years ago. The mysterious post quickly attracted over 12 million views, with Gill adding a cryptic video clip hours later, further fueling speculation and excitement among traders.


GameStop saw its shares momentarily peak at a staggering 110% increase before stabilizing. The trading frenzy was so intense that it triggered multiple daily trading halts. Similarly, AMC shares also saw a significant uptick, with prices doubling at one point during the trading session.
The resurgence of these stocks can be traced back to Gill’s influence in the early days of the pandemic. His advocacy for GameStop, a struggling video game retailer at the time, drew in a horde of retail investors who opposed hedge funds shorting the stock. 

This collective action forced massive buy-ins from short sellers, skyrocketing the stock’s price and causing significant disruptions in the market.

Gill’s recent activity has spurred buying in GameStop and AMC and spilled over to other meme stocks like BlackBerry and Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., which experienced their own respective rallies. Still, some industry analysts remain skeptical. 

“I don’t think they have the numbers to keep this up, nor do I think the shorts have the resolve shown by Gabe Plotkin three years ago, so likely this fizzles as the fundamentals continue to deteriorate,” Wedbush’s Michael Pachter said.

Edward Snowden warns that Bitcoin developers must prioritize privacy at the protocol level to protect users as the U.S. government intensifies its scrutiny of crypto mixers.
                        Two crypto-supportive senators have urged the Justice Department (DOJ) to reconsider its recent enforcement action against a popular Bitcoin privacy service.Protecting Bitcoin Privacy Tools
On Monday, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) publicly shared a letter arguing that the DOJ’s “unprecedented interpretation” of what constitutes an unlicensed “money services business” (MSB) contradicts both Treasury Department guidance and the intent of Congress.“This interpretation threatens to criminalize Americans offering non-custodial crypto asset software services,” read the letter, co-authored by Lummis and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR).Late last month, the DOJ arrested the founders of Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet for allegedly operating an unregistered MSB, allowing criminals to use their service for money laundering.Specifically, Samourai used CoinJoin transactions to enhance user privacy, which involves multiple parties combining the inputs and outputs of their transactions into one transaction, making the flow of funds difficult to trace on the blockchain.While Samourai’s wallet did require a centralized server to coordinate CoinJoin transactions, the service never involved taking control of users’ actual funds.That makes Samourai’s case a tricky legal topic, since the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) defines “money transmission” as “the acceptance of currency…and the transmission of currency…to another location or person by any means.”What Counts As Money Transmission?
The senators argued in their letter that such definitions were clear, and required so that other groups like internet service providers and postal code carriers weren’t caught up in the definition of an MSB. By the same logic, the definition would fail to capture that of crypto wallets where users maintain control of their private keys.“Subjecting developers of non-custodial crypto asset software to potential criminal liability… will only serve to stifle innovation and shake confidence in the DOJ’s respect for the rule of law,” the letter concluded.By contrast, the DOJ’s interpretation of the money-transmitting business statute posits that a money transmitter need not have actual control of the funds that it transfers. It likened money transmission to a USB cable transferring data between devices, or a frying pan transmitting heat from a stove the the pan’s contents.The DOJ has since issued a warning to crypto users that they could lose funds in wallets provided by non-regulated entities, which could face future prosecution by the department.

As 'Roaring Kitty' Returns, Here Are 3 ETFs To Leverage The 2024 Meme Stock Wave - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AMC Enter Hldgs (NYSE:AMC) - Benzinga

Meme stocks have once again captured the spotlight in the financial market following the return of Keith Gill — known widely as “Roaring Kitty”— to social media after a three-year hiatus. For those unfamiliar, Gill is a pivotal figure in the meme stock phenomenon that took the financial world by storm in early 2021. As an individual investor and financial analyst, he became famous for his role in the explosive rise of GameStop Inc. GME’s stock price.The struggling video game retailer saw its shares soar from under $20 to nearly $500 at their peak in January 2021, largely driven by a short squeeze on investors who had bet against the stock amid weak fundamentals. Unlike traditional stocks, which are influenced by fundamental analysis and corporate performance, meme stocks are often subject to rapid price changes driven by hype and mass trading actions.Gill chronicled his investment journey across various platforms, including YouTube and Reddit, notably under the username u/DeepF******Value on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets. His philosophy is emblematic of a broader narrative about meme stocks and the democratization of investing, illustrating how individual investors can unite to disrupt the financial status quo of seasoned and large investors.Gill’s resurgence on  X (formerly known as Twitter) on May 13, sparked a viral reaction. A posted image of a man intensely focused on a video game, adopting a serious gaming stance, served as a metaphor for Gill’s impactful return to the public eye.The post has attracted considerable attention, amassing over 10K retweets, 24K quote tweets, 94K likes, and over 19 million views, highlighting its widespread appeal and significance.As a result, GameStop’s share price soared by 74% on Monday, representing the fourth-largest one-day gain since the company’s IPO in 2002. This surge trails only behind the spikes of 104% on Feb. 21, 2021, 135% on Jan. 27, 2021, and 93% on Jan. 26, 2021.Similarly, other meme-related stocks experienced significant increases. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC saw its shares climb nearly 80%, marking its most substantial single-day rise since June 2021, the third strongest in its history.

Price analysis 5/13: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, TON, DOGE, ADA

Traders prefer a trending market rather than a range-bound one. Sometimes, when there is uncertainty about the next directional move, traders step to the sidelines, and that seems to be the case with Bitcoin (BTC). According to research firm Santiment, “fear and indecision” could be the factors that have led to a drop in Bitcoin’s on-chain activity toward historic lows. The firm clarified that it does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin will fall more.Bitcoin’s consolidation is giving opportunities to investors to load up on Bitcoin. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet said it had made a “strategic shift” in its treasury management strategy to follow a Bitcoin-only approach in response to a sustained decline in the Japanese yen. Metaplanet announced a purchase of 117.7 Bitcoin at an average price of $65,000.Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360Generally, a consolidation near a lifetime high is a positive sign as it shows that traders are holding onto their positions as they anticipate the uptrend to continue. However, even after repeated attempts, if the overhead resistance is not crossed, traders may dump their positions, starting a sharp pullback.Will bulls defend the essential support levels in Bitcoin and select altcoins?

If the 5,265 level is taken out, the index may travel toward 5,500.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will attempt to stall the up move at 5,265. If the price turns down from this level, the index may stay range-bound between 5,265 and 4,950 for a while.U.S. Dollar Index price analysisThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) broke below the 20-day EMA (105) on May 9, indicating aggressive selling by the bears on every minor rally.DXY daily chart.

If the price bounces off the 50-day SMA, the index may again attempt to rise above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the index could rally to 106.50.Alternatively, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bears are in charge. The index may slump to the support line, which is likely to attract strong buying from the bulls.Bitcoin price analysisThe bulls are struggling to sustain Bitcoin above the 20-day EMA ($62,671), indicating that the bears are maintaining the pressure.BTC/USDT daily chart.

If buyers maintain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($65,426). This level may act as a stiff resistance, but if the bulls surpass it, the pair may climb to $73,777.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, it will indicate that bears are active at higher levels. The pair may then slump to the critical support zone between $59,600 and $56,500.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) continues to trade inside the descending channel pattern, indicating that the bears are in control.ETH/USDT daily chart.

Big Week: US CPI, Ethereum ETF, SEC vs Ripple, and More News


This week is key for the crypto market, as several pieces of news will show the industry players’ direction. 
From inflation data to legislation would affect the crypto industry, and even updates on spot Ethereum ETFs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple.
Wednesday’s US Consumer Price Index
This week, the market will witness the release of the US Consumer Price Index data, which could be busy defining the direction of the crypto market. Analysts expect the underlying CPI to rise 0.3%, up from 0.4% in March. 

“Investors need to have some level of reassurance that inflation is not going to go back up, and potentially down, to give the Fed cover for at least one or maybe two cuts before the end of the year,” Thomas Hayes, president of Great Hill Capital LLC, said.

The SEC’s Position on Spot Ethereum ETFs
Forecasts that rule out the SEC’s upcoming approval of spot Ethereum ETFs are growing. The regulator recently delayed the review of Galaxy Invesco’s proposed Ethereum ETF for 60 days until July 5. Meanwhile, ARK Invest and 21Shares removed staking from their SEC filing due to a regulatory crackdown on crypto staking. 
Analysts already predict Ethereum will fall to $2,500 if the ETF is denied. However, if approved, ETH could surpass $4,000.

In the coming weeks, the SEC will file a decision on several Ethereum ETF proposals. These include BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark Invest and 21Shares, Fidelity, VanEck, Hashdex, Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy Digital, and Bitwise. 
Crypto Regulations in the US Congress
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry said the US Congress could vote on the “Financial Innovation and Technology Act of the 21st Century” (FIT21) before the end of May. FIT21 would impose jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies in investment contracts. 
Representatives believe the legislation would cement US leadership in the international financial system for decades. 


“With the floor vote announced today, Congress will take a historic step toward providing a clear regulatory framework for digital asset markets,” McHenry said.

SEC vs. Ripple Update Expected
Finally, one of the most emblematic legal cases in the crypto market, SEC v Ripple, is expected to make news headlines. The latest development around this is that both parties involved filed omnibus letter motions to seal proceedings.

These pieces of evidence represent one of the last steps before judges rule on the case. The goal is to conclude whether Ripple must pay a hefty fine for its XRP sales.

OpenAI’s latest upgrade essentially lets users livestream with ChatGPT

ChatGPT creator OpenAI has announced its latest AI model, GPT-4o, a chattier, more humanlike AI chatbot, which can interpret a user’s audio and video and respond in real time.A series of demos released by the firm shows GPT-4 Omni helping potential users with things like interview preparation — by making sure they look presentable for the interview — as well as calling a customer service agent to get a replacement iPhone.Other demos show it can share dad jokes, translate a bilingual conversation in real time, be the judge of a rock-paper-scissors match between two users, and respond with sarcasm when asked. One demo even shows how ChatGPT reacts to being introduced to the user’s puppy for the first time.  "Well hello, Bowser! Aren't you just the most adorable little thing?" the chatbot exclaimed.


“It feels like AI from the movies; and it’s still a bit surprising to me that it’s real,” said the firm’s CEO, Sam Altman, in a May 13 blog post.“Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”A text and image-only input version was launched on May 13, with the full version set to roll out in the coming weeks, OpenAI said in a recent X post. GPT-4o will be available to both paid and free ChatGPT users and will be accessible from ChatGPT’s API.OpenAI said the “o” in GPT-4o stands for “omni” — which seeks to mark a step toward more natural human-computer interactions. 


GPT-4o’s ability to process any input of text, audio and image at the same time is a considerable advancement compared with OpenAI’s earlier AI tools, such as ChatGPT-4, which often “loses a lot of information” when forced to multi-task.Related: Apple finalizing deal with OpenAI for ChatGPT iPhone integration: ReportOpenAI said “GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models,” which even includes picking up on a user’s emotions and breathing patterns.It is also “much faster” and “50% cheaper” than GPT-4 Turbo in OpenAI’s API.The new AI tool can respond to audio inputs in as little as 2.3 seconds, with an average time of 3.2 seconds, OpenAI claims, which it says is similar to human response times in an ordinary conversation.Magazine: ​​How to stop the artificial intelligence apocalypse: David Brin, Uplift author

Buy Or Sell Bitcoin? Quant Reveals What Leading Metric Says


																A quant has explained what a potential leading Bitcoin indicator could say about what’s next for the cryptocurrency’s price.
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium May Hold The Answer To Where BTC Goes Next
In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the trend currently taking place in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium. “We can use the trend of Coinbase Premium as a leading indicator of the future direction of BTC price,” notes the quant.
The “Coinbase Premium” is a metric that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).

	Related Reading



When the value of this indicator is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is higher than on Binance right now. Such a trend suggests the buying pressure is higher (or the selling pressure is lower) on the former platform than on the latter.
On the other hand, the negative premium implies Coinbase might be observing a higher amount of selling than Binance, as the asset is currently trading at a lower price there.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium over the last couple of years:

The 30-day MA value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant
As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has been positive recently, suggesting that Coinbase users have supported the asset through the rally.
Coinbase is popularly known as the preferred platform of the US-based institutional entities, while Binance has a more global user base. As such, the premium’s value can provide hints about how the behavior of the American whales differs from that of the rest of the world.
From the chart, it’s visible that the buying pressure from these institutional traders peaked alongside the price top but has since been declining. The metric continues to be positive overall, although it’s now quite close to the neutral zero mark.
In the graph, the quant has highlighted an interesting pattern that the cryptocurrency has followed regarding the Coinbase Premium during the last two years. It would appear that whenever the indicator has hit bottom in negative territory and reversed back to an uptrend, the coin’s price has observed a rebound.

	Related Reading



An example of this trend also played out just earlier in the year, when a reversal in the indicator led to Bitcoin observing a rally in which the asset would eventually break its all-time high.
The Coinbase Premium is currently riding a downtrend, but it’s yet to dip into negative territory. The analyst explains that BTC is in a “wait and see” phase, where a rebound might be a bit longer out. The metric has to first decline more and reach a reversal point, at least if the historical pattern has to repeat.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had slipped under $61,000 earlier, but the asset has found a slight rebound in the past day, returning above $62,700.

Crypto Fear and Greed Index signals greed: Bitcoin, altcoins to rally? - AMBCrypto



The crypto Fear and Greed Index indicated that the market could get greedy, going forward.
Ethereum and Solana could gain from the rise in greed as well.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] price hasn’t budged significantly over the past few days, suggesting a neutral market sentiment.
However, despite the inactivity of BTC’s price, the crypto Fear and Greed Index told a different story.
Holders get greedy
The Fear and Greed Index gave a reading of 57 at the time of writing, which suggested that most of the market was willing to buy BTC and was mostly bullish.
This could mean that BTC’s price may surge significantly going forward and may even reach the $65,000 level.
The long positions taken in favor of BTC had also grown materially from 48% to 51.23% over the past few days as well, according to Coinglass’ data.
Source: coinglass
At press time, BTC was trading at $62,581.09 and its price had grown by 2.21% in the last 24 hours.
Despite the recent uptick in price, the MVRV ratio for BTC had declined significantly, implying that most holders were still unprofitable and there wasn’t much selling pressure on the king coin.
Source: Santiment
However, it won’t just be BTC that will be affected by the rising greed in the markets. As BTC is highly correlated with other altcoins in the industry, they are expected to see growth as well.
Across the board
For instance, Ethereum witnessed an uptick of 1.27% as well in the last 24 hours.
AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that the velocity of ETH had also grown significantly, implying that the frequency of transactions occurring on the Ethereum network had surged materially.
This could mean a positive turn of events could unfold for ETH holders in the future.
Even though the price of ETH was growing, it was observed that the network growth for ETH had declined. This indicated that new addresses were losing interest in ETH as a token.
The falling network growth of ETH can hinder the ability of ETH’s price to climb in the future.

Other altcoins such as SOL could also benefit from a greedy market. At press time, SOL was trading at $145.66 and its price had grown by 0.44% in the last 24 hours.
Coupled with that, the social volume for SOL had also surged, indicating a rise in popularity for the SOL token.

Trader Says Two Ethereum Rivals Could Outperform Crypto Market, Predicts Rally for Low-Cap Altcoin - The Daily Hodl


								A popular crypto strategist is naming two Ethereum (ETH) challengers that he thinks will rise faster than the rest of the market once conditions improve.
Pseudonymous analyst The Crypto Dog tells his 776,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s long-term bullish on Near (NEAR).










According to the trader, NEAR has been one of the faster horses this cycle and he believes it will burst right out of the gate once the crypto market catches a bid.
“Still believe taking a multi-month NEAR position today is a good move. Lock it in and don’t trade it.
NEAR keeps showing relative strength along with coins [latching] AI (artificial intelligence) trend. When the market turns, it will outperform.”
At time of writing, NEAR is worth $6.95.
Next up, the analyst is also keeping a close watch on fellow layer-1 altcoin AIOZ (AIOZ). The Crypto Dog says he’s also willing to hold AIOZ over a multi-month period.
“Been ranging for the last couple of months, should pick up again and outperform when the market swings back. I’m trading lees, taking bigger, longer-time positions.”
At time of writing, AIOZ is trading at $0.778, down nearly 4% in the past day.
The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the gaming-focused crypto project Xai (XAI). According to the analyst, XAI could skyrocket by nearly 60% from current levels in the coming weeks.
“I’d think XAI can send back to $1 by June, seems like a good price at the moment. (I am a heavy bagholder).”

At time of writing, XAI is worth $0.635.

China Takes Down $295M Crypto Underground Bank: Beginning Of A Bigger Crackdown?


								Chinese law enforcement has disrupted a covert banking network that leveraged cryptocurrencies to execute unauthorized foreign exchange transactions totaling around 2.14 billion yuan ($295.8 million).
This illicit operation mainly converted the Chinese yuan into the South Korean won, evading the established legal frameworks for currency exchange.

Uncovering The Shadow Crypto Banking Network 
In Jilin province, police apprehended six people connected to this operation, underscoring the growing role of digital currencies in bypassing standard financial regulations.
According to official statements, this clandestine banking entity utilized cryptocurrencies’ inherent “anonymity and decentralization” to carry out these unlawful transactions.
It was reported that the accused managed domestic bank accounts to receive and channel funds and conduct over-the-counter cryptocurrency trades.
These activities primarily served several business types, including South Korean purchasing agents, cross-border e-commerce entities, and firms engaged in import-export trade. This setup enabled the illegal exchange of currencies between the yuan and the won, violating regulatory norms.
Notably, the busting of this underground bank is part of a broader crackdown by Chinese authorities on crypto-related activities. Despite banning cryptocurrencies and related operations like Bitcoin mining, China remains active in policing the sector.
This action follows the recent investigation of Yao Qian, a former pro-blockchain official, under suspicions of “serious violations of discipline and law.” However, details of the allegations against Qian remain unclear, with authorities only citing vague violations. The report noted:
Yao Qian, Director of the Science and Technology Supervision Department and Director of the Information Center of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently under investigation by the Central Committee.
Challenges Facing China’s Digital Currency Initiatives
While China combats illegal crypto operations, it faces challenges in promoting its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY, or digital yuan.
Despite government efforts to pilot the e-CNY in various cities and reports of billions in transactions, public reception remains tepid.
For instance, state employees in some regions are paid partly in digital yuan. Due to the lack of incentives and limited merchant adoption, they frequently convert their holdings back to cash.
The digital yuan struggles to compete with well-established digital payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay, which dominate online and offline transactions.

Sammy Lin, an account manager at a Chinese state bank, noted the absence of benefits in holding the digital yuan, stating, “There’s no interest if I leave it there, and there aren’t many places where I can use it.”
This sentiment reflects broader concerns about the e-CNY’s practicality and the need for more compelling use cases to ensure widespread adoption.

King Mark Cuban (KINGCUBA) to Surge 16,000% Ahead of ByBit Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and King Mark Cuban (KINGCUBA) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



King Mark Cuban (KINGCUBA), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 16,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KINGCUBA will be listed on ByBit, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy King Mark Cuban.



Currently, King Mark Cuban can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KINGCUBA on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for King Mark Cuban by entering its contract address – B8V4DqTWPUjY3TkPtUp14MUvcdNToT65JDpMtUDGL8Vz – in the receiving field.




KINGCUBA currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Here Are The Bitcoin Layer 2s To Watch Out For, According To Grayscale


																Crypto asset management giant Grayscale says there’s a “renaissance” in Bitcoin development, with several new Layer 2s (L2s) worthy of keeping an eye on.
In a new investor report, Grayscale analyst Michael Zhao argued how these technologies may both bring new use cases to Bitcoin and foster more market demand for BTC.
Rollups On Bitcoin
Zhao first named Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BitVM) among Bitcoin’s “most anticipated” next generation of applications.
Published by Robin Linus in October, BitVM is a new computing model for verifying computations on Bitcoin, opening the network to smart contract functionality more familiar to Ethereum.
One of the leading applications of BitVM in development is optimistic Bitcoin rollups, letting users batch fast, cheap transactions together in off-chain environments before settling them back to Bitcoin in one piece.




“While still in its early stages, projects like Build on Bitcoin aim to incorporate BitVM for future settlement,” the report stated. Late last month, developers at BitcoinOS published a whitepaper explaining a practical Bitcoin rollup system that would let users bridge BTC back and forth between rollups in a decentralized manner.
Another technology highlighted by Grayscale was Spiderchains, developed by Botanix Labs. Spiderchains are layer 2 chains secured by staked Bitcoin (BTC) within decentralized multi-signature wallets.
Users’ pegged Bitcoin assets are secured by a rotating subset of 100 ”orchestrators” that manage the layer 2 chain, which can feature any functionality seen on other blockchains, like Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Staking With Babylon
Babylon is also expanding the Bitcoin “staking” world through its BTC re-staking technology. This would allow BTC holders to stake their coins and earn yield on them by using them to secure other blockchain networks, like Solana or Ethereum, if the latter networks were upgraded to allow for it.
Finally, projects like Taproot Assets seek to bring tokenization – specifically stablecoins – to one of Bitcoin’s most popular current L2s: the lightning network.
“With numerous projects vying for attention and liquidity simultaneously, the Pareto principle suggests that only a select few will emerge as successful projects in the coming years, similar to patterns observed on other smart contract platforms,” Grayscale wrote.
Given Bitcoin’s underdeveloped smart contract ecosystem, Grayscale believes it could be a massive untapped market. For example, while roughly 17% of Ethereum’s total market cap ($360 billion) is currently used in applications, the value locked in Bitcoin dapps is still just 0.2% of its total market cap ($1.2 trillion).
“If the latest wave of development results in more adoption for these use cases, it would imply a larger addressable market and potentially a higher market value over time,” Grayscale concluded.

Pepe hits all-time high, memecoins soar after famous GameStop stock trader ‘returns’

Pepe (PEPE) price topped the $0.000010 level for the first time since March 15.

On the night of May 12, the account posted an image of a man holding a controller and moving to sit forward in his chair as if to focus.

The latest rally has seen PEPE rise above a critical resistance level, which has underpinned the price since March.

Who Is Roaring Kitty, and What Does His Return Mean for Crypto? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFinancial analyst turned stock and meme influencer Roaring Kitty has roared back onto social media. His return to Twitter on Sunday didn’t even directly mention GameStop—the stock whose rollercoaster ride sparked global headlines and a documentary film—but nonetheless prompted the price of GME to double briefly and preceded a 1,900% surge in a Solana-based tribute coin also named GME.What’s the connection between Roaring Kitty—whose real name is Keith Gill—the failed video game retailer, and meme coins?Gill is no fringe character. He was the subject of the 2023 film “Dumb Money,” which told the story of the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, after his stock analysis and campaign to promote GameStop stock largely started the fire that engulfed Wall Street in 2021—and led him to testify on Capitol Hill.He announced his return with a single tweet on Sunday with an image of a man sitting up in his seat, holding a video game controller with a look of keen interest on his face.It was his first tweet in over 150 weeks. And it was enough to fuel another maelstrom in both crypto and traditional investing circles.Who is Roaring Kitty?Before he took the financial sector by storm as Roaring Kitty (or DeepFuckingValue on Reddit), Gill dreamed of being a track and field star and even appeared in an edition of Sports Illustrated, according to the Wall Street Journal. Gill’s first foray into creating content on YouTube was posting a 4:33 mile run, where he lost a bet to beat 4:30.While his dreams of racing stardom failed to pan out after an injury, Gill shifted his focus to the stock market. In 2019, Gill became a director of financial wellness at life insurance company MassMutual. That same year, he joined Reddit and began posting on the WallStreetsBets subreddit.Gill gained widespread fame for his role in the GameStop short squeeze that occurred on January 27, 2021. Under his "DeepFuckingValue" account on Reddit, he earned a following for his investment in GameStop’s stock, his advocacy for the asset on social media, and his Roaring Kitty YouTube channel.“FYI these positions are up in March,” Gill wrote in a Reddit post in 2020. “GME has been crushing the market on a relative basis.”The stage was set.GameStopAt the time, the gaming retailer had been struggling financially, and many institutional investors and hedge funds believed its GME stock was overvalued, taking short positions on the GameStop stock. Short positions are an investment move where investors borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference.At the time, a share of GME stock was worth about $5.16. Before the GameStop surge started, its share price was way down from its prior all-time high.Users on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, including Gill, noticed the rising number of short positions being placed on GME, sensing an opportunity to trigger a short squeeze. A “short squeeze” is when the price of an asset rises sharply, prompting traders who had bet on its price falling or “shorting” to liquidate or sell their positions.While not single-handedly behind the GameStop short squeeze, Gill was a prominent figure in the conversation, having previously gone against the grain and deeming GameStop undervalued.“People talk up the demise of GameStop, yet here they are about to generate over $2 billion in [revenue] in a single quarter at the tail end of a console cycle,” Gill, writing as DeepFuckingValue, wrote on Reddit. “The ‘shift to digital’ thesis is way overblown. This business model has legs, and the new consoles will be a major tailwind.”As the price of GME rose, several firms that had bet against GameStop were forced to close their positions, including Melvin Capital, which lost nearly $3 billion for its GameStop shorting. SkyBridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci compared the GameStop short squeeze to the French Revolution.On January 28, the day after the GameStop short squeeze took place, Robinhood—the platform of choice for the legion of retail investors—was hit with two lawsuits after the trading platform blocked customers from purchasing more GameStop stock during its historic one-day run.At the time Robinhood blocked the purchase of GameStop, the stock had already reached $492—but soon fell to $193.The AftermathOn February 18, 2021, Gill was called to testify before the U.S. Congress House Committee on Financial Services. Joining him at the hearing were the CEOs of Robinhood and multinational hedge fund Citadel.“It is true that my investment in that company multiplied in value many times. For that, I feel enormously fortunate.” Gill said during the virtual hearing. “I also believe the current price of the shares demonstrates that I've been right about the company.”Dispelling any notion that he was a cat, Gill also told the members of Congress that he is also not an institutional investor or a hedge fund.“I do not have clients, and I do not provide personalized investment advice for fees or commissions,” he said. “I'm just an individual whose investment in GameStop, and posts on social media are based upon my own research and analysis.”Gill called the idea that he could use social media to promote GameStop stock and influence the market preposterous.“My post did not cause the movement of billions of dollars into Gamestop shares,” Gill said. “It is tragic that some people lost money and my heart goes out to them. But what happened in January just demonstrates again that investing in public securities is extremely risky.”Gill’s last Reddit post is dated April 16, 2021. He quietly left social media on June 18, 2021, after posting a video of sleeping cats on Twitter.It would be another 151 weeks before Roaring Kitty returned.After the frenzy around the GameStop short squeeze fizzled out, the stock's price returned to earth. Currently, it is trading at $36.90.GameStop did try to capitalize on the renewed interest in its business, even going so far as to make a push into cryptocurrency and NFTs. But the company’s crypto aspirations were short-lived as the firm shut down its NFT wallet in August 2023 citing regulatory uncertainty, and its NFT marketplace in January of this year.The GameStop short squeeze and Roaring Kitty’s part in the chaos were the focus of both a documentary and a feature film. In September 2022, Netflix launched the streaming mini-series “Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga,” which was followed in 2023 by the feature-length film “Dumb Money” starring Paul Dano as Roaring Kitty and Pete Davidson as Gill’s brother Kevin.The ReturnNews of Roaring Kitty’s return inspired social media influencers like Andrew Tate dumping Bitcoin to invest their money in GameStop stock and meme coins. For his part, Tate said he would sell $500,000 in Bitcoin to invest in the latest GameStop short squeeze.“I’m taking Wall Street down, watch me,” Tate said. "Fuck ‘em. Fuck ‘em all.”“Hey bro, what we buying?” Crypto Influencer Ansem asked in response to a Roaring Kitty tweet.Even Barstool Sports founder David Portnoy was also ready to jump in.“You wanna get nuts [Roaring Kitty] let's get nuts!” Portnoy wrote on Twitter. “Every time I think I'm out they pull me back in!” he said, quoting a line from the Godfather Part III.It's unclear why Gill chose Sunday to return to Twitter—his Reddit and YouTube account are still fallow as of this writing—and whether he will resume tweeting after posting a dozen times until 8 p.m. ET on Monday. He did not respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.But his reemergence has stirred the meme coin market, which rose 5.4% for the day, with several meme coins, including Dogecoin, Shibu Inu, and Pepe, up 5.7%, 5.0%, and 15.4%, respectively.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Binance Receives Approval to Operate in India, Joins KuCoin as Second Offshore Crypto Exchange Cleared by FIU



                    

Binance, the global cryptocurrency exchange, has recently received approval from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in India, allowing it to offer services in the country. 



This development positions Binance as the second offshore crypto exchange to receive such regulatory approval, following KuCoin.




In a CoinDesk report, FIU head Vivek Agarwal stated, “Binance is now a registered entity.” 



The approval comes after Binance, along with KuCoin and other major exchanges like Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex, were issued non-compliance notices by Indian authorities in December 2023. 



The Indian Finance Ministry had subsequently directed its IT department to block access to these platforms in mid-January 2024.




These regulatory challenges prompted several exchanges to seek compliance with FIU requirements to continue operating in India.



While KuCoin and Binance successfully navigated the regulatory landscape to reinstate their services, others such as OKX and BitStamp opted to cease operations within the country.

In response to India’s stringent tax laws on cryptocurrency—comprising a 30% tax on gains and a 1% tax deduction at source on each transaction—many Indian investors turned to foreign exchanges like Binance. At its height, Binance handled 90% of crypto trading volume from India. 




The Indian market’s heavy tax burden led to a significant migration of crypto traders and businesses to more favorable regulatory environments abroad. 



Consequently, the remaining crypto exchanges in India faced difficulties in building trust with investors, further hampered by the absence of robust banking solutions.



Despite these challenges, India remains a key market for major cryptocurrency exchanges. 



However, the regulatory uncertainty and stringent tax measures have cooled its appeal on the global crypto stage. 



As of the latest updates, Cointelegraph has reached out to both Binance and FIU for comments but has not received any response yet.

Tether CEO Responds To Brad Garlinghouse’s Comments


								In a recent podcast interview, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that Tether, the largest Stablecoin issuer by market share, is next on the US government’s target list. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, refuted Garlinghouse’s comments and accused him of spreading fear.

Is Tether Next In Line?
Ripple’s CEO joined Quantum’s founder, Chris Vasquez, for his World Class podcast on May 10. During the interview, he discussed his outlook for the future of crypto and his thoughts on the US government’s crackdown on the industry.


Regarding unforeseen circumstances, Garlinghouse believes the crypto market has shown remarkable resilience despite the adversities. The CEO used the downfall of FTX and the immense regulatory scrutiny that Binance has faced over the last couple of years to back his point.
Two years ago, FTX and Binance were two of the most influential companies in the industry. Similarly, their founders and CEOs, Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, were some of the most important players in crypto, as Garlinghouse highlighted.
Since then, SBF has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, while CZ has stepped down as Binance’s CEO and was recently sentenced to a four-month incarceration. To Ripple’s CEO, these events would have been impossible to predict, adding that black swans are “hard to know” as unpredictability is part of the event’s nature.
Despite this, he considers what the community and industry have endured over the years shows a positive side, as the “freaking resilience of this industry and market (…) should give us immense optimism about what’s coming.”
Garlinghouse believes there will be another Black Swan.  He also stated that it would be “an interesting one to watch,” despite not being sure what it could be.
To him, it’s clear that the “US government is going after Tether.” Ultimately, he added that a crackdown on the company could have a big impact due to its “important part of the crypto ecosystem.”
Tether’s CEO Responds
On Monday, Paolo Ardoino took X to respond to the comments. The CEO called Garlinghouse “an uninformed CEO,” and suggested that he was spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) about USDT.
Ardoino seemingly took the comments as an attack from someone “leading a company being investigated by the SEC, launching a competitive stablecoin.”  As a result, he decided to update the community on the safety of Tether’s ecosystem.


The CEO highlighted USDT’s status as “the most used stablecoin in the world, with hundreds of millions of users across primarily emerging markets and developing countries.”  Moreover, he added that most mainstream media reporters refuse to report data regarding Tether’s global compliance work.
Ardoino’s post listed various factors that affect Tether’s compliance. These included Tether’s collaboration with 124 law enforcement agencies across 40+ countries, its respect for the OFAC / SDN lists, and its blockage of over $1.3 billion related to scams, hacks, money laundering, and terrorist financing.
To the CEO, the refusal to share Tether’s statistics sets a “sensationalistic” narrative against the usage of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies worldwide, likely to protect the old guard of the financial establishment.
Garlinghouse responded to the post, clarifying his intentions behind the comments. He explained that he wasn’t attacking the stablecoin issuer. Instead, he pointed out that the US government had “clearly indicated they want more control over USD-backed stablecoin issuers.”
Thus, Tether’s status as the largest player in the sector made it “first in line” for a regulatory crackdown.

Dogecoin Investors Shift to New GambleFi ICO, Chasing Potential 895% Returns / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Dogecoin bulls were in charge on Monday amid a surge in meme coin risk-taking in wake of Roaring Kitty’s return to social media, but investors are nonetheless shifting funds to a new GambleFi ICO called Mega Dice as they hunt for 10x or 895% gains.Dogecoin gained 5% on Monday and was last trading just under $0.15, 10% up from earlier session lows.Legendary GameStop investor Roaring Kitty, who was a key leader of the meme stock movement of 2021, triggered a spike in meme coin and meme stock sentiment when he made his first post on X since 2021.His return triggered a chorus of calls that a new meme coin season might now be here.But the Dogecoin chart gives little reason for that kind of optimism right now.The Dogecoin price remains stuck near its 21DMA and substantially down versus its 50DMA.And the price is arguably also in the process of forming a bearish descending triangle from its late-March highs.A break below $0.12 support would open the door to a quick drop back towards $0.10.With Dogecoin potentially headed back under $0.10 soon, investors are turning to new GambleFi ICO Mega Dice as they hunt upside. Source: TradingViewCan Dogecoin Reach $1?
However, given it remains the undisputed king of meme coins, Dogecoin is a strong bet this bull market.Dogecoin could feasibly 6.5x from current levels to hit $1, fulfilling a long-term prophecy of many of its community members.At $1, Dogecoin’s market cap would be over $140 billion.That’s a lot for a token that doesn’t have much utility beyond as a collector’s item and independent blockchain.Few would expect Dogecoin to 10x or more. Investors looking to turn bigger profits, of 20-50x for example, should check out an often overlooked investment strategy – presale investing.Web3 projects frequently sell their tokens at a big discount to early investors as they raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good projects that end up gaining decent traction in the market, they can book huge profits.One presale project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is new GambleFi ICO Mega Dice Casino.
Dogecoin Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Mega Dice is an already well-established crypto casino that recently launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.With over 10,000 active monthly players and over $50 million wagered monthly, Mega Dice’s big user base ensures demand for DICE will be strong.That’s evident in the huge success of the project’s presale, which is closing in on raising $1 million.Investors need to move quickly, as when the $1 million mark is hit, the DICE price will rise from $0.069.At $0.069 per token, DICE is valued at a very modest $29 million market cap. That’s very low considering the amount of real-world adoption Mega Dice’s platform is already garnering.With Mega Dice already a market leader in GambleFi, its coin could one day be worth over billions of dollars. This could easily be a 50-100x coin.In terms of what DICE holders can expect to get – big cashback benefits on their wagers and an impressive passive income via staking.The new GambleFi ICO is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors. Mega Dice is also running a referral scheme.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presalehttps://twitter.com/megadice/status/1787530056979341365

Historical cycle data suggests Bitcoin has left the ‘danger zone’ - Analyst

Bitcoin (BTC) may have escaped the post-halving “danger zone” — and is now headed for reaccumulation, according to a crypto analyst citing historical data. On May 13, crypto market analyst “Rekt Capital” posted an update to his Bitcoin market cycle chart on X declaring that the “danger zone” when the asset corrects after the halving event is now over. Bitcoin is celebrating with a “good bounce from the re-accumulation range low support,” he added. The periods of pre and post-halving “danger zones” have occurred in previous market cycles when the asset retreats on either side of a halving event.In this cycle, BTC fell 23% from its peak price in mid-March to $56,800 on May 1 marking the potential bottom of the post-halving danger zone period. The analyst added that if $56,000 was not the bottom, “then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days.” However, history suggests that this current pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days, he opined. Source: Rekt CapitalBTC has now recovered to trade back above $63,000 at the time of writing, supporting the return to the re-accumulation zone analysis. However, historical cycle movements aren’t always indicative of future ones, and further pullbacks during the period of sideways chop that often follows the halving could still be on the cards. The analyst, however, was confident that current support levels would hold. “Bitcoin is showing early-stage signs of slowing down in its sell-side momentum, slowly developing a curl against the ~$60,000 support,” This level needs to hold as it has been doing so far for it to eventually lift up again which could result in a move back to $68,000, he added. Related: Bitcoin ‘as strong as ever’ with record high 200-day moving averageMeanwhile, in a May 13 post to X, Global Macro Investor founder Raoul Pal said “Macro Summer and Fall are driven by the global liquidity cycle,” with crypto performing particularly well in what he termed a “banana zone” in the latter half of the year when prices of these high risk assets surge. Source: Raoul PalEarlier this month, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes concurred that a period of sideways trading and accumulation is likely to occur before markets start moving again later this year.He also cited an injection of liquidity from Federal Reserve monetary policy which could make its way into riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Is The Crypto Winter Thawing? US Bitcoin ETFs Record First Inflows In Weeks - Coinshares


																After experiencing outflows for four consecutive weeks, US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have marked a notable shift in momentum, witnessing net inflows once again.
According to recent data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products have seen inflows totaling $130 million for the first time in five weeks.
This change suggests renewed investor interest in crypto-focused investment products, particularly in the United States, where most of these inflows, totaling over $130 million, occurred.

A Mixed Bag Of Global Investment Flows
Grayscale, a major player in the digital asset space, reported a significant decrease in weekly outflows, recording its lowest since January at $171 million. This trend indicates a potential stabilization in the market after a period of volatility and declining interest.
Meanwhile, interaction between US regulators and spot ETF issuers has remained minimal, particularly for spot Ethereum ETF applications.
This lack of engagement has fuelled speculation that approval for these ETFs might not be approaching, as reflected by the amount of outflows from Ethereum-based products. James Butterfill, Head of Research at Coinshares, particularly noted:
Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent, this has been reflected in outflows which totalled US$14m last week.
On a global scale, the investment landscape showed mixed signals. After a week of record inflows likely driven by “seed capital” post-Bitcoin ETF launches, as highlighted by Butterfill, Hong Kong saw a significant drop to $19 million in inflows.
Conversely, Switzerland experienced inflows amounting to $14 million. Canada and Germany continued to see outflows, with their year-to-date figures reaching a combined $660 million, indicating sustained bearish sentiment in these markets.
Bitcoin has rebounded with $144 million in inflows, counteracting a generally “weak month.” In contrast, short-Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded outflows totaling $5.1 million, up to $18 million over the last eight weeks.
These figures highlight the volatile dynamics within the crypto market, with Bitcoin currently showing stronger performance than Ethereum.
Bitcoin And Ethereum Market Performance
Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin surged nearly 3%, while Ethereum increased by only 1.2%. Despite these gains, both assets are down by 2.3% and 6% over the past week.

Amidst these market movements, crypto analyst Ali provided insights into Bitcoin’s potential paths. According to Ali, Bitcoin could climb to $76,000 if it reclaims $64,290 as a support level.

                        South Koreans who received airdrop tokens and prizes from the Bithumb crypto exchange from 2018 to 2021 could face unexpected tax bills.Per Hanguk Kyunjae, Bithumb said on May 10 that it would foot the bill for customers who have been ordered to pay taxes on the giveaways.However, the exchange wants to challenge the National Tax Service (NTS)’s decision to retrospectively tax its customers.Bithumb Airdrop Events Hit Hitch?
Bithumb customers have been told to pay a combined total of around $30 million in taxes as a result of winning airdrop prizes and taking part in cashback-type promotions.The NTS thinks that Bithumb gave away almost $61 million worth of assets to South Korean residents in the period 2018-2021.The tax bills have come as a shock to many, particularly as South Korea does not currently tax crypto-related profits.However, the NTS does require the winners of “lotteries and similar events” to declare and pay taxes on their winnings.The NTS classifies these as a form of “other income.” For prizes exceeding around $37, residents must pay 22% of their winnings.Bithumb says that 10,700 of its users were told to pay a total of $15 million in taxes last year alone. This is the first time the NTS has taxed South Korean airdrop recipients.Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko)Free Gifts or Prizes? Exchange to Dispute NTS Decision
Bithumb said that it would “immediately” compensate its customers for anything they had to pay the NTS as a result of receiving its airdrops.However, the exchange announced that it was “filing a tax appeal” against the national tax body.Bithumb argued that “virtual assets and commission cashback distributed via events are a type of free gift or sales benefit.” As such, the exchange said, these are “exempt from taxation.”The media outlet quoted South Korean tax experts as stating that the appeal’s success would hinge on “the nature of the event giveaways.”While the NTS appears to view the tokens as “a prize,” Bithumb insists these are “free gifts.”Legal Process ‘Could Take Years to Resolve’
The exchange may argue, experts noted, that it is following the example of securities providers, who often give out stocks to new account holders.In more conventional cases, shopping outlets that give high-spending customers gift certificates also avoid legal issues. In neither case do recipients pay taxes, experts added.Again, this is because the NTS does not see such handouts as competition “prizes,” but as “free gifts.”The media outlet warned that appeals to the NTS are often time-consuming, concluding that “it may take up to several years for a ruling to emerge.”Bithumb is currently aiming to become the first South Korean crypto exchange to float on the nation’s stock exchange.

Stablecoin Exchange Inflows See Major Drop: Bad For Bitcoin?


								On-chain data shows that stablecoin exchange inflows have seen a sharp drop recently. This could be bearish for the Bitcoin price.
Ethereum-Based Stablecoins Have Seen Low Exchange Deposits Recently
As CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr. pointed out in a post on X, the exchange inflows of Ethereum-based stablecoins have recently dropped below the 90-day average.
The “exchange inflow” here refers to an on-chain indicator that tracks the total amount of any given cryptocurrency being transferred to the wallets associated with centralized exchanges.

When the value of this metric is high, investors are now depositing large amounts of the asset into these platforms. Generally, holders send their coins to the exchanges for trading purposes, so this trend can show high demand for exchanging away the cryptocurrency.
Exchange inflows’ implications for the wider market, though, depend on the type of asset in question. For volatile assets like Bitcoin, inflows may have a direct bearish effect on their prices, as they imply selling is happening.
BTC, in particular, is a major doorway for capital to move in and out of the digital asset sector, so selling it can have cascading effects on the prices of the altcoins.
Selling stablecoins doesn’t affect their prices as they are, by nature, “stable” in value at the $1 mark. Exchange inflows of them are still consequential for the market, however, as they suggest the stable holders are looking to make a swap.
If investors are making the inflows to withdraw into fiat, then the market as a whole would see a bearish effect as it implies a net amount of capital is exiting the sector.
In the scenario that the deposits are being made to purchase Bitcoin and other volatile coins with them, the prices of these assets would register a bullish effect.
The latter may be more likely anytime large stablecoin exchange inflows take place as, generally, investors interested in the sector store their capital in the safety of these fiat-tied tokens, waiting for the right opportunity to buy into the volatile side.
Now, here is a chart that shows what the trend in the exchange inflow has looked like for the Ethereum-based stablecoins as a whole:

The value of the metric appears to have been sharply going down in recent days | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day moving average (MA) of the stablecoins exchange inflow has recently sharply declined and fallen below the 90-day MA.

This suggests that stablecoin users have significantly less demand for buying into Bitcoin and others now than during the rally that led to BTC’s new all-time high. “The drop in volume below the quarterly figure is a negative signal,” notes the analyst.
BTC Price
Bitcoin has been attempting another recovery push during the past day, and its price has now returned above the $63,000 mark.

Ethereum: What does ETH's future hold as investors continue to leave? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s price fell by nearly 10% in a week.
Technical analysis suggested a possible short-term recovery, with key metrics indicating reduced investor interest.

Ethereum’s [ETH] price has seen a significant downturn, with a nearly 10% drop in the past week and 1% decline in the past day, bringing it to a 24-hour low of $2,868. 
This decline is more pronounced compared to Bitcoin [BTC], which has managed to breach notable price marks despite the current market conditions. 
The downturn in Ethereum’s market performance is attributed to several factors, including massive whale activities that have introduced substantial volatility and selling pressure into the market.
Indicators of declining investor interest in Ethereum
Further compounding Ethereum’s market woes are the declining metrics of network activity. 
According to AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data, Ethereum’s active addresses have decreased from a peak of 564,868 in late April to 468,548 as of press time.

This decline in active addresses is paralleled by a drop in the number of new addresses—from 196,629 earlier in the month to below 85,000 on the 11th of May. 
These metrics highlight a waning investor interest in Ethereum during this period.

From a technical analysis perspective, Ethereum has broken significant support structures on the daily chart, indicating bearish pressure. 
The 4-hour chart revealed that, at press time, there was liquidity near the $3,200 region that needed to be taken before any major downward continuation. 
This suggested that Ethereum could experience a short-term rise above the $3,000 mark before potentially dropping to around the $2,800 level, setting the stage for a potential rally thereafter.

Notably, the deposit of Ethereum into the exchange coincides with the reactivation of two Bitcoin wallets that had been dormant for nearly 11 years. 
Each of these wallets, holding 500 BTC, liquidated their entire holdings, which was yet another spot of bad news for investors.

Black Donald Trump Surges 600% Before Consolidating, As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP), a Solana memecoin that was launched yesterday, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Black Donald Trump presents a similar opportunity.



BLATRUMP rallied over 600% in the first few hours after its launch, before consolidating as some early buyers cashed out their profits.



However, most investors are still holding their tokens, as they are waiting for BLATRUMP to be listed on ByBit later this week, as this listing will cause the coin’s price to skyrocket.




Its current price presents a great opportunity for new investors to buy the dip before the next rally. 



BLATRUMP has a market cap below $30,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of around $500,000-$1,000,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-3,000% in a matter of days or hours. 



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally another 12,000% in the coming two days, and Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, BLATRUMP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for BLATRUMP by entering its contract address – 29BiHVTBEo7RnbtwqwTmV3Hy6nDTadcCgopM6HUyjGRK –  in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BLATRUMP.

Polygon (MATIC) Labs Head of DeFi Jumps Ship, Joins Berachain - DailyCoin


        

Last week, Polygon (MATIC) Labs Head of DeFi Jack Melnick disclosed that he was leaving the firm.



Melnick has now disclosed a new role at the Cosmos-based Berachain.



Despite the move, Melnick has asserted that he maintains a positive outlook on Polygon.




Another Polygon (MATIC), Labs executive has jumped ship. 



In recent months, the project has weathered an onslaught of key executive exits to competing projects, from its president in November 2023 to its head of business development in January 2024. Now, the firm’s former head of DeFi, Jack Melnick, has followed suit after announcing that he was leaving last week.



Melnick Announces New Role



In an X post on Monday, May 13, Melnick disclosed that he was starting his first day as head of DeFi at Berachain: a Cosmos-based EVM compatible project that tries to address liquidity concerns that can arise from the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model through a novel consensus model dubbed Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL). 




Explaining the rationale behind his decision, Melnick suggested that the move to Berachain was a long time coming.



“I’ve been in the trenches of the Berachain community for almost three years, and as [Berachain co-founder] @SmokeyTheBera used to say: ‘it’s when, not if’ I came on full time.



Grateful to have found the ulitmate [sic] culture & work fit – getting to do the job I love, with friends I’ve built alongside and respected for years,” he enthused.




Melnick first announced that he was stepping down from his role at Polygon (MATIC) Labs on Thursday, May 9, stating that he remained “excited about the things getting built on Polygon.”

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Struggles with Investor Outflows Despite May Influx



                    

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), experienced a brief resurgence in investment inflows in early May, following a substantial period of financial hemorrhaging since its inception. 



Despite this, the fund quickly reverted to outflows within just a few days, reflecting its ongoing struggles in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.




GBTC debuted on January 11 and suffered consistent outflows for 78 consecutive days, resulting in a total loss of over $17.5 billion. 



A temporary reversal occurred in early May, with inflows recorded on May 3 and May 6, totaling $63 million and $3.9 million respectively. 



This influx of investment briefly suggested a potential stabilization or renewed investor interest in the fund.




However, this trend did not sustain. By May 7 and May 9, GBTC reported outflows of $28.6 million and $43.4 million respectively, effectively negating the gains made in the previous days. 



This pattern of rapid reversal is indicative of the challenges faced by GBTC, marking it as the only spot Bitcoin ETF issuer to report outflows during that period while other funds under the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) saw positive or neutral investment flows.



In contrast, other Bitcoin ETFs have fared significantly better. 



For instance, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust attracted substantial investment, totaling nearly $15.5 billion.

Other notable funds include Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, and Cathie Wood’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, which reported net inflows of $8.1 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.2 billion respectively.



Despite these fluctuations, the average daily loss for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust since its launch stands at a stark $211 million. 



Nonetheless, the overall Bitcoin ETF market in the U.S. has maintained a positive net balance of $11.7 billion due to robust inflows into other funds.



Adding insight into the investor demographics, Jan VanEck, CEO of VanEck, commented during the Paris Blockchain Week in April that “You’ve had some Bitcoin whales and some other institutions move some assets in, but they were already exposed to BITCOIN.” 



He further noted the predominant retail investor contribution, which accounts for 90% of Bitcoin ETF inflows. 



Despite this, there is an anticipation for significant institutional investments from banks and traditional firms as projected around May.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Edge Higher On Spot ETF Holdings Disclosure And 'Roaring Kitty' Frenzy: Analyst Says $66,250 Next Hurdle For Bitcoin Before A New All-Time High - Benzinga

Top cryptocurrencies of the market lifted upward Monday, spurred by top banks' disclosure of investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs, and a social media post by retail trader "Roaring Kitty" that sent meme coins flying.CryptocurrencyGains +/-Price (Recorded 8:30 p.m. EDT)Bitcoin BTC/USD+2.19%$63,021.64Ethereum ETH/USD+0.48%$2,952.36Dogecoin DOGE/USD+4.72%$0.1488What Happened: Bitcoin, the most valuable digital asset on the planet, rose above $63,000 after a subdued weekend. The disclosure of spot ETF holdings by banking titans such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase last week likely acted as the major trigger. About $56 million in positions was wiped out in the last 24 hours, with nearly equal amounts of longs and shorts liquidated.The uptick in spot prices drove investments in the derivatives market, as Bitcoin's Open Interest went to upwards of $30 billion, following a 2.94% increase over the last 24 hours.The world's largest meme coin, Dogecoin, bounced 4.73% in the last 24 hours as popular retail trader Roaring Kitty posted a meme on social media after a nearly three-year absence.The level of "Greed" in the market surged, according to Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index, an indication that buying pressure might improve in the days ahead.Top Gainer (24 Hour)CryptocurrencyGains +/-Price (Recorded 8:30 p.m. EDT)Ethena (ENA)+4.10%$0.8947Lido DAO (LDO)+3.11%$1.97UNUS SED LEO (LEO)+2.61%$5.93The global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.3 trillion, increasing by 1.42% in the past 24 hours.Major stock indices closed lower on Monday.

Investors Bet on Solana as SOL Investment Products Lead Altcoin Inflows, Data Shows | Cryptoglobe


                                
Cryptocurrency investment products saw inflows of $130 million over the past week, with Solana ($SOL) leading institutional investment among the altcoins it’s possible to get exposure to via these products.



According to CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund Flows weekly, investment products offering exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin saw inflows of $144 million, while products offering exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization Ethereum (ETH) saw outflows of $14.4 million as ETH keeps underperforming when compared to BTC itself.



Meanwhile products offering exposure to multiple digital assets saw $3.4 million of outflows, and were followed by those offering exposure to Binance’s BNB, which saw $400,000 of outflows. Products shorting BTC also saw $5.1 million of outflows.



Altcoins saw significant inflows with Solana-focused investment products seeing $5.9 million of inflows, bringing their total year-to-date flows to $17 million. Polkadot (DOT), XRP and Litecoin (LTC) investment products followed suit, with $1.2 million, $600,000 and $100,000 inflows respectively.



CoinShares noted in its report that exchange-traded product trading volumes were of just $8 billion, compared to the $17 billion average seen during April. Per the firm, these volumes show ETP investors are “participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present.”







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The firm added that Ethereum-based investment products likely saw outflows as low interaction by Us regulators with spot ETF issuer applications for Ethereum funds has “increased speculation” that the approval of these ETFs isn’t imminent.



Investors are seemingly more optimistic about Solana, based on a survey of 64 investors with a total of $600 billion in assets under management. It’s worth noting that Solana’s price is up over 470% over the past year as it saw a major surge, but it has lost around 33% of its value over the last 30 days.



As CryptoGlobe reported, a popular cryptocurrency analyst known in the space for accurately predicting the cryptocurrency market bottom during the 2018 bear market, has recently said the price of Solana is “gearing up for a violent breakout.”



Notably, earlier this month Solana whales started buying up memecoins amid a recent cryptocurrency market downturn that has seen the prices of these assets plunge.

Bitcoin dominance tops 50% amidst market volatility: What's next? - AMBCrypto



BTC remained the most dominant asset despite recent declines.
BTC rose above the $61,000 price range.

Bitcoin [BTC] prices have been fluctuating, moving in and out of the red zone, highlighting the lackluster trend it has been experiencing. 
Despite these fluctuations, Bitcoin dominance has managed to stay above 50%, albeit with marginal changes.
 This sustained dominance above the 50% mark has also influenced the overall trend of the cryptocurrency market capitalization.
Bitcoin dominance remains at over 50%
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Bitcoin’s dominance data from CoinMarketCap indicated that towards the end of the previous year, BTC dominance dropped below 50%, signaling a decrease in BTC’s market cap. 
However, at the onset of 2024, the market cap regained the 50% threshold and continued to rise. As of the last recorded data on 11th May, BTC dominance stood at over 53%.
Source: CoinMarketCap
It’s worth noting that CoinMarketCap calculates data weekly. As for the 24-hour data from Crypto Rank on 12th May 12th, BTC dominance had fallen to around 50%. 
However, within the last 24 hours, BTC dominance has increased by approximately 0.4%, bringing it back to over 51% at this time. 
This translates to around 51% of the total crypto market capitalization.
Bitcoin market cap maintains a $1 trillion threshold
Analysis of the crypto market capitalization trend on CoinMarketCap revealed that it stood at around $2.3 trillion at press time. 
Recent data indicated a reduction in market cap over the past few weeks, with a decrease of over 2% in the last 24 hours. Declines in the prices of various crypto assets primarily drive the decrease. 
Also, following a period in 2022 where the market capitalization fell below the $2 trillion mark, it re-entered this range around March and has since remained there, albeit with fluctuations. 
Further examination of the data highlights that out of the total $2.3 trillion market capitalization, Bitcoin accounts for over $1.2 trillion. 
Also, despite market fluctuations, the price of Bitcoin has managed to hover around $60,000. 
This ensured that its market capitalization remained above the $1 trillion mark for an extended period, allowing Bitcoin dominance to remain above 50%.
BTC makes push above $62,000
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin daily timeframe price trend indicated that it has surged above the $62,000 price zone. It was trading at around $62,500 at the time of writing, with an increase of over 1%.
 This marked the first return to this price range in the last three days.

Should this momentum persist, BTC may test its short-term resistance level at around $64,000. 
However, it’s worth noting that it remained in a bear trend according to its Relative Strength Index (RSI) at press time.

Crypto Firm Falcon Labs Settles ‘Unregistered Activities’ Case With CFTC For $1.7M | Bitcoinist.com


								The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has taken action against crypto brokerage firm Falcon Labs, a company based in the Seychelles, for failing to register as a futures commission merchant (FCM) in the US. 
Interestingly, this marks the CFTC’s first enforcement action against an unregistered futures commission merchant involved in providing “unauthorized access” to crypto exchanges.
Falcon Labs Faces CFTC Crypto Crackdown
Under the CFTC order, Falcon Labs is required to immediately cease acting as an unregistered FCM, specifically by facilitating US individuals’ access to digital asset derivatives trading platforms. 
In addition, Falcon Labs was ordered to pay a disgorgement of $1.7 million and a civil penalty of $589,000, the latter in recognition of the company’s cooperation with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, as described in the order.

Ian McGinley, the Director of Enforcement at the CFTC, emphasized the agency’s commitment to maintaining integrity in the derivatives markets and ensuring compliance with registration requirements. He stated: 
The CFTC’s enforcement program has made clear it will not tolerate digital asset exchanges that fail to register with the CFTC or comply with the agency’s rules that maintain integrity in the derivatives markets,” said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. And now the CFTC is taking the fight one step further by, for the first time, charging an intermediary that inappropriately facilitated access to those exchanges. Today’s action highlights that the CFTC will not hesitate to charge any entities—exchanges or intermediaries—who are providing customers access to digital asset products and services that require registration but have failed to appropriately register. 
‘Unregistered Activities’ In Crypto Derivatives Market
The CFTC’s order reveals that from around October 2021 through at least March 27, 2023, Falcon Labs solicited and accepted orders for digital asset derivatives from US-based customers. 
Acting as an intermediary, Falcon Labs facilitated customer trading on various digital asset exchanges, including institutional customers in the United States.
According to the CFTC, Falcon Labs provided direct exchange access by creating a main account in its name and associated sub-accounts. Notably, the sub-account holders’ customer-identifying information was generally not required by the exchanges, nor provided by Falcon Labs.
During the period in question, Falcon Labs collected net fees totaling approximately $1.1M from customers engaging in crypto-derivative transactions facilitated by the company. 

Following the CFTC’s complaint against Changpeng Zhao, Binance Holdings Limited, Binance Holdings (IE) Limited, Binance (Services) Holdings Limited, and Samuel Lim in 2023, Falcon Labs reportedly increased its controls for identifying customer locations.

New daily Runes etched on Bitcoin falls 99% from post-halving peak

The number of new Runes etched on Bitcoin daily has fallen below 250 for the last six days, with 157 Runes etched on Monday marking a 99% fall from its peak in late April. The fall comes after a highly successful streak that came a week after launch, which saw an average of 14,700 new Runes etched each day between April 26-30, including a record 23,061 etched on April 26, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard created by RUNES.IS.New daily Runes etched on Bitcoin since April 20. Source: Dune AnalyticsRunes is a new token standard that launched at the fourth Bitcoin halving block on April 20. The protocol allows memecoin and nonfungible token enthusiasts to inscribe and etch their favorite artwork, images, audio and videos onto the Bitcoin network.It initially provided a much-needed revenue boost for Bitcoin miners looking to mitigate the impact of the recent halving, which saw the block subsidy halve to 3.125 Bitcoin (BTC) — worth $196,800 at current prices.However, the 157 Runes etched on May 13 only contributed $3,835 in transaction fees to Bitcoin miners, far less than the hundreds of thousands of dollars that miners were receiving every day in late April. A total of $4.5 million in transaction fees have been paid to Bitcoin miners since Runes launched on April 20 — coming out at about $189,00 each day.A little over 91,200 Runes have been etched on Bitcoin so far.Runes still make up the bulk of transactionsDespite the fall in the number of Runes etched, Runes transactions continue to make up the majority of transactions in May, which were largely taking place on marketplaces such as Magic Eden, OKX, Ordinals Wallet, and UniSat.Key statistics from the Runes protocol from May 13.

The sudden and unexpected return of Keith Gill — the man widely credited with kicking off the 2021 GameStop short squeeze — has speculators asking one question: Are we in for GameStop 2.0?Many are hopeful, but at least one analyst has his doubts.Gill was at the center of the GameStop saga during the pandemic, which saw Reddit traders flip the table on hedge funds that had been making money shorting what they believed to be a failing brick-and-mortar game store — which ended up sending the price of GME soaring over 1,000% in under a month. Some also believe the GameStop short squeeze laid the groundwork for a massive surge in the price of memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) after retail turned its attention elsewhere.Gill went dark on social media on June 19, 2021, but returned after a nearly three-year hiatus on May 13, posting a typically cryptic meme of a gamer sitting up in their chair to announce his comeback. In the 24 hours following Gil’s return to X, shares of GameStop rallied as much as 111%, while DOGE and SHIB gained 6.2% and 5.4% respectively in the same time frame. Comparative price action of GME, DOGE, and SHIB since May 5. Source: TradingViewNow, crypto enthusiasts are pinning their hopes that Gill’s return will spark a similar breed of retail mania.One analyst isn't so bullishHowever, eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert told Cointelegraph that it probably won’t be that easy this time around. “I think it will certainly ignite some short-term moves from these assets, but it's hard to see any longevity,” he said. Additionally, Gilbert noted that the outstanding shorts on assets like GameStop were much smaller compared to 2021 meaning that the “size of the move to the upside” would likely be smaller as well. “The environment is just not comparable to 2021, when interest rates were at rock bottom, governments were providing fiscal stimulus globally, and major economies had little to no inflation.”“We have 5.5% interest rates in the US and there is a global cost of living crisis going on. Simply, consumers are unlikely to be in the same position as they were in 2021 and that has a huge impact on financial decisions,” Gilbert added. Crypto enthusiasts offered a more simple thesis for their bullishness. Pointing to a recent integration between Robinhood and decentralized exchange UniSwap, pseudonymous trader Travis said it was reasonable to expect a new wave of GameStop degens to start buying memecoins and other cryptocurrencies by way of the app.“Just a reminder you can trade memes on Robinhood now. You think the Roaring Kitty army isn't going to buy these things?”However, Gilbert said among many other factors, most investors are now clued into how speculative rallies end up and are more likely to exercise a much higher degree of caution.Source: Trader Travis“I think we’re in a completely different position from where we were in 2021, which makes me think a similar rally would be unlikely,” he said. “That said, the 14.5 million users on WallStreetBets have shown in the last few years that anything is possible.”Several GameStop-related memecoins including a coin named GameStop (GME) — which bears no official affiliation with the company — spiked massively amid the unfolding drama. The GME memecoin soared more than 3,650% in a single day, per Birdeye data. A GameStop-themed meme oin spiked massively on the news.

                        The UK government’s Insolvency Service has shut down a London-based crypto advisory firm that claimed to offer investment advice in cryptocurrencies.In a London High Court ruling on April 30, Amey Finance Academy Ltd was ordered to close. The company’s sole owner and leader, Desmond Amey (42), who presented himself as a wealth creation specialist, had previously assured customers that their cryptocurrency investments were safe.Despite Amey’s assurances, customers allegedly lost money in their investments, according to a statement on Monday. This lack of positive returns raised red flags. And in July 2022, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stepped in.The financial watchdog identified Amey Finance Academy as an unauthorized provider of financial services or products in the UK, warning against dealing with it.The firm’s founder Amey didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.Crypto Advisory Firm Allegedly Made False Promises and Investor Losses
Established in Dec. 2018, Amey Finance Academy advertised itself on social media as “an established and successful independent consultancy providing a plethora of financial services.” The company also claimed to operate a leading education academy within the industry, the Insolvency Service said.However, Amey made false assurances, guaranteeing one customer who later lost all their invested funds that their investment would not fall below 90%.In WhatsApp messages investigators reviewed, Amey assured another customer that the investments were “100 certy” and urged them to “trust me bro.” Additionally, Amey Finance Academy promoted crypto schemes conducted by other firms such as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7b from investors globally.Chief Investigator Exposes Founder’s Deceptive Crypto Schemes
Further, Amey posted a video on YouTube in Oct. 2023, suggesting that the office still maintained a presence at 1 Canada Square in Canary Wharf, London. However, he had actually been evicted earlier that year in January due to rent non-payment.“Desmond Amey used Amey Finance Academy to recklessly persuade individuals to invest in cryptocurrency schemes and mislead them about the risks of doing so,” said Mark George, the Insolvency Service’s chief investigator.He also mentioned that the service couldn’t determine the company’s full activities, assets, liabilities. Nor could it ascertain the handling of £5m ($6.2m) from Oct. 2019 to March 2022 due to insufficient accounting records and lack of transparency.“The public deserve protection from companies trading in an opaque and objectionable manner which is why we applied to have Amey Finance Academy shut down,” George said.Earlier this year, the UK’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) took down 43 websites suspected of crypto phishing scams. The NFIB’s investigation uncovered a fake email address designed to trick Blockchain.com customers. This spoofed address aimed to exploit security weaknesses and steal cryptocurrency.

                        The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has reached a settlement with Falcon Labs, Ltd., a Seychelles-based entity, for operating as an unregistered futures commission merchant (FCM) and facilitating access to digital asset exchanges without proper registration.CFTC Settlement Terms and Fines Against FalconUnder the settlement terms, Falcon Labs must cease acting as an unregistered FCM, particularly in providing US individuals access to digital asset derivatives trading platforms. Additionally, Falcon Labs has been ordered to pay $1,179,008 in disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty of $589,504.The reduced penalty reflects Falcon Labs’ extensive cooperation with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement throughout the investigative process.Ian McGinley, the CFTC’s Director of Enforcement, emphasized the agency’s unwavering commitment to upholding integrity in derivatives markets, particularly in the digital asset space. He said,“The CFTC’s enforcement program has made clear it will not tolerate digital asset exchanges that fail to register with the CFTC or comply with the agency’s rules that maintain integrity in the derivatives markets.”McGinley highlighted the CFTC’s determination to hold accountable any entities, whether exchanges or intermediaries, that provide access to digital asset products and services without appropriate registration.As an intermediary, Falcon Labs facilitated customer trading on various digital asset exchanges, including institutional customers within the US. The company provided direct access to exchanges by creating main accounts in its name and establishing associated sub-accounts, often without requiring or providing customer-identifying information.Throughout this period, Falcon Labs amassed net fees totaling approximately $1,179,008 from customers engaging in digital asset derivative transactions intermediated by the company.Notably, Falcon Labs took voluntary steps to enhance its customer identification controls following the CFTC’s complaint against entities associated with Binance, which shed light on similar practices involving sub-accounts for U.S.-located customers trading digital asset derivatives.CFTC is Mostly Having Its Way
In last year’s precedent-setting decision, a US district judge ruled in favour of the US CFTC in its litigation against Ooki DAO, ordering the organization to pay a civil penalty of $643,542 and cease operations in the US. The court’s ruling establishes that DAOs can be held liable for violating the law, challenging the notion that their decentralized structure insulates them from legal consequences.The background of DAOs reveals them as organizations operating based on blockchain rules and smart contracts, enabling decentralized decision-making without a central authority. The case of Ooki DAO last year has echoed broader regulatory trends, as evidenced by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s subpoena of Sushi DAO, another decentralized organization behind a crypto exchange.With this recent landmark settlement, the CFTC seeks to encourage other digital asset intermediaries operating unlawfully to come forward and report their activities as required. Director Ian McGinley said,“In recognizing Falcon Labs’ substantial cooperation and remediation in this order in the form of a lower penalty, the CFTC hopes to encourage other digital asset intermediaries operating illegally to come forward and report their activities to the agency.”

Following this launch, the Open League has sparked improved user engagement with the TON blockchain. For context, the league has triggered a 264% increase in TON’s monthly active users (MSUs) to 1.5 million users. According to data from Coinmarketcap, TON trades at $7.05 during press time, representing a 4.15% intraday increase.

Mark Cuban Says SEC Didn't Learn A Thing After Mt. Gox, Applauds Japan's Response: 'They Are Still So Stupid' - Benzinga

Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor and television personality, criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its inaction following the Mt. Gox debacle. Cuban also lauded Japan’s regulatory response to the incident.What Happened: Cuban took to social media platform X, to express his views on the SEC’s handling of the Mt. Gox situation. He contrasted this with Japan’s approach, which he commended for protecting its stakeholders.“The SEC didn't learn sh*t. Not a damn thing when MT Gox happened. They are still so stupid they think the mere process of registration protects investors. The only actions they take are after the fact. See Madoff. See FTX. See Chinese Stocks,” Cuban wrote.See Also: If You Bought Your Mom $100 In Bitcoin, Dogecoin And Ethereum Last Mother’s Day, Here’s How Much She’d Have TodayHe also criticized the SEC’s approach to innovation, stating that it is “completely the opposite of our technology history in the USA.” He further questioned the SEC’s ability to protect investors from scams, suggesting that the regulatory body is “really really bad” at it.Cuban responded to a post by Mike Kelly, which questioned the potential of 65 tokens in Japan to be breakthrough applications. Cuban pointed out that even the “scammiest of the scammiest tokens” haven’t caused as much loss as other investments.Why It Matters: Cuban’s criticism of the SEC’s regulatory approach comes amid a broader debate on the regulation of cryptocurrencies. In a recent exchange with James Love, Director of an NGO Knowledge Ecology International, Cuban highlighted the various benefits of digital assets, including minimal transaction fees, easily accessible credit, and insulation against theft.Meanwhile, the Mt. Gox incident has been a long-standing issue in the cryptocurrency space. The exchange, once the world’s leading Bitcoin BTC/USD exchange, suffered a devastating hack in 2011 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2014. However, there is now a glimmer of hope for creditors, with some reportedly receiving updates on their claims.At the same time, the SEC’s regulatory approach has been a source of frustration for many in the crypto space. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev recently expressed his disappointment with the SEC’s response to the company’s efforts to engage with the regulatory body.Read Next: Bitcoin Clinging On To $60K, Ethereum, Dogecoin Bleed: ‘Bitcoin’s Final Move Will Be The Most Aggressive,’ Predicts TraderImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

Joe Biden Blocks Chinese-Owned Crypto Mining Firm - MineOne


On May 13, The President of the United States, Joe Biden, issued a directive prohibiting MineOne from acquiring real estate near a strategic missile base. The US government found that MineOne, mainly owned by Chinese nationals, aimed to use the property for crypto mining.
This decision stems from national security concerns due to the site’s proximity to Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. The base hosts Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles.
National Security Concerns Prompt Presidential Action
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) saw risks in the foreign-owned, specialized equipment at the site.

“The proximity of the foreign-owned Real Estate to a strategic missile base and key element of America’s nuclear triad, and the presence of specialized and foreign-sourced equipment potentially capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities, presents a national security risk to the United States,” the President’s order reads.

As a result of these findings, the transaction has been prohibited. MineOne and its affiliates must sell or transfer all ownership interests in the property within 120 days. Additionally, they must remove all equipment and improvements from the site within 90 days and certify the completion of these actions.

MineOne and its affiliates are restricted from accessing the property throughout this period and must ensure compliance with the order. They must also provide weekly updates to CFIUS until all conditions are met.
The Department of Treasury issued an official statement following the President’s order. In the statement, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen emphasized that this order shows President Biden’s commitment to protecting national security.

“It also highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security, particularly as it relates to transactions that present risk to sensitive US military installations as well as those involving specialized equipment and technologies,” Secretary Yellen added.

Furthermore, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Investment Security Paul Rosen reiterated that CFIUS expects complete, accurate, and timely information from involved parties. He also stressed that failure to address national security risks would prompt decisive actions, including Presidential interventions.
This order follows the Department of the Treasury’s proposed 30% tax on electricity consumption by crypto mining firms as part of the Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue Proposals. This proposal aims to mitigate the environmental impact of the crypto mining industry’s rising energy demand.
Under this scheme, crypto mining firms must report the quantity and cost of electricity consumed, including off-grid power production. The tax will be introduced gradually, starting at 10% and reaching 30% by the third year, effective January 1, 2025.
Biden’s Crypto Policies Stir Controversy and Industry Reaction

The Biden administration’s tougher stance towards the crypto industry is further evidenced by its position on H.J. Res 109, a resolution to nullify the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. This bulletin requires financial institutions to include customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets, which the crypto community sees as burdensome.
The White House has clarified that rejecting this rule would weaken the SEC’s investor and financial system protections. President Biden is ready to veto the resolution.
In response to the current regulatory environment, industry players are rallying to support pro-crypto political candidates. Coinbase has created a new political action committee (PAC) named “Stand With Crypto” to support crypto-friendly candidates financially.
Coinbase’s PAC has garnered support from various parties, including Moonpay, a fintech platform that supports crypto transactions. Moonpay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright emphasized the importance of advancing crypto innovation.


“This year’s election will define the future of our industry in the United States, and it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that want to positively advance crypto innovation for everyone,” Soto-Wright stated.

Also, prominent crypto community figures, such as Mark Cuban and Hayden Adams, have warned that Biden’s current stance could impact the upcoming elections. The warning aligns with a recent report from the Blockchain Association. The report indicates that one in five US voters considers crypto a key issue, with many distrusting candidates who interfere with crypto.

Crypto exchange OKX launches local regulated entity in Australia

Crypto exchange OKX is moving its Australian-focused services under a locally regulated entity as part of its expansion efforts through the Asia-Pacific region.Oscar Piastri of McLaren Racing — one of OKX's main sponsors —officially announced the news at a media event in Sydney on May 14.“Australian crypto users deserve a platform that is secure, easy-to-use and response to their needs, which include seamless access to banking rails as well as AUD pairs for the most popular cryptocurrencies,” OKX Australia general manager Jamie Kennedy said in a statement shared with Cointelegraph.170 crypto trading pairs will be available to Australian users, OKX noted.Options trading would also be available in addition to spot trading, Kennedy noted.Source: OKXOKX president Hong Fang says Australia offers a “dynamic customer base” for the firm, including both sophisticated traders and others that are interested in crypto but haven't taken the first step yet.OKX told Cointelegraph it was opening an Australian office in March last year, explaining there was a “huge appetite” for crypto and it saw the country as “a key growth market.”The exchange’s Australian-focused services since March 20 moved from a Seychelles-based firm to the on-shore entities OKX Australia Pty Ltd which handles the crypto exchange and fiat services side, and OKX Australia Financial Pty Ltd which handles its derivatives and margin products.However, Australian laws dictate that local users must pass a suitability assessment and meet the definition of a wholesale client — a legal requirement under the Corporations Act 2001.Despite the regulatory hurdles, Fang praised Australian regulators for engaging with them in an open and transparent manner.Related: Australia’s top exchange may approve spot Bitcoin ETFs this year: ReportOKX has also had to stop offering its copy trading, yield-bearing products and trading of some tokens to comply with local laws.

New Filing Reveals What Ripple Wants To Hide From The Public


								In a court filing on May 13, 2024, Ripple Labs has formally requested the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to seal various documents that were submitted in connection with the SEC’s Motion for Judgment and Remedies. These documents, collectively referred to as the “Remedies Materials,” contain sensitive financial data, including audited financial statements, revenue, expenses, and other confidential business information.
Breaking Down Ripple’s Request To Seal
Ripple’s legal counsel, Andrew J. Ceresney of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, articulated in the letter to Judge Analisa Torres the rationale behind the request. Ceresney’s argument focuses on the potential damage to the company’s competitive position, noting, “Public disclosure of this information would be highly detrimental because it would reveal detailed information about Ripple’s financial condition, long-term business plans, revenue streams, and expense structures to the marketplace, including competitors, customers, and future business partners and customers.”
A core objective of Ripple is to seal the discounts offered to institutional buyers of XRP. The motion lays out three main reasons to justify their request for sealing.
Protection of Highly Confidential Financial Information: Ripple emphasizes the critical nature of the documents it seeks to seal, particularly its audited financial statements and related materials.

According to Ceresney, “The documents and information are non-public and their disclosure would cause significant harm to Ripple’s business interests and competitive standing.” He argues that these documents contain sensitive financial metrics that are vital to maintaining the company’s proprietary strategies and competitive position in the marketplace.
Preservation of Negotiating Power: Another significant aspect of the request is to protect the details of its financial terms negotiated with third-party business partners. The company asserts that revealing the XRP sale terms could compromise its competitive position and adversely affect its negotiating capabilities in future deals.
The motion details the potential repercussions, noting, “Revelation of the financial terms of its contracts with counterparties and customers […] could result in serious damage to Ripple’s negotiating position with future counterparties, and would cause competitors to adjust their sales plans and pricing policies to compete with Ripple in the marketplace.”

This section underscores the concern that such disclosures could not only harm its individual bargaining power but also provide competitors with unjust insights into the company’s strategic operations.
Ensuring Privacy of Non-Parties: Ripple also seeks to redact the identities of non-party entities like XRP investors, customers, and business partners, asserting that their privacy should be protected as their identities and contact information are irrelevant to the legal issues at hand and could be misused if disclosed.
The motion articulates, “The identities of these non-parties have no bearing at all on the Court’s resolution of the Remedies Motion and therefore their privacy interests outweigh the presumption of public access.” Ripple stresses that such disclosure poses unnecessary risks to the individuals and entities involved and does not contribute to the resolution of the case.
Ripple’s legal team also points out that the SEC has not opposed several of the sealing requests, which might play in favor of their motion. Citing previous cases where the court granted similar requests for sealing and redaction, the motion suggests that there is a strong precedent supporting their request.
Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan commented, “a company has every right to seek to protect commercially sensitive information. In this situation, the need for Ripple to even apply to seal information on discounts arises from the SEC putting this in evidence and its weak argument that pecuniary harm is suffered by a sophisticated institutional investor […].”
At press time, XRP traded at $0.507.

                        Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, is grappling with a “system-wide outage” that has rendered its services inaccessible to users on both desktop and mobile platforms.The exchange officially announced the outage on its status page, alerting users to a “major outage” that began at 4:15 am UTC on May 14.As a result, attempting to visit the Coinbase website currently displays a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error message.“Coinbase experiencing a system wide outage. We are investigating this issue. Your funds are safe,” the message on its status page reads.Coinbase Might be Experiencing an Overload
According to a developer guide from Mozilla, this error message commonly indicates that the servers are either undergoing maintenance or experiencing overload.Coinbase Support took to social media to acknowledge the issue and assure users that they were actively investigating and working towards a solution.They reiterated that users’ funds remained safe despite the disruption.This is not the first time Coinbase has faced temporary outages.On February 28, along with several other exchanges, Coinbase experienced service disruptions due to a surge in crypto trading activity.While such outages are undoubtedly frustrating for users, some individuals in the cryptocurrency community leverage these incidents to fuel a bullish narrative, suggesting that the heightened activity causing the downtime ultimately benefits the market price.Although the outage duration and the underlying cause have not been specified by Coinbase, the company is expected to provide updates as they work to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to its platform.KBW Increases Coinbase Price Target to $230
Last month, investment banking firm KBW hailed Coinbase for offering investors a unique opportunity to tap into the long-term growth potential of the crypto economy and increased its price target for COIN to $230.In a research analysis, KBW raised its Coinbase price target from $160 to $230 while maintaining its market performance rating. Meanwhile, Coinbase has also faced its fair share of regulatory trouble.Last month, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase can proceed.The Judge’s decision came after Coinbase filed a motion to dismiss the SEC case, which borders on allegations the exchange operates as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.In her ruling, Judge Failla declared that the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase held “plausible” ground. “The Court finds the SEC has sufficiently pleaded that Coinbase operates as an exchange, as a broker, and as a clearing agency under the federal securities laws, and through its Staking Program engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities,” the court document read.As reported, Kathryn Haun, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney and partner at Andreesen-Horowitz, has stepped down from Coinbase’s board.

                        OKX, a world-leading digital asset exchange, has officially launched its operations in Australia, a year after it established an office in Sydney in May 2023.Announced Tuesday, the launch would enable spot trading for all users and derivatives trading for verified wholesale clients in Australia.The move arrives months after the exchange’s subsidiary received in-principle approval for a payments license to operate in Singapore. The exchange also launched its operations in Turkey, this February.Adding on to its expansion spree, OKX’s Australian launch aims to provide trusted, compliant, and transparent gateway to crypto trading and decentralized finance (DeFi).“As part of our long-term commitment to the Australian market, we look forward to continuing to improve our offering to better serve the local crypto community,” the exchange wrote on X.With the launch, OKX claims to be the largest global crypto exchange offering direct AUD deposits and withdrawals to Australians.As of now, spot trading users have access to 170 crypto spot pairs and a total of 85 tokens including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Tether, the release added. The OKX’s Australian arm plans to add more tokens in the coming months.“Australian crypto users deserve a platform that is secure, easy-to-use and responsive to their needs, which include seamless access to banking rails as well as AUD pairs for the most popular cryptocurrencies,” Jamie Kennedy, general manager at OKX Australia, noted.Australia’s Growing Crypto-Hungry Population
One of the key reasons for crypto exchanges to choose this smallest continent is due to its crypto-hungry population. According to a survey from Koinly reported that as many as 31.6% of Australians held or had held crypto as of July 2023.Additionally, crypto ownership in Australia has consistently increased since 2019, in a way that 1 in 4 adults own some type of cryptocurrency.On the other hand, Australia had intensified scrutiny on crypto exchanges lately, demanding data from 1.2 million accounts. A move to crackdown on users failing to pay their taxes amid a rising interest in crypto tokens.Further, ASX, the country’s market operator, is eying to approve the first-ever Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the end of 2024. As a result, this would trigger a surge in Bitcoin investment options among Australian users.

The filing also indicated that HODL held 8,711 BTC, costing $515 million and valued at $619 million. The ETF also reported liabilities of $20 million and a net realized gain of $6 million. Additionally, the fund had 8.2 million shares outstanding as of April 30, 2024.The SEC approved VanEck and 10 other Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, 2024, marking a historical milestone for the cryptocurrency industry.VanEck CEO Jan van Eck expressed skepticism about the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs during a CNBC interview on April 9.

They are both awaiting a final decision, due on May 23 and May 24 respectively.Advisor Expresses Concerns and Criticism
Previously on March 27, VanEck advisor Gabor Gurbacs criticized current crypto regulations for stifling innovation.Gurbacs’s concerns were sparked by the instability in the crypto industry, which he attributed to inadequate regulatory frameworks, especially following the SEC’s delay in potentially approving the Ethereum ETF applications.“I am personally unhappy with how regulators in developed markets managed the first decade of digital asset regulation,” said Gurbacs. “They manage to simultaneously enable scammers, hamper actual innovation and protect incumbents on the expense of those building better systems.”“It’s not excusable or tolerable to prioritize personal/political interests and senseless bureaucracy over national interests and capital formation. Not ever but particularly not in the economic condition where the world is now,” stated Gurbacs.

'Roaring Kitty' Comeback Makes Cat-Themed Coins Explode: ROAR Shoots Up Over 500% - Benzinga

The "Roaring Kitty" mania rippled across the meme coin market, causing coins themed on kitty avatars to soar to unprecedented heights. What Happened: Coins, which had nothing to do with either Roaring Kitty — the social media nickname of retail trader Keith Gill — or Gamestop, the company at the center of the well-known short squeeze in January 2021, began climbing solely due to the buzz surrounding the word “Kitty.”CryptocurrencyGains +/-Price (Recorded at 12:30 a.m. EST)Roaring Kitty ROAR/USD+545%$0.001459Kitty Coin Solana KITTY/USD+126%$$0.0009446Kitty AI DOGE/USD+10.6%$0.0002691Ethereum-based Raoaring Kitty was the largest gainer in the memecoin space, exploding 545% over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Similarly, Solana-based Kitty Coin Solana was up 126% in the said timeframe, ranking as the third-best-performing coin in the space.Amid these astronomical gains, on-chain tracking site Lookonchain revealed how a trader purchased a large amount of KITTY moments before the tweet from Roaring Kitty–the event that sparked the euphoria. The "lucky" trader then sold a significant portion of his stash when prices pumped, leading to a massive 32x jump in profits.Why It Matters:  The phenomenon reaffirmed the volatile and speculative nature of meme coins, requiring just a social media post to swing wildly.While they appear enticing to a lay investor during periods of hype, questions remain regarding the sustainability of the surge. It would be interesting to observe how long these new kitty-themed tokens can keep their upward trend.Image Courtesy: PixabayIt was observed that the more established meme coins seem to show greater resilience during weak markets.Read Next: GameStop Stock Pumps, But What About The GameStop Meme Coin?Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Daily Bitcoin Rune Etchings Plummet by 99% Since April Peak

                        The number of new Runes etched on Bitcoin daily has experienced a drastic decline, falling below 250 for the past six days.The drop is particularly notable, with only 157 Runes etched on Monday, marking a staggering 99% decrease from the peak witnessed in late April, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard created by RUNES.IS.The decline follows a highly successful period that occurred a week after the launch, during which an average of 14,700 new Runes were etched each day between April 26 and 30.This impressive streak included a record-setting 23,061 Runes etched on April 26.Rune Etchings Decline After Halving Peak
Runes, a new token standard, was introduced at the fourth Bitcoin halving block on April 20.The protocol enables memecoin and non-fungible token enthusiasts to inscribe and etch their favorite artwork, images, audio, and videos onto the Bitcoin network.Initially, it provided a much-needed revenue boost for Bitcoin miners seeking to offset the impact of the recent halving.The block subsidy was halved to 3.125 Bitcoin (BTC), equivalent to $196,800 at current prices.However, the decline in Rune etchings is evident, with the 157 Runes etched on May 13 contributing a mere $3,835 in transaction fees to Bitcoin miners.This is a significant drop compared to the hundreds of thousands of dollars miners were receiving daily in late April.Since its launch on April 20, a total of $4.5 million in transaction fees have been paid to Bitcoin miners, averaging approximately $189,000 per day.The current count stands at over 91,200 Runes etched on Bitcoin.Despite the decrease in Rune etchings, Runes transactions continue to dominate the majority of transactions in May.These transactions primarily take place on popular marketplaces such as Magic Eden, OKX, Ordinals Wallet, and UniSat.Runes, introduced by Ordinals inventor Casey Rodarmor, aims to utilize blockspace more efficiently than its main competitor, BRC-20s, as outlined by Binance Research.Unlike BRC-20s, Runes are compatible with Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, allowing UTXOs to hold balances of arbitrary fungible tokens like Runes.Developers Hit Back at Runes
Last month, Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr criticized the Runes protocol, suggesting it exploits a fundamental design flaw within the Bitcoin blockchain network.In his post, Dashjr highlighted the contrasting nature of Ordinal Inscriptions and the Runes protocol in their interactions with the network.He explained that while Ordinals exploit vulnerabilities within Bitcoin Core, the Runes protocol operates within the existing framework of the network’s design flaws.In response to his opposition to Runes, Dashjr suggested methods for filtering out transactions related to the protocol.He recommended adjusting the “datacarriersize” setting in the bitcoin.conf file to zero, which would effectively block Runes’ spam.However, early indications suggest that miners are not following this advice.The popularity of the Runes protocol led to Bitcoin transaction fees reaching an all-time high average of $128 on April 20, coinciding with the fourth Bitcoin halving.

                        Security firm CertiK said it has detected and prevented a flaw in the cross-chain bridge Wormhole which could have resulted in $5 million worth of losses.In a social media post, CertiK said its research team found a critical bug in Wormhole — an incorrect application of the public and entry modifiers exposing the blockchain to potential multimillion-dollar exploits.In a short video explainer, CertiK runs through how it detected the flaw in the network.  CertiK said this case study not only underscores the critical role of proactive security practices but also celebrates the power of open-source software in raising security and transparency standards across the Web3 world.Wormhole supports the transfer of tokens and data across different blockchain networks. The crypto project was spun off by Jump Trading Group and is one of the most popular bridges linking the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.Wormhole Experienced the Largest DeFi Attack in 2022
In 2022, Wormhole lost about $321 million in an exploit. Hackers compromised Wormhole Bridge leading to 120,000 wETH loss from the platform, equivalent to $321 million. It was the largest DeFi attack of 2022 and the hacker swapped wETH tokens with Ethereum, SOL, USDC, APE, SX, etc.An investigation conducted by pseudonymous researcher Pland, detailed in an X post on April 4th, revealed that the Wormhole team overlooked excluding several wallet addresses associated with the exploit that drained $321 million in crypto from the cross-chain bridge.Chainalysis said to understand why the 2022 attack was more serious than the average hack, it is important to know how cross-chain bridges work.“Users interact with cross-chain bridges by sending funds in one asset to the bridge protocol, where those funds are then locked into the contract. The user is then issued equivalent funds of a parallel asset on the chain the protocol bridges to. In the case of Wormhole, users typically send Ether (ETH) to the protocol, where it is held as collateral, and are issued WeETH on Solana, backed by that collateral locked in the Wormhole contract on Ethereum,” — Chainalysis: Lessons from the Wormhole Exploit.April Sees Lowest Crypto Hacks Since 2021
April 2024 saw the lowest combined losses from crypto-related hacks and scams, with CertiK reporting approximately $25.7 million lost to exploits, hacks, and scams. This latest figure marks the lowest recorded hacks since CertiK began tracking such incidents in 2021, as flash loan attacks and private critical hacks decreased.

Can Ethereum Price Repeat Pattern and Start Fresh Surge To $3,200?


																Ethereum price is attempting a recovery wave from the $2,865 support. ETH might start a fresh surge if it clears the $2,960 resistance zone.

Ethereum remained stable and attempted a recovery wave above $2,900.
The price is trading below $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $2,930 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
The pair could start a major increase if there is a close above the $2,990 and $3,000 resistance levels.

Ethereum Price Holds Support
Ethereum price traded as low as $2,864 and recently started an upside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH was able to rise above the $2,900 and $2,920 resistance levels. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $2,930 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.
The price even spiked above $2,980 and tested $3,000. A high was formed at $2,992 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a minor move below the $2,960 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $2,864 swing low to the $2,992 high.
Ethereum is now trading below $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $2,950 level and another connecting bearish trend line on the same chart. If the bulls push the price and repeat the recent breakout, the price might start another increase.
The first major resistance is near the $3,000 level. The next key resistance sits at $3,050, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,120 level.

Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com
If there is a clear move above the $3,150 level, the price might rise and test the $3,220 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,250 resistance zone.
Another Failure In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,950 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,2930 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $2,864 swing low to the $2,992 high.
The first major support is near the $2,900 zone. The next support is near the $2,865 level. A clear move below the $2,865 support might push the price toward $2,740. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,650 level in the near term.
Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.
Major Support Level – $2,865
Major Resistance Level – $2,950

Bracebridge Bets Big in Bitcoin ETFs, Now Largest ARKB Holder


A recent SEC filing revealed that Bracebridge Capital has invested $363 million in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This Boston-based hedge fund has hefty stakes in the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).
This move highlights the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency.
Institutional Investments in Bitcoin ETFs Surge Amid Heavy Outflows
Bloomberg Intelligence data reveals Bracebridge Capital holds $262 million in ARKB, $81 million in IBIT, and $20 million in GBTC. The data further shows that Bracebridge Capital is the biggest holder of ARKB.
This is particularly noteworthy given that Bracebridge manages funds for endowments for Yale University and Princeton University. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, commented on Bracebridge Capital’s significant investment.


“The new high water mark (authorized participants/market maker) for Bitcoin ETF holdings has arrived. […] They went wild. If you manage money for the Ivys, you are as pro as it gets,” Balchunas wrote.

A few days before this revelation from Bracebridge, another SEC filing unveiled that traditional banks are also jumping on the spot Bitcoin ETFs bandwagon. The Switzerland-based investment bank, UBS Group AG, invested $145,692 in IBIT (3,600 shares) through its subsidiaries and institutional investment managers. Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) S.A., the family-owned banking giant, also owns $4.2 million in IBIT shares and $82,121 in GBTC shares.
Bracebridge Capital, UBS, and Rothschild’s moves align with a trend among institutional investors. BeInCrypto recently reported that the Susquehanna International Group had invested over $1.1 billion in various Bitcoin ETFs.

New York-based asset manager Hightower has also ramped up investments in Bitcoin ETFs. Hightower’s investments totaled $68.35 million across spot Bitcoin ETFs.
However, James Seyffart, another ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, cautioned the crypto community to be careful about identifying recent Bitcoin ETF ownership trends.

“Just FYI, everyone. JPM, Susquehanna (which also owns these ETFs and was all over this site last week), and others are just market makers and/or [authorized participants] APs. Their ownership isn’t necessarily indicative of anything other than this is how many shares they had on March 31, 2024,” Seyffart explained.


Despite the interest from institutional investors, US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs’ performance could have been more impressive in May. According to SoSo Value data, these ETFs recorded only three positive flows throughout May.
On May 3, the daily total net inflow was $378.24 million. Meanwhile, on May 6 and May 8, it was $217.06 million and $11.54 million, respectively. The ETFs saw outflows for the rest of May, with the biggest outflow of $563.77 million on May 1.

Nonetheless, the significant investments by institutions like Bracebridge Capital highlight the growing integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream financial portfolios. While the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs fluctuates, the increased institutional backing signals long-term confidence in the potential of digital assets.

Biden orders removal of Chinese-owned crypto miner near missile base

United States President Joe Biden has signed an order preventing a China-linked crypto mining firm from continuing to use land near a Wyoming nuclear missile base.The order, released by the White House on May 13, forces MineOne Cloud Computing Investment and its partners to divest property operated as a crypto mining facility near the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming.Biden cited national security concerns for the order to rescind the firm’s property rights. “There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that MineOne Partners Limited, a British Virgin Islands company ultimately majority owned by Chinese nationals [...] might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.”MineOne acquired the property in June 2022 and then made improvements to use it for crypto mining close to the Air Force base. The military installation is a strategic missile base and home to intercontinental ballistic missiles, the order read. The firm and its affiliates are also required to remove all equipment on the site installed after the improvements. The order also prohibits Chinese-linked entities from any further access to the site, which is less than a mile away from the base.The company has 120 days from the date of the order to sell the property and is not permitted to transfer it to third parties. Map showing proximity of MinerOne site, Francis E. Warren AFB, and Microsoft data center. Source: Google MapsRed flags regarding this particular site have been raised in the past by tech giant Microsoft which has a data center nearby. The location could allow the Chinese to “pursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations,” the Microsoft team wrote in an August 2022 report to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), according to a 2023 New York Times investigation. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who also serves as the chairperson of the committee, said the order to force MineOne to sell the land “highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security.” MineOne raised more than $20 million for its first fund within a month in 2021. Since it launched the fund in October 2021, it was n "actively subscribed" by U.S. institutional investors and high-net worth individuals, according to the announcement at the time.Cointelegraph reached out to MineOne for comments but did not receive an immediate response. Related: China has a Trojan Horse in US Bitcoin mining infrastructureThe Biden Administration has previously ordered a crackdown on the U.S. Bitcoin mining industry citing China as an example to follow as part of its ongoing war on crypto.Crypto mining was heavily curtailed by the ruling regime in China in 2021, initiating an exodus of mining operations, many of which ended up across the pond in the U.S. The latest White House order comes just a day before the Biden administration is set to sharply increase tariffs on several Chinese imports, including electric vehicles.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Economist Henrik Zeberg Says Extreme Rally Ahead for Crypto and Stocks - But There’s a Big Catch - The Daily Hodl


								Closely followed economist Henrik Zeberg is revealing his outlook for stocks and crypto for the coming months.
The macro strategist tells his 139,600 followers on the social media platform X that he believes stocks and crypto are gearing up for big rallies that may endure until the end of the year.










Zeberg points to two narratives that he says bulls will latch on to justify the ascent.
“1. Blow off top is not over and done – yet! Extreme rally ahead in certain indices and crypto.
2. Sentiment will become extremely BULLISH.
3. I will be called ‘Perma Bear’ as I call US market top. Market top very close in outside US.
4. Bulls will point to AI (artificial intelligence) and Fed liquidity to explain why markets can only go UP.”
But while Zeberg believes that more rallies are in sight for risk-on assets, he predicts that both stocks and crypto will implode once the top is in.
“Top in US markets will be in Q3/Q4 2024. 
Recession sets in Q4 2024. 
Fast decline in markets will begin.”
The economist also says market participants will be exuberant as the S&P 500 ascends to greater heights.
“People will become overly BULLISH – right as we approach the top. This bullish sentiment will grow bigger as the S&P 500 heads towards 6,150 [points]. And talk of AI and liquidity – as the reasons why markets only can go UP – will dominate…”
At time of writing, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,221 points.

Is Cardano a 'must-buy' right now? Key points about ADA's 2024 fortunes - AMBCrypto



Social media engagement and user activity have been falling in the past six weeks.
The NVT and mean coin age metrics posed a dilemma to investors.

Cardano [ADA] was unable to shake off its bearish bias. Technical analysis revealed that further losses remained likely for the token.
A lack of demand was a major reason, and bullish sentiment has also been negligible.
Bitcoin [BTC] was unable to break out of the $60.8k-$63.3k region, and Cardano was also stuck within the $0.43-$0.47 area. Do on-chain metrics hint at a bullish breakout, or reinforce the bearish expectations?
Development activity was high but the good news stops there

A high development activity shows that the project is continually fixing issues or otherwise preparing to ship new features.
Overall, it is a good sign for long-term investors, and Cardano did not slouch in this department.
Yet, the other metrics like daily active addresses and social volume have been in a decline since mid-March.
It indicated fewer users were utilizing the network for transactions and that social media engagements had fallen off. Moreover, the Weighted Sentiment has been negative for a good chunk of the past six weeks.
The online engagement has been negative or bearish, which does not bode well for the short-term price prospects. However, these factors alone do not indicate a drop is inbound.
The contradicting signs — is ADA undervalued or not?

The 30-day MVRV ratio has been negative since mid-March, showing an extremely undervalued asset in the short-term.
However, despite this development, the price trend has been bearish. During this time, the mean coin age has trended rapidly higher, showing accumulation in place.
It presented a good opportunity for swing traders to buy, as ADA was also at the range low. Yet, the NVT revealed something else.
The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio calculated using the daily circulation has also trended higher since mid-March.
This indicated that the network was likely overvalued, or expensive, compared to its low ability to transact tokens. This has bearish implication for the network usage, and in turn, the future demand.

Read Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2024-25

Therefore, putting these clues together with the technical analysis, it appeared that Cardano is likely headed for more losses.
A Bitcoin breakout might halt or reverse the downtrend, but the evidence at hand was not bullish.

Chainlink's (LINK) Outlook Grows Bleak: Signals of Bearish Continuation Surface


																Chainlink’s LINK price is struggling to surpass the $13.80 resistance. The price could continue to move down if it breaks the $13.00 support.

Chainlink price is showing bearish signs below the $14.00 resistance against the US dollar.
The price is trading below the $13.60 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $13.50 on the 4-hour chart of the LINK/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The price could start a decent increase if it clears the $13.80 resistance zone.

Chainlink (LINK) Price Turns Red
In the past few days, Chainlink saw a steady decline from well above the $13.80 level. LINK price declined below the $13.50 support level to enter a short-term bearish zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The price tested the $13.10 support zone. A low was formed at $13.07 and the price recently attempted a recovery wave. There was a move above the $13.50 level. It even jumped above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $14.30 swing high to the $13.07 low.
However, the bears were active below the $13.80 resistance and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $14.30 swing high to the $13.07 low. LINK price is still trading below the $13.80 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
Immediate resistance is near the $13.50 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $13.50 on the 4-hour chart of the LINK/USD pair.
Source: LINKUSD on TradingView.com
The next major resistance is near the $13.80 zone. A clear break above $13.80 may possibly start a steady increase toward the $14.00 level. The next major resistance is near the $14.35 level, above which the price could test $15.50.
More Losses?
If Chainlink’s price fails to climb above the $13.50 resistance level, there could be a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $13.10 level.
The next major support is near the $12.80 level, below which the price might test the $12.20 level. Any more losses could lead LINK toward the $11.50 level in the near term.
Technical Indicators
4 hours MACD – The MACD for LINK/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LINK/USD is now below the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $13.10 and $12.80.
Major Resistance Levels – $13.50 and $13.80.

US Senators Slam DOJ's Stance on Non-Custodial Crypto Services


Senators Ron Wyden and Cynthia Lummis have raised serious concerns regarding current crypto regulations in the United States. They target the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) recent stance on non-custodial crypto asset software services.
In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, they argue that the DOJ’s interpretation of federal laws threatens to criminalize Americans offering these services.
Senators Criticize DOJ’s Stance on Non-Custodial Crypto Services
The senators assert that the DOJ’s unprecedented interpretation of the prohibition on operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business contradicts Congressional intent. They also note that it conflicts with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) established guidelines.
They warn this interpretation could stifle innovation in the crypto industry. It could also undermine trust in the rule of law.

Both senators explain that non-custodial crypto services allow users to retain sole possession and control of their crypto assets. This means service providers do not “accept” or control them. Transactions happen on the user’s device without third-party access.
Read more: What Is a Non-Custodial Wallet?
Aligning with the senators’ explanation, FinCEN has held that non-custodial services are not subject to money transmitter registration requirements. This is because they do not involve direct receipt and control of assets.

“Non-custodial crypto service providers cannot be classified as money transmitter businesses because users of such services retain sole possession and control of their crypto assets. At no point when operating or providing non-custodial services do such service providers ‘accept’ crypto assets from their users. Users retain exclusive custody and control over the private keys to their crypto assets. All transactions are signed and processed on the user’s local device without third-party access,” the letter reads.

Furthermore, the letter urges the DOJ “to discard this flawed interpretation of Section 1960” to support the rule of law and foster the development of transformative technologies. In addition to her letter, Senator Lummis shared her thoughts on her X (Twitter) account.


“President Biden’s DOJ steamrolling the longstanding interpretation of FinCEN is legally wrong and threatens to criminalize Bitcoin software development in America,” Senator Lummis wrote.

Although the letter did not name any specific crypto services, many interpret it as referring to the recent case with Samourai Wallet. This platform is a Bitcoin wallet that provides financial anonymity for its users.
BeInCrypto reported that the DOJ charged Samourai Wallet’s co-founders with several financial crimes. These charges include operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.
Following the charge, US officials arrested Samourai Wallet’s co-founders. They also seized the platform’s operational infrastructure and removed its app from Google’s Play Store in the US.

The DOJ previously charged Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based decentralized crypto mixer, with a similar allegation. In August 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the crypto mixer service. At that time, OFAC claimed that Tornado Cash had been involved in laundering funds worth $7 billion.

Following OFAC’s sanction, the Netherlands Crime Agency (FIOD) arrested Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev in Amsterdam in the same month. FIOD alleged that Pertsev sponsored illicit financial flows, money laundering, and the mixing of cryptocurrencies through the service.
According to the schedule, Pertsev will hear his verdict today. The crypto community keenly awaits the outcome of Tornado Cash’s case. They fear that the outcome may threaten developers of privacy-focused software within the ecosystem.

San Francisco-based blockchain company Ripple has filed to seal or narrowly redact some of its documents in connection with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s motion for judgment and remedies. Ripple claims that the disclosure of these non-public documents would cause “significant harm” to its business interests. The company wants to seal or redact highly confidential information concerning its earnings, revenues, expenses and so on.In addition, Ripple wants to keep its contractual agreements with thirty-party business partners under wraps. While the Ripple admits that the fact that it offered discounts to institutional XRP buyers is relevant, it it not willing to disclose the specific financial and pricing terms. Ripple has stressed that the redactions are “narrowly drawn” and “warranted” due to their “sensitive” nature. Moreover, Ripple is also seeking to protect the identities of certain non-party financial institutions, customers as well as employees. The disclosure of these identities would be “detrimental” to their “legitimate privacy interests,” according to the filing. This could potentially damage Ripple’s partnerships.As reported by U.Today, the SEC is requesting more than $2 billion worth of fines and penalties from Ripple. However, the defendant insists that the civil penalty should not exceed $10 million. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief lawyer, recently said that the lawsuit was “closer than ever” to its resolution.

Tether Freezes 5.2M USDT On 12 ETH Addresses


							

Tether froze 5.2 million USDT tokens as per a May 14 post from MistTrack.



The tokens were associated with 12 Ethereum addresses.



The addresses might be connected to laundering addresses for phishing groups.




Tether, the firm associated with the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, froze 5.2 million USDT on May 14 as per the data from MistTrack, a crypto tracking and compliance platform. 



In a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), MistTrack stated that the stablecoin firm froze 5.2 million USDT on 12 Ethereum addresses tagged as “USDT Banned Address” by the crypto tracking platform. 



Notably, these 12 addresses may be money laundering addresses for phishing groups. It is a common practice for attackers to withdraw their funds to another platform and use crypto mixers to launder their money. 









Back in November 2023, the stablecoin issuer announced the “largest-ever freeze of USDT in history” while teaming up with digital asset trading platform OKX. Over 225 million USDT tokens associated with 37 wallets were frozen, and the funds were tied to a human trafficking group on Monday.



Further, the stablecoin issuer also froze 41 wallets controlled by those on the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List in December 2023.It is important to note that crypto firms have been actively freezing addresses associated with scammers and hackers. As per earlier reports, Binance and Huobi froze $1.4 million worth of crypto assets that were associated with Lazarus Group’s Harmony Bridge heist in June 2022.

Bitcoin Price Drops Toward $61K as Coinbase Reports System-Wide Outage


																The largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange informed its customers minutes ago that it is experiencing a system-wide outage but also reassured them that all funds are safe.
While it may not be entirely related, the price of bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop that drove it south by almost a grand.
The Coinbase status page highlighted the issue just a few hours ago, adding that the team has begun investigating it. Minutes ago, there was another update saying they continue to look into the problem.
These “system-outage” warnings came just minutes after more issues, described as “degraded transactions,” in which users reported failures when sending crypto or withdrawing fiat currencies.
After both problems, though, Coinbase wrote that “all funds are safe.”




At the same time these issues came to light, BTC’s price headed south and dropped by more than a grand in minutes. Although these events might not be related, it’s safe to assume that issues with the largest US crypto exchange can impact bitcoin’s price movements.
The asset dropped from $62,700 to $61,450 in minutes. Moreover, BTC is down by two grand from yesterday’s peak at $63,400.

‘Starting To Look Scary Bullish for Bitcoin’, Says Veteran Macro Investor Dan Tapiero | Cryptoglobe


                                
Dan Tapiero’s insights carry significant weight in the financial and digital asset communities. He is the Founder, CEO, CIO, and Managing Partner of 1RoundTable Partners and 10T Holdings, firms that manage over $1.2 billion in investments across 26 private companies within the digital asset ecosystem​​​​. Tapiero’s career spans several decades, beginning as a macro-focused portfolio manager and analyst at prominent investment firms like Tiger Management, Duquesne Capital Management, Steinhardt Management Co., and SAC Capital Advisors​​. His entrepreneurial ventures include co-founding Gold Bullion International (GBI), a precious metals platform that expanded into cryptocurrencies, and the Agricultural Company of America (AGCoA), one of the largest farmland REITs in the U.S. until its sale in 2013​​.



On 14 May 2024, renowned macro investor and digital asset enthusiast Dan Tapiero took to social media platform X to share an optimistic forecast for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. In his post, Tapiero expressed strong confidence in Bitcoin’s potential to surge, indicating that once Bitcoin breaks the $65,000 mark, it could quickly escalate to $90,000 and beyond. He observed a technical pattern known as “sideways overlapping flag type consolidation,” suggesting that Bitcoin’s consolidation phase is nearing its end and preparing for a significant price breakout. Tapiero also remarked on the unpredictability of market catalysts, stressing that the exact trigger for the anticipated surge is unclear but ultimately irrelevant. He concluded with a motivational reminder inspired by fellow investor Raoul Pal, urging followers to seize the opportunity.

Bitcoin Backers Return: Weekly Crypto Investments Bounce Back With $130 Million


								After five weeks of fleeing the digital asset market, investors are cautiously dipping their toes back in, with Bitcoin (BTC) emerging as the clear favorite. A recent report by CoinShares reveals a net inflow of $130 million into crypto investment products, marking a potential turning point after a period of sustained outflows.

US Investors Lead The Charge
The United States emerged as the primary driver of this shift, contributing the lion’s share of the inflows. This trend can be attributed, at least partially, to a slowdown in selling pressure from Grayscale, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) witnessed its lowest weekly withdrawals in five months, further bolstering investor confidence.

Hong Kong Joins The Inflow Party
While the US spearheaded the net inflow movement, Hong Kong also displayed a newfound interest in Bitcoin. Hong Kong-based Bitcoin ETFs attracted nearly $20 million, showcasing a growing regional appetite for the flagship cryptocurrency. However, these inflows paled in comparison to the dominance of Wall Street offerings, which raked in more than $130 million across various Bitcoin-focused products.

Source: Coinshares
ETP Trading Volume Hints At Investor Caution
Despite the positive news surrounding net inflows, the report also highlights a concerning trend – a significant decline in overall trading volume within Exchange Traded Products (ETPs).
Compared to last month’s $17 billion weekly average, the current volume of $8 billion suggests a more cautious approach from investors. Analysts interpret this as a sign that while some are dipping their toes back in, a large portion of investors remain on the sidelines, waiting for a clearer market picture.
Bitcoin Sentiment Rebounds, Ethereum Outflows Persist
The recent price fluctuations within the crypto market appear to have had a contrasting impact on investor sentiment towards Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Bitcoin, which witnessed a downward spiral of outflows earlier in May due to plummeting prices, seems to be regaining investor favor with the recent inflows.
BTCUSD trading at $61,880 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com
However, the story is quite different for Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency continues to experience outflows, amounting to $14 million last week.
Regulatory Uncertainty Clouds Ethereum’s Future
Analysts point towards the ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum ETFs in the US as a major factor contributing to the outflows. The SEC’s delay in approving spot Ethereum ETFs has fueled skepticism among investors, leading many to believe that regulatory approval may not materialize.
This sentiment has been further solidified by recent enforcement actions taken against Ethereum-related entities like Consensys, Uniswap, and even crypto trading platforms like Robinhood.

Light At The End Of The Regulatory Tunnel?
While the SEC’s current stance remains ambiguous, there’s a potential ray of hope on the horizon. Proposed bills and initiatives in Congress might bring much-needed clarity regarding the regulatory body that will oversee the crypto industry. A definitive framework could significantly impact future market trends and investor confidence.

Stolen Poloniex Ether worth $53M never made it back to the exchange

Over half of the $100 million worth of Ether (ETH) linked to the infamous Poloniex hack from November 2023 has been siphoned via the privacy protocol Tornado Cash.On Nov. 10, 2023, wallets belonging to crypto exchange Poloniex recorded massive unauthorized outflows. Investigations later confirmed that over $100 million worth of ETH was lost to a hack.Despite Poloniex claiming to have identified the hacker weeks later and offering a $10 million bounty, the stolen funds never made it back to the exchange.

PEPE is at All-Time High: Are Meme Coins Back? | Cryptopolitan

The entire crypto market bounced back, renewing hopes of an altcoin rally. The first and biggest movers this time were meme tokens. Riding on pure memetic energy, Pepe (PEPE) is among the big recoveries in the past day, with a nearly 20% bounce. PEPE reached record valuations, but it will probably stop there. Instead, the community sees the opportunity to enter another price discovery period with no endpoint.PEPE added another 22.95% in a single day and 25% week-on-week. The meme token traded at $0.00001036, an all-time high after recovering a 50% loss. Price moves like this are not impossible at the extremely low price range. But PEPE is more than a pumping token; it is an indicator of energy returning to the crypto market. PEPE is fully launched, with 100% of the supply in circulation. It is also one of the most traded tokens, turning over nearly half its supply in a 24-hour period. The token also finds support from its community, which is dedicated to holding, hence the ability to bounce from lows. Decentralized trading is limited for PEPE, with only less than 1% of all volume happening on Uniswap. Despite this, some PEPE has found its way into smaller DeFi protocols, bridges and lending platforms. PEPE holders may not wish to immediately sell for profit, but instead hold the token as instrumental for future growth, with an even more influential brand.Can PEPE Eat Another Zero?The recent PEPE rally showed no signs of stopping in the past day. The question remains whether PEPE is ready to eat another zero if the altcoin and meme coin boom continues. One of the big boosters for PEPE is that its community expects much more than a short-term pump. The goal is a memetic supercycle, where PEPE becomes even more prominent. In the “frogs vs dogs” war, PEPE aims to become a top 10 token, displacing ShibaInu (SHIB) and even Dogecoin (DOGE).Holders are the key to “eating a zero”, and since PEPE is accessible, it’s easy to add it to hundreds of portfolios daily. Where Does PEPE Get Its Support?PEPE seems to be running on “we are so back” energy. However, the token is supported by several factors. For one, more than 44% of all PEPE trades are concentrated in a single trading pair on Binance, which allows for a quick inflow of liquidity and significant price moves. Almost all big exchanges carry PEPE, except Coinbase spot listing. The asset is now waiting for a new pairing, which may boost volumes and exposure. However, since April 23, Coinbase has carried PEPE perpetual futures, adding to the token’s activity.PEPE has 219,625 holder wallets, of which the top stashes belong to exchanges. For now, PEPE is trading mostly on centralized markets, and is yet to expand into decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. This differentiates PEPE from newer meme tokens, which have no choice but to rely on decentralized pairs. PEPE has been added to Revolut and Crypto.com, boosting exposure even more. This led PEPE to become the third-biggest meme asset after DOGE and SHIB. After the latest rally, the token achieved the biggest 12-month returns of the top 3 meme assets. All-Time High Arrives After Roaring Kitty ReawakensThe meme token boom coincided with a Level 8 social media flareup – the return of Roaring Kitty, the legendary stock picker behind the GameStop short squeeze. While Roaring Kitty is not affiliated to any crypto coin or token, the pure enthusiasm boosted the overall market mood. Let’s not forget that PEPE remains a politically-charged token, even if it seems to ride on pure market speculation. Allegedly, the anonymous @degenharambe is the creative force behind Pepe, which emerged from the swamp of 4Chan memes. The profile may be flagged for sensitive content, which spills over into the meme coin discussion.
https://twitter.com/degenharambe/status/1653605896310734849The token’s price action may thus be completely tied to obscure memes, while carrying a strong anti-corporate ethos.

What Chainlink's rising development activity means for LINK - AMBCrypto



Development activity on Chainlink increased materially in the last few days.
Price of LINK continued to fall as network growth declined.

Chainlink [LINK] has been one of the most prominent infrastructure protocols in the crypto space for quite some time.
One reason for the same would be the rising development activity on the Chainlink network.
A spike in activity
Recent data revealed that Chainlink is at the forefront of GitHub activity in the Real World Assets (RWA) sector, underscoring its dedication to pioneering blockchain solutions for real-world assets.
The surge in development activity for Chainlink could help the protocol improve upon its products and offerings. This, in turn, could improve sentiment towards the network and attract more users.
Source: X
However, overall activity on the network had declined significantly.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Token Terminal’s data revealed that the number of active daily users on the network fell by 66% over the past month.
Coupled with that, the revenue generated by Chainlink dimished by a whopping 90%.
Source: Token Terminal
The price of LINK wasn’t doing that well either. Since the 26th of March, the price of LINK began to see its downfall.
It plummeted from the $20.737 price and began to indicate lower lows and lower highs, which are signs of a bearish trend.
There was no sign of significant positive price action in all of April or May, as LINK’s price failed to push past the $16.041 mark.
LINK would need to test this level multiple times and weaken the resistance before it could possibly aim at a price reversal in the future.
The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) showcased a negative picture as well, as it had declined to -0.13. A falling CMF indicated that the money flowing into LINK had declined materially in the last few days.
Moreover, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) for LINK had also fallen to 42.06 implying that the bullish momentum around the LINK token had waned.

Chainlink’s Network Growth had also declined materially over the last few days, implying that new addresses were losing interest in the token. This could further increase selling pressure.
However, the velocity around LINK continued to surge, which meant that the frequency of LINK trades had grown significantly high over the last few days.

No Ties To OpenAI: Worldcoin Drops 9% As Top Trader Warns


																Worldcoin (WLD) has seen its value plummet by nearly 9% in just 24 hours, with the price settling at around $5.20. This decline aligns with a critical analysis issued by DeFi^2 (@DefiSquared), the current top trader on the crypt exchange Bybit, who has raised concerns about the potential for substantial inflationary pressures and misleading marketing associated with Worldcoin.
Notably, the WLD plunge comes just after OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, announced on Monday its plans to unveil a cutting-edge AI model named GPT-4o. This advanced model boasts the ability to engage in lifelike voice conversations and seamlessly interact across text and images. Worldcoin is usually a beneficiary of OpenAI announcements, but this time WLD price plunged.
Why Worldcoin Is Plummeting
In his analysis shared on X, DeFi^2 expounded on the mechanics behind the rapid devaluation of Worldcoin, emphasizing that the token is suffering from significant daily depreciation due to both emissions and strategic sales maneuvers by the Worldcoin Foundation.
Specifically, the token’s value is deteriorating at a rate of 0.6% each day, driven by the emissions related to grant and operator claims. These tokens, as per DeFi^2’s observation of on-chain analytics, are predominantly sold off almost immediately upon issuance, adding to the downward pressure on Worldcoin’s price.

	Related Reading



Adding to the supply concerns, the Worldcoin Foundation recently declared its intention to offload $200 million worth of Worldcoin to trading firms. This move will effectively increase the circulating supply by an additional 18%. DeFi^2 criticized this decision, pointing out that the tokens, misleadingly attributed to a “Community” allocation, are being sold at a discount to entities that may not prioritize the broader community’s interests, potentially diluting the value for existing holders.
The most critical issue highlighted by DeFi^2, however, pertains to the near future, when unlocks for venture capital and team-related tokens are set to begin. He forecasts that in just 70 days, the supply of Worldcoin will start to inflate at an alarming rate of 4% per day due to these unlocks combined with ongoing emissions. This scenario could unleash nearly $50 million worth of sell pressure daily, profoundly impacting the token’s market price and stability.
DeFi^2’s analysis did not shy away from addressing the perceived misconceptions surrounding Worldcoin’s affiliation with notable tech personalities and organizations. He clarified that Sam Altman, known for his role with OpenAI, has no active involvement with Worldcoin, which operates as a completely separate entity. This point addresses a common misconception that potentially misled investors about the nature and backing of the token.

	Related Reading



Moreover, DeFi^2 drew parallels between Worldcoin’s tokenomics and what he describes as “predatory” economic models that are engineered to disproportionately benefit early investors and insiders at the expense of general retail investors. He noted that similar strategies had been used in the past in the crypto industry, where the manipulation of token supply and market conditions facilitated significant gains for insiders while leaving regular investors exposed to heightened risks and losses.
“Worldcoin realistically might become the greatest transfer of wealth of this entire cycle. Unfortunately, this wealth transfer isn’t in the form of universal basic income as their mission suggests, but instead to the pockets of the team and insiders,” DeFi^2 stated. He added that “the manipulative low float / high FDV design is straight out of the SBF playbook, and directly enriches insiders as they hedge their locked allocations at high valuations pre-unlock via perps / OTC; yet retail somehow sadly still think they’re beating the system trying to push the price up.”
As the crypto community digests DeFi^2’s stark warnings, the immediate reaction has been a surge in trading activity to $666 million (up 104% in the last 24 hours), with investors and speculators likely reassessing their positions in Worldcoin in light of these revelations. At press time, WLD traded at $5.24.

< p >The Hedge Fund Bracebridge Capital invests in Bitcoin ETFs< /p >

Bracebridge Capital, a renowned hedge fund, has made a significant entry into the cryptocurrency market, as revealed by its latest investment documents: it has declared to own $262 million of ARK’s Bitcoin spot ETFs and another $81 million of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs. 
This strategic move underlines the growing acceptance of digital assets among traditional financial institutions and highlights the evolving landscape of investment strategies.

The hedge fund Bracebridge Capital and the investment in Bitcoin ETFs
Bracebridge Capital, known for its conservative approach to investments and focus on fixed income strategies, has surprised many with its substantial investments in Bitcoin ETFs. 
The decision of the hedge fund to allocate a significant portion of its portfolio to Bitcoin ETFs represents a change in its investment philosophy, reflecting the broader trend towards institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.
ARK Invest, led by influential investor Cathie Wood, has been a vocal supporter of disruptive technologies, including cryptocurrencies. 
The ARK Bitcoin spot ETF aims to provide investors with direct exposure to Bitcoin, bypassing the complexities of managing the underlying assets. 
The $262 million investment by Bracebridge Capital in ARK’s Bitcoin ETF signifies a strong confidence in ARK’s ability to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market and offer substantial returns.
Cathie Wood’s reputation for identifying high-growth investment opportunities likely played a crucial role in Bracebridge’s decision. 
ARK Invest has a successful track record with innovative technologies and disruptive industries, which likely reassured Bracebridge Capital about the potential of Bitcoin and the robustness of ARK’s ETF management.

From BlackRock to Ark: implications for the crypto market
In addition to the substantial investment in ARK’s Bitcoin ETF, Bracebridge Capital has also declared an $81 million stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF.
 BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has a significant influence on global financial markets. Its entry into the Bitcoin ETF sector adds credibility and legitimacy to cryptocurrency investments.
The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is designed to offer institutional investors a safe and regulated opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The support of a giant like BlackRock provides a sense of security and stability, making it an attractive option for institutional investors like Bracebridge Capital. 
The $81 million investment indicates Bracebridge’s strategy to diversify its holdings in cryptocurrencies by leveraging the strengths of various ETF providers.
The substantial investments by Bracebridge Capital in ARK and BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs reflect a broader trend towards institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. This move is indicative of the growing confidence among traditional financial institutions in the long-term potential of digital assets. 
With more hedge funds and asset managers allocating resources to cryptocurrencies, the market is likely to experience increased liquidity and reduced volatility, making it more attractive to a wider range of investors.
Furthermore, the involvement of reputable companies such as ARK Invest and BlackRock provides a layer of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency market, potentially encouraging regulatory authorities to create more favorable frameworks for cryptocurrency investments. 
This could lead to a more robust and secure investment environment, fostering further growth and innovation in the sector.
Risks, Opportunities and conclusions
While Bracebridge Capital’s substantial investments highlight opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, they also underscore the inherent risks. Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, and the regulatory landscape remains uncertain in many jurisdictions. 
However, the strategic decision of a conservative hedge fund like Bracebridge to heavily invest in Bitcoin ETFs suggests that the potential gains are considered higher than the risks.
Investors should note that Bracebridge Capital’s move could inspire other institutional players to do the same, potentially increasing demand for Bitcoin ETFs and cryptocurrencies in general. 
This could lead to a virtuous cycle, where increased investments drive up prices, attracting more investors and further fueling the market.
The $343 million investment by Bracebridge Capital in ARK and BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs marks a significant milestone in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. 
This bold move not only highlights the evolving investment strategies of traditional financial institutions, but also underscores the growing legitimacy and potential of digital assets. 
With more hedge funds and asset managers recognizing the value of cryptocurrencies, the market is poised for substantial growth and maturation, paving the way for a new era of financial innovation.

Canada: The Bank of Montreal announces the purchase of Bitcoin ETFs

In a significant development for the cryptocurrency market in Canada, the Bank of Montreal, the country’s fourth largest bank by assets, has disclosed its holdings in a Bitcoin spot ETF. 
This move marks a crucial moment for the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial services in Canada and highlights the growing acceptance of digital assets among traditional financial institutions.

The Bank of Montreal’s ETF holdings in Bitcoin spot in Canada
The Bank of Montreal, known for its conservative approach in the banking and investment sector, has historically maintained a cautious position on the volatile cryptocurrency sector.
However, the recent revelation indicates a strategic change, recognizing the potential and demand for cryptocurrency-related products among its customers. 
Embracing a Bitcoin spot ETF, Bank of Montreal offers its investors a regulated and potentially safer opportunity to invest in Bitcoin, directly influencing the perception and valuation of digital assets.
An ETF Bitcoin spot differs from other financial products related to Bitcoin in that it involves the actual purchase of Bitcoin, rather than derivatives or futures. 
This means that the ETF directly holds Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the real-time price of Bitcoin without the complexities and risks of managing and storing digital currencies.
For traditional investors, this is a key attraction as it mitigates the risks associated with security of digital wallets, attacks on exchanges, and other operational risks involved in cryptocurrency trading.
The decision of the Bank of Montreal to list its holdings in this ETF could be seen as a response to the growing interest of investors and the increasing legitimization of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. 
In recent years, institutional interest in cryptocurrencies has increased, with numerous global banks, hedge funds, and financial institutions exploring or already investing in this sector. 
The move by the Bank of Montreal is therefore significant not only for the bank itself, but also for the broader financial landscape, signaling a possible trend towards a wider adoption of cryptocurrencies by major financial players.
The regulatory discussions of the issue 
The announcement has also sparked discussions on regulatory frameworks and the future of investments in cryptocurrencies.
In Canada, regulatory bodies have adopted a relatively progressive approach towards cryptocurrencies, facilitating a supportive environment for innovations such as the Bitcoin spot ETF.
This regulatory framework is crucial, as it provides a level of security and trust for institutions and their clients, promoting a more inclusive approach to integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional financial portfolios.
Furthermore, the disclosure of holdings in a Bitcoin spot ETF by the Bank of Montreal could encourage other institutions to follow suit. 
As more banks and financial institutions begin to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their offerings, we may see an increase in the development of similar products, further improving liquidity and stability in the cryptocurrency markets. 
This, in turn, could lead to more robust investment strategies, diversified portfolios, and a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in various sectors of the economy.
Investors’ reactions to Bank of Montreal’s move have been largely positive, with many seeing it as a prudent step towards diversification and innovation in banking services. 
While some remain skeptical about the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, the controlled and regulated environment of an ETF provides a more familiar and secure framework for traditional investors to explore this new asset class.
Conclusions 
In conclusion, the decision of the Bank of Montreal to disclose its holdings in a Bitcoin spot ETF represents a significant development in the cryptocurrency landscape in Canada. 
It demonstrates not only the adaptive strategies of the bank in the face of evolving financial technologies, but also signals a broader shift in the acceptance and integration of digital assets in the traditional financial sector. 
As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the role of traditional banks like the Bank of Montreal will be crucial in shaping the future of investments in digital assets, potentially leading to greater stability and wider adoption of cryptocurrencies in general.

Coinbase Reports Widespread Outage, Confirms Ongoing Investigation


							

Coinbase is experiencing a widespread system outage.



The Coinbase team is investigating the issue and working on a solution.



The crypto exchange assured users that their funds were safe.




Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., is experiencing a widespread system outage. A post from Coinbase Support on X in the early hours of Tuesday stated that the crypto exchange is investigating the issue and working on a solution. The team further assured users that their funds were safe while they worked to resolve the problem. 







The outage interrupted trading activities on both the Coinbase website and app. As of the time of writing, attempting to access the crypto exchange’s website returned a 503 error message, showing the problem persisted. 



Meanwhile, Coinbase users have expressed frustration over the issue, with some taking to the social media platform X to communicate their inability to carry out operations. A user responding to Coinbase’s post shared a screenshot of a message he received trying to access the Coinbase app. The message on the shared screenshot read – “Planned maintenance in progress.”









Apart from the initial message from the Coinbase Support team, the crypto exchange had yet to state the reason for the outage as of the time of filing this report. The crypto exchange’s position remained the same as its original message of investigating the situation.



Coinbase experienced a similar outage in March this year. However, the firm later found the reason behind the March incident was heavy trading activities on the platform.

El Salvador news: the strategy of buying "one bitcoin a day"

Among the latest news on El Salvador, the new reality visible to the world stands out: the website where you can track the Country’s Bitcoin Treasury. In fact, by doing so, the strategy implemented by the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, to “buy a bitcoin a day” is now in front of everyone’s eyes. 

El Salvador news: Nayib Bukele’s strategy of “buying one bitcoin a day” is visible to everyone
Yesterday, the new online platform of El Salvador was announced, providing public access to data on the country’s BTC investments through a custom mempool.
Basically, through the website, anyone can track the Bitcoin Treasury of El Salvador.
On this subject, it is possible to verify the famous strategy implemented by President Nayib Bukele already in November 2022: “buying one bitcoin a day until BTC becomes inaccessible with fiat currencies”.
And so, while yesterday the total capital owned by El Salvador was 5,748.76 BTC, today, the total on the website is instead 5,749.76 BTC. The daily Bitcoin was therefore purchased by the country and verified on its portal.
Nayib Bukele also shared the news on his X profile, currently followed by 6.1 million followers

“El Salvador bought another #Bitcoin today. President Bukele said they will buy 1 #BTC every day ‘until Bitcoin becomes inaccessible with fiat currencies’.”
El Salvador news: the first Bitcoin-based capital raise airing on Bitfinex
Another novelty for the country that made Bitcoin legal tender in 2014, shared by Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether and CTO of Bitfinex. 

“The next phase of El Salvador’s Bitcoin economy development is coming tomorrow. Disintermediating traditional finance and making capital and investments available to everyone. Watch @bfxsecurities”
Tomorrow marks the beginning of a new era in capital markets based on bitcoin. El Salvador’s first capital raise on @Liquid_BTC will be broadcast on @BFXSecurities
Basically, on Bitfinex Securities, a government company of the iFinex group, the first capital raise of El Salvador will soon be available, with the issuance of new tokens powered by Liquid Network, the Bitcoin sidechain. 
The project refers to the new debt tokens in “Volcano Bond” style, which will be used to raise the capital needed to build a large hotel complex near the international airport of the South American country.
The structure is called Hampton by Hilton and covers 4,484 square meters on five levels. The new debt token is called HILSV, and aims to raise 6.25 million dollars with a 10% premium and a duration of 5 years with a minimum investment of $1000. 
The construction of the hotel financed with HILSV will seek to ensure a significant flow of tourists to El Salvador, as well as the creation of about 6000 jobs. At the same time, the formula behind HILSV will allow small investors to be part of this investment, breaking down barriers to microcredit. 
The price of BTC
Meanwhile, the price of BTC continues to fluctuate around $62,000. In the last week, in fact, BTC has reached price lows of $60,300 and highs of $64,200. 
In the last 24 hours, the trading volume of the queen of crypto has increased by 60%. 
While its market cap remains at $1.220 billion, slightly higher than a week ago.

Ripple Chief Executive Defends Statement on Tether


							

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino called Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse an “uninformed CEO.”



Ripple’s CEO recently said that the US authorities are coming after USDT.



Garlinghouse noted that he wasn’t attacking Tether.




Tether chief executive Paolo Ardoino recently took to social media platform X to highlight the statement on USDT given by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in an interview, calling him an “uninformed CEO.”



As reported earlier, Garlinghouse said in an interview that the US authorities are targeting USDT and seeking to crackdown on the stablecoin, while adding that he cannot predict the impact that this would have on the digital asset sector. 









Ardoino stated in a post on X that Garlinghouse is “spreading fear” about USDT and emphasizing that his firm seeks to roll out a competitive stablecoin. He also noted that USDT has “proved overtime to have strong price stability, highly liquid reserves, top tier custodians and profound compliance.”



Garlinghouse replied to the post by Ardoino, clarifying his statement, stating that Tether is indeed a very important part of the digital asset ecosystem, and noting:




“I wasn’t attacking Tether…the next words out of my mouth during the podcast were that I view Tether as a hugely important part of the ecosystem”




The Ripple executive claimed that his “point was that the US govt has clearly indicated they want more control over USD-backed stablecoin issuers, and thus, Tether, as the largest player, is in their line of sight.”



On the other hand, Tether has been planning expansion beyond the stablecoin business, recently announcing four new divisions.

Official: the Swiss bank UBS has bought Bitcoin ETFs

Yesterday, the Swiss bank UBS presented an updated form 13F-HR to the US SEC. 
Inside the document all the assets owned by UBS Group AG at the end of the first quarter of the year (March 31, 2024) are listed, and among these is also the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). 
IBIT is the BlackRock’s ETF on Bitcoin spot, and iShares is the subsidiary of BlackRock that issues and manages the ETFs. 

Swiss bank UBS and the purchase of Bitcoin spot ETF
UBS is the largest Swiss banking institution and the largest private bank in the world. 
The UBS brand was born in 1912 as “Union Bank of Switzerland”, but the two banks that merged to create UBS already existed in 1862-1863. 
It is therefore a decidedly old banking group, although not extremely ancient. 
In 1997 UBS merged with SBS (Swiss Bank Corporation), and since at the time they were respectively the second and third largest banks in Switzerland, they gave rise to the largest banking group in Switzerland, UBS AG. Since then, UBS no longer stands for Union Bank of Switzerland. 
With that merger, the “New UBS” became the second largest combined bank in the world, behind only the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. 
In the early 2000s, the process of internationalization began, leading UBS to become a global banking group, no longer just Swiss. The headquarters are still in Zurich, but now it operates worldwide. 
Last year UBS agreed to acquire Credit Suisse, one of its main competitors, due to the risk of the latter’s bankruptcy. 
Overall, the UBS group has more than 115,000 employees worldwide, and manages a total wealth of over $5.7 trillion. 
It is a publicly traded company without a single majority shareholder, and among the largest shareholders are GIC Private Limited with 7.07%, BlackRock Inc with 4.98%, Norges Bank with 3.30%, MFS Investment Management with 3.05%, and Capital Group Companies with 3.01% of the total share capital. 
The purchase of Bitcoin ETF shares by the Swiss bank UBS
In light of this, it is not surprising that UBS has chosen BlackRock’s ETF to take a position on the price of Bitcoin. 
Note that he declares that as of March 31st he owned 3,600 shares of IBIT, with a total value of only $146,000, purchased at around $40.5 per share. 
As of today, the price of IBIT shares has dropped to $36, so the purchase was made by UBS when the price of Bitcoin was above $68,000. 
His 3,600 IBIT shares are currently worth less than $130,000, so for now UBS is at a loss of almost $16,000 with this investment. 
However, it cannot be ruled out that since March 31st the Swiss bank may have decided to make other similar purchases, also because the $146,000 invested correspond to less than 0.001% of the total value of the assets it has declared to own in the 13F-HR form submitted to the SEC. 
BlackRock’s ETF
The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) currently owns just under 275,000 BTC, more than those owned by MicroStrategy, but less than those still owned by the Grayscale ETF. 
Altogether, it has issued 482 million shares, whose price during the first months of the year has risen from the initial $30 to a maximum of almost $42 in mid-March. 
So UBS bought them when they were near their highs, even though the purchase was extremely small for a Swiss bank. 
Subsequently the price has dropped, and now since the end of April it has been moving sideways within a range between $33 and $36. 
UBS Stocks
UBS Group AG is listed on the stock exchange in New York. 
Yesterday, upon the news of his investment in Bitcoin, the price did not move significantly, also because the exposure to IBIT is really minimal. 
The closing price of yesterday’s session, $29.7, is practically the same as Friday’s closing price. 
During 2024, the price of UBS shares first rose to $32, then in April it dropped to $26 on May 1st, and then it recovered. 
It should be remembered that during 2023 it had risen significantly, even after the acquisition of the almost failed Credit Suisse. 
Indeed, after starting the year at $19, it closed at almost $31, with an increase of 63%. 
Actually, the maximum price of UBS stocks on the stock market since the 2008 crisis was reached earlier this year in mid-March, when they exceeded $32 for the first time in almost twenty years. 
Instead, the all-time high remains at $66 in April 2007, before the subprime mortgage crisis broke out. 
UBS and Bitcoin
It is worth noting that at the end of January, UBS published on its official website an article explicitly discussing the new ETFs on Bitcoin spot. 
So his interest in these products started a few weeks before the moment they decided to purchase them. 
In that article, written by the UBS editorial team, they stated that the Bitcoin spot ETFs had “finally” arrived, already indicating a clear interest in them. 
After all, for financial institutions of this importance it could be counterproductive to buy BTC on crypto exchanges, because then they would be forced to make it public. The risk is that they end up damaging their image. 
Instead, buying shares of an ETF issued by BlackRock does not risk compromising the image of such a financial institution at all, especially if the exposure is extremely limited. 
At this point, given that the market reaction has not seemed negative at all, it is possible that they decide to continue down this path and maybe buy more IBIT shares, especially now that their price has dropped.

CFTC Urges Caution Amid Rising Money Mule Scams

                        The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is warning against “money mule” scams targeting remote job seekers.On Monday, the regulator said people seeking work-from-home opportunities should be on the lookout for these deceptive schemes.According to Melanie Devoe, director at the Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO), summer job seekers, drawn to part-time online work, could be especially vulnerable to scams. However, they end up risking jail time as unwitting money mules for criminals, she said.Work-From-Home Scam Turns into Money Laundering Nightmare
Criminal organizations are actively recruiting networks of people to launder money, according to the CFTC. They move illegal funds between bank accounts, converting currencies, and using blockchains to avoid law enforcement detection.The criminals often target unsuspecting people who might not realize they’re involved in a crime. These victims may believe they’re helping a friend, a romantic interest, or simply fulfilling work duties. However, both willing and unwitting participants face the same consequences, which can include criminal charges.The CFTC cracked down on money mule activity in two recent cases. In one instance, the CFTC accused Debiex of using well-known romance scam tactics to steal $2.3m in customer funds meant for digital asset trading.Another enforcement action involved a California man and his company. They were charged with running a complex romance scam, also known as a “pig butchering scheme” that defrauded dozens of investors for over $1m.Protect Yourself from Crypto Money Laundering with These Red Flags
The CFTC warned potential victims to be wary of two main red flags: “off-ramping” and “on-ramping” crypto-assets. With off-ramping, criminals might send you crypto and ask you to convert it to dollars, moving the cash through your bank account to another, essentially laundering their money.On the other hand, on-ramping could involve criminals giving you cash to buy crypto (like at a bitcoin kiosk) and then forwarding it to another walle, again, using you to get their money into the crypto system. A third tactic, “smurfing,” involves receiving a large amount of crypto yourself, which could raise suspicion.

Twitter: Roaring Kitty wakes up GameStop (GME) stocks

Roaring Kitty, the man who led the ‘meme stock mania’ of 2021, is back after 3 years with a post on X (formerly Twitter). On the same day, GameStop’s shares increased by over 74.4%, shaking the market. 

Roaring Kitty: his return on Twitter after 3 years makes GameStop shares soar by +70%
Back on everyone’s lips, it’s the great return of Roaring Kitty, the man of the ‘meme stock mania of 2021’, who with a new post on X (formerly Twitter), has once again shaken the market. 
First of all, GameStop’s shares recorded an increase of +74.4% after a surge of 110%. 
His first post is an image on X of a video gamer leaning forward on the chair, as if to indicate that he is taking the game seriously. The tweet marked Roaring Kitty’s first post on the platform, but also on Reddit, since 2021. The post has gathered 63,000 likes in 13 hours.

Below I tweet, they are all preview videos of some popular movies, up to the most recent one, where Roaring Kitty blatantly asked the audience if they got his attention. 

Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, is a former marketer at Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. Also known as DeepF——Value on Reddit, Gill has attracted an army of day traders who have encouraged each other and invested in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer’s stock and call options of GameStop between 2020 and 2021.
Roaring Kitty: the return on Twitter of the man behind the meme stock mania of 2021 and GameStop’s actions
The new post by Roaring Kitty claims his return, shaking up the market and investors. 
Not only that, on X there are several videos that even recall Gill’s testimony in 2021, in the face of a class action lawsuit against him. Here, in the video below, Roaring Kitty pretended to be a novice trader despite being a licensed professional.

“GameStop’s shares explode as ‘Roaring Kitty’ returns on X in his first post since June 18, 2021. Short sellers have suffered a mark-to-market loss of ~1 billion dollars, while today GME is up over 70%. (CNBC). ‘Roaring Kitty’ went viral in 2021 for sparking the ‘meme stock frenzy’ by waging war against institutional investors betting against GameStop. Last night he posted a photo on X with a man leaning forward in his gaming chair, bringing attention back to the meme stock. The video below shows Roaring Kitty’s testimony on GameStop in 2021.”
Not only that, also a Robinhood user had filed a class action lawsuit in 2021 against Roaring Kitty, after the decision of the application to limit GameStop trading on its platform. 
According to the market research platform Quiver Quantitative, on Monday GameStop was the most discussed stock on WallStreetBets on Reddit, with over 600 mentions in the last 24 hours, surpassing the popular chipmaker Nvidia.
Are meme stocks back? The case described by Georgetown University
The case of GameStop and its stocks that, in 2021 had turned finance into a meme, had become a case study at Georgetown University.
Specifically, GameStop had shocked the world of stock markets, as a company in deep crisis, unable to react to technological innovation, saw its investors turn it into a “meme stock”. 
Basically, on one side some hedge funds were ready to short sell GME stocks, a group of retail investors who had noticed this intention, found themselves on a Reddit forum, WallStreetBets, discussing and making mass decisions. 
And indeed, it was precisely in mass that retail investors bought GameStop shares, triggering the short squeeze. Consequently, the price grew disproportionately and hedge funds accumulated losses of billions of dollars in just a few hours, as they were selling shares that were increasing in value. 
Georgetown University has defined this game on GameStop’s actions as a “gigantic joke”, a meme that makes the web laugh, a behavior imitated by big investors. 
The problem is that big investors were the ones ending up under the meme stock’s attack.

Bitcoin exits post-halving dip, signals accumulation phase, suggests analyst - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin (BTC) may have exited the post-halving “danger zone” and entered the accumulation phase, according to data shared by technical analyst Rekt Capital. He suggests that the selling pressure behind Bitcoin’s price is weakening.Following the halving event, Bitcoin typically experiences a “danger zone” characterized by heightened volatility. In the 2016 cycle, Bitcoin’s value dropped nearly 18% in the three weeks that followed.This specific downturn came back in this halving cycle, albeit with a mild 6.5% decline over the same period. However, this was briefly followed by a 15% surge, suggesting a strong exit from the “danger zone”.At the time of reporting, Bitcoin is trading at nearly $62,600, marking a 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Rekt Capital notes that the $60,000 support level is crucial for the continuation of this upward trend, potentially leading to a return to the $68,000 mark.“History suggests it means that Bitcoin will no longer produce downside volatility below its current Re-Accumulation Range,” Rekt Capital explained in his recent blog post. “The Bitcoin correction should be over and price should be able to maintain itself above $60,000 going forward.”While historical trends do not guarantee future results, the current support level’s resilience is a positive sign for Bitcoin’s trajectory.What to expect next?A major focus this week will be the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), which will be released on Wednesday. Forecasts for the CPI and core CPI are 3.4% and 3.6%, respectively.The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) target is 2% and current data shows inflation remains stubborn. Rates might stay high for a longer period unless inflation improves.According to BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, rising government debt and adjustments by the Fed and US Treasury are making alternative investments like Bitcoin more appealing. He predicts that Bitcoin’s price will exceed $60,000 and move to a period of relative stability between $60,000 and $70,000 by August.The upcoming US presidential election could also influence Bitcoin’s value, according to Standard Chartered. The bank believes a potential win for Donald Trump could benefit Bitcoin’s value. Additionally, the US’s fiscal and monetary policy shift is seen as potentially favorable for Bitcoin.Standard Chartered expects BTC’s price to reach $150,000 by year’s end and $200,000 by 2025.

Toncoin Outshines Bitcoin With Price Surge And Social Buzz


																The native token of the Telegram-connected Open Network, Toncoin (TON), has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) despite the recent market turbulence. Bitcoin fell by 3% over the last week, while TON increased by nearly 20%. Within the cryptocurrency world, this unexpected outperformance has set off a wild speculating frenzy. Will TON’s rapid ascent continue, or is this merely a passing blip?

	Related Reading



Social Buzz Fuels The Toncoin Engine
One key factor behind TON’s recent success appears to be a surge in social media activity. Social volume, a metric that tracks discussions and mentions on platforms like Twitter and Telegram, has skyrocketed by over 20% compared to the previous week. This suggests a growing interest in TON, potentially attracting new investors and driving up the price.

Investor Sentiment: A Mixed Bag For TON
However, a closer look reveals a potential wrinkle in this optimistic outlook. While the overall sentiment surrounding TON has been positive, it has recently dipped into negative territory. This could be a sign of growing investor apprehension, as some may be worried about the sustainability of the current price rally.

Accumulation Signals: Are Investors Betting Big On Toncoin?
On the other hand, some metrics point towards potential long-term bullishness. The mean dollar invested age, an indicator of how long tokens have been held, has been gradually increasing. This suggests that investors are holding onto their TON, potentially with an eye on future gains.
Additionally, the dormant circulation, representing tokens that haven’t been moved in a while, has remained low. While a previous spike coincided with a price peak, the current stability could indicate a more strategic accumulation by investors.

Technical Analysis: Eyes On The Prize For Toncoin
Technical analysts, who study price charts and historical data to predict future movements, are also cautiously optimistic about TON. Fibonacci retracement levels, a popular technical tool, suggest the recent downtrend may be nearing its end. This could pave the way for TON to climb towards targets near $10, with potential profit-taking opportunities for investors.

A Marathon, Not A Sprint
While the recent surge in price and social media buzz paints a promising picture for TON, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile.
The current uptrend for TON could be the beginning of a long-term ascent, fueled by growing adoption and a thriving ecosystem within the Telegram network. However, it’s also possible that this is just a short-lived rally, followed by a correction.

How GameStop helped Dogecoin, WIF rise 10% as memecoins surge 170% - AMBCrypto



The value of the meme coin market has skyrocketed in the past 24 hours. 
DOGE and WIF have logged double-digit price rallies during that period. 

The meme market has witnessed significant growth in trading activity in the past 24 hours after GameStop stock trader Keith Gill posted on his Roaring Kitty X account for the first time since 2021. 


The image of a man holding a controller and sitting focused on a chair caused GameStop’s stock to surge by more than 100% in the 24 hours that followed. 
By noon on the 13th of May, trading of the stock had been halted several times to curb market volatility. 
The rally in GameStop’s stock led to increased activity in the meme coin market. 
According to CoinMarketCap’s data, in the last 24 hours, trading volume in that market totaled $8 billion, having grown by over 170%. 
The sector’s market capitalization also increased by 10% during the same period. 
DOGE and WIF head in different directions
In the last 24 hours, the values of leading meme assets Dogecoin [DOGE] and dogwifhat [WIF] have grown by double digits. While DOGE has seen a 10% price rally, WIF’s value has climbed by 11%.
As of this writing, DOGE traded at $0.15. Its double-digit rally in the past 24 hours caused its price to bounce off support at $0.14 as the bulls attempt to reclaim the resistance price level of $0.16. 
However, for this to happen, demand for the meme coin has to be sustained. 
Readings from the coin’s key momentum indicators observed on a one-day chart showed that DOGE’s market was yet to be flush with demand.
At press time, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 49.84, below the 50-neutral spot. Likewise, its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures the flow of money into and out of the asset, was at its zero line. 
The values of these indicators showed that despite the price hike in the past 24 hours, market participants’ demand for DOGE had yet to exceed its distribution.

On the other hand, WIF fared considerably better. As of this writing, its key momentum indicators rested above their respective center lines. 
Its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 66.61, while its RSI was in an uptrend at 52.68. These values signaled that the meme coin’s accumulation was beginning to gain momentum. 
Further, WIF’s 11% gains in the past 24 hours have pushed its price above the 20-day simple moving average (SMA).

When an asset’s price rallies above this moving average, it signals the beginning of a bullish trend in the short to medium term.
 It often means that buyers have regained control, and the asset’s price is trending upwards.

This DeFi Platform Announced Season 1 of Airdrop Campaign


The decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Okto has announced the launch of Season 1 of its Okto Wallet points program, along with a strategic airdrop of its native OKTO tokens. 
This initiative promises to reward users for their on-chain activities.
Okto Airdrops 7% of Its Tokens to Users
In an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, Neeraj Khandelwal, the co-founder of Okto, said that all existing self-custody wallets equipped with the Okto Wallet application have received bonus Okto points. The company has set an initial drop of 20 million points for all the eligible on-chain traders.
This points program extends to all on-chain activities on the Okto Wallet app. Activities include depositing crypto, buying and selling tokens, placing futures trades, and participating in various airdrop quests. 
This initiative incentivizes users to engage more deeply with the platform’s offerings.

Users transferring their assets from other centralized exchanges to Okto Wallet can earn bonus points. The platform has planned a reward of 1.5x bonus points for high-volume traders on their first $1 million in futures volume.

Through the points program, the airdrop campaign allocates 7% of the OKTO tokens to early users. According to the whitepaper, the OKTO token would power the OKTO chain and play a crucial role in network operations. However, the team has not yet released the total supply and complete allocation details.


“Details about total supply and allocation of the remaining 93% will be detailed in next version of our whitepaper,” Khandelwal told BeInCrypto.

Recently, the crypto community has scrutinized the fairness of token distributions. EigenLayer airdrop faced backlash for its changing eligibility criteria and regional restrictions. Large allocation to the project’s investors was also a concern. 
In response to such concerns, Khandelwal reassured that Okto is committed to ensuring a level playing field. Furthermore, the platform says that it has implemented strong sybil checks and partnered with leading anti-sybil establishments to prevent fraudulent activities.
In addition, Okto is also advancing its technological infrastructure by developing a fully expressive orchestration layer.

“The Okto infra does the heavy lifting of abstracting Web3 complexities and orchestrating end-to-end delegated and secure transactions,” Khandelwal explained.

These Meme Coins Explode Daily as Bitcoin Faces Enhanced Volatility (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price soared by over two grand yesterday but was pushed back down today amid system issues coming from the largest US crypto exchange, Coinbase.
At the same time, several altcoins have taken the main stage with impressive gains, but none more notable than Pepe.
BTC’s Pump and Dump
It was just over a week ago – last Monday – when bitcoin jumped to a multi-week peak of $65,500 but the bears quickly intercepted the move and drove it south. The correction culminated on Friday with a price drop that pushed BTC all the way down to $60,200.
As most were preparing for another leg down that can see the cryptocurrency losing the coveted $60,000 level, the asset actually reversed its trajectory and reclaimed some value during the weekend to around $61,000.
This Monday began on a more positive note as BTC jumped from $60,800 to $63,500 in just a few hours. However, it failed to maintain its run and retraced to just under $63,000.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


The landscape worsened earlier this morning when Coinbase reported some issues with its network. Bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop that drove it to $61,400.
Despite recovering some ground since then, BTC is still below $62,000. Its market cap has declined to $1.220 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 51.1%.

PEPE Leads the Way
Meme coins have become the main talking point once again in the cryptocurrency industry, with numerous impressive price pumps over the past day. PEPE is the leader of the larger-cap meme tokens, having gained over 20% in the past day. Moreover, the asset charted a new all-time high earlier today.
Floki (10%), Dogecoin (4%), and WIF (3%) follow suit from this cohort of crypto assets. In contrast, most other alts are in the red, with ETF solidifying its place below $3,000 after a 2% drop and BNB down beneath $590.
The total crypto market cap has slumped beneath $2.4 trillion after losing $40 billion in a day.

Will GameStop Pump Trigger Crypto Market Rally Similar to 2021? Is Meme Coin Mania Back? | Coinspeaker



The GameStop rally triggered a massive surge in the meme coin market with DOGE and SHIB gaining 10%, and other meme coins jumping by 34%.

Three years after GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) stock stormed Wall Street, the stock is back in action once again. On Monday, May 13, GameStop stock rallied by a staggering 75% in a single day closing the day at $30.45. Interestingly, the GME stock has rallied by an additional 21% in the aftermarket hours trading.
This surge on Wall Street led to an even stronger rally in the Solana-based meme coin GameStop ($GME). In the last 36 hours, the GameStop meme coin price has surged by a staggering 1800%, leading to a strong rally across the meme coin sector.




These developments have led everyone to think about whether we are going to see a GameStop 2.0 rally soon. Keith Gill, often lauded as the catalyst behind the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, vanished from social media on June 19, 2021.
However, after an almost three-year absence, he resurfaced on May 13, sharing a cryptic meme featuring a gamer sitting up in their chair to signify his return. Within 24 hours of Gill’s reappearance on X, GameStop shares surged by up to 111%. Roaring Kitty ($ROAR), the cryptocurrency devised after Keith Gill, also saw a 4,100% rally in the last 24 hours.
This massive rally in the GameStop stock on Monday led to over $1 billion in losses for short sellers, as per data from S3 Partners. They further noted that the 74% rally in the GME stock led to a mark-to-market loss of $838 million for the short-selling hedge funds. Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 managing director of predictive analytics, told CNBC:

“Expect short covering in this stock as it already had a 100/100 squeeze score prior to today’s trading.”

Meme Coin Party KickStarts
Several market analysts believe that GameStop short squeeze served as a catalyst for a massive surge across the entire meme coin sector. The top two meme coins – Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) – rallied by 10% in the last 24 hours. Other meme coins have delivered even higher gains.
The GameStop surge by 74% on Monday spurred a significant uptick in meme coin activity, attracting attention from crypto traders. Memecoins experienced a notable start to the week, witnessing breakouts and decouplings across the board over the past 24 hours.
Trading volumes for the top 50 assets in this category surged by more than 34%. Coins such as $PEPE, $MAGA, $MOG, $BITCOIN, $PONKE, $PEPE2.0, $SPX, and $ANALOS are worth monitoring for potential volatility opportunities, reports Santiment.
However, some market analysts note that we’re still not near the 2021-like frenzy in GameStop. eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert said that the current outstanding shorts in GameStop are much smaller in comparison to that seen during 2021. Thus, the move to the upside would also be smaller.
“The environment is just not comparable to 2021, when interest rates were at rock bottom, governments were providing fiscal stimulus globally, and major economies had little to no inflation,” he said.

According to Analysis Firm Kaiko, Bitcoin Miners Are in a Difficult Situation After the Halving! Here's Why - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to information provided by researcher Kaiko, Bitcoin miners are facing increasing pressure as they struggle with low token rewards, which has significant impacts on market liquidity and trading activity.
A significant portion of Bitcoin mining revenue has been experiencing a significant decline recently following the halving at the end of April.


This event, known as the halving, occurs approximately every four years and reduces mining rewards by half.
The latest halving, the fourth since 2012, reduced daily production from 900 tokens to 450, resulting in a loss of annual revenue of approximately $10 billion based on then-current prices.





In response to this revenue decline, Bitcoin miners have attempted to offset their losses by taking advantage of transaction fees, an alternative revenue stream beyond the mining subsidy.
However, due in part to the introduction of memecoins on the Bitcoin network, the post-halving surge in transaction fees has since subsided, contributing to further revenue problems for miners.


Kaiko's analysis suggests that potential selling pressure from miners, especially those with significant Bitcoin reserves, could have a negative impact on cryptocurrency markets.

This scenario is further complicated by the seasonal slowdown in trading activity and liquidity, which is usually observed during the summer months.





Despite the recent revenue decline, Bitcoin miners have tended to hold on to their reserves, unlike the sell-offs observed during the 2022 crypto market downturn.
Over the past two years, major Bitcoin mining companies such as Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain have increased their holdings, demonstrating renewed confidence in the digital asset market.
According to Kaiko's data, Marathon reportedly owns 17,631 Bitcoins worth over $1.1 billion, while Riot owns 8,872 Bitcoins worth over $500 million.

Solana's Recovery: The Role of Institutions in Reviving SOL


The Solana (SOL) price is awaiting solid bullish cues to break out of the consolidation it is currently in.
This might come with the support of the institutional investors whose interest is reigniting.
Solana Sees Large Inflows
While 2023 was a good year for Solana’s price, it was also a good year for the asset in terms of investment, particularly from large wallet investors who made SOL their favorite asset. However, since the beginning of the year, this changed.
SOL noted fewer inflows than other altcoins such as Litecoin, Polkadot, and XRP. This is now changing, as Solana’s institutional inflows have risen considerably in the past two weeks.

For the week ending May 10, SOL emerged as the altcoin with the highest inflows, amounting to nearly $6 million. This bumped the net flows year to date, bringing it up from $11.1 million to $17 million.
Solana Institutional Inflows. Source: CoinShares
Although other assets have noted much larger year-to-date flows, Solana’s price could likely catch up if this interest does not fade.
At the same time, a shift from bearish to bullish is close to being confirmed as well, looking at the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI measures the speed and change of price movements. It’s used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. 
Read More: How to Buy Solana (SOL) and Everything You Need To Know

The presence of the indicator above the neutral line at 50.0 can be observed, and testing this level as support would confirm the bullishness. This would aid SOL in observing and continuing any recovery that initiates in the coming days.
SOL Price Prediction: Key Level to Watch

Solana’s price, trading at $147, has been between $126 and $156 for nearly a month now. Three attempts at breaching the upper limit have failed, but with the help of institutions, the fourth attempt could succeed. 
This would enable SOL to cross $160 and head towards $169, which is a key support level based on historical price action.
Read More: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030

However, another failed breach could lead to a drawdown with Solana’s price testing the local support at $137. Falling through this would result in a dip to $126, invalidating the bullish thesis.

GameStop Surges 110% as 'Roaring Kitty' Returns: What's Next?


							

Keith Gill’s return to social media coincides with GameStop’s over 110% stock surge, signaling renewed market interest.



GameStop’s rapid climb, propelled by Gill’s return, signifies a resurgence in meme stock trading driven by online communities.



The stock’s rise triggers a 5% increase in Crypto Memecoins, suggesting a connection between meme stocks and cryptocurrency markets.




Wu Blockchain, a cryptocurrency and blockchain news source, reported a resurgence in GameStop stock alongside the return of Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” after a three-year social media hiatus. Gill’s online presence coincided with GameStop’s stock soaring over 110%, triggering multiple circuit breakers. This surge also influenced a 5% increase in the broader Crypto Memecoin sector.







GameStop, a video game retailer, experienced a rapid rise in its shares, climbing over 70% in Monday’s morning trade to surpass $30, marking its highest level since 2022. This surge follows Gill’s reappearance, known for his role in the January 2021 rally that defied Wall Street predictions. Despite a slight price retreat, the stock’s recent performance reflects renewed investor interest.



Following his social media disappearance, Gill returned on Sunday with a cryptic post featuring a drawing of a man seemingly preparing for action. Subsequent posts on Monday further hinted at his re-engagement in the market.







The rise and fall of GameStop shares earlier this year were emblematic of meme stock trading, a trend driven by independent online traders sharing investment tips. Gill, among the most prominent figures in this movement, denied allegations of manipulating investors, attributing his social media activity to personal enjoyment. 









The meme stock phenomenon is part of a larger pattern of growing retail investor trading. Analysts believe that the first spike in meme stocks during the epidemic was caused by greater savings and free time. This year, when markets improved, retail investor activity surged on trading platforms such as Charles Schwab and Robinhood.



As of the latest update, the GameStop price surged to $0.012947 with a 24-hour trading volume of $167,602,349, representing a 429.35% increase in the past 24 hours. GameStop’s market cap stands at $89,140,304, with a circulating supply of 6,885,214,218 GME coins.

$BTC: 10x Research CEO Predicts a Volatile Week for Bitcoin Ahead Amid U.S. Inflation Data Releases | Cryptoglobe


                                
Markus Thielen is a prominent figure in the digital asset investment community, known for his analytical and strategic expertise. He is currently the CEO of 10x Research, a firm that provides detailed research and insights into digital assets, aimed primarily at institutional investors. Additionally, Thielen serves as the Head of Research and Strategy at Matrixport, a leading firm in the digital asset investment space.



Earlier today, Thielen shared his insights on LinkedIn regarding the implications of this week’s inflation data for Bitcoin. Thielen began by highlighting traders’ expectations for a significant move in Bitcoin’s price by the end of the week. According to Thielen, this anticipated volatility is influenced by the upcoming release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) data tonight and the more crucial Consumer Price Index (CPI) data tomorrow. These metrics are key indicators of inflation, with the PPI measuring the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output and the CPI tracking the average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Thielen pointed out that traders are expecting a +/-6% move for Bitcoin, driven by these inflation reports. However, he noted that the implied volatility, currently priced at 52.8% compared to 50.8% for other maturities, does not suggest that the market is fully anticipating a major move. Implied volatility, a metric derived from the price of an asset’s options, indicates the market’s expectations for future volatility. Despite the slightly higher implied volatility, Thielen observed that it is not considered expensive since the realized volatility, which measures the actual historical volatility of Bitcoin, traded slightly below 50%.



In his analysis, Thielen emphasized that Bitcoin is currently testing the support level between $60,800 and $61,400. A support level is a price point where an asset tends to find buying interest, preventing it from falling further. Thielen warned that if Bitcoin breaks below this support range, it could lead to lower prices. He highlighted that the average entry price for spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) holdings is around $57,000, suggesting that a drop below $60,000 would likely cause significant concern among these investors. The spot Bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without owning the actual asset, and its inflows have reportedly slowed since Bitcoin’s recent rally attempts failed.



At the time of writing (8:30 a.m. UTC on May 14), Bitcoin is trading at around $61,857, down 1.5% in the past 24-hour period.

Machine learning algorithm predicts SHIB price on May 31, 2024


Although many assets in the cryptocurrency market have turned red, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is moving in the opposite direction, recording significant gains on its daily chart, and machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms predict further (albeit modest) price increases in the following weeks.
Indeed, Shiba Inu has made a surprising twist that has seen it advance over 7% in a matter of hours without any significant announcement or development during the weekend, other than the popular token becoming one of the payment methods on CoinGate last week.
SHIB price prediction
As it happens, Shiba Inu might continue to advance during May, possibly hitting the price of $0.000024 by May 31, 2024, according to the latest forecast by the advanced machine learning algorithm over at the crypto analytics platform PricePredictions obtained on May 14.

In other words, provided that the algorithm, which uses technical analysis (TA) indicators like average true range (ATR), relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and others, is correct, the price of SHIB would increase 1.61% by the end of this month.
SHIB price analysis
Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is trading at the price of $0.00002362, which indicates a 7.18% gain in the last 24 hours, an increase of 0.11% across the previous seven days, as well as an advance of 4.18% in the last month, in addition to growing 130.04% since the year’s turn.

It is also worth noting that the sentiment on SHIB’s 1-month technical gauges is bullish and suggests a ‘buy,’ as recorded by oscillators in the ‘buy’ zone at 2 and moving averages (MA) pointing at a ‘strong buy’ at 7, as per the most recent TradingView information.

At the same time, renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez has pointed out that SHIB has broken the upper boundary of a descending parallel channel at $0.00002444, which means that the popular dog meme token could see an “upswing to $0.00002954,” according to his X post on May 13.

SHIB bullish factors
So, why is Shiba Inu going up today? Notably, SHIB’s recent surprising price movements occurred several days after CoinGate, a blockchain payment processor, added Shiba Inu as a payment method, integrating it with Polygon (MATIC) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) on May 10.

Other than that, there have been no major news or announcements over the weekend related to the Shiba Inu ecosystem that may have assisted in moving the needle in SHIB’s favor, which points to a more meaningful role of technical factors as the main trigger for its sudden rise.
Ultimately, the AI algorithm might be correct in its prognosis, especially considering the token’s recent price action, but it is still just that – a prognosis – which may or may not come true as things in the crypto market can change, so doing one’s own research and keeping up with any SHIB news is important.

Rain Loses $14.8M in April 29 Exploit; Exchange Recovers Funds


							

ZachXBT points out an exploit on Rain exchange that stole $14.8 million in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP.



The exploit possibly happened on April 29 and the stolen funds were immediately transferred into 2 wallets.



Rain updates that the issues were solved and the customer fund is safe.




According to a recent revelation by crypto sleuth ZachXBT, the prominent Middle Eastern cryptocurrency exchange, Rain, was “likely exploited” on April 29 for $14.8 million. The sleuth reported that a suspicious flow of cryptocurrecies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP into two wallets has been identified.



In ZachXBT’s Telegram page, the researcher shared insights on the stolen funds from Rain, which were reportedly transferred into two wallets holding 137.9 BTC and 1,881 ETH. Both wallets remained inactive since they received the stolen funds. ZachXBT’s statement read,




“It appears the crypto exchange Rain was likely exploited for $14.8M on April 29, 2024 after their BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP wallets saw suspicious outflows. Funds were quickly transferred to instant exchanges and swapped for BTC and ETH.”




However, Rain shared an official blog post in response to ZachXBT’s report on the platform’s security breach. The platform assured that the situation was resolved and the customer funds were safe. Rain added, “This means that all your fiat currency and crypto assets are held with the highest standards of security and regulatory compliance.”









Further, Rain narrated its efforts to tackle the situation and strengthen the platform’s security measures. The crypto exchange wrote,




“As soon as we became aware of the incident, we isolated the issue and put additional controls to strengthen our security…All customer and operational activity including crypto buy, sell, send, receive, along with fiat deposit, and withdrawals, remain operational and uninterrupted across all our platforms.”




Blockchain security firm CertiK’s report in April pointed out that the crypto market has witnessed a loss of $502,522,934 in a total of 223 onchain security incidents. The report also highlighted that the losses incurred in crypto attacks in 2024 Q1 are significantly higher than the losses in last year’s first quarter.

CoinShares Sets New Benchmark with Exceptional Q1 2024 Financial Performance | Coinspeaker



The first quarter of this year was the strongest quarter ever as the company’s revenue, gain, and other income rose to £43.9 million, which is 216% higher than the same period last year.

CoinShares International Limited, an asset management company specializing in digital assets, has set a new standard in its financial performance after it released its Q1 financial results for 2024. During this period, the company experienced an exceptional level of expansion and success.
CoinShares in Q1 2024
In a document released, the asset management CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti revealed that the first quarter of this year was the strongest quarter ever as the company’s revenue, gain, and other income rose to £43.9 million, which is 216% higher than the same period last year. Also, the total income for the first quarter reached £34.1 million, compared to just £ 2.9 million in the first quarter of 2023. He said:




“Q1 2024 is our strongest quarter ever, with combined revenues, gains, and income of £43.9 million (+216% YoY) for an adjusted EBITDA of £34.2 million (78% margin).”
Mognetti further mentioned that this achievement is not only about financial performance but also reflects CoinShares’ commitment to expanding its presence worldwide, as recently demonstrated in its acquisition of Valkyrie’s ETF business in March 2024. The acquisition of Valkyrie ETF and the approval of ETFs in the United States are opportunities for CoinShares to further establish itself as the worldwide leader in the asset management industry.
Success Contributors
The asset manager had a lot of inflow from CoinShares Physical, which was essentially part of the improvement in financial performance. This division achieved its highest-ever quarterly performance in management fees, which is about £3.3 million, a considerable increase compared to the same period in 2023, which was £0.6 million. Moreover, the introduction of staking CS physical Ethereum also boosted the performance of CoinShare, which ultimately led to a 64% increase in Asset Under Management (AUM) – £567.2 million to 932.1 million.
Aside from the CoinShare Physical, XBT Provider also contributed to the overall financial performance, earning £15.7 million in fees for the first quarter compared to £8.3 million in the same quarter the previous year. This was made despite experiencing a net outflow of approximately US$238.3 million (£188.6 million) during the quarter (compared to US$27.4 million (£21.7 million) in Q1 2023), but the company still achieved huge fee income.
Hence, the AUM increased by 54% during the quarter, rising from US$2.38 billion (£1.87 billion) to a closing AUM of US$3.65 billion (£2.89 billion).  The Capital Market & Hedge Fund Solutions also delivered top-tier performance bolstered by vibrant market activity and gains from staking and trading.
The company’s board of directors has approved a new dividend policy for the fiscal year 2023, committing to an annual dividend of 20% to 40% of the group’s total comprehensive income. The initial payment was disbursed on May 3rd, and three more are scheduled throughout the year.

Bitcoin, Solana lead the way as crypto inflows rise after 5 weeks - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin contributed $144 million to the investment, while Solana had $5.9 million.
Ethereum’s struggles with regulatory uncertainty triggered outflows from its products.

Bitcoin [BTC] investment products have finally broken the five-week streak of outflows and attracted $144 million in weekly inflows, according to a recent report by CoinShares.
Every week, the digital asset management firm released a detailed about investments in crypto products. For the last five weeks, all of them have ended in massive outflows, despite the initial strong start to the year.
Volume falls, capital rises
But last week, the products were able to amass inflows totaling $130 million. The report linked the hike to the growing interest in crypto products in Hong Kong.
Also, ETFs in the U.S. registered low outflows. However, Bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency that ensured the record ended in a net positive value.
According to CoinShares, Solana [SOL] also had a hand in it as it registered $5.9 million in inflows.  Despite the improvement, the ETP volume dropped when compared to the average weekly volume in April.
Source: CoinShares
ETP stands for Exchange Traded Products. In April, the average volume was $17 billion. But the metric was not able to match that last week, as it only hit $8 billion.
The decrease indicated a declining interest in interacting with crypto products, with the report noting that,
 “These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges relative to 31% last month.”
At press time, Bitcoin’s price was $62,579. This was a 2.72% increase in the last 24 hours. Solana, on the other hand, changed hands at $148.22— a 7.44% increase within the same period.
BTC and SOL are leaving ETH behind
With this price performance, it could be possible that committing capital to Bitcoin and Solana-related products was a wise choice.
Furthermore, it seemed that the market was getting more and more confident about BTC and SOL. This was evident from the state of their Weighted Sentiment.
Using Santiment’s on-chain data, AMBCrypto noticed that Bitcoin’s Weighted Sentiment was 0.201. This reading implied that comments about the coins have been largely positive.
For SOL, it was -0.429. However, this was a notable improvement from what the metric was on the 12th of May. As such, this was confirmation that the bearish bias around Solana was waning.
Source: Santiment
Meanwhile, Ethereum [ETH] was also on the radar. But this time, it was on the losing end, considering that AMBCrypto reported how the altcoin got more inflows in the previous week.

Realistic or not, here’s SOL’s market cap in BTC terms

Based on the latest data, Ethereum products had outflows worth $14.4 million.
The fading optimism about the approval of the Ethereum ETF application was the major reason for the decline, with CoinShares explaining that,
“Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF has increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent, this has been reflected in outflows which totaled US$14m last week.”

Bitcoin hash rate dips as miners turn off unprofitable ASICs post-halving

Bitcoin hash rate saw a decline as Bitcoin mining firms have started turning off unprofitable mining rigs after the fourth Bitcoin halving.The Bitcoin network’s hash rate fell to an over two-month low of 575 exahash per second (EH/s) on May 10 before making a small recovery to the current 586 EH/s, according to data from blockchain.com.The hash rate drop can be attributed to the fact that “miners are beginning to turn off unprofitable rigs,” according to a May 13 X post by James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares. Source: blockchain.comThe temporary drop was predicted by an April 19 report by CoinShares, which expects hash rate to surge during the next year. According to the report:“Our model forecasts the hash rate rising to 700 exahash by 2025, although after the halving, it could fall by up to 10% as miners turn off unprofitable ASICs.”The temporary reduction is attributed to the increased costs of Bitcoin (BTC) mining due to the halving, along with rising electricity costs, according to the report:“Key mitigation strategies include optimizing energy costs, increasing mining efficiency, and securing favorable hardware procurement terms.”Infrastructure and energy costs remain key for BTC mining profitabilityYet, according to Nazar Khan, the co-founder and COO of TeraWulf, only smaller mining operations with less energy-efficient equipment will be endangered after the 2024 halving. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Khan said:“If you are a firm that just owns a bunch of machines and you are not profitable, you will be challenged. If you are a company that owns quality infrastructure that can deliver low-cost power, that's a real asset and if anything the underlying value of that asset [BTC] has increased…”TeraWulf is the world’s eighth largest Bitcoin mining company, worth over $670 million, according to Companiesmarketcap, planning to further expand its mining operations this year, despite the halving of block rewards.Related: 10 days until halving: Bitcoin mining profitability won’t necessarily fallHowever, the profitability of mining operations largely depends on the cost of electricity the companies are paying.

Frontline Bybit Trader Accuses Worldcoin Team of System Manipulation - Coin Edition


							

According to DeFi^2 Worldcoin might become the greatest transfer of wealth in the upcoming bull cycle.



The top trader accused the Worldcoin team of plans to manipulate its system and extort the public.



According to the trader, the Worldcoin team designed WLD to have predatory tokenomics.




According to DeFi^2, a ranked trader on Bybit, Worldcoin might become the most significant transfer of wealth in the upcoming bull cycle. In a post on X, the famous trader alleged that the indicated wealth transfer would be from the public to the pockets of the Worldcoin team and insiders, citing the project’s upcoming WLD unlock and vesting program.







In his opening statement, DeFi^2 accused Worldcoin of being a deceptive project with no link to OpenAI as popularly assumed. He accused the Worldcoin team of planning to sell off the project’s native coin, WLD, as unlocks ramp up in the coming months, which would lead to hyperinflation.



According to the trader, WLD is undergoing a 0.6% daily devaluation from grant emissions and operator claims. He noted that the Worldcoin Foundation has announced it will sell $200 million more WLD tokens to trading firms, marking an additional 18% of the circulating supply to sell at a discount.









Meanwhile, the Bybit top trader highlighted that in just 70 days, when VC and team unlocks begin vesting, WLD supply will begin inflating at 4% PER DAY from unlocks and emissions. From his calculations, he disclosed that the process would lead to $50 million a day of nonstop sell pressure on a coin insiders are hoping to cash out at a $60 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV).



Warning his followers, DeFi^2 highlighted that people design coins like WLD to have predatory tokenomics that benefit the team and early investors. He noted that the Foundation intentionally ended the market maker contract, which prevented the price from squeezing higher on a low float in December. He accused the  Worldcoin team of engaging in actions similar to Sam Bankman-Fried’s routine by manipulating the system to enrich insiders.

Crypto Trader Accuses Worldcoin of Predatory Tokenomics


Crypto trader DeFiSquared shared a comprehensive analysis of the Worldcoin project and its native token—WLD. Their analysis delves into concerns about the project that Sam Altman of OpenAI co-founded, focusing on tokenomics design.
DeFiSquared explained that Worldcoin “realistically” might be the biggest wealth transfer of this cycle. Yet, this may not come as universal basic income as the project’s mission suggests.
DeFiSquared Accused Worldcoin (WLD) of Having “Predatory Tokenomics”
DeFiSquared shared some calculations regarding the WLD token’s hyperinflation. Currently, at a $60 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV), the token is being devalued by 0.6% daily due to emissions from grants and operator claims, mostly sold immediately.
DeFiSquared thinks many investors must be aware of the expected aggressive WLD sell-off. The Worldcoin Foundation announced it will sell $200 million more WLD tokens to trading firms. This transaction will add 18% of the entire circulating supply sold at a discount to counterparties.


“These $200 million of tokens come from the deceptively named ‘Community’ allocation of WLD token supply, yet are being sold to adversarial parties to benefit the foundation,” DeFiSquared noted.

The most important thing, according to DeFiSquared, is that in just 70 days, when the token allocation to venture capital (VC) and teams starts to open, the supply of WLD will increase by 4% per day. That’s nearly $50 million per day of “non-stop selling pressure” on WLD tokens that insiders hope to cash out at an FDV of US$60 billion.
Moreover, DeFiSquared alleged that crypto tokens like Worldcoin were designed to have “predatory tokenomics” since the beginning. DeFiSquared highlighted an event in December 2023 as the prime example of Worldcoin’s predatory tokenomics. At that time, they said that the Worldcoin Foundation intentionally terminated the market maker contract that prevented WLD prices from squeezing higher on low float.

They noticed that the low float, high FDV design is a similar tactic used by Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange FTX. This design also directly enriches insiders as they hedge their locked allocations at high valuations pre-unlock via perpetual or over-the-counter (OTC).

“Yet retail somehow sadly still thinks they’re beating the system trying to push the price up,” they suggested.

DeFiSquared also reminds investors to be alert to some strategically timed announcements between now and the token unlock period for WLD insiders in July. They see that the unlock will most likely create profitable exit liquidity for WLD insiders.
Exit liquidity is a common tactic in the crypto industry. Insiders use hype and announcements to increase the price of select crypto assets. After seeing the price rise, they will sell their holdings, leaving retail investors at potential losses.

Despite public assumptions, DeFiSquared thinks the project has no real connections to the popular artificial intelligence (AI) project—OpenAI. Therefore, they called it “a deceptive project.”
They also flagged that most retail buyers probably need to realize that Sam Altman has no active involvement in Worldcoin. DeFiSquared emphasized that the project is under a completely separate entity from OpenAI.
Historically, OpenAI’s development often influenced WLD’s price performance. BeInCrypto reported last week that WLD surged 30% amid rumors of a new OpenAI search engine product. Additionally, when OpenAI announced Sam Altman’s departure as the company’s CEO, WLD dropped over 13%.

However, OpenAI’s introduction of GPT-4o on Monday has not pushed WLD’s price. At the time of writing, WLD is trading at $5.22. This figure marks a decrease of 11.66% for the last 24 hours.

USA Bans Chinese Cryptocurrency Company! - Bitcoin Sistemi

With the US presidential elections just around the corner, cryptocurrencies have become frequently discussed during the election process.
At this point, presidential candidate Donald Trump, who was previously known for his anti-Bitcoin (BTC) and anti-cryptocurrency views, is now declaring his support for crypto, while the current president and presidential candidate Joe Biden continues his anti-crypto approach.


According to Coindesk, US President Joe Biden ordered the shutdown of the MineOne operation of a cryptocurrency mining company controlled by Chinese investors, located near Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, citing national security risks.
In the statement made by the White House, it was stated that a crypto mining company, mostly owned by Chinese citizens, set up shop within one mile of a US nuclear missile base without the necessary permission.





It was also stated that the company used foreign technology that created national security concerns.
The White House also said that the land where the mining operations were located was acquired in 2022, but the company that owns the land was accused of purchasing the land and starting work there without applying to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and an investigation was launched regarding this.


Biden's stop order also requests the sale of the land in question.
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in her statement:






“The decision underscores the critical watchdog role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not harm our national security, especially as it relates to transactions involving sensitive U.S. military facilities as well as specialized equipment and technologies.”

                         TRLab’s Audrey Ou’s exploration into the future of digital art, NFTs, and technologyAudrey Ou, CEO and co-founder of TRLab is a frequent speaker on fine art NFTs and an Ivy League graduate of Princeton University and Columbia University. She is steering the TRLab platform towards thinking about the future of fine art as it evolves with the development of technology.NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital tokens. Each token has a specific identity and value. Because of that, Ou immediately identified the potential of blockchain technology in the art world. Her parents founded the Rockbund Art Museum in Shanghai when she was a child. She grew up in the art world before moving on to the tech world.Blockchain technology is perfect for fine art. Blockchain tech ensures the authenticity and ownership of digital art through secure, transparent records that can’t be altered. Artists can create and sell unique digital artworks as NFTs that can be tracked and verified across and beyond their lifetime. Compare this to traditional art collecting: provenance and authenticity can raise concerns even for the strictest museums and auction houses. Art is notorious for forgery, as seen in countless TV shows, and as many documentaries have pointed out, verifying the rightful owner of a piece is tricky, especially when art is lost during times of war.Since their introduction, NFTs have had a passionate following. Audrey and TRLab aim to expand this following by creating a community around fine art NFTs and the artists who create them. TRLab has collaborated with many celebrated artists, but it’s the up-and-coming artists that will shape the future of digital art with the help of Audrey and TRLab.In partnership with Chen Qiufan and Kai-Fu Lee’s book AI 2041: Ten Visions For Our Future, authors and artists came together to represent two promising emerging technologies: AI and blockchain. This partnership highlights the innovation that has made TRLab so successful among investors and collectors.The project invited 7 artists to bring their interpretation of the stories and predictions in Qiufan and Lee’s book. The art, seen worldwide, connects viewers to the book’s message of how AI will come to make our lives easier in expected and sometimes unexpected ways. The NFTs, created by artists who were inspired by the literature, share visions of the future of AI as they are themselves evidence of how digital art is transforming and evolving.Audrey Ou and TRLab have empowered established and emerging artists alike providing a platform that connects them with a global audience and supports their creative freedom. The work that Audrey Ou works on at TRLab encourages digital art to further evolve. At the same time, the artists retain control and rights over their creations, fostering a dynamic and sustainable art ecosystem. About the AuthorDarla Wall is a freelance writer from Trenton, NJ, where she lives with her husband.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin price prediction is a hot topic as two mysterious whales, inactive for over a decade, have suddenly moved 1,000 BTC, worth about $60.9 million, within the past 20 minutes.This unexpected activity has intrigued market analysts and traders, prompting speculation about potential market impacts and future price movements.Two Mysterious Whales Start Transferring Funds After 10 Years
Two Bitcoin wallets that have been inactive for over a decade suddenly moved 1,000 BTC, valued at approximately $60.9 million, within the past 20 minutes. These transactions have caught the attention of market analysts and traders alike, sparking curiosity and speculation about potential market impacts.The wallets, identified as “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH,” each received 500 BTC in September 2013, when Bitcoin was priced at $124 per coin. This activity, reported by Lookonchain, raises questions about the motives behind the transfers and whether these movements could signal a significant shift in market dynamics.The sudden reactivation of these long-dormant wallets may indicate upcoming volatility or strategic moves by influential holders, making it crucial for investors to stay informed and vigilant.Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $62,022, down around 1.50%, with a neutral Bitcoin price prediction. The 4-hour chart highlights a pivot point at $61,764, a critical level for traders to monitor. Immediate resistance is found at $63,824, followed by $65,506 and $67,222. On the downside, immediate support lies at $60,185, with further support at $58,812 and $56,640.Technical indicators show that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at a neutral 50, suggesting no immediate overbought or oversold conditions. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $62,023, closely aligning with the current price.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewA symmetrical triangle pattern is forming around the $61,760 level, indicating potential volatility. This pattern suggests that Bitcoin could break out in either direction. On the lower side, a break below $61,764 could lead the price towards $60,185, with further declines potentially reaching $58,800 and $56,640.Conversely, if Bitcoin breaks above $63,000, it could target resistance levels at $65,500 and $67,250. The outlook remains cautiously bullish above $61,765, but a break below this level could trigger significant selling pressure.Mega Dice Presale Approaches Final Stage with $960K Raised: Last Opportunity Before Price Increase

Chainlink's Response to Bitcoin's Influence in a Bearish Market


In today’s analysis, we will delve into the recent price action of Chainlink (LINK) and its on-chain activity to understand the underlying trends and potential future movements.
Even though Bitcoin’s price surged from $60,700 to $63,000 within hours. Chainlink’s price failed to surpass the significant mid-term resistance level of $13.7. Curious about the reason? Let’s zoom In for a closer examination.
Chainlink Price Action Remains Bearish
The current price of LINK is trading below a significant yellow range, which is critical to observe over the next few days. This range could act as a resistance level. The fact that the price remains below this range signals a bearish sentiment in the market.

Interestingly, even as Bitcoin recovered to $63,000 yesterday, LINK did not exhibit comparable price appreciation, which aligns with bearish trends observed in similar tokens like PYTH. In addition, a decreasing trading volume has contributed to a deep price correction.

Key Observations:
– Resistance Watch: The yellow range is crucial; breaking above could suggest a bullish reversal, whereas continued resistance confirms bearish pressures.– Comparative Underperformance: Unlike Bitcoin, LINK’s lack of recovery is a point of concern, reflecting broader market uncertainty or specific challenges within the Chainlink ecosystem.– Volume Trends: The decrease in trading volume, coupled with reduced exchange activity, indicates a lack of trader confidence, which could further decline the price.

A closer look at the on-chain metrics reveals that exchange deposits and LINK withdrawals have decreased significantly, leading to very low trading volumes. This drop in active trading volume is a bearish indicator and suggests that the price may continue to face downward pressure, potentially reaching the major mid-term resistance level of $11.9.

Additionally there has been a noticeable decline in the number of new addresses created on the Chainlink network, as depicted in the provided chart. 
This downturn in active address creation correlates closely with the decline in LINK’s price, underscoring a reduced demand from new market investors.

Chainlink is currently exhibiting several bearish signs. The key to its short-term price movement will be its ability to break above the noted resistance range. Investors should monitor trading volumes and exchange activity as indicators of potential shifts in market sentiment.

As always, it’s essential to approach trading cautiously, considering the volatile nature of crypto markets.
LINK Price Projection: How BTC Can Influence Price

Bearish to Neutral Outlook: Chainlink’s price struggles below key resistance, with declining trading volumes and low exchange activity. This indicates strong bearish signals amidst a lack of new investor interest
Bitcoin’s Influence: If Bitcoin continues its upward momentum towards $65,000, it could positively impact Chainlink.
Conditional Resistance: Should Bitcoin fall below $60,800, LINK might experience a notable mid-term price decline, possibly extending its bearish trend.
Price Projections: In the bearish scenario, LINK’s price could potentially fall to $11.9. 
Our recommendations for traders: If Bitcoin hits $60,800, expect LINK to drop 12%. A $65,000 BTC price could boost LINK to $15. Traders should consider waiting to buy LINK at a lower price, around $12 – $12.5. Setting a stop loss at $11.5 and aiming for a sell price of $15 might be a smarter move.

Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Phase, Exiting Post-Halving "Danger Zone," Claims Analyst


                        
                            Bitcoin Enters Accumulation Phase, Exiting Post-Halving “Danger Zone,” Claims Analyst

                        Technical analyst Rekt Capital suggests that Bitcoin has emerged from the post-halving “danger zone” and entered an accumulation phase, as indicated by weakening selling pressure.After previous halving events, Bitcoin typically experienced increased volatility, which came to be known as the “danger zone.”In the current cycle, Bitcoin’s price dropped by a mild 6.5% over three weeks, followed by a 15% surge, signaling a strong exit from the danger zone.“The Post-Halving Bitcoin “Danger Zone” (purple) is officially over,” popular crypto trader Rekt Capital wrote. “And Bitcoin is celebrating with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.”As of now, Bitcoin is trading at nearly $62,600, reflecting a 3% increase in the past 24 hours.Bitcoin Price to Hold Above $60,000 Support
In a recent blog post, Rekt Capital emphasized the importance of the $60,000 support level for the continuation of the upward trend, with a potential return to the $68,000 mark.“The Bitcoin correction should be over, and price should be able to maintain itself above $60,000 going forward.”While past trends do not guarantee future outcomes, the resilience of the current support level is a positive indicator for Bitcoin’s trajectory.Investors will closely monitor the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on Wednesday, which is forecasted to be 3.4% for CPI and 3.6% for core CPI.Inflation remains a concern, as it exceeds the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Unless inflation improves, interest rates may remain high for an extended period.Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, believes that rising government debt and adjustments by the Fed and US Treasury make alternative investments like Bitcoin more appealing.Hayes predicts that Bitcoin’s price will surpass $60,000 and stabilize between $60,000 and $70,000 by August.The outcome of the upcoming US presidential election could also impact Bitcoin’s value, according to Standard Chartered.The bank suggests that a potential win for Donald Trump might be beneficial for Bitcoin, considering potential shifts in fiscal and monetary policies.Standard Chartered expects Bitcoin’s price to reach $150,000 by the end of the year and $200,000 by 2025.Pantera Capital Bullish on Bitcoin
As reported, crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has reiterated its bullish stance on Bitcoin. It predicts a potential surge in price to $114,000 by August 2025.The forecast comes as the industry grapples with challenges such as inflation concerns, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and the escalating Middle East crisis.Utilizing a stock-to-flow model, Pantera assessed the supply of Bitcoin in relation to the rate of new production, which is designed to decrease by 50% every four years during halving events.Historical data shows that Bitcoin’s price has experienced significant increases, sometimes up to 93-fold, in response to these events.By studying both pre-halving and post-halving rallies, Pantera Capital determined that, on average, prices tend to reach their peak approximately 2.6 years after halving events.Based on this analysis, the projected timeframe for Bitcoin’s potential surge aligns with August next year.

Ripple v. SEC case update as of May 14, 2024


As the cryptocurrency community continues to sit tight for the final outcome of the long-running courtroom battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the blockchain company has asked the court to seal certain documents.
Specifically, Ripple has filed a motion to seal specific documents filed in connection with the SEC’s motion for judgment and remedies, according to a document shared by a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, James K. Filan, in an X post on May 14.

Ripple v. SEC: Confidential financial data
Among other things, the court document addressed to Judge Analisa Torres seeks sealing or redacting confidential information, including the company’s “negotiated financial terms of its contractual agreements with certain third-party business partners.” 



“Ripple’s proposed redactions are narrow and target only the specific financial and pricing terms that Ripple and certain of its past or existing counterparties negotiated, and the Court granted Ripple’s identical or similar proposed redactions in connection with the Summary Judgment and Daubert motions.”

On top of that, Ripple’s chief financial officer, Jonathan Bilich, has filed a declaration in support of the firm’s motion to seal, arguing that “Ripple is a private company” that “undertakes significant efforts to protect the confidentiality of its sensitive and proprietary business information.”

“Its disclosure to the public would be detrimental to Ripple’s business relationships with customers and other counterparties and harm Ripple’s competitive standing in the marketplace.”

Discounts to institutional buyers
According to a lawyer and popular commentator on the case, Bill Morgan, this means that Ripple’s legal team is purportedly seeking to seal certain discounts offered to institutional XRP buyers, further explaining that a “company has every right to seek and protect commercially sensitive information.”

As a reminder, the securities regulator has earlier filed its remedies reply brief and supporting exhibits, in which the SEC is trying to justify the need for injunctions, arguing that Ripple’s claims refuting the accusations of acting recklessly were “contrary to evidence,” as Finbold reported on May 10.
In fact, the SEC has accused Ripple of planning “to issue a new unregistered crypto asset,” referring to the company’s announcement on April 4, 2024, of the planned dollar-pegged stablecoin release as evidence of its continuous violations.
Meanwhile, XRP, the token at the center of the protracted legal standoff, was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.51, which indicates an increase of 0.5% on the day, a loss of 6.64% across the past week, and a 2.28% gain in the last month, as per data on May 14.

Coinbase Suffers Critical Outage: Were Your Funds Safe? - DailyCoin


        

Coinbase suffered a system-wide outage on Tuesday.



The exchange has issued several alerts since the issue began.



Users contemplated whether funds were safe following the glitch.   




The largest crypto exchange in the U.S., Coinbase, suffered a critical “system-wide outage” on May 14, rendering the platform inaccessible via mobile phone or desktop for hours.



On Tuesday at around 4:15 AM UTC, Coinbase notified its users of the outage, noting that its team was investigating the issue and working on a solution. At the time, the exchange’s website displayed a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error when accessed.




As the investigation was underway, users contemplated whether their funds were safe. Even more intriguing, the exchange warned users about possible transaction failures after it claimed the issue was resolved.



Coinbase ‘Resolves ‘System Outage



Hours after the glitch, Coinbase reported that the “system-wide” outage had been resolved.



“Coinbase is now fully recovered. We appreciate your patience and apologize for the inconvenience,” the exchange wrote on X.



However, while the alert was a relief to some confused users who hadn’t been issued with a detailed explanation of what transpired as of press time, it didn’t inspire confidence among some X users.



Specifically, a user by the name “rocket” responded to Coinbase’s alert, terming the tweet “false.”




“@X can we get community notes here. This tweet is false as millions of people are still unable to withdraw or transfer their assets.” The user wrote.



Tens of other users claimed that they couldn’t send or withdraw their funds, so Coinbase issued another alert.



Were Funds Safe During the Outage?



While all the alerts issued by Coinbase since the start of the outage and after the supposed recovery reiterated that user funds were safe, the exchange acknowledged that users might experience issues when sending crypto or withdrawing fiat from its platform.



“Some users may still experience failures when sending crypto or withdrawing fiat. We are continuing to investigate this issue and will provide an update shortly. Rest assured, your funds are safe,” Coinbase stated.



At last check, the exchange had issued another alert, claiming “the issue has been identified and a fix is being implemented.” In the meantime, it seems users will believe that funds are safe if they can conduct normal transfers without glitches.

Coinbase claims full recovery after system-wide outage - Crypto Briefing




US crypto exchange Coinbase has been grappling with a “system-wide outage” since 12:15 am ET earlier today, rendering its services inaccessible to users attempting to access the platform via desktop or mobile.The exchange has been regularly updating its official status page and social media channels, assuring users that their funds remain secure. In its latest post on X, the exchange says that it has “fully recovered” from the incident.Despite this, users are still reporting access issues to Coinbase’ platform, with some requesting X for community notes on the matter. Community notes on X is a user-driven feature where contributors are allowed to provide context, fact-checks, and helpful information under posts, images, or videos with the aim of countering disinformation by allowing users from different perspectives to collaboratively contribute notes.Due to the outage, users attempting to visit the Coinbase website have been met with a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error message, indicating that the servers are either down for maintenance or overloaded.The status page has shown progress through the various stages of addressing the outage, from investigating to identifying the problem and monitoring the effectiveness of the implemented fix. Despite the challenges, Coinbase has maintained transparency about its troubleshooting process and has reiterated that all user funds are safe.By 4:16 AM ET, the status page stated that a fix has been implemented and results after the fix are being monitored. Some 42 minutes later, the page stated that the Coinbase team is still “currently” investigating the issue, implying that the implemented fix did not work out as planned.This is not the first time Coinbase has experienced an outage. On February 28, the exchange, along with several others, suffered temporary outages due to a rapid uptick in crypto trading activity during a Bitcoin (BTC) flash crash that saw the asset price fall nearly 10% before spiking back up. This happened again as Bitcoin reached the $67K level during the first week of March 2024.While outages can be frustrating for users, some in the crypto community view surges in traffic that cause extended periods of downtime as a bullish sign, indicating increased interest and activity in the cryptocurrency market.

Wallets Dormant Since 2013 Abruptly Move Over $60,000,000 in Bitcoin (BTC) - Here’s Where the Crypto’s Headed - The Daily Hodl


								Two wallets that held a combined 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) for more than 10 years have suddenly awoken from their slumber, according to on-chain data.
The crypto tracker Lookonchain notes that the first wallet received 500 BTC worth $62,000 on Sept 12th, 2013, when the price of Bitcoin was $124. 










The second wallet received the same amount at the same price the following day.
After more than 10 years of dormancy, both wallets transferred out all of their holdings in a 20-minute span over the weekend. The Bitcoin troves were worth a combined $60.9 million, a staggering increase of 49,012.9%.
Data from the digital asset de-anonymizing platform Arkham indicates the crypto was sent to two newly created wallets. One of the addresses still holds 500 BTC, while the other one sent the Bitcoin through a series of other fresh wallets.
In April, Ki Young Ju, the chief executive of blockchain intelligence platform CryptoQuant, noted that newer crypto whales – or investors that his firm defines as holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin with an average coin age of less than 155 days – had accumulated nearly twice as much BTC as their long-term holder counterparts.
BTC is trading at $62,568 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours.

Strong Q1 2024 Performance: IGT Reports Revenue Increase to $1.07 Billion - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



International Game Technology PLC (NYSE: IGT) reported robust financial results for the first quarter of 2024, showcasing a revenue increase to $1.07 billion, a 1% rise from the previous year’s $1.06 billion. This growth was primarily driven by a significant uptick in Global Lottery sales, a 6% increase to $661 million. However, this was partially offset by a 7% decline in Gaming & Digital revenue, which fell to $406 million. The company’s operating income remained steady at $256 million, but excluding separation and divestiture costs, it reached a record $273 million, marking a 7% increase.



Operating income margin for the quarter was 24.0%, slightly above the prior year’s 24.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $443 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41.5%. When excluding separation and divestiture costs, adjusted EBITDA rose to $461 million, and the margin improved to 43.1%.



IGT Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1, Reports $1.07 Billion in Revenue



IGT’s performance in the first quarter exceeded market expectations. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.40 (and an adjusted EPS of $0.46), significantly higher than the anticipated $0.30. This remarkable improvement in EPS, a 264% increase from the $0.11 reported in the same period last year, was driven by a combination of strong operational performance and favorable foreign exchange gains. Analysts had projected revenue of $1.03 billion for the quarter, but IGT surpassed this with actual revenue of $1.07 billion, highlighting the company’s robust sales in the Global Lottery division.



Despite a decline in Gaming & Digital revenue, the segment’s operating income margin expanded by 80 basis points to 20%, thanks to process improvements in research and development and easing supply chain costs. The Global Lottery segment’s operating income rose by 8% to $258 million, driven by strong same-store sales in Italy and higher product sales margins. These results underscore IGT’s ability to outperform expectations through strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies.





IGT Upgrades Full Year 2024 Guidance



Given the strong performance in Q1 2024, IGT has upgraded its full-year outlook. For the second quarter of 2024, the company expects revenue of approximately $1.05 billion and an operating income margin of around 22%, or 24.5%, when excluding separation and divestiture costs. This guidance reflects continued confidence in the company’s ability to drive growth and profitability across its key business segments.



For 2024, IGT has set ambitious targets, projecting revenue of around $4.4 billion and an operating income margin of approximately 21%, or 24%, excluding separation and divestiture costs. The company also anticipates generating cash from operations of at least $1.0 billion and plans capital expenditures of roughly $500 million. This optimistic outlook is supported by broad-based momentum across key performance indicators and ongoing efforts to separate the Global Lottery business from Gaming & Digital.

Ethereum (ETH) Option Traders Are Expecting This Price for Ethereum at the End of June! - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to data from Deribit, the term structure of open interest in Ethereum options reveals a concentration in call contracts, consisting of more than 617,000 contracts expiring at the end of June with a face value exceeding $1.8 billion.
Ethereum Options Traders Predict $3,600 for June Expiration
This significant number of call contracts and their significant nominal value may reflect confidence in Ethereum's potential to gain value by the end of June.


Intensifying interest could also support the price of the digital asset if derivative investors choose to exercise their options when the price begins to exceed certain strike prices specified in the option spread.
According to CoinShares Research Associate Luke Nolan, strike prices for June expiry calls are concentrated above $3,600, with $6,500 being the most preferred strike price.






The analyst highlighted a significant notional value of $192 million associated with the largest open interest before June expiration at a strike price of $6,500, reflecting confidence among some investors in Ethereum's ability to reach or exceed that level.
“The largest open interest for the June expiration is concentrated at a strike price of $6,500 with a face value of $192 million,” Nolan said in a statement.


The data also shows that the number of outstanding calls has increased compared to open positions in Ethereum options ahead of the late June expiration.
A call options ratio below one indicates that the buying volume exceeds the selling volume and there is an upward trend in the market.





An investor who buys a call option is implicitly assumed to be in a bullish trend in the market, while an investor who buys a put option is assumed to be in a bearish trend.

Solana Meme Coin Devs Fight on Livestream to Pump Price-Until One Loses a Tooth - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe world's top boxers can make millions of dollars per fight. In a decidedly lower-stakes matchup, two Solana meme coin creators smacked each other around on a livestream early Monday, with dreams of their coin perhaps rising to hit a million-dollar market cap amid the viral buzz. Unfortunately, they were brought back to reality when a tooth went flying.Posted in the early hours of the morning, FriendlyFadesLive popped up on Pump.fun—the streamlined platform used to launch LiveMom, Shark Cat, and other meme-driven Solana tokens.It’s the latest instance of a growing trend of meme coins being driven by livestreamed stunts, such as the dev who tied his hands, oiled himself up, and slept on stream.To promote this particular token, FADELIVE, two young men faced off in balaclavas, wearing Everlast boxing gloves and sparring in a tiled dining room rather than a legit boxing ring.While Tyson Fury will be fighting Alexander Usyk to become undisputed heavyweight champion this weekend, this clash was billed by the devs as “two of the deadliest fighters battling it out to see who takes over Solana.”After only a couple minutes of livestreaming on Kick, the token was crowned king of the hill on Pump.fun—a featured spot on the site reserved for tokens that hit a $30,000 market cap, which often brings in new buyers as well thanks to the increased exposure.As a reward, viewers watched the two titans brawl in a one-handed fight. Despite being named “Friendly Fades,” it quickly became clear that they weren’t pulling any punches.For 20 seconds, the two amateur brawlers threw right hand after right hand. In this first fight, it appeared that the fighter in the red shorts got the better of his Nike gray tracksuit-wearing opponent—landing a clean straight shot that signaled the end of the round.“This shit about to hit Raydium?” said the dev who was now up on the scorecard, looking at his laptop. When a Pump.fun token reaches a market cap of $69,000, it can be listed on Raydium, a Solana decentralized exchange (DEX)—so the devs’ eyes were set on a new prize.“Pump it up, pump it up boys,” the gray tracksuit boxer cried.The chat filled with viewers demanding that they continue fighting. “You have 60 seconds ‘til I fucking withdraw my SOL,” one Kick viewer commented.“Stop talking, more fighting,” another said. “Last time you fought, it almost hit Raydium.” That was all the devs needed to hear. The men strapped their gloves up and began another 20-second round, this time with both hands in play. It was like watching Max Holloway in the last seconds of a fight, as both brawlers stood nose-to-nose and swung for the fences. Unfortunately, the round was cut short when red shorts’ unplugged his Xbox with poor footwork, after being backed into a corner.Going into the third round, it looked like a draw on the judges' scorecards. Someone had to pull themselves away from the pack. Red shorts dominated early on, landing a stiff jab followed by a strong right hook, and then a slapping left hook—an effective combination. Gray tracksuit was wobbled, defending for his life as red shorts left striking range. Still flustered, gray tracksuit threw some strikes, yet hit nothing but air. In the next flurry, red shorts landed a nasty three-piece combo that had his opponent backing off. He landed one last straight as gray tracksuit’s body language deflated.“You good? What happened?” the shorts-wearing man asked.“My tooth came out,” gray tracksuit replied, sounding slightly scared. The toothless fighter appears to walk out of the room, likely in search of a mirror. It sounds like it was one of his back teeth that fell victim to his friend’s vicious striking.“We need to go to the hospital,” he muttered, clearly affected by his sudden missing tooth.Amid laughs in chat, the boxers' morale appeared to change. Possible brain damage aside, the pair managed to amass only four viewers on Kick, and they didn’t even get their token to Raydium. It’s a reward that's far from the $150 million Tyson Fury is estimated to earn this weekend. It’s unknown whether the pair plan to fight again in the future. The Twitter and Kick livestream accounts associated with the token are still up, so perhaps there will be a rematch ahead. But for now, it appears that red shorts is the world boxing champion of Solana.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin's prices depend on this week's Fed events: What's going on? - AMBCrypto



Key events that could impact BTC’s price are coming up this week.
BTC has lost some gains from its previous trading session.

Bitcoin [BTC] has encountered volatile price movements in recent days, exemplified by a notable over 3% decline on the 10th of May, which drove its value down to $60,000. 
However, indications suggest that these choppy fluctuations may persist, largely influenced by the impending Federal Reserve meetings.
Bitcoin investors await BLS events outcomes
The upcoming events scheduled by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) this week are noteworthy for investors due to their potential impact on investment decisions. 
Historical data suggests that announcements from the Federal Reserve (Fed) have influenced Bitcoin prices in the past.
 Therefore, the upcoming speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, scheduled for the 14th of May, is particularly significant.
The BLS schedule indicates two key events: the Producer Price Index (PPI) today and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the 15th of May.
 The PPI measures changes in prices received by producers for goods and services, while the CPI tracks changes in prices paid by consumers for those same goods and services.
 Both indices serve as vital economic indicators that investors rely on to gauge the state of the economy.
Additionally, the BLS website indicates an upcoming event focused on employment claims later in the week.
 These macroeconomic events are poised to influence Bitcoin price movements as investors closely monitor them to inform their investment strategies.
What to expect from Bitcoin price moves
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Bitcoin’s price trend on a daily timeframe chart indicated a sluggish performance over recent weeks.
 On the 10th of May, the price experienced a significant drop from over $63,000 to around $60,000, reflecting a loss of over 3%. 
While attempting to recover since the 11th of May, Bitcoin could only reach approximately $62,900. At the time of this writing, it was trading at around $62,000, with a decline of over 1%.
Source: TradingView
Examination of the stochastic indicator suggested the possibility of further decline, as a crossover was still ongoing. 
However, based on recent price action, the $60,000 level appears to serve as a strong support region. Should the price drop further, around $57,000 might act as another level of support to prevent further decline.
Possible rise in BTC volume expected
The volume metric for Bitcoin could experience increased activity if the price begins to decline. 
The chart revealed that during the previous trading session, when the Bitcoin price was rising, the volume was approximately $25 billion.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

However, at the time of writing, as the BTC price has dropped, the volume has already surged to nearly $28 billion. 
This uptick in volume suggests heightened trading activity, potentially indicating increased selling pressure if the price continues to fall.

Alibaba Group Misses EPS Expectations by $0.02 in Q1 2024 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA), a leading e-commerce and technology conglomerate, reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The company demonstrated moderate growth with revenue reaching RMB 221,874 million ($30,729 million), marking a 7% increase year-over-year. This growth was driven by the company’s China and international commerce businesses, which saw double-digit year-over-year GMV growth, and the accelerated growth of cloud computing revenues related to AI products.



Despite the revenue growth, Alibaba’s income from operations decreased by 3% year-over-year to RMB 14,765 million ($2,045 million). The company attributed this decrease to increased investments in its e-commerce businesses and retention incentives for Cainiao employees. Adjusted EBITA also saw a 5% decline, totaling RMB 23,969 million ($3,320 million). Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB 3,270 million ($453 million), a significant drop from the previous year, largely due to a net loss from investments in publicly-traded companies.



Alibaba Group Misses EPS Expectations in Q1 with $1.40 EPS



Alibaba’s performance in the March quarter of 2024 was a mixed bag when compared to market expectations. Analysts had projected earnings per share (EPS) of RMB 10.27 and revenue of RMB 220.32 billion. The actual revenue of RMB 221,874 million slightly exceeded expectations, showcasing the company’s ability to maintain growth in a competitive market. However, the company’s non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS came in at RMB 10.14 ($1.40), falling short of the expected EPS.



The discrepancy in earnings was primarily due to the company’s increased investments and the significant net loss from its equity investments, which impacted the bottom line. Net income for the quarter plummeted by 96% year-over-year to RMB 919 million ($127 million), highlighting the volatility in Alibaba’s investment portfolio. This stark decline overshadowed the revenue growth, raising concerns among investors about the sustainability of the company’s profitability in the short term.





Alibaba Group Repurchased $12.5 Billion of Shares During the Fiscal Year, Approved $4 Billion Dividend



Alibaba remains optimistic about its strategic priorities and future growth opportunities. CEO Eddie Wu emphasized the company’s commitment to enhancing customer experience and capturing growth in AI and cloud computing. The company expects strong revenue growth in public cloud and AI-related products to offset the decline in low-margin project-based revenues. This strategic shift is aimed at improving the overall profitability of



Alibaba’s cloud business saw a 3% year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter. Additionally, Alibaba’s board of directors approved a $4 billion dividend for fiscal year 2024, reflecting the company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders. The company also repurchased $12.5 billion of shares during the fiscal year, indicating strong confidence in its long-term prospects. These measures will likely bolster investor sentiment and cushion against short-term market fluctuations.



Strategic and Operational Updates



Regarding business segments, Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall Group reported a 4% year-over-year revenue growth to RMB 93,216 million ($12,910 million). The company achieved double-digit online GMV and order growth, driven by an increase in the number of purchasers and purchase frequency. The Cloud Intelligence Group recorded RMB 25,595 million ($3,545 million), with a strategic focus on high-quality revenues from public cloud adoption and AI products.



The Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group saw a robust 45% year-over-year revenue growth to RMB 27,448 million ($3,802 million), driven by its cross-border e-commerce initiatives. Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited also reported a 30% increase in revenue to RMB 24,557 million ($3,401 million), primarily due to cross-border fulfillment services. These segments underscore Alibaba’s diversified growth strategy and its efforts to enhance operational efficiency across various business units.



In conclusion, while Alibaba’s Q1 2024 performance showcased moderate revenue growth, the significant drop in net income and earnings per share highlighted the challenges posed by increased investments and volatile equity markets. However, the company’s strategic focus on AI, cloud computing, and international expansion, coupled with shareholder-friendly measures, positions it well for future growth and profitability.

                        DOGE has gained by 4% in the past 24 hours, with the Dogecoin price racing to $0.1504 after the return of GameStop trader ‘Roaring Kitty’ to X sent meme coins flying yesterday.Dogecoin is now up by 8.5% in a fortnight but down by 4.5% in a month, with the alt sitting on a 108% increase in the past year.The online return of Roaring Kitty – whose real name is Keith Gill – not only pushed GameStop’s stock up by close to 75% in a day, but has boosted various meme tokens, including DOGE, PEPE, WIF and Roaring Kitty (ROAR).The gains of such coins come on a day when the crypto market as a whole is down by 1%, suggesting that meme tokens may outperform averages in the near term.Dogecoin Price Prediction as DOGE Bounces 4.5% in a Day – What’s Causing the Pump?
DOGE’s chart is in a very promising position at the moment, with its indicators having perked up in the past day but still having room to intensify before we enter an overbought position.Most significantly, the coin’s 30-day average (orange) has just climbed over the 200-day (blue), forming a golden cross that often portends strong gains.Source: TradingViewThis has happened in the context of a rising relative strength index (purple), which touched 80 yesterday and remains in a promising position between 50 and 60.Given that the previous few days had seen a sustained loss, it’s likely that the Dogecoin price will continue to consolidate its recent gains in the near term.It’s also encouraging that DOGE’s 24-hour volume has shot up to $2 billion today, from $600 million barely 24 hours ago.This indicates some very strong interest, with DOGE outperforming most alts today, save for a handful of other meme tokens.As noted above, this is largely because ‘Roaring Kitty’ has posted online for the first time in three years, inviting speculation that he may begin trading again.Regardless of whether Gill actually begins another crusade, traders have pre-empted any possible pump by buying the likeliest meme tokens to benefit from his return.This includes DOGE, which, in the longer term, may end up benefiting massively from X’s introduction of digital payments.X has said it will introduce such payments this year, and if its options include crypto and DOGE, the latter could rocket.If not, it may reach $0.25 by the end of the summer and $0.4 by the end of the year.New Dogecoin Token Has Big Potential
While DOGE could continue to gain in the near term, it arguably doesn’t promise as much positive volatility as newer meme tokens, which can often outperform the market by big margins.While picking winners in advance is often a crap shoot with very new meme coins, one way of identifying stronger candidates is to look for successful presales.And one new meme coin with a very encouraging sale is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme coin that has raised over $15 million in its token offering.Source: DogeverseAs the first-ever Doge-themed multi-chain crypto, DOGEVERSE will run on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.By operating on multiple chains, it could gain much greater usage and traction that it would have as a single-chain coin, with the increased demand helping to push up its price.Helping with a higher price will be its max supply of 120 million tokens, which, over time, will potentially make the coin deflationary.Also, squeezing its supply will be the ability to stake the token, which will incentivize long-term holding on the part of owners.VIDEOWhile the coin’s presale will be ending soon, investors can still join its sale by going to the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE is $0.00031.This is its final presale price, with DOGEVERSE unlikely to be available so cheaply ever again.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Ripple files motion to seal remedies documents in ongoing SEC legal battle

Ripple Lab Inc. has filed a motion to restrain the process related to the remedies stage of its ongoing legal case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The motion, put forward on May 13, 2024, asks the court to shield Ripple‘s proprietary information. Ripple has cited reasons why the disclosure of information publicly might hurt its business and competitive standing.Ripple seeks to seal remedies documentsXRP’s lawyers are asking the Court to seal documents regarding potential remedies and penalties that the XRP developers may face should the company be decided guilty in the SEC case. According to James Filan, a well-known defense lawyer, this is in an effort to keep confidential the company’s proprietary business information and strategic details. Ripple presents that revealing such documents could allow one’s competitors to gain an unfair advantage over it and harm one’s market position.The company states that the security of these documents is fundamental to protecting its business in the midst of legal proceedings. If the motion to seal is granted, these files will be sealed, and even the public will be allowed to see them if the court or parties to the case are involved in the reviewing process. The company believes that such a measure would be essential for Ripple’s business strategies and proprietary information.Ripple CFO supports motion to sealJonathan Bilich XRP, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), filed a testimony declaring his support for the motion to seal. Bilich highlights that by not moving forward with the resolution, XRP could face a core business rupture. He highlights the potential financial losses, the disruption in operations, the loss of market confidence, facing heavy regulation, and many more. According to Bench, such a motion will preserve Ripple’s stability and market position for the duration of legal proceedings.The motion regarding sealing has stirred up the mixed feelings of the financial and crypto communities. While transparency supporters want the public to serve as a check and balance for fairness and accountability, XRP proponents are convinced that the company may face aggressive competitors and, therefore, need to improve the secrecy of their data. This discussion, thus, strikes at the heart of the wider debate on the conflict between transparency and business confidentiality in high-end litigation.Ripple-SEC case key for crypto regulationIn December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs, accusing it of selling XRP unlawfully through off-market, unregistered securities sales. According to the SEC, XRP is a security per federal securities rules, and Ripple regards this assertion with much contention. Ripple insists that XRP is not a security and has successfully repelled all the SEC’s charges against it.The decision, in this case, warrants deep consideration for regulating cryptocurrencies in the US. It could be a milestone in the development of the cryptocurrency sector by providing scenarios for the classification and regulation of digital currencies. XRP’s legal battle with the SEC is closely followed by players in the financial and crypto sector, as it may have a wide influence on the overall regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase Resumes Operations Following Four-Hour System Outage | Coinspeaker



The lack of a definitive explanation for the downtime led to speculation that it could have been due to server maintenance or system overload.

Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, has successfully restored its system back online after four long hours that seemed like an eternity to users. On May 14, Coinbase announced that it was hit by a major system outage that impacted its performance on both desktop and mobile devices.
In a social media post shared on X, the company described the incident as a “system-wide outage”, which resulted in the temporary unavailability of its services. The outage commenced at approximately 4:15 am UTC on Tuesday. However, after hours of locking users out of their accounts, the company’s support team announced on X that the services had been fully restored.






Coinbase Yet to Disclose Cause of System Outage
Initially, users attempting to visit the Coinbase website on desktop and mobile devices received a “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” error message.
While the company informed users about the “system-wide outage”, it did not include details of the exact cause of the downtime. Its support team took to X to notify users that the company had been unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the blackout while assuring users that their funds were safe.
The lack of a definitive explanation for the downtime led to speculation that it could have been due to server maintenance or system overload. According to a developer guide from Mozilla, overloading is one of the most common causes of such disruptions, which could have contributed to Coinbase issues.
Despite restoring the service back online, Coinbase has not disclosed the specific cause of the outage, leaving users and industry observers to speculate about the incident.
Not the First
Coinbase’s recent four-hour system outage is not an isolated incident for the publicly traded US-based company. Earlier this year, Coinbase was among several crypto exchanges that faced temporary blackouts in February.  The outages were triggered by a sudden surge in crypto trading activity during a Bitcoin (BTC) flash crash, which caused the asset’s price to plummet nearly 10% before recovering.
Coinbase also encountered another issue in March when some users reported difficulty accessing their accounts. The temporary glitch affected users’ ability to use the platform, with some traders even seeing a zero balance on their Coinbase accounts during the incident.
While outages can be frustrating for users of crypto exchanges, the experience is not limited to centralized platforms. Yesterday, Coinspeaker reported that Degen Chain, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, suffered a system outage that lasted more than 12 hours.
The outage led to temporal restriction of users’ access to other blockchain projects including bridges associated with the chain.
Last month, another blockchain protocol, Shibarium, a layer-2 network developed for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, suffered a system outage that affected the performance of  SHIB.

Equalizer DEX hacker drains funds: Users warned, investigation underway

A hacker began draining user funds on May 14 through the decentralized exchange (DEX) Equalizer. The misuse of funds only became apparent when the Equalizer team tweeted warning users to stop interacting with the exchange.So far, the hacker has drained around 2,353 Equalizer (EQUAL) and several other tokens from users. Though the value of the stolen tokens is low, the small transactions allowed the hacker to continue siphoning user funds under the radar.Source: EqualizerThe hacker’s  wallet address was established over 222 days ago and is continuing to receive the stolen user funds.The theft began with 2,500 SpookySwap liquidity tokens (spLP) being drained at around 4:10 am UTC on May 14, which led to many other tokens being taken from users.The total number of tokens drained so far include:As a result, EQUAL price is down almost 11% on the day to around $8.90.To add insult to injury, a scammer then created a fake Equalizer X account and posted how affected users could claim a refund.Source: Fake Equalizer account It is not yet clear whether all the tokens were drained through the Equalizer DEX, but the Equalizer team is currently still investigating the exploit. Through the Equalizer Discord channel, the team announced a preventative measure for users to take to stop further loss of funds:“If connecting to the dapp [[Connect Wallet]] asks you to Approve something, immediately Stop using that site. If the dapp asks you to interact with a contract you have never interacted with earlier, Stop using that site. If it asks you to approve any contract that is unknown or not in our docs, Stop using that site.”


Equalizer Discord member “543” informed the community that users are safe if they “did not interact with Equalizer Websites since 6 hours ago.” However, if users interacted with the websites in the last six hours, “543” requested that users “please revoke all your approvals made during this time.”Source: Equalizer Discord channelThe team is “working on restoring the main website” and has informed users to avoid using the main website until updated.

After years of quiet, Roaring Kitty gets loud


A small-time retail trader named Keith Gill — also known online as Roaring Kitty and DeepFuckingValue — who is famous for helping GameStop become the meme stock of the century around 2021 has reappeared on X (formerly Twitter) after years of silence.

Gill’s videos and live streams, which often advocated for investors to examine their own financial situation and take profit accordingly, were referenced in front of Congress, where he testified and stated, simply, “I like the stock.”
The influential tweeter made his return on Monday and since then has posted a dozen tweets, all videos, all suggestive memes.
Part of Gill’s testimony pointed out that GameStop retained value in its physical locations. Since then, over 200 locations have closed, according to a website that tracks the closing of GameStop locations.
Judging by Gill’s tweets, it appears as though he’s expressing some disappointment, either with how management has handled GameStop since the run-up in stock price, or how the entire financial system has reacted since the blowup of RobinHood in 2021.

Amazon-backed Anthropic brings Claude AI chatbot to European users

The artificial intelligence (AI) developer Anthropic announced that its AI chatbot Claude is now available in Europe for use by both individuals and businesses, according to a blog post. On May 14, the company said that its AI assistant is now accessible via its web application and iOS app with “strong levels of comprehension and fluency” in multiple European languages, including French, German, Spanish and Italian.


The development follows the launch of Claude 3, its most powerful system that can analyze images, in the United States in March 2024. Previously, to access the chatbot, Europeans could only do so by using a virtual private network (VPN). The announcement comes shortly after its launch of the Claude API in Europe earlier this year — a feature that allows developers to integrate Anthropic’s AI models into applications, websites, or services.Cointelegraph reached out to Anthropic for further information on its European release. Users on X have been commenting on Claude's emergence in Europe, noting that while ChatGPT still excels in reasoning, Claude is demonstrating superior eloquence in writing.While writing quality can be somewhat subjective, our European correspondent Savannah Fortis put Claude 3 to the test in a small head-to-head with ChatGPT. In both instances, the free version of the chatbots was used. Related: Mistral AI startup launches LLM to take on ChatGPT, Gemini and ClaudeWhen prompted to “write a short poem about Europe,” both chatbots incorporated key elements of multiple European countries as a part of the content of the poem. However, Claude’s writing quality stood out and was more accurate in providing a “short poem” with only a handful of stanzas. Claude’s poem was more coherent as a full story, whereas ChatGPT had nice rhymes on theme, though they sounded more like phrases put together rather than telling a story.

Over the last year it has secured investments from some of the biggest names in tech, including Amazon who committed an investment of up to $4 billion in September 2023 and a $2 billion commitment from Google the month after.On April 5, Anthropic launched a beta of its feature “tool use” for all Anthropic Message API users for the Claude suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models. This enables real-time information lookup, access and integration of third-party features into Claude’s workflow; allowing users to insert code snippets to their account to allow Claude to bring in outside information into conversations.

CFTC Warns Students and Job Seekers about Crypto Money Mule Scams | Coinspeaker



The CFTC says that young people, students and job seekers should be careful as unwitting money mules are still liable to criminal charges.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has warned young people, including students and remote job seekers, about scams that use unsuspecting job seekers as crypto money mules. In a release published Monday, the CFTC’s Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO) warns of the dangers of these scams, which help criminals to launder money.
CFTC Warns Job Seekers Warned About Become Money Mules
According to the OCEO, young people could end up in jail simply by associating with illicit activity. These money mule scams get people to use their crypto wallets, trading accounts, or other digital wallets to send and receive money or transfer funds from one person to another. Job seekers are sometimes easy targets because they may believe the requests are legitimate “secret shopper” or “payment processor” activities. OCEO Director Melanie Devoe stated:




“Young people looking for summer jobs may be just looking for part-time income and could be attracted to offers that require being online a few hours a day. Unfortunately, they could become unwitting accomplices to money laundering or what the criminals call ‘money mules,’ and that association could land them in jail.”
The OCEO writes that criminal organizations use networks of people to move illicit funds to evade law enforcement. These fund transfers and currency conversions seem legit as young people and job seekers usually think they are performing regular job duties. In other instances unrelated to job seeking, victims may believe they are helping a friend or doing a love interest a favor.
Unfortunately, according to the CFTC, “the consequences – often in the form of criminal charges – remain the same for witting and unwitting participants.”
In some cases, scammers may convince the victims to on-ramp cash to a blockchain. This involves using cash to buy crypto via a trading account, or even a Bitcoin kiosk, and then sending the crypto to a specified wallet. There is also off-ramping, which requires people to convert crypto tokens to fiat currency, essentially withdrawing the money from the blockchain.
Methods Used by Criminals
Cryptocurrency transfers are an easy way for criminals to move illicit funds under the radar. However, criminals are also aware that despite some anonymity in blockchain use, law enforcement agencies are getting better at tracing and confiscating illicit assets. Consequently, criminals get unsuspecting victims to help them off-ramp the money and then move the fiat from the victim’s bank account to another.
The OCEO’s release also highlights another common scam called “smurfing”. Using crypto, criminals send a large amount to an unsuspecting person’s wallet or trading account. The person is then expected to send small amounts to several wallet addresses.
The CFTC’s release is part of its participation in the Money Mule Initiative, an annual international movement to dismantle money laundering networks. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) reported that through this year’s campaign alone, law enforcement agencies have taken action against over 3,000 money mules. The agencies have also brought charges against 24 individuals.

AI-powered social engineering not technical exploits now dominating 90% of cyber attacks

A newly published cyber threat report from Avast has revealed substantial dominance of social engineering in cyber threats during the first quarter of 2024. Per the report, nearly 90% of cyberattacks on mobile and 87% on desktop devices involved scams, phishing, and malvertising, exploiting human vulnerabilities more than technical weaknesses.A significant rise in scams using sophisticated technologies like deepfake videos and AI-manipulated audio was noted. These scams often utilize hijacked YouTube channels and other social media platforms to spread fraudulent content. The report highlighted that such deceptive practices are becoming more complex, with cybercriminals leveraging high-profile events and figures to enhance the credibility of their scams.YouTube, in particular, has emerged as a critical vector for these threats. Avast’s telemetry indicated that in the previous year, four million unique users were protected against YouTube-based threats, with around 500,000 users shielded in the first quarter alone. Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting YouTube’s automated advertising and user-generated content features to sidestep traditional security measures, deploying a variety of attack vectors from phishing campaigns to malware distribution.The report outlined several prevalent scam tactics on YouTube:Phishing campaigns specifically target creators with fraudulent collaboration offers, leading to malware dissemination and account compromises.Attackers post videos with descriptions containing malicious links, disguising them as legitimate downloads for popular software.Channel hijacking, where attackers gain control of YouTube accounts to push various scams, including crypto schemes that often start with fake giveaways.Attackers exploit reputable software brands and create domains that mimic legitimate companies to distribute malware disguised as genuine software.Beyond individual platforms, the broader trend of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) was identified as a growing sector within cybercrime. Criminals rent out malware, facilitating a commission-based partnership where even less experienced hackers can launch attacks. This model simplifies the process of executing cyberattacks, making advanced tools accessible to a broader range of criminals.Malware types such as DarkGate and Lumma Stealer were specifically mentioned for their propagation methods, including spreading via platforms like Microsoft Teams and YouTube. These methods underscore the continual evolution of cybercriminal strategies, emphasizing the role of social engineering.Jakub Kroustek, Malware Research Director at Gen, remarked on the severity of the situation,“In the first quarter of 2024, we reported the highest ever cyber risk ratio – meaning the highest probability of any individual being the target of a cyberattack.”He added that human vulnerabilities are a significant focus for cybercriminals, who exploit emotional responses and curiosity to gain access to personal information and financial assets.As technically focused exploits and hacks in crypto have fallen over the past year, Avast’s report showcases how non-technical attacks have risen. Human vulnerabilities are often the hardest aspects of op-sec and AI appears to already have made sufficient progress to offer a considerable challenge for security experts.Latest Alpha Market Report

President Biden blocks Chinese-backed crypto miner near Wyoming nuclear site


After a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining firm tried to buy land near a nuclear missile base in Wyoming, United States, President Joe Biden issued an order preventing this purchase, citing “national security risk” due to the vicinity of the nuclear site.
Specifically, the order prohibits the purchase and demands the divestment of the real estate belonging to a company largely owned by Chinese nationals and located within one mile of Francis E. Warren Air Force Base (F.E. Warren AFB), according to the US Treasury Department’s press release on May 13.
Also, it seeks “the removal of certain improvements and equipment at the property by MineOne Partners Limited, (…) majority owned by nationals of the People’s Republic of China; MineOne Cloud Computing Investment I L.P.; MineOne Data Center LLC; and MineOne Wyoming Data Center LLC (collectively MineOne), as well as their affiliates.”


Reasoning behind Biden’s order
Furthermore, listing the reasons for this decision, the press release stated that F.E. Warren AFB is a “strategic missile base and home to Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles” and that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) had investigated this transaction.
Commenting on the President’s decision, the US Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen explained that:

“Today’s divestment order (…) highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security, particularly as it relates to transactions that present risk to sensitive US military installations as well as those involving specialized equipment and technologies.”

Crypto issue in Trump – Biden race
As a reminder, the incumbent US President has received scathing criticism from the crypto community due to his perceived hostility toward crypto assets, heightened after his recent announcement that he would veto legislation enabling highly regulated financial firms to act as custodians for crypto assets.
In response, his main opponent in the presidential race, former US President Donald Trump, expressed support for the crypto sector, arguing that Biden didn’t understand crypto but that he himself was “fine with it,” suggesting that other crypto supporters should vote for him, as Finbold reported on May 9.

All Eyes on Bitcoin Turned to Powell's Statements: What Time Will He Speak? Will There Be a Powell Pump in Prices? What are the expectations? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Although the high inflation that the FED has been struggling with for a long time has receded slightly, it is still above the FED's 2% inflation target.
At this point, while the possibility of the FED reducing interest rates is decreasing day by day, and the uncertainties regarding the FED's next term interest policy continue to make pricing difficult, all eyes in the markets are today on FED Chairman Jerome Powell's statements and PPI data.


While the signals to be received from the inflation data that will be announced in the US economy starting today are expected to increase volatility in the markets, the results of the New York FED's Consumer Expectations Survey for April, which was recently announced, increased concerns.
According to the survey results, while consumers' short-term inflation expectations increased, analysts stated that both the increase in inflation expectations and the cautious stance of FED officials negatively affected the risk appetite in the markets.





At this point, while analysts think that today's PPI and Powell's statements may affect investor decisions, he said that CPI data will be followed tomorrow.
Analysts also added that the question marks regarding the FED's next term road map may decrease after the PPI and CPI data.


Will Powell Pump Come to Bitcoin?
PPI and CPI data, which are among the important data followed by the FED for inflation, and FED President Jerome Powell's statements regarding interest rates have a great impact on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
The analyst, who thinks that this week's CPI, Core CPI, PPI and FED president's speech will affect the direction of the Bitcoin price, expects volatility to increase in BTC after Powell's statements and data.





At this point, some analysts state that Powell's speech will have a positive impact on the BTC price and there will be an increase, while others think that we will see inflation data slow down for the first time, if not this month, then soon.
FED President Jerome Powell will speak at the Dutch Foreign Bankers Association panel. His speech will start at 17.00 Türkiye time.

Uniswap Marks $4B Mobile Swaps, Brings L3 Projects Soon | Cryptopolitan

Uniswap has reached a milestone of $4B swaps through its mobile app. Decentralized trading is still comparatively small against big exchange volumes, but has helped grow the crypto and DeFi infrastructure, while offering highly accessible swaps. The potential for swaps means some of the trades are borderless and permissionless. Uniswap has added an optional feature for Know Your Customer (KYC) screenings, but some pairs may be accessible without the process. The Uniswap web app also offers limit orders, to simulate centralized trading and automate decisions. Uniswap is also available on more than seven leading L1 blockchains in addition to Ethereum, hosting their newly minted tokens. The most active chains include Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, XDAI, Optimism, and Polygon.The Uniswap team also claims that its high liquidity and leading position allow the DEX to offer better swaps compared to price aggregators. For wallet holders using the web app, Uniswap also offers easier swapping by switching between different wallets and networks. The Uniswap team is also highly active in adding new features, with 53 weekly commits to the codebase. Uniswap Hints at L3 AssetsUniswap sent out a cryptic message, which may be taken as a suggestion the exchange will carry L3 assets of some form. Layer 3, or L3, emerged as a new moniker for restaking tokens, or other assets based on locking collaterals of ETH. There is no clear list of what makes an L3 asset, as most restaking protocols started as tokenless projects. However, some of those projects rewarded points or other placeholder balances. Restaking protocols are thus setting expectations of launching a new wave of tokens and a new level of decentralized complexity. The next months may bring the L3 trend on Ethereum to fruition. Uniswap is also facing the challenge of absorbing Bitcoin-based DeFi and tokens. Which Layer 3 Will Go to Uniswap?Uniswap has not clearly stated it would list a specific Layer 3 project, or simply allow liquidity building for a series of new tokens. Making the best guess, the protocol in question may be Layer3XYZ, which is preparing to launch its native asset this summer. Layer3XYZ already aggregates L3 and restaking protocols, making the process easier. In L3, earning points and keeping track of all gains may be difficult, especially after the launch of multiple restaking pools and hubs. Layer3XYZ aims to reflect the entire L3 ecosystem in a single native token, coming up soon. L3 grew after the boom of EigenLayer, which became a leader in restaked ETH tokens and in issuing point-based rewards. So far, there is no clear list of the reward platforms on EigenLayer, and it is uncertain which ones would be ready to launch tokens. Uniswap Still Leads DEX RosterUniswap is still contributing to the usage of Ethereum’s blockchain, and remains among the most used DEX. The gas fees paid in a month indicate Uniswap usage. The exchange hosts both user-generated transactions, and MEV bots to optimize swaps. Uniswap is the leader in terms of both daily trades and total value locked. The current DeFi season is slower compared to 2021, but Uniswap still caries $5.36B in value locked. This is more than double compared to the closest competitor, PancakeSwap. The DEX carries around $1.32B in daily volumes for all versions and liquidity pools. Close to 50% of that activity is through the Ethereum-based Uniswap V3. Activity statistics also show Uniswap communicates with 156K unique wallets daily, even though some of those addresses are linked to trading bots. Uniswap has recovered more than 50% of its peak value locked. One of the reasons for the lower value is the native token, UNI. During peak times, UNI traded close to $40, but now Uniswap has to deal with a native asset at $6.90. For 2024, UNI peaked at around $15 before the April correction.The leading DEX continues to carry major assets, including highly active meme tokens. Additionally, Uniswap almost constantly lists new tokens with no barrier to entry except for liquidity. Those new tokens are held by a few dozen users at best, and are often risky and volatile. Their liquidity pools are often under 10 wETH.

Coinbase CLO Rallies Binance, Ripple, Uniswap to Resist SEC's 'Gaslighting'

Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of Coinbase Global Inc., has called on other crypto platforms on the U.S. SEC’s radar to reject the commission’s crack-down approach.Coinbase CLO points out SEC’s gaslightingAccording to Paul Grewal, the Securities and Exchange Commission refuses to provide clarity on its crackdown tactics. It is worth noting that Coinbase has a major legal brawl with the market regulator over the alleged support for securities tokens.To drive home his point, Grewal tagged other firms the regulator has sued or issued a Wells Notice to. He called on Binance, Ripple, Uniswap, Robinhood and Kraken to ask whether or not they got full clarity on the key reasons behind the Wells Notice or charges levied against them.To Grewal, that the SEC brings up charges without a "thorough explanation" is straight-up gaslighting before Judge Shelby and the United States District Court. He believes this is wrong and should not stand. There are different claims against the SEC’s stance that some of the top altcoins on the market are securities. The ruling from Judge Analisa Torres that XRP in itself is not a security forms the most defined clarity over the past year.Grasping at strawsDespite the clarity the XRP ruling provided, the regulator is still grasping at straws and is vehemently pursuing remedies from Ripple. This remedy stems from the part of the ruling that faults the company for selling XRP to institutional investors.Some of the SEC’s targets, including Robinhood, have revealed several attempts to connect with the SEC to discuss its process. In all, the SEC’s inconsistent feedback has left a major gray area that it is hanging on to sue crypto players.There is a major trend now, however, and it hinges on the readiness of these affected firms to fight their case in court.

Roaring Kitty's Return Sparks Rally: Future of Meme Coins?


In the financial world, few stories are captivated, like that of Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty. This former financial analyst turned stock influencer sparked the 2021 GameStop (GME) short squeeze. 
His actions shook Wall Street, capturing the global attention. After a significant hiatus, Gill has recently returned to social media, sparking renewed interest in both traditional and crypto markets.
Who is Roaring Kitty?
Known under the alias “DeepFuckingValue,” Gill became a hero on platforms like Reddit and YouTube. He was a vocal advocate for GameStop, a company that was largely considered faltering at the time. Many institutional investors and hedge funds had shorted GME, expecting its value to decline further.
However, the narrative took a sharp turn when GME shares, initially valued at around $5.16, surged to exceed $490 in 2021. This price inflation was primarily driven by users from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. 
Gill’s posts there had inspired a collective action to trigger a short squeeze. This market maneuver occurs when rising stock prices compel short sellers to purchase shares at increasing rates, thereby escalating the stock price even further.
From an initial investment of $53,000, Gill’s stakes in GME soared to an impressive $48 million at the peak of the market upheaval. His significant role in this market anomaly brought him before Congress for testimony and was later depicted in the film “Dumb Money.”

Will Cat-Theme Meme Coins Pump?
Upon his return to the public eye with an X (Twitter) post in mid-2021, Gill once again stirred the investment world. The post featured an image of a man intently using a video game controller. It quickly sparked discussions in stock investment circles and in the crypto domain. 
Influencers like Andrew Tate announced shifts in their investment strategies, from Bitcoin to GameStop stocks and various meme coins. Tate said he would sell $500,000 in Bitcoin to invest in the latest GameStop short squeeze. Moreover, he put the ticker symbol of GME on his X bio.


The resurgence of interest following Gill’s tweet extended to meme coins, a sector known for its high volatility and speculative nature. These digital assets, often inspired by internet memes, experienced a noticeable boost. 
For instance, the Roaring Kitty (KITTY) meme coin saw remarkable trading activity, with one trader turning a $3,000 investment into $94,000 almost overnight due to a sudden price surge.
Now, investors and spectators alike are pondering the future of meme coins in this revived market environment. Several of Gill’s videos hint at a potential preference for cat-themed meme coins, possibly heralding the next big rally in this quirky asset class.
On-chain analysis firm – Lookonchain indicates that smart investors are already positioning themselves in cat-related meme coins like POPCAT, MANEKI, and KITTY.


“Maybe the next Dogecoin (DOGE) will be among the cat-themed meme coins,” Lookonchain said.


As the market adapts, the influence of internet personalities like Roaring Kitty is undeniable. His ability to mobilize public opinion and challenge traditional investment strategies reshapes financial landscapes.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Dips Below $62K Ahead of U.S. Inflation Figures

Bitcoin fell below $62,000 during the European morning on Tuesday, losing about 1.63% over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a broad measurement of the digital asset market as a whole, fell almost 1.1%. Ether declined more than 2% to just above $2,900, while solana was largely unchanged at $145. In the next 24 hours, attention will turn to inflation reports out of the U.S. The latest Producer Price Index (PPI) is set for release at 08:30 ET today and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is due tomorrow. Stubbornly high inflation has previously put paid to hopes of rate cuts in the U.S., which can have the effect of a handbrake on risk assets such as crypto.

                        Adopting a potential digital euro won’t displace the Swedish krona, Sweden’s central bank said.In a staff memo published Tuesday, the Sveriges Riksbank indicated it sees potential benefits for Sweden in the digital euro. It highlighted the possibility of a more robust and competitive payment system.The bank added that there may be a small shift away from traditional bank deposits. However, the Riksbank believes any impact will be limited due to the proposed cap on individual holdings of digital euros.Using the digital euro might extend beyond the eurozone. While it’s designed for eurozone countries, a proposal allows non-eurozone members to potentially join the system through agreements with the European Central Bank (ECB). This could give residents and businesses in those countries access to the digital euro on equal footing with those in the eurozone.Sweden’s central bank downplayed the impact of a potential agreement, arguing that institutional factors won’t “crowd out” the krona. Firstly, payments involving the government are conducted in Swedish kronor, solidifying its position as the primary currency, it said.“For instance, given we pay our taxes in Swedish kronor, we also prefer to receive our salary in Swedish kronor,” the Riksbank said. “And when businesses pay salaries, their main expenditures, in Swedish kronor, they prefer to charge customers in Swedish kronor.”Also, Swedes can use digital euros even if they haven’t visited or lived in the eurozone before. Meanwhile, businesses in Sweden can accept digital euro payments, but they must transfer them directly to a bank account, just like businesses in the eurozone.EU Moves Forward with Digital Euro Exploration
The European Central Bank (ECB) launched a two-year planning stage for the digital euro project late last year. Its goals for this period include finalizing the rules, choosing private sector partners, and running tests and experiments.According to the EU’s draft proposal, which might be revised before release, advantages with a digital euro are significant. Meanwhile, the potential downsides tied to not having one could be substantial.The draft rules give the ECB the authority to restrict how much money individuals can hold in digital form. A possible limit of between 3,000 to 4,000 euros is being discussed.Swedish e-Krona Hinges on Digital Euro
A potential downside of the digital euro is that it could threaten the Swedish krona’s stability. High inflation can lead to price swings. If this becomes a problem in Sweden, businesses might switch to pricing things in euros. People might also choose to hold more of their money in euros (seen as a more stable currency) instead of krona. This “flight to quality” could weaken the krona.Further, the decision to launch a digital Swedish krona, or e-krona, hinges on the development of the digital euro. An e-krona would bolster the Swedish krona’s position within Sweden if the digital euro becomes widely used, according to the bank.Additionally, leveraging the technology and regulations built for the digital euro could significantly reduce the cost and complexity of launching an e-krona. Finally, the coexistence of both digital currencies could lead to smoother cross-border payments, it said.

Dutch court finds Tornado Cash dev Alexey Pertsev guilty of laundering $1.2B - Crypto Briefing




A Dutch court at ‘s-Hertogenbosch has convicted Alexey Pertsev, a 31-year-old Russian national and developer of the crypto mixing platform Tornado Cash, of laundering $1.2 billion in illicit assets.The three-judge panel is expected to sentence Pertsev on Tuesday, and his lawyers will have 14 days to appeal the decision.The verdict is set to have a significant impact on the future of privacy in decentralized finance, as experts believe it will create a “chilling effect” on the development of open-source software that provides users with financial privacy tools.During the trial in March, prosecutors argued that Pertsev did not do enough to prevent criminals from using Tornado Cash, while the defense countered that the open-source and automated nature of the smart contracts at the heart of the platform meant Pertsev could not be held accountable for the actions of anonymous and independent users.Tornado Cash is a decentralized protocol designed to obfuscate transaction histories on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a solution to the inherent privacy issues of publicly visible and immutable records.Despite this definition, however, prosecutors rejected the idea that the technological concepts outweighed legal obligations to prevent platforms from aiding criminals and sanctioned entities, such as North Korean cybercrime groups, in concealing the origins of stolen assets.Public prosecutor Martine Boerlage argued that Tornado Cash was run like a company, despite claims that it operated without leadership.The platform has been used to launder crypto from hacks and heists worth over $7 billion, according to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, with the North Korean cybercrime organization Lazarus Group being a key abuser of the protocol.The crypto industry has shown support for Pertsev through advocacy efforts, petitions, and attempts to cover his legal fees. Fellow Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm is facing similar charges in the US, with his trial scheduled for September 23. Experts speculate that Pertsev’s guilty verdict may foreshadow Storm’s fate.Note: This story is developing and will be updated with statements from involved parties.

AI Could Send Smart Contract Platforms to Massive $25,000,000,000,000 Valuation, Says Analyst Jamie Coutts - The Daily Hodl


								Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts says that the layer-1 crypto sector could see a staggering rise in valuation driven by artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
Coutts says on the social media platform X that the total market value of all smart contract platforms could reach a 14-figure price tag in the next six years.










“By 2030, the combined market value of smart contract platforms, driven by the expanding use by AI agents could reach between $15 trillion and $25 trillion.”

The analyst shares an excerpt from his firm’s Pro-Crypto November 2023 report that suggests AI will increase the demand for on-chain verification and authentication services. The report also says that human-directed or autonomous AI agents could make use of smart contract platforms to exchange value, significantly increasing the growth rate.
“By incorporating an ‘AI growth factor’ starting in 2026, which adds 10% to the annual growth rate, we can begin to gauge this impact. Initially, the effect is modest, but by 2030, AI agents could comprise over 40% of total daily active users (DAU). This obviously creates some rather astronomical valuations for the blockchain assets, which will benefit from the transaction fees generated by an increasing number of AI agents.”

Coutts further says that even if the report’s prediction is partially correct, the combined market capitalization of smart contract platforms would still witness tremendous growth.
“Projections based on historical regressions will not hold indefinitely. The key point is that, directionally, network value increases exponentially as the network expands. Even if I am 25% correct on where this all goes, then it’s still a 4x to 5x from the current market cap levels.”

At time of writing, the total market cap of top layer-1 crypto projects is sitting at $1.88 trillion, according to CoinGecko.

Pepe Jumps 19% to All-Time High Following Roaring Kitty Return - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsPEPE has hit a new all time high after climbing 19% in the past 24 hours. This comes after Roaring Kitty’s return has seen GameStop and other memes continue to soar.Financial analyst Roaring Kitty was a central figure to the 2021 GameStop short squeeze which saw the r/WallStreetBets subreddit community attempting to take down hedge funds by purchasing meme stocks. Yesterday, the figure returned to social media after a three year hiatus which saw GameStop double in value and a new meme frenzy begin.The third largest coin in the meme category, according to CoinGecko, started seeing steady gains due to the meme influencer returning. One of his tweets featured a reimagining of a scene from Gangs of New York with the characters’ skin turned green—just like Pepe the frog. It appears this was bullish for the Pepe community with the token jumping 5.5% in a matter of minutes.Roaring Kitty (also known as Keith Gill) returning also sparked a slew of Solana meme coins to launch, with a Pump.fun record being set. Other meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba, and Dogwifhat have also seen significant gains.After Gill’s Gangs of New York tweet, Pepe traded mostly sideways until Coinbase experienced a “system wide outage” early this morning. This saw Pepe’s price periodically fall before unconfirmed rumors began to circulate that the centralized exchange was preparing to list the meme coin and crashed as a result.Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.“Looks like Coinbase is down for maintenance again! Maybe they are getting everything ready before they list PEPE,” one Twitter user said. “The volume is gonna [be] 10x and they need to prepare.”It’s worth repeating: There are currently no confirmed reports that Coinbase is going to list PEPE. But the mere suggestion has been enough to cause the meme coin to jump 9% to an all-time high of $0.00001096.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Coins.ph to Trial Stablecoin in Philippines' Remittance Market, Here's Why


							

Approval of Coins.ph’s stablecoin trial signals the Philippines’ openness to blockchain innovation.



PHPC could enhance remittance efficiency, benefiting both senders and recipients.



Amidst regulatory changes, digital payment firms vie for a stake in the Philippines’ remittance market.




The financial realm of the Philippines stands on the brink of change as the central bank gives the green light to Coins.ph to experiment with a groundbreaking stablecoin in the nation’s crucial remittance market. This decision represents a noteworthy progression in the quest to update the remittance sector, which ranks among the largest globally, aiming to boost its effectiveness and accessibility.



Coins.ph, known for its digital currency exchange services, is preparing to introduce PHPC, a stablecoin linked to the Philippine Peso. This comes after receiving approval from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Under the BSP’s Regulatory Sandbox Framework, the stablecoin will be backed by Coins.ph’s reserves held in Philippine bank accounts, ensuring stability and reliability.



Led by Wei Zhou, formerly Binance’s Chief Financial Officer, Coins.ph aims to introduce PHPC to its platform by early June, following a successful pilot phase. The pilot will gauge the stablecoin’s viability in real-world scenarios and its impact on the existing financial ecosystem. If specific benchmarks are met, full approval is anticipated, allowing Coins.ph to transition out of the sandbox environment.









This development comes amidst the Philippines’ decision to restrict Binance’s operations within its borders and its commitment to launch a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) within the next two years, steering clear of a retail CBDC. Concurrently, digital payments firm Strike has expanded its global money transfer services to the Philippines, further diversifying the remittance landscape.



Expanding its reach, digital payments company Strike has now extended its global money transfer service to the Philippines. This strategic move allows Strike to access the country’s lucrative $12 billion remittance market. It underscores the increasing need within the nation for streamlined and economical options for cross-border transactions.



Coins.ph envisions integrating PHPC into remittance platforms across countries with substantial remittance flows to the Philippines, promising greater efficiency and lower transaction costs for overseas Filipino workers and their families. This move is poised to revolutionize cross-border payments, streamlining processes and fostering financial inclusion.

                        PEPE has hit a new all-time high in the past couple of hours, with the Pepe Coin price currently sitting at $0.00001039 and enjoying a 19% gain today.The meme token’s current price also represents a 23% gain in a week and a hefty 92% increase in a month, with its price benefitting from the return of legendary meme-stock trader Roaring Kitty to X.And with PEPE also up by 440% in a year, it has strong enough momentum to continue rising for the foreseeable future.It could potentially continue breaking its current ATH over the next few days, particularly if Roaring Kitty’s return does instigate a big bull run for meme tokens.Pepe Coin Price Prediction as PEPE Hits New All-Time High – Can PEPE 100x From Here?
PEPE’s indicators are definitely looking bullish right now, with its 30-day average (orange) racing ahead of its 200-day (blue).Its relative strength index (purple) also shot above 80 yesterday evening, and while it has declined a little, its position remains high.Source: TradingViewIn other words, the momentum is still there, with PEPE’s rising resistance (red) and support (green) levels also pointing towards further gains in the near term.What’s particularly bullish is that whales have been buying the meme coin in the past day, indicating an expectation that PEPE will continue to build on its gains.As the tweet below shows, PEPE has seen big purchases during its current run, which is encouraging insofar as you’d expect the whales concerned to hold onto the token for a little while longer at least.Also positive is the aforementioned return of Keith Gill, who under the alias Roaring Kitty led the infamous 2021 GameStop rally and helped spearhead the whole meme-stocks movement.His return may indicate a renewed impetus for that movement, something that could help meme tokens such as PEPE continue to climb to new heights.However, retail investors should be cautious that Gill’s return doesn’t necessarily mean we’re going to have a new GameStops phenomenon in the coming months.Also, with PEPE reaching a new all-time high today, traders should also be wary that it may correct a little before it rises again.As such, they may prefer to hold off from buying PEPE today and wait for a dip, since the coin has actually declined by 3% in the past hour.Yet once this minor correction has ended, the Pepe Coin price could reach $0.000011 or $0.000012 in the next week or so.New Meme Tokens May Also Be Big Gainers
While PEPE is probably the strongest major meme token in the market at the moment, there are numerous newer meme coins that could outperform it in the coming weeks.This includes various presale tokens that have been attracting investors as they prepare to launch, with Sealana (SEAL) – a Solana-based meme token – being one of the most promising.It has raised more than $750,000 in its token offering and is on course to hit $1 million soon, such is the growing investor interest in the token.It’s clear that the market’s appetite for meme coins – particularly Solana-based coins – remains very strong and that SEAL is benefitting from this.It has chosen a distinct meme for itself, adopting a bumbling seal as its mascot, who represents the widespread desire among retail traders to make a quick buck via crypto.One other bullish feature of SEAL is that it has recently announced an Ethereum version of its token, making it a multi-chain meme coin.This should help boost demand for the coin, with investors able to join its sale by visiting the official Sealana website.They can buy SEAL by sending SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.The token is available at an exchange rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which converts to $0.021.VIDEOGiven that meme tokens look ready to continue outperforming the market for the foreseeable future, SEAL is likely to eclipse such a price once it lists.Buy SEAL Today

Vitalik Buterin proposes Ethereum gas model overhaul

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new Ethereum Improvement Protocol (EIP) 7706 focused on a new gas model for the transaction call data.Ethereum-based transactions currently have two types of gas fees: one for transaction execution, which covers the computational effort required to perform a transaction, and one for storage, which is the cost of storing data in “blobs.”Buterin’s (EIP) 7706 proposes a third form of gas exclusively for call data, the portion of an Ethereum transaction containing key data transmitted to smart contracts. This means the Ethereum blockchain will allocate a unique charge to data transferred during transactions, separate from the costs of executing contract code or storing data. The new gas model will add a transaction type that provides max_basefee and priority_fee as a vector, providing values for execution gas, blob gas and call data gas.At present, the base fee adjustment uses separate mechanisms for the transaction execution cost and the data storage in the form of blobs. However, Buterin suggested that with the introduction of a third type of gas fee, the Ethereum network should adopt a common approach for all three types of gas fees.Related: ZK-proofs introduce security challenges for developersThe move aims to reduce the transaction costs associated with transactions that are data-heavy but not necessarily computationally intensive. If the proposal is accepted, the Ethereum network will be responsible for setting the call data costs independently of other costs. Buterin recommended managing all three forms of gas via a dynamic model that modifies fees simultaneously.Buterin suggested that by implementing a separate gas fee for call data, The “theoretical max call data size of a block would be greatly reduced, while basic economic analysis suggests that on average, call data would become considerably cheaper.”The Ethereum network has struggled with gas fee issues for years now and the main motivation to move from the proof-of-work mining consensus to a proof-of-stake (PoS) was to become more scalable and less costly. However, such critical changes haven’t improved the network’s scalability as promised. Thus, these EIPs come in as a timely aid for the network.Magazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?

Roaring Kitty Resurfaces on Social Media, Returns with Cryptic Messages



After almost three years of silence on social media, Gill has resurfaced on Twitter, sending the investing community into a frenzy.

Keith Gill, more popularly known as “Roaring Kitty” or “DeepFuckingValue”, made an unexpected return to Twitter on Sunday. The widely celebrated return follows a hiatus that lasted nearly three years, leaving his followers beaming with anticipation and speculation about his whereabouts or what his next crypto moves would be.
Who Is Roaring Kitty?
Gill rose to prominence in 2021 as one of the key figures behind the GameStop stock buzz. His bold investment calls, which he shared on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, led thousands of retail investors to rally behind GameStop, causing its stock price to skyrocket massively.




The price surge, which he predicted, was so shocking that the profits he made from his investment earned him a hearing as he was called to testify before the US Congress House Committee on Financial Services at the time.
On February 18, 2021, during the hearing, Gill cleared any notions that he may be an institutional investor or a hedge fund. Part of his statement at the time reads:
“I’m just an individual whose investment in GameStop, and posts on social media are based upon my own research and analysis.”
Now, after months of relative silence on social media, Gill has resurfaced on Twitter, sending the investing community into a frenzy. His return, however, has been met with a mix of excitement and curiosity. Some of his followers can’t wait to hear his thoughts on the current state of the market and his latest investment strategies. That is, if he has any. Others, however, wonder why he is making an appearance at this particular moment in time.
Investment Community Anticipates
Interestingly, Gill has taken off from where he left after tweeting in his typical cryptic manner. His return tweet was an image post of a man sitting up in his seat and holding a video game controller. Although he did not mention anything related to GameStop, the price of GME immediately doubled before a 1,900% surge in a Solana-based tribute coin, also named GME.
The image appears to suggest a statement along the line of “let’s do this”, leaving his followers speculating that he may be gearing up for another big play. In all of this, though, one thing is clear. Gill’s influence on the market remains significant. At least, that is what the engagement on his post suggests. His ability to influence retail investors has also not gone unnoticed by Wall Street. Therefore, his return to social media is sure to attract attention from participants in the financial markets.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Lands Spot On Massachusetts GOP Ballot


								John E. Deaton, a fervent advocate for XRP and critic of current regulatory approaches to digital assets, has officially secured his place on the Massachusetts Republican ballot for the 2024 US Senate elections. Deaton’s campaign announcement has stirred notable attention, setting the stage for a direct challenge against incumbent Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Pro-XRP Lawyer Is Officially On The Ballot
Deaton’s entry into the political arena follows his vocal criticism of what he perceives as overreach by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and particularly targets Senator Warren’s stance on cryptocurrency regulations. “Bad news for one of Washington’s most entrenched career politicians. Elizabeth Warren: Look who’s on the ballot!” Deaton announced on X after confirming the validation of 11,873 signatures needed to secure his candidacy.


In a series of statements shared on X, Deaton expressed his gratitude towards his supporters: “I am proud to announce I am officially on the ballot for the US Senate. A huge thank you to all the volunteers and supporters who worked tirelessly to collect over ten thousand signatures.”
He added, “Make no mistake, I am in this fight to win. Voters in Massachusetts are sick of Washington corruption. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s extremism represents everything that is wrong with our current politics, and why voters are telling me they’re ready for change.”

Deaton has been a significant figure in the legal battles involving XRP, a digital currency often in the crosshairs of US regulators. He pointedly criticized the SEC’s classification of XRP as a security, which contrasts with the stance of several other countries that deem it a non-security asset.
“Japan was one of the countries that declared XRP NOT a security. Yet, our SEC, without any support in the law, declared XRP itself a security,” Deaton remarked. He highlighted his representation of 75,000 XRP holders in the US and globally, arguing their case pro bono, which ultimately led to a legal victory where US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP itself is not a security.
Reflecting on his legal achievements and his advocacy for cryptocurrency, Deaton positioned his Senate run as part of a broader battle against governmental overreach. “Our next biggest victory against government intrusion and oppression will be when I defeat Warren, come November,” he declared.

Deaton’s campaign has already attracted support from various corners, including crypto-related political action committees (PACs) and individuals within the crypto community like Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson as well as individuals from outside the community like Mark Cuban who view his candidacy as a counter to Senator Warren’s allegedly “irrational attacks on the crypto industry” and her efforts to sever connections between banks and cryptocurrency entities.
As the first GOP candidate to make it onto the Massachusetts ballot for the upcoming election, Deaton’s campaign is poised to be a focal point for discussions on cryptocurrency regulations and their role in broader US policy.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.50588.

Halving Hits Hard: Bitcoin Miners Face Financial Strain


Bitcoin miners are starting to feel pinched as halved rewards become their new reality post-halving.
A spike in network fees briefly eased their strain. Yet, declining transaction fees are now increasing financial pressure.
Post-Halving Pressures Mount for Bitcoin Miners Amid Declining Fees
Kaiko Research recently reported a surge in daily average network fees after the halving. This surge helped Bitcoin miners offset some discomfort, albeit temporarily.
However, the initial user rush to the Runes protocol has cooled. According to Dune Analytics, Runes transactions plummeted by over 4,500%. They fell from 753,814 on April 24 to 16,630 by May 14.

Additionally, halving events often force miners to sell BTC to cover the costs of creating new blocks. Although the spike in fees helped mitigate some selling pressure, the recent fee decline could renew the pressures.

“For instance, Marathon Digital holds 17,631 BTC worth just over $1.1 billion, while Riot Platforms hold another 8,872 BTC worth over $500 million. If miners were forced to sell even a fraction of their holdings over the coming month, this would have a negative impact on markets,” the report reads.

Furthermore, trading activity and liquidity typically decrease during the summer. Last August, the 2% market depth declined to as low as $250 million. This seasonal decline could further complicate the situation for miners and the broader crypto market.
Crypto analyst Maartun echoed Kaiko Research’s finding. He noted that Bitcoin miners’ profitability has plummeted to a 3-year low.

“Bitcoin miners are facing significant underpayment due to the recent halving of block subsidies and relatively low transaction fees. This is likely to cause substantial strain, especially for less efficient miners,” he wrote.


Despite the current situation, crypto analyst PlanB sees a brighter future for the long term. PlanB said that Bitcoin miners’ revenue will bounce back in 2 to 5 months as Bitcoin’s (BTC) price will double.

“[In] 2012: revenue drops [from] $3 million [to] $1.5 million, back in 2 months. [In] 2016: [revenue] drops [from] $60 million [to] $30 million, back in 4 months. [In] 2020: [revenue] drops [from] $500 million [to] $250 million, back in 5 months,” PlanB explained.

As Bitcoin miners weather the post-halving storm, their financial stamina faces a test. Fluctuating fees and market conditions pose challenges and opportunities. With a recovery in miner revenue forecasted, the coming months are pivotal for the sector’s stability and growth.

Ripple dumps 75% of May XRP reserves in a single sell-off


Ripple, the largest XRP holder, sold 150 million tokens from this month’s sell-off reserves on May 13. The sale is worth $75 million, representing 0.25% of XRP’s $28 billion capitalization with the token at $0.50.
On May 1, the company released 1 billion XRP from the initial distribution, locked in monthly escrows until 2027. Ripple then sent 200 million XRP to its treasury account and locked the remaining 800 million in new escrows.
As usual, the selling activity resulted from the treasury account, labeled Ripple (1), sending tokens to the unlabeled account rP4X2…sKxv3. This action causes XRP supply inflation—by putting tokens that have never circulated before into circulation for the first time.


In particular, the recent 150 million XRP sale inflates supply by 0.25%, over an estimated 4.35% yearly inflation.

What happened to Ripple’s 150 million sell-off?
After receiving May’s 150 million, Ripple’s destination account rP4X2…sKxv3 kept 50 million and sent 100 million XRP to rhWt2…E32hk. Notably, this is a usual path for the company’s dumps, following a similar pattern to previous months.
rP4X2hTa7A7udDbE6wczXvPz7XZ63sKxv3 account summary. Source: XRPScan
If the pattern continues, these accounts will distribute Ripple’s XRP to three to five centralized exchanges for the sell-off. Therefore, the 150 million may create supply pressure on the spot market, potentially affecting the price of XRP.
XRP price analysis
It is noteworthy how Ripple sales directly impact XRP’s price. Historically, the token suffered a local crash most of the time Ripple sold its tokens.
In 2024, only three out of 10 sell-off days had positive price action: February 5, 11, and April 14. All the other seven days were of local crashes, evidencing the importance of monitoring the company’s activities.

U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Net $66M Inflows As Hong Kong ETFs Fall Behind - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

The U.S. Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market saw a positive turn on Monday, recording a combined net inflow of $65.96 million.What Happened: This uptick comes amid a period of mixed signals in the broader cryptocurrency market, according to data from SoSoValueLeading the charge was the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC with a single-day net inflow of $38.57 million. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB also saw significant inflows, bringing in $20.26 million. Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC did not experience any inflows or outflows on May 13.This positive trend in the U.S. market stands in contrast to outflows witnessed in other regions.Also Read: ‘Republicans Smell Blood In The Water:’ Uniswap CEO Warns Democrats Of ‘Swing States Level Miscalculation’ On CryptoSoSoValue reported that the Hong Kong Bitcoin Spot ETF experienced its third consecutive day of net redemptions, with investors pulling out 519.5 Bitcoin in a single day.This brings the total number of Bitcoin BTC/USD held by the fund down to 3,560, with total net assets currently at $219 million.The contrasting fortunes of U.S. and Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs highlight the fragmented nature of the global cryptocurrency market. While U.S. investors appear to be cautiously re-entering the market, those in other regions may be taking a more cautious approach.Understanding The Landscape: The Importance of TransparencyAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, these trends are expected to be a key topic of discussion at Benzinga's upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. The event will explore the implications of these inflows and outflows on the broader digital asset market and what they signify for the future of financial technology and investment, particularly focusing on how diverse global markets interact with evolving digital asset frameworks.Read Next: Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week?Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

                        Meme coin FLOKI is going against the grain today. Crypto’s fifth largest meme coin, inspired by Elon Musk’s pet Shiba Inu of the same name, has rallied 8.8% in the last 24 hours and currently trades at a price of $0.0001887.This means long-term FLOKI HODLers have found their digital coffers raised by 28% over the last 30 days and a staggering 430% from this time last year.Many of the largest meme coins by market capitalization are pumping today despite the downturns posted by the market leaders.The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ($BTC), fell 2% overnight and currently trades at $61,767. Ethereum ($ETH), the token underpinning the most commercially important blockchain, fell 2.4% to trade at $2,910.Standing in stark contrast to either of the biggest coins, Pepe Coin ($PEPE) ballooned 19% to $0.00001056. Original meme coin Dogecoin ($DOGE) posted a light appreciation of around 3.6% and currently trades for $0.1497.Over on FLOKI’s trading chart, we can see a token that broadly rose in step with Bitcoin through early March to peak around the middle of the month.Since then, the token has found strong support between $0.00015 and $0.0002 and appears stable today.With a relative strength index (RSI) of 58 and falling, the token appears to be priced well, although the sell-off could pick up pace and end the rally.Source: TradingViewFLOKI Humbled As Crypto’s Cleverest Doge WienerAI ($WAI) Raises $1.8 Million in Meme Coin ICO.
Fun it may be on a good day, but FLOKI doesn’t offer holders much of value.Its cultural cache seems a bit limited too. After all, it’s a meme coin about Elon Musk’s dog.Before FLOKI, we already had Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, after it we got Bonk and DogWifHat, so investing in FLOKI is really just speculating on future price rises.However, for those who believe in crypto’s longevity, a new generation of meme coins is cropping up which brings bundles of utility along with the laughs.Leading this new generation of coins is WienerAI.$WAI is a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.The presale is only a month old, and it has already attracted close $1.8 million in investments.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms.Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking.WienerAI’s website offers buyers the ability to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 543% APY.Stay on top of WienerAI news over on X and Telegram.Join the presale now over on the WienerAI website.

XRP Analyst Forecasts the Next Cycle Top for September 2024


							

EGRAG Crypto forecasts XRP’s next cycle top for September 9, 2024.



His analysis covered the timeframes of previous cycles.



EGRAG advises market readiness, noting that deviation from expected patterns by the target date would signal a change in trend.




Popular crypto expert EGRAG Crypto, known for his XRP analysis, shared a forecast regarding XRP’s “Super Guppy Cycle Top” in September 2024. EGRAG’s analysis compared the current cycle to past patterns, offering projections and potential insights into XRP’s trajectory over the coming months. For clarity, the Super Guppy indicator is a group of exponential moving averages (EMA) that indicate changes in price action.



EGRAG’s analysis covered timeframes of previous cycles, highlighting Cycle 1’s peak occurrence after 287 days and Cycle 2’s after 133 days. Furthermore, he drew parallels to Cycle 3, which began with the Super Guppy turning green in November 2023. As such, the XRP analyst suggested a potential cycle top in approximately 112 days, following Cycle 1’s pattern.



Meanwhile, EGRAG Crypto pointed readers to his previous tweet from May 5th, titled “This Time is Different,” which focused on the behavior of the 21 EMA and 55 MA on a 2-weekly timeframe. 



“I recommend revisiting the post from May 5th titled “This Time is Different,” where the 21 EMA and 55 MA on the 2-weekly timeframe suggest the potential cycle top might occur in September 2024,” he said.



EGRAG’s comparison indicated that while the duration from the bullish cross has surpassed Cycle B’s timeframe, it remains within Cycle A’s range. Accordingly, September 9th, 2024, emerged as a potential date for the next cycle top if historical patterns repeat.









To conclude his analysis, EGRAG called for readiness among XRP enthusiasts and market participants. He suggested that if September 9th passes without XRP reaching an all-time high or experiencing significant upward movement, it will deviate from historical patterns.



“STAY READY! If we pass the 9th of September and #XRP has not reached an ATH or experienced a major pump, then I can confidently say, “This Time is Different.” EGRAG stated via X.



On the current market front, XRP trades at $0.5052 during press time, reflecting a 0.21% intraday increase.

This AI Altcoin's 'Predatory Tokenomics' Will Fill The Pockets Of Team And Insiders, Trader Warns - Benzinga

Renowned Bybit trader DeFi^2  raised concerns about Worldcoin’s WLD/USD long-term viability and potential for aggressive short-selling, arguing that Worldcoin’s “universal basic income” mission statement masks a wealth transfer benefiting insiders.What Happened: According to the trader’s analysis, the coin may be facing a grim future:“Worldcoin realistically might become the greatest transfer of wealth of this entire cycle. Unfortunately, this wealth transfer isn’t in the form of universal basic income as their mission suggests, but instead to the pockets of the team and insiders,” DeFi^2 expressed in a cautionary post. This criticism highlights a growing skepticism about the project’s objectives and its operational transparency.DeFi^2 outlined specific details that suggest the possibility of aggressive short-selling due to the project’s tokenomics and insider activities.“At its current $60 billion fully diluted valuation, right now it is being devalued by 0.6% a day from emissions of grant and operator claims,” he noted, pointing out that these claims are mostly sold immediately upon release, as indicated by on-chain analytics.Moreover, the Worldcoin Foundation‘s recent decision to sell $200 million worth of tokens to trading firms—which amounts to 18% of the circulating supply—raises alarms about the potential dilution of value for existing holders.These tokens, sourced from what is ambiguously termed the “Community” allocation, seem to be strategically offloaded to entities that might not prioritize community interests.Also Read: Keith Gill’s ‘Roaring Kitty’ Comeback Sparks 1400% Surge Of Kitty-Themed Meme CoinThe concern doesn't stop there, as DeFi^2 warns of an upcoming period where venture capital and team unlocks that could dramatically increase the supply: “In just 70 days… WLD supply will begin inflating at 4% PER DAY from unlocks + emissions.”This could translate to nearly $50 million a day of continuous sell pressure, a scenario that could devastate the coin’s market value.Accusations of predatory financial arrangements were starkly put forth, likening Worldcoin's strategies to those previously seen in notorious market manipulations. “The manipulative low float/high FDV design is straight out of the SBF playbook, and directly enriches insiders as they hedge their locked allocations at high valuations pre-unlock via perps/OTC,” DeFi^2 remarked.Most concerning is the misconception held by retail investors about the affiliations and endorsements of the project. Many are unaware that Sam Altman, often associated with leading tech innovations, has no active involvement with Worldcoin, which also has no connection to OpenAI.What’s Next: As the cryptocurrency community braces for these developments, these concerns are likely to be a topic of intense discussion at the upcoming Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.This event will provide a platform for experts to delve deeper into the impacts of market strategies like those employed by Worldcoin, exploring the broader implications for investors and the integrity of the digital asset space.Read Next: Arthur Hayes: ‘Major Economies To Print Even More Money’ In The Next 24 MonthsImage: Shutterstock

Will Shiba Inu (SHIB) Succeed in Invalidating This Downtrend?


Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price is seeking support from the broader market cues and its investors to break free from the ongoing downtrend.
This could happen in the coming days as SHIB holders have switched from selling to HODLing.
Shiba Inu Investors Seem Serious
Shiba Inu’s price has not always noted an impact of its investors’ actions in bullish scenarios since the meme coin is mostly a whale token. However, conviction among retail and whales is certainly a positive factor for the meme coin.
This increasing confidence towards a rise is visible in their action and evident in the decline in active deposits. Active Deposits refer to the unique addresses that move SHIB from their wallets to the exchange deposits. A spike in this metric is also synonymous with increased selling pressure.

In the case of SHIB, the active deposits are consistently declining. Currently, this metric is at a multi-week low, which means that investors are not too keen on selling their assets.
Shiba Inu Active Deposits. Source: Santiment
This sentiment is further strengthened by the fact that even short-term investors are acting bullishly. The overall supply held by them has declined by 1 trillion SHIB worth over $22.3 million in the span of three weeks. 
This is a positive sign since short-term holders tend to hold their supply for less than a month. As a result, the asset becomes susceptible to selling and corrections. 
However, a move from short to mid-term holders is positive since the latter hold their SHIB for over a month and less than a year.

Put simply, SHIB appears to be in a good place.
SHIB Price Prediction: Looking for a Breakout

Shiba Inu’s price of $0.00002387 is above the critical support of $0.00002093. This level has been holding strong for a while, and so has the downtrend line. However, SHIB is initiating a breakout, which, aided by investors, could lead to a rally.
For the same, the meme coin would need to first flip the resistance at $0.00002584 into support. This would push SHIB towards $0.00002835 breaching, resulting in a bull run.

On the other hand, a breakdown below $0.00002093 could result in a massive drawdown to $0.00001473, the next crucial support. There is also a possibility that a failed breach could keep the meme coin consolidated within $0.00002584 and $0.00002093, invalidating the bullish thesis in any case.

We asked ChatGPT-4o what will be Bitcoin price at the end of 2024; Here’s what it said


Given the high hopes that persisted through much of 2024 stemming from the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the reaching of a new all-time high (ATH) in March, and the April halving event, there has been a surprising amount of drama and uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin (BTC) in recent weeks.
Indeed, while earlier analyses predicted Bitcoin would hit $100,000 in no time, and some of the cryptocurrency’s bigger bulls estimating it can reach $300,000 by the end of 2024, the debate has shifted on whether the coin can even hold above $60,000 or if BTC will need to find its footing at the $52,000 support level.
Though the change in attitude is hardly surprising given BTC’s protracted struggle to hold its own in the crypto market and its recent, short-lived fall below $57,000, it has left little clarity to crypto traders about what is next for the world’s premier cryptocurrency.

In its quest to find at least some answers about what may lie ahead, Finbold decided to consult the most advanced version of OpenAI’s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) platform – ChatGPT-4o – about where Bitcoin might stand at the tail-end of 2024.
ChatGPT sets BTC price for end of 2024
After analyzing Bitcoin’s performance in 2024 and beyond, ChatGPT offered a cautiously bullish prediction for where BTC might stand in December. 
According to the AI, the coin is most likely to find itself in the range between $80,000 and $85,000 by the year’s end given that Bitcoin price today stands at $61,711.

Given that it cited the long-term effects of the halving, the likely institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, and the broader economic uncertainty – all factors used by many other analysts to make far more bullish projections – Finbold challenged ChatGPT over its price target.
The AI, however, held to its previous assessment, explaining that, even though it laid out a fairly bullish trajectory, Bitcoin is still facing significant competition from altcoins, regulatory clarity is not expected to be total or completely favorable, there are significant psychological resistance levels ahead, and historic patterns show diminishing returns from each subsequent halving.

ChatGPT offers a bullish but plausible BTC alternative
ChatGPT also proved willing to construct a more bullish scenario which, while taking into account the same factors as for its general estimate, projects they’d have a significantly greater impact. 
Thus, the AI estimates that the upper plausible bound for Bitcoin’s price at the end of 2024 stands at $120,000.
ChatGPT offers a bearish but plausible alternative
Similarly, ChatGPT agreed to look at a hypothetical situation that could drive Bitcoin into the ground. 
The AI explained that should the regulatory crackdown against cryptocurrencies intensify, the global economy recover more fully and rapidly than anticipated, and should Bitcoin face unforeseen and significant technical challenges, the price of BTC might collapse to $30,000 by late December.

Two Reasons Why Ethereum ($ETH) Is Underperforming Bitcoin ($BTC) As an Asset | Cryptoglobe


                                
The Ethereum blockchain has long faced issues with scalability, particularly during high activity periods that lead to network congestion, slow transaction times, and high gas fees. These challenges affect user experience and limit the network’s capacity to support a diverse range of applications. The Dencun upgrade, introduced in March 2024, represents a significant advancement towards resolving these issues by laying the groundwork for future scalability improvements.



Dencun, which combines elements from the Cancun and Deneb upgrades, does not provide an immediate solution to all scalability problems. However, it is a crucial milestone in Ethereum’s development. Central to the Dencun upgrade is the concept of “proto-danksharding,” which sets the stage for future sharding implementations. Sharding involves partitioning the blockchain into smaller shards, each capable of processing transactions independently. This parallel processing is expected to substantially increase Ethereum’s transaction throughput in the future. While Dencun does not implement sharding directly, it establishes the necessary technical foundation for its eventual deployment.



The primary focus of Dencun is not directly reducing transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet. Instead, it aims to optimize fees within Layer 2 networks. Layer 2 solutions function on top of the Ethereum blockchain, aggregating transactions off-chain before submitting them back to the mainnet. This process helps mitigate congestion on the main network and can potentially lower fees for users.



A significant feature of Dencun is EIP-4844, which lowers the cost for Layer 2 networks to submit their bundled transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. This improvement is expected to enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 solutions, potentially reducing fees for their users. However, the actual fee reductions observed may not be as substantial as initially projected, and the long-term effects on fees will need further monitoring.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

One unintended consequence of the Dencun upgrade has been its impact on the Ethereum supply. The reduction in transaction fees led to a decrease in the amount of ETH burned. Previously, higher network activity and fees resulted in more ETH being burned, contributing to a deflationary effect on its total supply. Following the Ethereum Merge, which transitioned the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, this deflationary mechanism was an anticipated benefit. However, with fewer fees being burned and the natural increase in supply, the total supply of ETH has started to grow at a faster rate, shifting back towards an inflationary model.



The Dencun upgrade has prompted a fresh analysis from CryptoQuant, a respected South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm. This upgrade, according to CryptoQuant, may significantly alter Ethereum’s progression towards becoming an “ultra sound money” – a concept that denotes a currency that appreciates or maintains its value over time.







The other problem for Ethereum is that once the U.S. SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, many people thought that probably within a few months, the SEC would start approving some, if not all, of the several pending spot Ethereum ETF proposals. Unfortunately, with the SEC’s recent crackdown against the Ethereum ecosystem (e.g. Uniswap receiving a Wells notice last month), it seems that SEC Chair Gary Gensler sees Ether (ETH) as a security (which is what Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin suspects) and therefore the expectations for spot Ethereum ETFs getting approved in the U.S. sometime in 2024 have been dramatically lowered. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, says he wouldn’t be surprised if we do not see an approval until 2025.







As for the extent of ETH’s underperformance against BTC, as the following  ETH-BTC price chart shows, in the past one-year period, ETH id down 30% vs BTC.

LUNC And USTC Revival: Terra Community Votes To Make Allnodes An Official Organization | Bitcoinist.com


								The Terra community isn’t relenting in its efforts to revive the LUNC and USTC tokens and take them back to their old glory days. This time, the community has proposed a proposal to ensure that the Luna Classic’s (LUNC) circulating supply data is well documented. 
Terra Community Proposes All Allnodes As An Official Organization
The text proposal titled ‘Change official CS API endpoint to Allnodes FCD’ aims to make Allnodes an official organization of the Terra community. Allnodes will be responsible for “hosting the endpoint, providing the correct circulating supply data for Luna Classic.” The proposal also aims to get an agreement from community members about how this circulating supply should be calculated. 
Related Reading: Crypto Price Predictions For 2024: Dogecoin To $2 And XRP To $3
Furthermore, the proposal highlighted why the appointment of an organization like Allnodes has become necessary. It noted that the absence of a named individual or organization to provide this circulating supply data has opened up the possibility of just anyone making changes to this data, which “could be harmful to the chain.” The proposal also included that such unauthorized changes can usually be made without informing developers, validators, or community members
Therefore, it has become essential to appoint an “official source” like Allnodes, which will be the go-to platform for getting the correct data on LUNC’s circulating supply. To accomplish this, Allnodes will be asked to update to the latest FCD version that implements the agreed mechanism for calculating LUNC’s supply. 
The Proposed Method For Calculating LUNC’s Circulating Supply
The proposed method for calculating LUNC’s circulating supply is to deduct unvested tokens, community pool holdings, and staked and bonded tokens from the total supply. Before now, LUNC’s circulating supply is said to have been calculated by deducting the unvested tokens, community pool holdings, and configured bank accounts from the total supply. This former calculation led to LUNC being handled differently from all other native tokens.

Meanwhile, the proposal noted that the circulating supply inside FCD must not be changed without a governance vote going forward. If passed, Allnodes FCD API will also act as the official information source for USTC and all other native tokens besides Luna Classic. Allnodes already agreed to take up the role as long as the proposal is passed. 
Interestingly, data from the Galaxy Station (where the proposal was put up) shows that Allnodes has yet to vote on it. Meanwhile, twelve validators have voted yes in favor of the proposal, one has voted no against the proposal, and one other validator has voted no with veto power. 
Only 5.46% of those authorized to vote have voted, meaning the quorum of 40% needed to pass the proposal is far from being met. However, voting closes on May 19, so there is still enough time for the proposal to pass.

Ethereum Whales Fuel Market Confidence with Massive ETH Exchange Withdrawals ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
As Ethereum (ETH) grapples with a downward spiral in its market value, recent large-scale withdrawals from exchanges by whales have injected a dose of optimism into the cryptocurrency community. The past week has witnessed a flurry of significant transactions, indicating strategic maneuvers by institutional players to fortify their positions amidst market volatility.



According to insights from “The Data Nerd,” an analyst specializing in tracking unusual crypto transactions. Coinbase has recorded multiple high-value Ethereum withdrawals.



On Tuesday, the pundit reported that within 24 hours, four distinct wallets orchestrated withdrawals totaling a staggering 78,301 ETH, equivalent to approximately $231.2 million. Notable among these transactions were withdrawals by wallets labeled “0xF7f” and “0xE51,” each withdrawing 30,440 ETH, amounting to around $90 million.



This surge in withdrawal activity follows closely on the heels of a substantial transaction reported on Monday by the same analyst. A single whale, identified by the address “0x36D,” withdrew 23,286 ETH, valued at approximately $67.83 million, from Coinbase. Over four days, this entity executed withdrawals totaling 30,870 ETH, worth roughly $89.7 million. Such pronounced movements by influential market participants have ignited discussions regarding their potential impact on Ethereum’s price trajectory.



That said, the recent influx of withdrawal activity echoes earlier reports indicating whale investors’ significant accumulation of Ethereum. On May 9, crypto transactions tracking platform Lookonchain highlighted a whale who initiated a series of sizable acquisitions, culminating in the withdrawal of 6,030 ETH from Binance. This move, valued at over $18 million, was interpreted as a strategic maneuver to bolster holdings amidst anticipation of a market rebound. Subsequently, the investor staked the acquired Ethereum into Lido, a decentralized liquidity staking protocol, further underscoring confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects.

Analysts suggest that these maneuvers reflect a broader trend of large investors leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) tools to enhance their positions in the cryptocurrency market, particularly Ethereum. By utilizing staked Ethereum as collateral to secure loans from decentralized lending protocols like AAVE, investors can access additional capital to fuel further acquisitions and capitalize on projected price surges.



Despite Ethereum’s recent price volatility, optimism persists within the market. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,916, representing a modest drop of 1.78% over the past 24 hours. Analysts are now eyeing $2,900 as a potential floor for the beleaguered asset, with resistance building around $3,310.

Binance Futures to Remove XRP and TUSD as Margin Assets, Converting to USDT | Coinspeaker



The announcement by Binance to stop supporting XRP could have some negative sentiment on the coin as various speculations about the possible reasons are expected to start flying.

Binance Futures, a division of Binance, a leading crypto exchange platform, has declared that it will cease to support XRP and TUSD as margin assets. This latest development is slated to take effect on May 28, 2024, at 06:00 UTC. In a swift action by the exchange company, it has already set the transfer-in-limit for the two cryptocurrencies to zero as of 06:00 UTC today, which is a means of preventing users of the platform from depositing the digital assets into their USDⓈ-M Futures wallets for margin trading.
The exchange further disclosed that any XRP and TUSD that are not withdrawn in users’ USDⓈ-M Futures wallets after the deadline will be automatically converted into USDT (Tether), a move that will ensure the users’ funds are not left stranded on the platform.  To ensure transparency in the conversion process, it was revealed that the exchange rate of XRP into USDT will be based on the average XRPUSDT price index. It will be calculated from 05:00 UTC to 06:00 UTC on May 28, 2024, while TUSD will be converted at a 1:1 ratio, which means the coin will be exchanged for one USDT.




Binance users are, however, cautioned not to open new futures positions during the conversion period. This is to prevent traders from experiencing potential losses during fund conversion from XRP and TUSD to USDT, as the exchange will not be liable for any losses incurred on any new trade during this period. Similarly, traders on the platform have also been informed that the conversion of XRP and TUSD balances may not immediately reflect in their transaction history.
XRP’s Ongoing Legal Battle with the SEC: Impact on Price and Adoption
This announcement comes amid the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple XRP. Recently, Ripple filed a motion requesting the court to seal certain key details related to documents concerning the case’s remedies. The lawsuit against Ripple has yet to be decided, which has been part of the reason why the coin’s price has been dragging.
XRP has been dropping since early this month, experiencing an over 15% drop in the last three weeks. However, the coin shows signs of recovery, as price action is trading in the green candlestick, reflecting that bullish activities are ongoing. However, the recovery could be short-lived.
The announcement by Binance to stop supporting XRP could have some negative sentiment on the coin as various speculations about the possible reasons are expected to start flying. Although Binance did not link the decision to stop supporting XRP as a margin asset to the ongoing Ripple court issue. The fear of such a move could increase the negative sentiment towards the coin, which could still affect the price growth this year as it has been since 2019. The massive XRP withdrawal or conversion to other crypto assets, which is expected to happen in the next few days, could also cause the price to dip more.

Billionaire Shark Mark Cuban Warns The SEC's Anti-Crypto Stance Could Cost Biden The Election - Benzinga

Known for his many business ventures, Mark Cuban has also been a long-term investor in crypto, specifically taking large positions in Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and NFTs. These investments have signaled his openness and support for crypto. He recently shared his thoughts on the current state of cryptocurrency as it relates to regulation.Don't Miss:"If @joebiden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank @GaryGensler and the @NewYork_SEC. Crypto is a mainstay with younger and independent voters. Gensler HAS NOT PROTECTED A SINGLE INVESTOR AGAINST FRAUD. All he has done is make it nearly impossible for legitimate crypto companies to operate, killing who knows how many businesses and ruining who knows how many entrepreneurs," Cuban posted on X. Cuban is referring to the different ways in which he believes that the SEC chair, Gary Gensler, has prevented crypto adoption in the U.S. According to Cuban, Gensler is operating under the guise of preventing fraud and allowing Americans to access trustworthy investments but instead has created an environment where it is hard to create a crypto business that complies with the many SEC regulations.One comment noted that the SEC is simply attempting to take precautions against pump-and-dump and other fraudulent activities. Cuban responded, saying, "Now compare it to OTC and Pink Sheets in today's US market. Even with the relatively new regs, it's a cesspool. And remember our SEC lets billions and billions of shares in bankrupt companies trade all the time."Trending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets — has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?Essentially, Cuban is noting that the SEC may have a double standard when it comes to some penny stocks and bankrupt companies, as it allows those to trade while crypto is subject to much more scrutiny. "This is also a warning to Congress. Crypto voters will be heard this election. You could solve this problem for Biden by passing legislation that defines registration that is specific to the crypto industry just as other industries have registration that is defined for them. Or you could do the better option and assign all crypto to be regulated by the @CFTC," Cuban also added.As the presidential election continues to heat up, cryptocurrency emerges as a dark-horse issue that could influence the votes of some in the crypto community. According to Cuban, the Biden administration, potentially through Gary Gensler, is failing to appeal to these voters, which could cost them the election. It is also noteworthy that Trump has recently expressed support for crypto at an NFT event, stating, "a lot of people are very much for it…and I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid…but I’m good with it. If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, you better vote for Trump." Will crypto be a deciding factor in the upcoming election? It may not be a huge issue for many Americans, but it could impact the votes of crypto enthusiasts. Read Next:

The bank will also propose protocol standards and identify the best approach to contribute to industry progress.Deutsche’s Asia Pacific head of securities and technology, Boon-Hiong Chan, will be the bank’s lead for Project Guardian. The bank is expected to work closely with Memento Blockchain, a software-based platform targeting DeFi and digital asset management. Deutsche and Memento Blockchain previously worked together in 2022 and 2023, successfully completing a proof-of-concept known as Project DAMA, which refers to Digital Assets Management Access. The initiative aims to unlock the potential for a more efficient, secure and flexible solution for digital fund management and investment servicing.The new Deutsche Bank’s efforts aim to introduce DAMA 2.

Developer of Tornado Cash found guilty of money laundering in the Netherlands - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Alexey Pertsev, Tornado Cash developer, found guilty of laundering $1.2B in the Netherlands.
Despite Tornado Cash being non-custodial, Pertsev sentenced to over 5 years in prison.
Verdict sparks debate on accountability of open-source developers in crypto space.

Alexey Pertsev, the founder of the cryptocurrency mixing protocol Tornado Cash, has been convicted of money laundering by Dutch judges at ‘s-Hertogenbosch court on May 14.
The ruling comes after Pertsev’s arrest in the Netherlands in August 2022. It marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of cryptocurrency technology and legal accountability.
Five years and four months in prison
Despite Tornado Cash being a non-custodial crypto mixing protocol, wherein funds passing through the platform are not held or controlled by it, Pertsev has been sentenced to five years and four months in prison for allegedly laundering a staggering $1.2 billion worth of illicit assets.
Tornado Cash gained notoriety for its ability to enhance privacy and fungibility in cryptocurrency transactions by obfuscating the origin of funds. However, its association with illicit activities led to its blacklisting by the United States government, precipitating Pertsev’s legal woes.
Despite the defence’s argument that Pertsev cannot be held accountable for the actions of Tornado Cash users due to the protocol’s decentralized nature, the court’s decision underscores the increasing scrutiny faced by developers in the crypto space.
The Tornado cash developer has a 14-days appeal window
Pertsev’s legal representatives now have 14 days to appeal the court ruling, as stakeholders across the cryptocurrency ecosystem closely monitor the outcome of this landmark case.
The verdict not only has immediate ramifications for Pertsev, but also serves as a cautionary tale for developers navigating the complex legal landscape of decentralized technologies. It raises pertinent questions about the responsibility and liability of open-source code developers in the realm of decentralized finance.
While developers typically have no direct control over the use of their code, this verdict sets a precedent that could have far-reaching implications for the broader developer community.

Roaring Kitty and Retail Traders Revive Meme Stock Frenzy with GameStop (NYSE: GME) Surge | Cryptoglobe


                                
This week, Wall Street is witnessing a resurgence in meme stock activity, reminiscent of the dramatic events surrounding GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) in 2021. 



A new wave of retail traders has significantly driven up the price of GameStop, the video game retailer that gained fame for its extraordinary rally two years ago. This rally led to widespread media coverage, including a Netflix series, a movie, and considerable financial scrutiny, culminating in heavy losses for those who failed to navigate the rapid fluctuations effectively.



So far today, in premarket trading, GameStop’s stock is enjoying a price increase of 74.4%, following a 70% jump on Monday, boosting the company’s market value by billions.

AMC Entertainment (NYSE; AMC), a movie theater chain, experienced a similar uplift, as did various lesser-known cryptocurrencies associated with Roaring Kitty and GameStop.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The revival of interest in GameStop can be traced back to Keith Gill, known online as Roaring Kitty, who returned to social media after a three-year absence. On Monday night, Gill posted a series of enigmatic video clips on his X account, sparking renewed interest in the stocks he previously championed. Despite not directly mentioning GameStop, his return triggered a flurry of activity akin to the original meme stock craze of 2021 and 2022, when stocks like GameStop and AMC saw their prices skyrocket by over 1,000%.




VIDEO




As The New York Times (NYT) reported, according to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, investors have been buying a significant number of GameStop call options, betting on continued price increases. Sosnick noted that this surge in activity wasn’t prompted by any substantial news about GameStop or AMC but rather by the renewed attention from Roaring Kitty’s social media presence. Sosnick expressed skepticism about the sustainability of this rally, citing his past experiences with similar phenomena.



The sharp increase in GameStop’s stock price has resulted in significant losses for short sellers, who had previously bet on a decline. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3 Partners, told the NYT that GameStop shorts, which had accumulated $392 million in profits earlier this year, faced losses amounting to $852 million by the end of Monday.

GameStop Surges in Premarket Again, Closing in on ATH Set in 2021 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) shares surged more than 90% in premarket trading on May 14, 2024, following a remarkable 74.4% increase from the previous close on May 13.



The stock closed at $30.45 on May 13, marking the highest price in recent months and a significant deviation from the 52-week high of $38.20 and the recent low of $9.95 in the last three years. The all-time intraday high for GameStop shares was $120.75 in January 2021, with an all-time closing high of $86.88 on January 27, 2021.



Short sellers have been hit hard by the recent surge in GameStop stock prices. Estimated losses for short sellers amounted to $868 million as of May 13, 2024. These losses increased to $1.26 billion for May, with an additional $1.04 billion incurred early on May 14, pushing total monthly losses to over $2.3 billion so far.



The Return of the Meme Stock Craze



The current surge in GameStop shares is linked to the resurgence of the meme stock phenomenon reminiscent of the events that unfolded in 2021. The rally was triggered by a social media post from Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty or DeepF*ckingValue, who posted for the first time in three years on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Gill’s post included a meme indicating serious gaming, viewed over 23 million times so far.



Retail investors have been highly active on social media platforms like Reddit (NYSE: RDDT), piling into GameStop stock and call options. The increased activity from retail traders has played a significant role in driving up the stock price.





GameStop’s Short Interest Near 25% of the Free Float



GameStop’s short interest has neared 25% of the free float, the highest level since 2022. The combination of the price increase and high short interest levels signals potential further buying pressure as short sellers begin closing their positions to minimize losses.



The current rally closely echoes the 2021 saga, where retail investors drove up the prices of previously undervalued stocks. Although GameStop stock has been trending lower in recent years, the renewed interest from retail investors has led to a resurgence in its market performance.

280 Million XRP Change Hands Amid Twists in the Ripple Vs SEC Case


							

Ripple’s CFO has filed a declaration supporting the firm’s motion to seal its omnibus letter motions.



A whale transferred 280 million Ripple shortly after the CFO’s filing.



XRP jumped 2.5% on Tuesday following significant whale activity.




Ripple’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Jonathan Bilich has filed a declaration in support of Ripple’s motion to seal the firm’s recently filed omnibus letter motions. Ripple filed the letter on May 13 to seal critical details regarding the remedies-related documents. Following the CFO’s filing, the XRP ecosystem experienced a significant transfer of tokens, leading to a price impact on the embattled altcoin.



Following the recent filing, onchain data reflected that nearly 280 million XRP changed hands between Ripple and a centralized exchange (CEX). According to details from the blockchain tracker Whale Alert, a crypto whale moved 279.97 XRP from an unknown wallet to an address on the Bitstamp crypto exchange. 



Whale Alert’s report showed the transaction happened in installments, with the last tranche involving a transfer of 29.97 million XRP from the unidentified wallet to Bitstamp.







The other two installments involved larger XRP volumes, as reported by Whale Alert. In the initial tranche, 150 million XRP moved from Ripple to an unknown wallet on Bitstamp. Shortly after the initial transfer, the same source sent an additional 100 million XRP to another address on the crypto exchange.



Notably, the movement of XRP tokens reflected on the altcoin’s price in the early hours of Tuesday. XRP bounced from an initial slump to post a 2.5% price rally. The embattled crypto token recovered from an initial slump, bouncing from $0.49693 to $0.50944. After a slight retracement, the top altcoin traded for $0.50544 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView.



The court case between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has experienced increased activity in the past few weeks. The increased tempo has led many crypto practitioners to believe the case is nearing a conclusion.

DMarket tops NFT charts but loses three-day streak above US$900,000


DMarket topped the non-fungible token (NFT) collection ranking on Monday with US$835,028 in daily sales. 



Despite leading the daily sales chart, Monday’s sales total snapped a three-day streak of at least US$900,000 in daily sales for DMarket.



DMarket collection represents in-game items for popular games such as Counter-Strike 2 on the Mythos network.



The collection witnessed an increase in unique buyers to 4,034 and sellers to 3,546, resulting in a total of 33,375 transactions for the day. 

	
	
	
	


This surge in daily activity has boosted DMarket’s all-time sales volume to US$427.86 million. 



While a Mythos-based project led the collections charts, the leading blockchain of the day was Bitcoin, which saw a sales volume of US$6.20 million, marking a 22% increase from the previous day’s US$5.08 million.



Bitcoin is now about US$150 million away from joining the US$4 billion club for NFT sales, and about US$400 million from catching up to Ronin, the network with the third-highest volume of all-time NFT sales.



The second and third best seller of the day came from Bitcoin.

	
	
	

	


The second-ranking collection for the day was $CORE BRC-20 NFTs. It recorded sales of US$701,305, with 251 unique buyers and 184 sellers completing 402 transactions. 



The third-ranking collection, NodeMonkes, saw daily sales of US$568,487 with 27 unique buyers and 29 sellers across 32 transactions.



NodeMonkes, became the all-time sales leader among Bitcoin collections earlier this month, has been surging up the chart. 



It recently took the 26th spot from CyberKongz and sits about US$8 million away from Crabada, the leading collection in the Avalanche network.



Other collections in Monday’s top 10 include Guild of Guardians Avatars and Solana Monkey Business, ranking fourth and fifth respectively. 



Guild of Guardians Avatars, on the Immutable network, maintained a steady performance with sales of US$535,487 and 104 transactions. 



Solana Monkey Business, on the Solana blockchain as its name suggests, recorded sales of US$472,811 with 66 unique buyers and 63 sellers.



CryptoPunks, the third ranked collection in all-time sales, came in sixth on Monday with sales of US$352,169, despite a tanking from the previous day’s US$1.39 million. 



The Captainz followed closely, ranking seventh with sales of US$345,272, rising from the previous day’s US$128,095.



The eighth position was held by Solana’s DogeZuki with sales of US$298,479, and Ethereum’s Kanpai Pandas took the ninth spot with US$288,501 in sales. 



The tenth-ranking collection was $BNB+ BRC-20 NFTs with sales of US$219,763.

Brace For Impact: Mt. Gox Set To Inject 142,000 BTC And 143,000 Bitcoin Cash Into The Market- Here’s When


																Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox is preparing to release a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC) into the market, signaling the upcoming disbursement of payments to creditors who had been affected by its hack attack in 2011.  
Mt. Gox Set To Release 142,000 Bitcoin Into Market
Reports from Reddit reveal that the Kraken Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) API interface have signaled that Mt. Gox is getting ready to release its substantial cryptocurrency and fiat holdings, which include 142,000 BTC and 143,000 BCH, and 69 billion yen. 

	Related Reading



As of May 13, the interface began reading “payment in preparation,” indicating that funds would soon be distributed to creditors. The date for the anticipated disbursement has also been slated for October 31, 2024. 
This decision comes after years of undergoing legal proceedings and negotiations aimed at reimbursing creditors who lost funds following the Bitcoin exchange’s crash. Earlier in 2011, Mt. Gox was hacked, resulting in the loss of 850,000 BTC now worth over $51 billion. Shortly after the unfortunate attack, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy and has since been gathering funds to compensate creditors. 
Reports from a few customers have revealed that the exchange has begun distributing funds in fiat currency. One particular Reddit user disclosed earlier in April, that he had received USD payments into an HSBC currency account with zero fees. 
While the long-awaited distribution process comes as great news to creditors, the release of such a large amount of Bitcoin could have a significant effect on the current Bitcoin market. 
Additionally, discussions about whether creditors would sell or retain their Bitcoin holdings once they receive their funds have been circulating. Nonetheless, the disbursement process presents a step towards closure and recovery for victims of the exchange’s hack and bankruptcy. 
Will Creditors Sell Or Hold?
With the Bitcoin market presently in a fragile position after experiencing a series of declines following the halving event on April 20, the possibility of a large-scale sell-off could lead to drastic changes in the market, potentially resulting in a crash. 
Commenting on Mt. Gox’s 142,000 BTC distribution plans, a Reddit community member suggested that the exchange’s upcoming repayments could become a catalyst for the next BTC dump in 2024. 

	Related Reading



In response, another Reddit user expressed doubt about the likelihood of a widespread sell-off, especially at the beginning of the bull market. The user surmised that investors who have been waiting for Mt. Gox’s payments for over a decade are unlikely to sell off their Bitcoin holdings quickly. 
Instead, he suggested that many creditors, like himself, would be more inclined to HODL their Bitcoin holdings, having acquired a deeper understanding of the pioneer cryptocurrency during the decade-long wait.

Poloniex Hacker Transfers $53.5 Million Worth of ETH Through Tornado Cash


																The movement of stolen cryptocurrency from the Poloniex hack in November 2023 is far from over. Although Poloniex claimed to have identified the attacker weeks later and offered a $10 million reward, the stolen funds were never returned.
In the latest development, PeckShield, a blockchain investigation company, found that more than half of the stolen funds were moved through Tornado Cash.
More than six months after the hack, the bad actor moved 17.8K ETH – worth approximately $53.5 million from six different wallets – to a single address of the controversial coin mixer, Tornado Cash.


The latest transfer of funds comes a week after the hacker moved more than 1,100 ETH in 11 batches of 100 ETH to the sanctioned crypto mixer over a period of two hours.




Poloniex was hacked in November 2023 after its private keys were compromised by malicious actors.
The attackers, suspected to be the notorious Lazarus Group associated with the North Korean government, stole around $126 million from the exchange’s hot wallets.
Later, Poloniex stated that its team identified and froze a portion of the assets linked to the hacker’s addresses to prevent additional losses. They also mentioned that the losses are within “manageable limits” and that their operating revenue can cover them.
TRON founder Justin Sun, who bought Poloniex in 2019, vowed to completely compensate the affected users of the exchange while asserting that it is financially stable and is seeking partnerships with other exchanges to recover the lost funds.

Bitcoin Rune etchings plummet by 99%; What's behind the dramatic fall?


In less than a month following its launch on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain, the Bitcoin Runes protocol has seen a staggering 99% drop in daily etchings, with numbers plummeting from a peak of 23,061 to just 157.
Launched on April 20 to coincide with Bitcoin’s fourth halving event, the Runes protocol initially had robust activity. However, recent data from Dune Analytics has highlighted a sharp decline, raising concerns about its sustainability and the impact on miners’ revenues.
Launched less than 30 days ago, the Bitcoin Runes has recorded a massive decline in activity. According to data sourced from Dune Analytics, the number of new Runes etched daily has sharply fallen to below 250 for the past six days, culminating in only 157 etchings recorded on Monday.

This marks a significant downturn of 99% from the late April peak when 23,061 Runes were etched in a single day. 
The protocol, launched to coincide with Bitcoin’s fourth halving event, initially sparked excitement among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. It enabled the etching of memecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and multimedia content directly onto Bitcoin’s blockchain, heralding new utility for the network.
In its first 10 days, the protocol issued more than 85,000 tokens and generated over $3 million in fees. At a time when the recent halving had reduced the block subsidy to 3.125 BTC (about $196,800 at current rates), the high volume of Runes transactions provided an essential boost to miners’ revenues.

Initially, other fees on the blockchain accounted for only 22.7% of total fees. However, the situation has since changed dramatically, with other fees now holding a share of 78.9%, while Runes account for just 21.1%.
Total miner revenue(BTC). Source: Glassnode
Finbold retrieved data from Glassnode that confirms this shift. On May 11, miners’ revenue was 533.69 BTC, a significant decline from 1677.09 BTC on April 20, which can be linked to the decreasing activity in the Runes protocol.
Over the past two weeks, all metrics—including fees, new Runes, and user activity—have dropped by more than 50%. Since May 1, only about 5,000 new Runes have been issued, generating just under $100,000 in fees.
It’s worth noting that this downturn occurred amid a general market decline, characterized by falling Bitcoin prices and slow growth in alternative tokens, which may have contributed to a drop in sentiment towards novel technology.
Market context and future prospects
Bitcoin’s On-chain activity. Source: Santiment
The decrease in Runes activity is not isolated but correlates with broader market trends. Bitcoin’s network activity has hit a five-year low, according to Santiment, indicating reduced trader interest and potential market anxiety. 
Additionally, the general sentiment towards cryptocurrency innovations like spot Bitcoin ETFs has cooled, with trading volumes declining and some funds experiencing outflows.
Despite these challenges, it’s premature to deem the Runes protocol a failure. According to Rodarmor, the inventor of Runes, speaking at a recent Ordinals event, new developments are underway that could invigorate the protocol. 
Furthermore, several Runes collections have already achieved notable market capitalizations in the millions, as per Magic Eden.
As the market anticipates upcoming economic indicators such as the US Consumer Price Index and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the cryptocurrency sector remains vigilant. 
These economic factors could significantly influence both traditional and digital asset markets in the coming days.

Institutional ETPs Post First Inflow In Five Weeks Despite Bitcoin Price Pullback - The Defiant

Weekly ETP trade volume is down 53% compared to April.After four straight weeks of outflows, investors tentatively resumed putting money into cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs).According to CoinShares’ May 13 Digital Asset Fund Flows report, institutional digital asset investment products enjoyed an inflow of $130 million last week, averting a five-week dry spell.The move coincided with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) posting its lowest outflow since converting into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January at 171 million. GBTC hosted no inflow or outflow on May 13, further indicating that the heavy outflows consistently suffered by the fund since its conversion are waning. Nearly $17.6 billion has exited the fund since January.Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF posted the strongest inflow among spot exchange-traded funds with $111 million, followed by Ark 21Shares with $83 million, and BlackRock with $48 million.However, despite the bullish signal from institutional investors, Bitcoin (BTC) posted a 4% pullback since tagging a local high of $64,120 on May 7. The move extends a multi-month streak of downward range-bound price action, with BTC hovering between $60,000 and $70,000 since March.BTC/USD. Source: CoinGecko.Hong Kong ETF inflows crashU.S.-based ETP providers led the pack with $135 million in inflows, followed by Hong Kong and Switzerland with $19 million and $14 million worth of inflows respectively. However, Hong Kong’s performance marked a nearly 94% drawdown compared to its previous week, which hosted a $307 million inflow.“Hong Kong, after a prior week of record inflows, saw just US$19 million inflows, suggesting the majority of the first-week post-Bitcoin ETF launches were seed capital," CoinShares reported.According to Sosovalue, Hong Kong-based ETFs suffered their heaviest daily outflow on May 13 with $32 million.Ethereum ETPs post outflowsWhile Bitcoin products hosted $144 million worth of inflows, Ethereum ETPs suffered a $14.4 million outflow as analysts anticipate that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will reject the pending cohort of spot Ether ETF hopefuls.“Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent," CoinShares said.The SEC is expected to provide its verdict on May 23, which coincides with the final deadline for the spot Ether application from VanEck.ETPs providing exposure to other altcoins drew modest inflows, including Solana (SOL) with $5.9 million, Polkodot (DOT) with $1.2 million, and XRP with $1.2 million.ETP volume dries upWeekly ETP trade volume trended low last week, with just $8B worth of shares changing hands. For comparison, crypto ETPs hosted $17 billion worth of weekly trades during April on average.The data likely indicates that many investors are sitting on the sidelines and awaiting the market’s next move amid tightening range-bound price action. "These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present,” the report said.

New Meme Token Flow Stimulated the Markets! These Altcoins Are on the Rise Under the Leadership of PEPE! Will the Rise Continue? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Stock trader and analyst Keith Gill, known as “The Roaring Kitty” on social media and largely fueled the GameStop craze in late 2020, mobilized the markets with his post.
At this point, after Gill's post, the price of Roaring Kitty (KITTY), a Solana (SOL)-based meme token, and the altcoin named GME, which is known for the GameStop project but has nothing to do with the project, recorded tremendous increases.


However, the rising effect did not stop with these two altcoins and popular meme tokens also revived. In this context, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) and cat-themed tokens Popcat (POPCAT) and Mog (MOG) have experienced double-digit price increases in the last 24 hours.
Such movement was interpreted as an early sign that risk appetite was returning to crypto markets after weeks of stagnant markets.





According to CoinMarketCap data, in the top 100 cryptocurrencies ranking, PEPE is at the top among the most profitable altcoins with a rise of 21%, while FLOKI is at the top with 12.8%; DOGE 5%; BOME 11%; POPCAT rose 23.9% and MOG rose 25.6%.



Speaking to Coindesk, MOG token developer Shisui said:

“Roaring Kitty is living proof that retail can outperform (outperform) corporations at the highest level.
Its return was perceived as a bullish signal for meme tokens as the market remembered that much of the Gamestop frenzy in 2021 spilled over into DOGE and other meme coins.
While we are far from being in a truly risky environment, price action following the return of Roaring Kitty points to which assets will perform better once bullish conditions return.
“The market has shown itself and wants MOG.”

Apart from MOG founder, Floki lead developer B also evaluated the rise.






“The crypto industry is just starting to realize that meme tokens are fun, relatable, and represent the average person.
The vast majority of retail investors are flocking to meme coins. This group of investors is tired and ignores old crypto projects.
“Although many people are concerned about meme tokens because they do not have enough information about meme tokens, I have predicted years ago that there will be strong interest in meme tokens.”

Paul Grewal criticizes SEC's approach in Coinbase case following Debt Box mishandling

Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, Paul Grewal, charged the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with moving from a traditional Wells notice process to penalizing the company for their case against Coinbase. Grewal’s criticism is a reaction to a disclosure of the SEC’s failure to use its routine procedures in a similar bankruptcy case involving Debt Box.Coinbase CLO questions SEC actionsIn a current X posting, Grewal pinpointed an important weakness of the SEC’s methodology. He noted that the SEC did not follow its usual Wells procedures for Coinbase. The typical Wells procedure involves the SEC submitting a comprehensive justification of the facts that led to the proposed charges. Nonetheless, Grewal showed the Coinbase authorities that they still needed to hear from them which assets they deemed securities.Grewal’s statement was broadcast after the SEC filed a lawsuit on Debt Box. The SEC has stated that its staff’s “usual practice is to set forth an adequate description of the evidence”. Given this admittance, the SEC’s enforcement proceedings have come under scrutiny for their justice and openness. In Grewal’s opinion, the SEC’s absence of details as to the composition of the assets under question creates a serious question mark on the honesty of its claims against Coinbase.The case of Coinbase getting a lawsuit filed against them by the SEC in June last year is an example. SEC claimed that the company engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities since 2019. This legal fight remains to be sorted, and just recently, the SEC sought the court to reject Coinbase’s appeal against the litigation. Critics of the SEC attack the agency’s actions as an instance of the SEC overstepping its authority. Some argue that the SEC should not be involved in crypto companies’ investigations.A judge of the federal district court in Utah said in March that the SEC was poor in handling the Debt Box case. The judge used the words “gross abuse” along with “power misuse” to describe the SEC’s actions and emphasized the fact that this case was marred by “false statements” and “misrepresentation.” The criticism of the SEC’s strategy has become stronger. The resignation of two SEC attorneys who led the prosecution of Debt Box has raised even more doubts about the legitimacy of the case.SEC enforcement faces growing industry backlashSeveral industry figures have criticized the SEC’s approach to enforcement. Rodrigo Silva-Herzog, a special counsel at Cooley LLP, stated that the SEC’s move was comparable to carpet bombing and showed that they intended to kill anything that might be crypto. Hayden Adams, the Founder of Uniswap, also reiterated this opinion, chastising the SEC for criminalizing the industry’s “remarkable individuals” rather than populating standards with which these players could work.The SEC has adopted a strong and enforcement-oriented position that has been met with growing criticisms regarding the lack of disclosure. Top industry people advocate that the current regulatory framework is counterproductive, marking a threat to crypto innovation and businesses operating in this field. Well-defined rule-making and regulation formation will encourage an environment in which the industry can flourish instead of being crushed.These past legal cases against Coinbase, Debt Box, and other digital currency enterprises epitomize the broader difficulties that the sector is experiencing. The absence of definite regulation frameworks is a key problem, which may put companies in a far-reaching situation of enforcement proceedings accused of being prejudicial or unclear.

Coinbase 'on top of it' despite withdrawals not processing


Coinbase users claim they can’t withdraw their funds from the world’s second largest exchange despite it announcing it had ‘fully recovered’ after a system-wide outage.
The platform suffered the three-hour-long outage on Monday but in the early hours of Tuesday, it claimed to have resolved the problem and apologized for the inconvenience. 
However, a slew of users on X (formerly Twitter) have responded to the recovery announcement claiming that they still can’t withdraw their funds. 
According to one user, “It’s not fixed, withdrawals are not available!!,” while another posted “@X can we get community notes here. This tweet is false as millions of people are still unable to withdraw or transfer their assets.”

Coinbase told users, “We are aware that some users may still experience issues while sending cryptocurrency or withdrawing fiat. Our team is on top of it.”
The latest ‘degraded transactions’ update from the exchange’s status page was posted at 02:58 PDT, and said, “We are continuing to investigate this issue.”
When asked to explain the situation, Coinbase told Protos, ”Some users may still experience failures when sending crypto or withdrawing fiat.
“We are continuing to investigate this issue and will provide an update shortly. Rest assured, funds are safe.” Coinbase failed to comment further on what caused the previous outage.

CoinShares’ AUM Tops $6B Following Valkyrie ETF Acquisition - DailyCoin


        

CoinShares has released its Q1 2024 Report.



The company posted impressive gains.



The development comes after the acquisition of Valkyrie’s ETF business.




Digital asset investment firm CoinShares has reported billions in assets under management (AUM) and a record surge in revenue, gains, and other income in its Q1 earnings report.



The impressive results come after CoinShares acquired Valkyrie’s ETF business on March 12, inheriting the fund’s $530M in assets under management. This acquisition enhanced CoinShares’ global presence and operational footprint across the Atlantic.



Record Q1 Earnings



According to the report published on May 14, CoinShares witnessed a 216% year-over-year surge in revenue, gains, and other income in the first quarter of 2024. The earnings totaled £43.9 million ($55 million), up from £13.9 million ($17.4 million) during the same period last year.




The company’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) stood at £34.2 million ($42.9 million), up over fourfold compared to 2023 Q1 results.



Notably, CoinShares’ total comprehensive income grew from £2.9 million ($3.6 million) in 2023 Q1 to £34.1 million ($42.8 million) in 2021 Q1.



$6B in AUM



The firm’s AUM topped £4.77 billion ($6 billion), with £3.82 billion ($4.8 billion) held on its balance sheet relating to ETFs issued by CoinShares Digital Securities Limited and XBT Provider. The remaining £0.95 billion ($1.2 billion) is held in the newly acquired funds from Valkyrie and the BLOCK index.




CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti lauded the report, noting that it reflected its commitment to growth and excellence.



“This quarter reflects not only our robust financial performance but also highlights our enhanced strategic growth capabilities, exemplified by the successful acquisition of Valkyrie's ETF business in March 2024,” Mognetti said in a statement.  



Per the statement, 2021 Q1 represented CoinShares’ “strongest quarter ever.”

Empire Newsletter: It’s memecoins all the way down - Blockworks


Memecoins show the way
What are brand-new projects to do in such a topsy-turvy market, one that’s either teetering on the brink of altcoin season or about to veer off into another crypto winter?
It’s been about seven months since a fake news tweet from Cointelegraph pushed crypto into overdrive. The market is clearly still confused.
The salacious tweet — which reported that the SEC had approved spot bitcoin ETFs for US markets — confirmed a major bitcoin rally that had been brewing all through 2023.
Bitcoin surged by two-thirds in the months between the post and official SEC approval in early January, and then by another 80% after the fact.
Crypto has since been outright messy. Memecoin, DePIN and computing marketplace projects have pumped, privacy coins have dumped, and ETH is stuck in no-man’s land awaiting approval of its own spot ETFs a la BlackRock’s IBIT.
As Jason touches on in today’s Empire podcast episode, creative ways of issuing new tokens have emerged between this cycle and the last. 
Startups and protocol stewards commonly run private token sales in funding rounds with venture capitalists — which apparently don’t piss off the SEC — before airdropping slices of the circulating supply to users and other early adopters (read: those pesky airdrop farmers).
No ICO means no SEC lawsuits, the thinking goes, while the supply ends up with folks who actively use the protocols they power. Seems like a win-win.
A byproduct of this New Style of doing crypto business is that token supplies are often drip-dropped into the market over a number of years. It’s now relatively routine for tokens to launch with less than 25% of the supply circulating — and in some cases much less. 
The rest is kept by the team, early backers and other insiders to fund development, marketing and, eventually, provide ROI. What results is a number of low-float tokens with massively high fully-diluted valuations compared to their actual market caps, a blueprint largely perfected by Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research with Serum and other “Sam Coins.”
It all begs the question of whether there’s any correlation between price performance and low-float supply dynamics. 
There are individual cases: dYdX, for instance, had only 18% of the supply circulating when Cointelegraph’s fake news tweet confirmed the bitcoin bull market and has since released an additional 34% of the supply. dYdX’s price against bitcoin has collapsed by more than half in that time. 
The airdropped Starknet token is another — it only has 7.3% circulating supply and its bitcoin ratio has also halved.
But after analyzing the current top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, as well as another two dozen or so tokens featured in the top 100 just before the bitcoin bull run really kicked off, broader correlation is harder to find.
Tokens at the top of the chart have high floats. Tokens to the right of the dotted line have beaten bitcoin. Brighter circles have increased their supplies more than darker ones. And larger circles have grown bigger market caps.
The cluster in the top left shows even the highest-float tokens have found it hard to beat bitcoin
After removing a few outliers, about 40% of the top end of the market have outperformed bitcoin since October. At that time, the median circulating supply for tokens that have gone onto beat bitcoin was 70%. For underperformers, it was 79%. Not exactly a huge difference. Low float cryptocurrencies generally did as well as high floats.
Then, the median performance against bitcoin for tokens with circulating supplies of 80% or more was minus 21%. So, high-float tokens appear just as susceptible to losing significant ground as low-floats.
Even projects with some of the lowest floats — 19 tokens with under 25% of the supply circulating — on average have beaten BTC by 25%, while the median was almost 1% ahead.
But for standout performers, there does appear to be a link. Bitcoin ratios of nearly a dozen top cryptocurrencies have more than tripled since October. Their median circulating supply was 94% before the rally.
All those stars were memecoins and DePIN projects, which aside from Bittensor, all had a large majority of their supplies already circulating. 
A great irony of crypto in 2024 is that perhaps, it’s time to treat memecoin launches as the new standard moving forward. 
And of course, WIF blows them all out of the water

Ethereum only has 174 validators waiting in the queue, down from more than 22,000 this time last month. Active validators were at an all-time high yesterday: 1,014,915.
Bitcoin transactions are more than 80% standard BTC transfers, plugging the gap left by lower interest in Runes and Ordinals.
Pepe’s leading the memestocks, gaining 18% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.
GameStop’s stock is above $65 in premarket trading, on pace to shatter its 52-week high of $38.

Deja vu
He’s back. 
I am, of course, talking about the man, the myth, the legend: Roaring Kitty. 
The return of Keith Gill, the man behind the powerful online persona, sent memestocks and memecoins soaring on Monday. 
We were left asking one big question: Is history repeating itself? The answer is…maybe? 
We’re nowhere near the 2021 memestock mania, when GameStop’s stock rose to new heights. And it’s not just the retail investors who benefited from the memestock focus either back then or right now. 
Pepe, Dogecoin, FLOKI, Dogwifhat and, of course, some random GME-themed memecoins (with no affiliation with the company) gained after Roaring Kitty posted a video suggesting his return.
That’s not even mentioning that GameStop’s market cap is back over $9 billion, or that the stock closed up 74% on Monday. AMC, another memestock favorite, closed up 78%.
A number of factors made 2021 unique. I’m not saying it’s impossible in this cycle, but the threads may be more similar instead of the exact same.
Memecoins dominate today’s market narrative, whereas 2021 saw NFTs booming — nowadays, not so much. 
There are macro differences, too. Zooming out of crypto, interest rates are sky high with the Federal Reserve holding on to the 5.25%-and-5.50% range since the summer of 2023. Inflation still runs rampant. Retail investors simply aren’t seeing the same economic environment, not to mention the pandemic that was still a thing in 2021. 
Back then, interest rates were so low that millennials could actually afford to buy houses.
The point is: We’re not coming out of lockdown, and we’re seeing crypto bounce back with some weakness after a rough bear market. Of course, that’s not going to stop folks who want to jump into either the memestocks or memecoins. But the conditions don’t look to be ripe enough for a repeat. 
Just remember: Diamond hands may be forever, but these cycles tend to have a short — and volatile — lifespan.

The Works

Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was found guilty of money laundering by a Dutch court this morning. 
A new crypto-focused political action committee launched, according to Blockworks’ Casey Wagner. 
A bitcoin mining company said to have ties to China was ordered by the US government to divest land holdings near a nuclear missile base, according to CNBC. 
Crypto prime brokerage Falcon Labs settled with the CFTC for $1.7 million. The regulator said Falcon Labs failed to register as a futures commission merchant. 
OpenAI released a new, upgraded AI model called ChatGPT-4o, according to CNN. 

The Morning Riff
Here’s an interesting find: Speculators on the prediction market Polymarket seem to be giving US President Joe Biden similar chances at victory than challenger Donald Trump in a new, major national poll. 
On Polymarket right now — in a market that has earned more than $125 million worth of bets — Trump leads Biden 49% to 44%. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., meanwhile, pulls a mere 3% — one percentage point less than Michelle Obama, wife of former president Barack Obama.

Let’s look at the new New York Times poll from this week.
Trump leads in an array of battleground states, per the Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer poll. In two of those states, Trump pulls 49% to Biden’s 42%. Biden fares best in Wisconsin, pulling 47% to Trump’s 45%. 
Interestingly, RFK Jr. polled around 10% in each of the battleground states — a marker of strength for the independent candidate and much stronger than what the folks on Polymarket are saying. 
The polls and prediction market aren’t moving in tandem, but at some points, they rhyme. To be sure, the crypto-powered Polymarket has been giving Trump strong chances for months. But it’s a fascinating lens for a major political matchup — I’ll be watching as the bets continue to develop. Stay tuned.

Is the meme coin mania back to crypto?


Meme coins are trending in the cryptocurrency market after a month of low activity. Renewed interest surged when the famous meme trader Keith Gill returned to social platforms on May 13. Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, inspired the GameStop (NYSE: GME) short squeeze in 2021 and a following Dogecoin (DOGE) pump.
Data from Santiment’s SanBase Pro, Vinicius Barbosa, for Finbold on May 14 shows a recent meme coin trend taking shape. In particular, PEPE leads the charge among today’s trending coins, followed by FLOKI, DOGE, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and dogwifhat (WIF).

Notably, the Ethereum-based meme token of Pepe The Frog has surged over 21% in the last 24 hours at $0.000011. It is a similar level reached in early March due to a massive meme coin boom. Moreover, PEPE’s social dominance (bars) has jumped to record highs of 2.46% of the market’s overall social interest.


Other meme coins have not followed PEPE’s price action yet. However, as these coins trend in social indicators, traders wonder if the meme coin mania is back to cryptocurrency trading.

Roaring Kitty’s return: GameStop and meme coin mania
Roaring Kitty, a pseudonymous for Keith Gill, reactivated his X (formerly Twitter) account after three years of idle. Sided with its last post from June 18, 2021, the account’s timeline shows the meme of a ‘gamer’ taking an active position to start playing on May 12.

Interestingly, on Monday, GameStop’s stock jumped 45% the day after Gill’s mysterious activity. GME trades at $30.45 as its last known price. However, a CNBC report highlights a 130% surge in today’s pre-market, with GameStop dominating the stock market attention.
Since then, Roaring Kitty has continued posting a series of mysterious videos, which cryptocurrency and stock traders are eagerly trying to decode in an attempt to identify the next meme coin pump—similar to what happened in 2021 after the event with GameStop.
Related words have dominated Santiment‘s trending feed: “gme, gamestop, kitty, and roaring.”

In this context, it is worth the warning that trading meme coins or meme stocks can be extremely risky. The risk of ruin with this asset class is high.
Furthermore, experts warn of “The Greater Fool” theory dynamics that resemble financial bubbles, when the “mania” disappears and the late buyers remain with massive losses of assets that have no organic demand besides the highly speculative nature of traders trying to outplay the market, but being outplayed as soon as the “music stops.”

Floki Inu (FLOKI) Recovers Close to Monthly High, Extends Meme Token Trend | Cryptopolitan

Floki Inu (FLOKI) is up alongside other meme tokens. FLOKI represents doge-themed assets and is one platform that aims to onboard Web3 activities and gaming. FLOKI went up close to its monthly high, reaching $0.0001894 with nearly 10% daily gains. FLOKI marks a second round of the meme token trend, repeating its all-time high from 2021-2022. The asset trades at a higher baseline, gaining support from new enthusiasm for memes. FLOKI Gets Boost from Token Burn ProposalLike other meme tokens, FLOKI relies on a mix of holders and burns to diminish the token supply and move to a higher valuation. The DAO approach means voting for the FLOKI community to decide on the token burn. The news made FLOKI a trending asset based on social media discussions. When meme tokens traded differently than other assets, they started paying more attention to FLOKI. The recent addition of FLOKI to the Van Eck meme coin index adds to the exposure. The positive performance of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is adding to FLOKI’s improved profile. In the coming months, FLOKI will add a Telegram trading bot, making the asset even more accessible. Additionally, the team at FLOKI will burn the bot fees to decrease the token supply further. FLOKI will also add a DNS service similar to Ethereum addresses to boost adoption and popularity.FLOKI Bets on Gaming Once AgainOne reason for FLOKI’s crash was the end of the play-to-earn boom. From the beginning, the creators envisioned FLOKI as more than just a token but also a fuel asset for a gaming ecosystem. But the outflow of players meant FLOKI traded sideways for years, erasing 99% of its value. FLOKI is revamping its game strategy, offering a mix of social media exposure and a growing game environment. The Heimdall Ascends game issued a new patch with improved performance. The Valhalla game is now trying to revive its player base. The Valhalla NFT was among the most successful during the boom of 2021, but it had a very limited presence on OpenSea in 2024. But this year, Valhalla may rise again, as Floki Inu plans to launch two mainnet versions and a mobile version scheduled for the end of the year. The FLOKI token may also become part of FinTech activities by allowing FLOKI spending. For now, Floki Inu is in the process of securing banking services for the crypto-to-fiat ramp.Multiple Uses Still Possible for FLOKIFLOKI aims to offer multiple utilities in addition to its central game product, Valhalla. The Floki Inu platform offers TokenFi and DeFi options. Additionally, Floki Inu lists its own Valhalla NFT in a native marketplace. Users can also spend the FLOKI token through a debit card. Additionally, FLOKI recently gained more exposure on Binance Pay, with a dedicated profile page. The Floki Inu platform has also added educational tools and allows users to stake the FLOKI asset for additional passive income. FLOKI has no maximum supply and nearly 10B tokens in circulation, so any locked or staked tokens help boost the market price. FLOKI also aims to grow its influence on Binance Venus, currently listed in an isolated pool. FLOKI decentralized trading still locks $2.7B in assets, but the project aims to become part of the Venus Core and draw in additional liquidity. The FLOKI token has a relatively small holder pool of around 78K wallets, around 30% of the holders of PEPE. Despite this, FLOKI aims to become the most known meme asset with additional utility. The recent trend of meme tokens showed that the leading assets with some history are the best performers. New meme tokens may be launched almost all the time, but only a handful rise to the top of the charts. FLOKI is among those tokens, boosted by an older, recognizable brand and a strong community.
