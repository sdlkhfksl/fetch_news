These Are The 28 Altcoins Binance Has Invested In But Hasn't Listed Yet - Bitcoin Sistemi


Binance Labs, the investment arm of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has been investing in many altcoin projects recently.
However, Binance does not yet list many of the altcoins it invests in on its exchange platform. Although Binance's investment in a project does not guarantee listing on the exchange, data indicates that the company is more likely to list the altcoins it has invested in.


So, which are the altcoins that Binance has invested in but has not yet listed on the stock market? Here is the list:

GPT
PBUX
HIP
ZK
CHAMP
PEEL
LFT
SQR
OLE
APX
PSTAKE
OOE
FOG
GMEE
MAVIA
NCG
FAQ
BBS
D.F.D.
BUNNY
PUSH
CQT
MATH
RWA
HOPR
NYM
CERE
MOB


Particularly noteworthy tokens in this list include MAVIA, CQT and NYM. The reason why these tokens attract attention is that their total market value is over 100 million dollars. Predictably, Binance is more willing to list high-cap tokens.





The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange has been making many listings via Launchpools lately. The last example of this was Notcoin (NOT). However, the NOT rewards were disappointing, paying out only $1.5 per approximately $1000 staked.

‘Godfather of AI’ advises UK government to start UBI

Geoffrey Hinton, a world-renowned artificial intelligence (AI) expert often referred to as the “Godfather of AI,” recently consulted with members of the United Kingdom’s government at Downing Street where he advised lawmakers to consider adopting a universal basic income (UBI) to deal with the impending threat of job loss.Until recently, Hinton worked for Google developing high-level AI features for neural networks — the underlying technology that powers most modern generative AI systems such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.According to Hinton, the AI revolution will mostly benefit the rich. Laypersons, blue collar workers, and those employed in jobs that can be automated stand to lose their means of income and “that’s going to be bad for society” he recently told the BBC in an interview.“I was consulted by people in Downing Street,” said Hinton, “and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea.”Hinton isn’t the only major player in the field of AI who believes that we’ll need UBI to offset the impact automation will have on the human economy.Prior to becoming one of the most famous CEOs in the tech industry, OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman studied under Hinton and helped pioneer the neural network. These days, Altman is known for his tenure as OpenAI’s top brass as well as his full-throated support for UBI.Altman's other venture, Worldcoin, is focused on providing UBI through the adoption of a cryptocurrency token provided free of charge to anyone who signs up for the service and submits to a retinal scan to verify their identity.Aside from saving humanity from employment displacement through the advent of UBI, both Hinton and Altman have expressed their belief that AI could pose an existential threat to humanity.Hinton reportedly left his post at Google so that he could speak more freely about his concerns over the impact AI could have on the future of our species. And Altman, for his part, claims the entire reason he co-founded OpenAI with Elon Musk and others was to ensure that advanced AI systems were developed carefully and for the benefit of humanity.In his recent BBC interview, Hinton said we may only have a handful of years before the threat becomes imminent:“My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over.”Related: AI safety researchers leave OpenAI over prioritization concerns

XRP Q1 Report Reveals Booming Usage Despite 5% Price Slide - DailyCoin


        

The price of XRP has dipped in Q1 2024, but its usage has skyrocketed.



Spot volume has surged by double digits while on-chain transactions have exploded by over 100%.



With a controlled token release and a dynamic network, could XRP be poised for a future upswing?




Fintech giant Ripple’s Q1 2024 report has painted a curious picture for XRP. Although the native token of the XRP Ledger has experienced a slight price dip in the first quarter of 2024, its usage statistics have told a completely different story. Here’s why this disconnect deserves a deeper dive.



XRP in Action



Forget price charts for a moment. The real story lies in how people are using XRP. Q1 2024 saw a staggering 40% increase in spot volume, reaching a cool $865 million. This translates to a significant jump in actual XRP being traded, not just paper shuffling by investors. 







On-chain transactions, which represent the actual movement of XRP on the Ripple network, exploded by a massive 108%, surpassing 251 million.This surge in activity isn’t just about volume. Interestingly, the average cost per XRP transaction dropped a sweet 44% compared to the previous quarter. 




This makes using XRP for everyday transactions even more attractive. Could this be a sign of wider adoption beyond simply trading? The amount of XRP “burned” for transaction fees. This number spiked by 101%, indicating a healthy level of network activity. Think of burning as a way to keep the XRP ecosystem clean and efficient, similar to how pruning strengthens a garden.



The Price Dip: A Temporary Blip?



So, why has the price declined amidst all this positive activity? The answer might lie in broader market fluctuations or the ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Investors may be adopting a wait-and-see approach, causing a temporary price dip.



Ripple’s report on their XRP holdings offers further insight. The majority of XRP is held in escrow, slowly released over time. This controlled release could help prevent market saturation and contribute to long-term price stability.




The Q1 report paints a picture of a dynamic XRP ecosystem, even amidst a price dip. The surge in transaction volume, lower costs, and healthy burn rate all suggest a network that’s being actively used. 



While the price decline deserves attention, it shouldn’t overshadow the underlying strength of the XRP ecosystem. For investors, this might be a time for cautious optimism, with a close eye on both the legal battle and continued network development.



On the Flipside




The wider cryptocurrency market experienced a correction in Q1 2024, which could be a contributing factor to the XRP price dip.



The ongoing lawsuit by the SEC against Ripple casts a shadow of uncertainty over the future of XRP.



The controlled release of XRP from escrow could continue to put downward pressure on the price in the short term.




Why This Matters



This disconnect between XRP’s rising usage and falling price raises questions about the short-term impact of market sentiment versus the long-term potential of a network with demonstrably increasing utility. Understanding this dynamic could be crucial for investors seeking to navigate the often-contradictory forces at play in the cryptocurrency market.

Floki Inu Frenzy: Memecoin Eyes New Highs as OI Soars


																Floki Inu (FLOKI), the Shiba Inu-inspired memecoin, has rocketed into the spotlight with a surge in trading activity and a nearly 20% price increase in the past week. However, experts caution that this “pup-ularity” might be short-lived, fueled more by hype than by strong foundations.

	Related Reading



Open Interest Takes Off: Newcomers Flock To FLOKI
The key indicator driving excitement is the skyrocketing Futures Open Interest for FLOKI. According to Coinglass, this figure, which reflects the number of outstanding futures contracts, has climbed a staggering 110% since May 1st, reaching a 30-day high of nearly $20 million. This suggests a surge of new market participants entering FLOKI positions, potentially anticipating further price increases.
Source: Coinglass
Adding fuel to the fire is the significant rise in FLOKI’s daily trading volume. On May 15th, Santiment reported a daily volume exceeding $1 billion, marking the highest level for FLOKI since late March. This intense buying activity indicates a surge in investor interest, pushing the price upwards.
Source: Santiment
Momentum Indicators Point To A Bullish Charge
Further bolstering the case for a bullish FLOKI is the behavior of its key momentum indicators. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Money Flow Index (MFI) currently sit comfortably above their neutral lines, at 62.68 and 65.37 respectively. In simpler terms, these metrics suggest that the price momentum leans towards further gains in the short term.

Also, the broader market sentiment surrounding FLOKI is notably positive. Increased trading volumes and a surge in social media mentions have amplified investor interest, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is gaining traction not just among retail traders but also institutional investors.
Recent partnerships and strategic developments within the FLOKI ecosystem are likely to fuel further growth. These factors, combined with the strong technical indicators, paint a promising picture for FLOKI’s near-term performance, potentially paving the way for substantial price appreciation.

However, beneath the shiny exterior lies a potential cause for concern. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), an indicator that measures the buying and selling pressure of an asset, paints a rather bearish picture.
Still In Negative Zone
Despite the price appreciation, FLOKI’s CMF remains firmly in negative territory, currently hovering around -0.11. This suggests that even though the price is rising, the buying pressure might be weakening.
This divergence between price and buying pressure is often seen as a sign of a potential reversal, indicating a rally driven by short-term speculation rather than long-term investor confidence.

While FLOKI’s recent performance is undeniably impressive, the underlying factors suggest a potentially volatile future. The surge in open interest and trading volume hints at a market frenzy, but the negative CMF raises concerns about the rally’s sustainability.

Ripple Market Report: Why Is XRP Volume Getting The Spotlight?


								Cryptocurrency payment company Ripple has released XRP’s market report for the first quarter of 2024. The report sheds light on XRP’s soaring trading volume. It also highlights updates on the on-chain performance and recent technical developments of the XRPL ecosystem. 

XRP Spot Volume Surges
According to the Q1 2024 XRP market report published officially on Ripple’s website on May 17, the total volume of Centralized Exchanges (CEX) in March has surged to unprecedented levels, recording an increase to $2.93 trillion in spot volumes and a $9.1 trillion in derivatives volume. 
On the other hand, the weekly volumes of Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) have spiked by 100% to $40 billion over the fourth quarter of 2023. 
Amidst the crypto market’s overperformance, XRP recorded a rise in average daily volumes. The cryptocurrency surged to $865 million in Q1 2024, a 40% increase from Q4 2023. The daily average XRP derivatives open interest increased from $460 million in Q4 2023 to $500 million in Q1 2024. 
XRP’s market report revealed that towards the end of Q1 of 2024, the cryptocurrency had exhibited a “high correlation with the general market,” emphasizing XRP’s increased trading activities and robust engagement. However, at the beginning of Q1 2024, particularly in March and February, XRP witnessed a significant decline. 
The cryptocurrency hit a low point in mid-February and peaked in March, highlighting a gradual decline to a potential bottom triggered by volatility. Following this downturn, XRP quickly recovered towards the end of March; however, its volatility levels were still as high as ever, recording a high of 90%. 
The report also disclosed several exchanges that contributed to XRP’s increased volume. The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, contributed a significant volume of XRP, while the combination of Bitstamp and Upbit accounted for a large percentage of XRP’s spot volume. 
Moreover, XRP’s distribution volume has remained relatively constant throughout the first quarter of 2024. Binance, Bybit, and Upbit have been responsible for more than 70% of the total trading volume in XRP during this period. 
XRP is currently trading at $0.52. Chart: TradingView
On-Chain Transactions Skyrocket
In addition to its increased volume in Q1 2024, XRP has also witnessed an increase in on-chain activity. On-chain transactions skyrocketed to $231.3 million in Q1 2024 from $121 million in Q4 2023, reflecting more than a 108% increase Quarter over Quarter (QoQ).
The average cost per transaction also decreased by 45% during this period. Additionally, the XRP burned for transaction fees surged by more than 101%, totaling 636,184 in 2024. 
Furthermore, the volume on DEX (in USD) rose by over 5%, recording $57.6 million in Q1 2024 from $54.9 million in Q4 2023. 

While recording an increase in on-chain activity, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem also witnessed a significant spike in developmental activities. Earlier this year, XRPL integrated Axelar, a multi-chain platform, to improve interoperability and expand XRPL’s features across more than 55 blockchains.
Moreover, XRPL partnered with EasyA, a leading Web3 app, to deploy decentralized applications (DApps) with intelligent contract capabilities on the ledger.

Venezuela to shut down cryptocurrency mining farms


Venezuela’s Ministry of Electric Power announced it would disconnect all cryptocurrency mining farms from the national power grid (SEN, Sistema Electrico Nacional). The measure aims to control the high energy demand from these mining farms and ensure reliable service for citizens.
AlbertoNews, a local media outlet, reported the announcement on May 18.

“The purpose is to disconnect all cryptocurrency mining farms in the country from the SEN [National Electrical System], avoiding the high impact on demand, which allows us to continue offering an efficient and reliable service to all the Venezuelan people,” 
the Ministry reported in its account in Instagram.



Notably, the announcement followed the seizure of 2,000 cryptocurrency mining machines in the country. This action is part of the government’s ongoing anti-corruption campaign. Leading to the arrests of several officials from state institutions.
Corruption with the National Superintendency of Cryptoassets
The National Superintendency of Cryptoassets (Sunacrip) has been under a restructuring board since the arrest of Superintendent Joselit Ramírez. Ramírez has connections to Tareck El Aissami, former Petroleum Minister and former president of Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).
On that note, El Aissami was charged with treason, embezzlement, misuse of influence, money laundering, and criminal association.
Venezuela power grid issues and cryptocurrency mining
Venezuela has faced an ongoing electricity crisis since 2009, worsened by massive blackouts in 2019 that left cities without power for up to seven days. Frequent power outages have negatively affected the country’s quality of life and economic activities.
Therefore, Governor of Carabobo state, Rafael Lacava confirmed restrictions on cryptocurrency mining farms due to their significant electricity consumption. He urged residents to report illegal cryptocurrency mining operations to prevent power shortages.

“If you, neighbor, see a house that you know, tell that person to turn off the farm, or else report it, because when they turn off the light, because you have to give light to a man so that he can earn some reales (money), you are left without electrical service.”
– Rafael Lacava

As reported by AlbertoNews, experts attribute the crisis to poor maintenance and inadequate investment in the power grid. Meanwhile, the government blames sabotage and has promised to modernize the state-controlled power network.
Overall, Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency mining are known worldwide for their high energy consumption. Countries like China and Cazaquistan have banned the activity to preserve their power grids, centralizing mining in fewer locations.
Therefore, the fewer countries allowing this activity, the higher the security concerns will be, as a few miners dominate block discovery.

Ethereum ETFs progress, but Solana may turn things bearish instead - How? - AMBCrypto



New data indicated that the likelihood of approval of Ethereum ETFs was relatively high.
Ethereum lost market share to Solana, however, the price of ETH continued to surge.

Ethereum [ETH] has been under a lot of heat due to the rising speculations around the dismissal of the approval of Ethereum ETFs.
Uncertainty around ETFs
While there is uncertainty regarding timely approval due to the SEC’s silence, it’s a matter of when, not if, a U.S. spot ETH ETF will be approved, according to Coinbase’s data.
However, potential justifications for disapproval may stem from differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin [BTC], particularly Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism.
Clear regulatory guidance on asset staking is lacking, making it unlikely that spot ETH ETFs enabling staking will be approved soon. Despite this, it is believed that unstaked ETH should not be impacted.
There is potential for a positive surprise in the approval decision, with odds estimated around 30-40%.
Considering crypto’s emergence as an election issue, the SEC may hesitate to deny approval, and litigation could overturn a rejection.
Additionally, not all spot ETH ETF applications need to be approved simultaneously, as noted by Commissioner Uyeda’s statement regarding spot BTC ETF approval.
Stiff competition
Even though the possibility of approval of Ethereum ETF’s was high, there were some other challenges that the Ethereum network would be facing. Especially, competition from other Layer 1 chains.
In terms of adoption, the emergence of highly scalable integrated chains, especially Solana [SOL], seems to be impacting Ethereum’s dominance.
With its ability to handle a large number of transactions at low fees, Solana has shifted the focus of trading activity away from the Ethereum mainnet.
Over the past year, Solana’s ecosystem has seen remarkable growth, increasing its share of decentralized exchange (DEX) volume from just 2% to 21%.
Source: Coinbase
Moreover, the increasing popularity of memecoins on the Solana network are also driving users away from Ethereum and towards Solana.

Despite these factors, the price of ETH has seen some positive movement. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,117.82 which was a result of a 2.11% appreciation in the last 24 hours.
Even though the price of ETH was rising, its Network Growth declined, indicating waning interest from new users.

Approval in Expected Cryptocurrency Lawsuit: $3 Billion to be Distributed to Users - Bitcoin Sistemi

In a landmark ruling, Genesis, a bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, has received court approval to distribute billions of dollars in digital assets and cash to its creditors.
Late Friday, Judge Sean Lane approved Genesis' Chapter 11 repayment plan, which includes a unique structure for returning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to creditors. This decision paves the way for Genesis to return customer assets that have been frozen on the platform since November 2022 following the collapse of other major crypto firms.


Judge Lane dismissed DCG's legal challenge in a sweeping 135-page decision, stating that Genesis' parent company lacked legal standing to challenge the Chapter 11 plan. As the equity owner of Genesis, DCG is last in line for repayment in Chapter 11. Judge Lane stated that any value that the company's bankrupt subsidiary was required to distribute was absorbed by creditors who were not fully repaid and stood before DCG.
“Given the magnitude of the creditors' claims, DCG is left out as a multi-billion dollar capital holder,” Judge Lane said.





DCG had argued that the plan provided an unacceptable benefit to Genesis creditors at its own detriment. The parent company insisted creditor claims should be determined by where crypto prices stood when its subsidiary filed for bankruptcy in early 2023. At the time, Bitcoin was trading around $24,000, and on Friday it was above $66,700.
DCG may appeal Judge Lane's decision.



Genesis estimates that creditors who loaned it digital assets could receive up to 77% repayment under its proposal, but significantly less if DCG prevails. The bankrupt company's bid has received broad support from its creditors, which include customers of Gemini Earn, a lending program run in partnership with Gemini, the billionaire Winklevoss brothers' company.
Judge Lane also said he would approve a settlement involving New York Attorney General Letitia James, who sued Genesis over the Earn program. The deal is structured so that assets that might otherwise go to state authorities are instead returned to former Earn customers.

‘46 Times Faster Than Ethereum’ - Solana Races to the Top of CoinGecko’s List of Swiftest Blockchains - The Daily Hodl


								Smart contract platform Solana (SOL) is moving to the top of CoinGecko’s list of fastest blockchains.
In a new publication, CoinGecko says Solana is a staggering 46 times faster than its rival Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market cap, making it the fastest large blockchain on the market.










However, CoinGecko says that Solana has only reached 1.6% of its theoretical maximum throughput.
 “Solana has proven to be the fastest among large blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) reaching a record high of 1,504 on April 6th this year amid the memecoin mania. 
This makes Solana 46 times faster than Ethereum, and more than five times faster than Polygon, which has the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.
Despite ranking as the fastest blockchain, Solana has still only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS.”
CoinGecko’s statistics show that Solana’s highest throughput was 1,053.7 TPS while Ethereum’s was just 22.70 TPS. The data also shows that Ethereum and its top 10 layer-2 scaling solutions only combine for 500 TPS.
 “Altogether, Ethereum and its ten largest scaling solutions registered a total real TPS of 500, placing their combined processing speed ahead of BSC (Binance Smart Chain) but still slower than Solana and Sui.” 
Other fast blockchains on the list include Sui Network (SUI) Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon (MATIC), Toncoin (TON), Tron (TRON), Near Protocol (NEAR) and Avalanche (AVAX).
Solana is trading for $172 at time of writing, a 7.63% increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin fees hit 3-month low: A $12M drop, explained - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s total fees have dropped to a three-month low.
Due to this, miners’ revenue derived from fees has declined.

Bitcoin [BTC] network fees have fallen to a record low as the Layer 1 (L1) transaction volume continues to decline.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), on-chain data provider IntoTheBlock noted that transaction fees on the Bitcoin network plunged to their lowest level in three months this week.
 Recording a weekly transaction fee totaling $12 million, the network saw a 45% decline from the previous week. 
State of the network
This week’s decline in the Bitcoin network’s fee is due to the decrease in its transaction volume.
 According to Santiment’s data, the aggregate amount of BTC across all transactions completed on the network fell steadily during the week. 
Between the 11th and the 17th of May, Bitcoin’s transaction volume plummeted by 5%.
Source: Santiment
The average fee paid per transaction dropped as the network saw a decline in demand. According to Messari, this decreased by 17% during the period under review. 
At press time, the average cost of executing a transaction on the Bitcoin network was $2.56.
The miners on Bitcoin’s network are the primary victims of its low network fees.
 After the percentage of miner revenue derived from transaction fees rallied to a year-to-date high of 75% on the 20th of April, post-halving event, it has since declined significantly. 
Source: Messari
As of this writing, only 4% of miner revenue is derived from the fees paid by Bitcoin’s users. This marked a 95% decline from the YTD high, per Messari’s data. 
Miners offload coins to prevent losses
Low revenue and BTC’s recent price troubles have forced some miners to sell their holdings.
 AMBCrypto assessed Bitcoin’s Miner Supply Ratio and found that it has fallen by 0.21% since the halving event. 
This metric measures miners’ BTC holdings relative to the coin’s total supply. When it declines this way, miners are selling a larger portion of their mined coins. 
This is often due to capitulation from high operational costs, the desire to take profit, or a lack of confidence in the coin’s price.

BTC sell-offs among miners on its network have led to a depletion of the coin’s Miner Reserve. This measures the amount of coins held in miners’ wallets within a specified period.

According to CryptoQuant’s data, BTC’s Miner Reserve, at 1.81 million at press time, has dropped by 1% since the 25th of April.

CryptoQuant CEO Maps Out Path Forward for Bitcoin Bull Cycle - Here’s When He Thinks It Will End - The Daily Hodl


								The head of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant thinks Bitcoin (BTC) is only halfway through its current bull cycle.
Ki Young Ju tells his 346,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC’s market cap is growing faster than its realized cap, a trend he says tends to last around two years.










The realized cap metric records the price of each Bitcoin when it last moved and aims to gauge how many holders are in profit or at a loss.
Explains Young Ju,
“If this pattern continues, the bull cycle might end by April 2025.”
Source: Ki Young Ju/X
BTC is trading at $67,014 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 2% in the past 24 hours and more than 10% in the past seven days.
Young Ju’s firm, CryptoQuant, notes that short-term holders are selling Bitcoin at low or negative profits. The firm says traders have exhausted their unrealized profits, which has decreased selling pressure in the BTC market.
Source: CryptoQuant/X
CryptoQuant also notes that Bitcoin balances at over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks have stabilized, which means less supply is entering the market.
Source: CryptoQuant/X
The analytics firm does caution that BTC demand from permanent holders and large investors “needs to accelerate to sustain the price rally.”

Whopping 97% Transaction Count Plunge Faced by Shibarium, What's Happening?

While the Shiba Inu developer team continues to work and add important upgrades to the Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium keeps seeing a drastic plunge in transaction activity — it has been going for almost a month already.This has coincided with a plunge in the SHIB burn rate as this metric found itself in the red today.Shibarium faces enormous activity plungeAccording to data publicly shared by the Shibariumscan explorer, the Layer-2 blockchain of the popular meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu, Shibarium, continues to lack transaction activity. For almost a month, the plunge has been astounding — almost 100%.Compared to a high of 562,990 daily transactions detected on Shibarium on April 17, today’s number equals merely 16,800.Still, the overall number of transactions continues to grow, albeit slowly. By now, this metric demonstrates 417,469,578 transfers made in total since the blockchain’s launch in August last year.Earlier this week, the enigmatic leader of Shiba Inu known as Shytoshi Kusama announced the launch of a new version of the ShibaSwap DEX and its bridging to Shibarium from the Ethereum chain. This move enables its users to be exposed to a wide range of products and services on both blockchains. This partly explains the low level of transaction activity on Shibarium at the moment.Grok AI has a say about Shibarium and ShibaSwapOn Friday, the official marketing lead of the SHIB team, Lucie, tested the Grok AI bot about what it knows about the ShibaSwap DEX launching on Shibarium. Elon Musk’s AI provided a humorous breakdown of the DEX for Lucie.Grok jokingly likened the expansion of the DEX from Ethereum to Shibarium to “moving from a crowded city to a peaceful suburb with better infrastructure and lower fees.” The outcome of this, per the AI, is “Faster transactions and lower costs for all you SHIB enthusiasts out there.” The program also revealed what it believes to be “the most exciting feature” of ShibaSwap. That is the ability to make up new liquidity pools on Shibarium. Another new feature brought by the DEX to Shibarium is discovery charts and trending tokens.Grok eventually concluded that “the new and improved ShibaSwap on Shibarium offers faster transactions, lower fees, new liquidity pools, and enhanced token discovery.”

Ethereum ETFs About to Be Approved? - Here are the Candidates Waiting for Confirmation ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
All eyes are on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approving the Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Following the groundbreaking approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, the anticipation for Ethereum ETFs is palpable, with major investment firms waiting for confirmation.



BlackRock



Leading the charge is BlackRock, the world’s largest investment management company, which submitted an S-1 form for its iShares Ethereum Trust. With CEO Larry Fink believing in Ethereum’s potential, BlackRock’s entry into the Ethereum ETF market shows the huge institutional interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency.



Grayscale



Meanwhile, Grayscale, a prominent crypto asset manager, awaits the SEC’s response to its proposal to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF. Having paved the way for Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., Grayscale will directly compete with BlackRock for the best ETF provider.



Ark 21Shares



ARK Invest, in collaboration with crypto ETF issuer 21Shares, has also entered the fray, filing for an Ethereum ETF with Coinbase as the trustee. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest is known for its innovative investment strategies, and its entry into Ethereum ETFs reflects the increasing demand for crypto investments.



Fidelity, VanEck, and Hashdex



Fidelity, another major player in the financial industry, signaled its interest in Ethereum ETFs by filing for a product with the SEC through Cboe.

&nbsp



The same goes for VanEck. An established asset manager, it was the first to send its proposal for an Ethereum ETF, but it later withdrew it in 2021.



Brazilian asset manager Hashdex, in partnership with Nasdaq, applied for a Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, leveraging its success with crypto ETFs in Brazil.



Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise



Franklin Templeton’s proposal for a Franklin Ethereum Trust includes staking as part of its investment strategy. With staking gaining popularity in the crypto space, Franklin Templeton is looking to present a unique value proposition and offer more opportunities to its investors.



Invesco, Galaxy Digital, and Bitwise have also submitted proposals for Ethereum ETFs, adding to the growing list of contenders awaiting SEC approval.



While the SEC’s decisions on these proposals are eagerly awaited, industry experts anticipate a potential launch of Ethereum ETFs by the end of the year. If approved, Ethereum ETFs could open up new avenues for mainstream investors to participate in the crypto market and have a huge impact on the market, potentially sending it to new highs.

Solana’s native token, SOL, is leading the recent recovery in crypto prices, outshining most of its large-cap crypto rivals, including Bitcoin (BTC), and signaling that the bulls are attempting a huge comeback. A hedge fund founder sees the prospect of SOL surging to the $200 price tag by the end of this month.



$200 SOL Within Reach



Solana’s SOL has surged over 3.8% in the last 24 hours to reach $175.79 on May 18 — its highest level in over a month. The token’s monthly returns stand at around 33.5%. On the weekly timeframe, SOL’s 20.7% leap was the largest among the top 15 coins and tokens by market cap.



Daniel Cheung, the co-founder of digital asset hedge fund Syncracy Capital, posited on the X micro-blogging site, “Strength on SOL has been incredible on this bounce. Very clear this is still the best trade of this cycle.”



Cheung revealed that he is “much more confident” that the price of SOL could reclaim the $200 mark by the end of this month and rocket to new historic highs “soon.”







SOL set its current record high of $259.96 in November 2021 — about 32.8% higher than the current price — during the peak of the previous bull market. The cryptocurrency crashed to as low as nearly $8 in December 2022 following the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire but has rebounded drastically since. It’s up a whopping 739.2% in the past year alone.

&nbsp



The uptick in SOL’s value so far in May can be linked to several factors, including a rise in Solana-based meme coins that are riding the latest wave of crypto hype, growing decentralized finance (DeFi) trading volume, and positive news in the Solana ecosystem. Trading platform Robinhood recently launched its first SOL-staking product for European customers. The rollout boosted investor confidence in Solana, as being featured by a leading brokerage like Robinhood is considered a validation of the crypto’s potential and strength.



Cheung highlighted forthcoming upgrades laying the groundwork for the much-awaited Firedancer upgrade — an entirely new independent client scheduled for release later this year — as another reason to be hopeful for Solana’s price.

Bitcoin Breakout From Major Resistance Levels Signals Bullish Momentum | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin which has been moving downward for a while now has managed to break above its previous resistance level of $67,303.98 and has been showing signs of a potential rally ever since.
At the time of writing, the price of BTC is up by 0.04%, and it is currently trading at around $67,303.98. BTC’s price is showing bullish signs and also forming a base above the $64,554.45 resistance level.
The price is trading above both the bearish trend line and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) both on the 4-hour chart and the daily chart suggesting a bullish signal. This can be seen in the image below.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour timeframe also suggests that the price of BTC is bullish as the RSI line is trending close to the overbought session above the 50% level. According to the RSI, the price might make a little consolidation before continuing in the upward direction. 
Furthermore, the 1-D MACD also indicates a bullish momentum as the MACD histograms are already trending above the zero line, while the MACD line and the MACD signal line have crossed each other and are heading towards the MACD zero line. If both the MACD line and the MACD signal line successfully cross above the MACD zero line, then the price is expected to move further upward.
1-Day Alligator: Finally, it can be observed that the price of Bitcoin has successfully crossed above the William Alligator indicator. Both the Alligator jaw and lip have crossed above the alligator teeth suggesting the start of an upward movement.

What Could Happen If Bitcoin Continues To Surge Upward?
There are two levels of resistance $67,267.79 and $71,337.80. If Bitcoin’s price continues to surge upward with this momentum and breaks above the $67,267.79 resistance level, the price could move further toward the $71,337.80 resistance level. A breakout from this resistance level would see prices rising significantly, probably to set a new high for the year.
What If The Price Declines?
If the price fails to break above these resistance levels mentioned above, Bitcoin will continue to move downward. There are currently three main support levels for BTC, which are $64,554.45, $60,137.39, and $56,540.64.
Should the price manage to continue in a downward direction, it will move toward the $64,554.45 support level. And if this level fails to hold the price, it might move even further to test both the $60,137.39 and $56,540.64 support levels.

The Big Day for the Cryptocurrency Market is Just 4 Days Away: Two Analysts Explain Their Views - Bitcoin Sistemi

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will make an important decision on the approval of Ethereum ETFs within the next week. However, according to Ric Edelman, President of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, the lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies could lead to a negative outcome.
Edelman, a famous investor and personal finance writer, expects another delay in the decision. “I think there will be another delay, which obviously isn't all bad news,” he said in an interview on CNBC's “ETF Edge” this week.


However, the SEC will have two options, either an approval or a rejection, in its decision on May 23. But a rejection also ultimately means a postponement.
“Without any police on their heads, it forces investors to go on their own outside of the investment advisory community because the community can't help them because we don't know what the rules are,” Edelman said. And they find themselves involved in fraud and fraud.” said.






Edelman also criticized SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's refusal to write regulation, stating that it “actually hurts the consumer rather than helps.”
Meanwhile, Bitwise Asset Management's Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan is also defending the new rules. Hougan argued that “80-year-old securities laws do not fit neatly into this world of digital assets, crypto and 21st century technology.” Hougan believes that everyone wants a safe and secure platform where investors are protected and innovation is assured.


Bitwise has its own filing for a spot ethereum ETF, and Hougan remains hopeful that it will arrive. “We've entered the ETF era for crypto. We've seen Bitcoin ETFs come to market. We've seen the great things they've done for investors, lowering costs, improving regulations, increasing safety, security and peace of mind. I think we'll achieve that on Ethereum as well,” he concluded.

Blockchain's Disruptive Impact on Gaming - BeInCrypto


In our world today, blockchain technology is at the forefront of almost every innovation. A groundbreaking innovation itself, the blockchain was initially associated with cryptocurrencies but is rapidly disrupting other industries. 
From Finance and healthcare to supply chain management and even voting systems, we are experiencing the impact of blockchain technology at a seismic level. Its core tenets of transparency, security, and decentralization are proving—and continue—to be a potent recipe for change. Blockchain has empowered individuals and promoted new ways of interacting with the world around us. 
One of the industries that has been impacted the most by the influence of blockchain technology has been the gaming industry. This industry, with an estimated value exceeding $200 billion, is no stranger to disruption. From the rise of mobile gaming to the explosion of eSports, the gaming industry has constantly adapted to new technologies and other consumer preferences. 
Now, the concept of play-to-earn (P2E) is rapidly gaining traction. This gaming model offers players ownership of in-game assets and the potential to earn real-world rewards through gameplay.
According to DappRadar, in January 2024, the number of daily Unique Active Wallets (UAW) interacting with P2E games reached 1.5 billion. This was 28% of that month’s entire industry activity and highlighted the increasing user base in this space. This shift is attracting a new wave of users to the cryptocurrency world while reshaping the gaming and eSports scenery. In this article, we will dive into the disruptive impact of blockchain technology on gaming.
Rise of play-to-earn (P2E) 

The advent of P2E games has brought a fundamental change in the player experience. Traditionally, gamers dedicated their time and resources to virtual worlds, acquiring in-game items and characters with value within the confines of the gameplay. Blockchain technology has disrupted this model by introducing the concept of ownership. 
Players can now own unique digital assets within a game through NFTs. These assets are not exclusive to the game alone; they exist on a blockchain, which is a secure and transparent digital ledger that allows players to freely trade, sell, or rent them on secondary marketplaces. This creates a dynamic player-driven economy within the game, promoting a deeper connection and giving the players a true sense of ownership over their digital experiences. 
In 2022, the global P2E Games market was valued at $32.9 billion. This figure is projected to increase at a CAGR of 17.93% to $88.6 billion by 2028. Ownership, however, isn’t where the disruption stops. The P2E model incentivizes long-term engagement and rewards skilled players for their dedication. 

Imagine earning cryptocurrency or other valuable tokens through your gameplay, competing for real-world prizes, or accumulating tradable in-game resources. With P2E, players can potentially generate income through their passion for gaming, blurring the lines between entertainment and work.
The rise of P2E gaming is just the beginning. As blockchain technology continues to grow and integrate seamlessly into the gaming experience, even more innovative models will emerge. There are some already; Move-to-Earn (M2E), Watch2Earn (W2E) etc. This disruption is democratizing gaming, empowering players, and creating entirely new revenue streams within the industry. The future of gaming is being shaped by blockchain, and the possibilities are vast and exciting.
NFT-powered adventures in P2E gaming
According to Statista, the global Non-fungible token (NFT) market size was worth a staggering $41 billion in 2021—an amount that neared the total value of the entire global fine art market ($50 billion in 2020)—and is projected to experience continued exponential growth. 

NFTs are revolutionizing the concept of ownership. These unique digital tokens act as deeds of ownership for in-game assets, transforming them from part of the gaming build to valuable possessions. Imagine a virtual fantasy world where your spear isn’t only a digital weapon but also a one-of-a-kind NFT you can customize, upgrade, and even sell to other players on a secure marketplace. 
Rewards like these empower players to invest in virtual experiences, promoting deeper connections and a sense of true belonging within the gaming world.
The P2E model goes a step further. By integrating NFT mechanics with gaming, players can earn rewards for their achievements. This could involve anything from conquering challenging dungeons to fighting and slaying mythical beasts to participating in competitive tournaments and crafting rare items. 
These rewards, often in the form of cryptocurrencies or tradable tokens, can then be used to enhance their characters, purchase new in-game assets, or they can even be cashed out for real-world value. This creates a compelling economic dynamic, where players are not just passively consuming content but actively contributing to and profiting from the game’s ecosystem. 
NFT-powered P2E games like Sidus Heroes is a prime example of that trend. Sidus Heroes is a futuristic Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that leverages the power of NFTs to create a truly player-driven economy. By using NFTs in the game, players can own in-game content which opens doors for trading, selling, or renting these possessions. This ultimately creates a vibrant marketplace fueled by blockchain technology. 

Democratizing eSports with blockchain technology
The impact of blockchain technology on gaming extends beyond NFTs. Companies like QORPO are using this technology to revolutionize the world of eSports. QORPO has positioned itself at the point where blockchain technology and eSports meet, aiming to make professional-level competition accessible to a wider audience. Their flagship project, Citizen Conflict, is a hero shooter game that combines fast-paced action with a robust eSports infrastructure powered by blockchain technology.

Here’s where things get more interesting. Traditionally, aspiring eSports stars face significant barriers to entry, often lacking the resources or connections to compete at the highest level. QORPO’s blockchain technology can change that. By creating a fair and transparent system, Citizen Conflict empowers talented players to showcase their skills and potentially earn rewards that could propel them onto the global eSports stage. 
This approach has the potential to disrupt an eSports industry that reached a worldwide audience size of 532 million people as of 2022 and is expected to reach over 640 million viewers worldwide by 2025. By leveraging blockchain, QORPO is paving the way for a new generation of eSports stars, and pushing for a more inclusive and meritocratic competitive scene. 
Bridging the gap between traditional and blockchain gaming 
P2E has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional and blockchain gaming experiences. Traditional gamers often value high-quality graphics, intuitive interfaces, and engaging storylines. Blockchain games, on the other hand, can sometimes prioritize complex mechanics or the underlying technology over user experience. 

New P2E projects are recognizing this need for accessibility. By focusing on user-friendly interfaces and captivating gameplay alongside the benefits of blockchain technology, they are creating a welcoming environment for both seasoned gamers and newcomers to the crypto space. 
Imagine an Open-World MMORPG that boasts stunning visuals and a rich narrative while simultaneously allowing players to own and trade unique in-game items through NFTs. This approach caters to the core desires of traditional gamers while introducing them to the exciting possibilities of P2E. 


In the last two sentences, I have just described Outlanders. Outlanders is an open-world MMORPG that bridges the gap between traditional and blockchain gaming. This project recognizes the importance of user experience, offering intuitive interfaces, engaging gameplay, and high-quality graphics that resonate with both seasoned gamers and newcomers to the world of cryptocurrency. 
This focus on user experience is crucial for the mainstream adoption of P2E gaming. By removing technical barriers and offering familiar gameplay mechanics alongside the benefits of blockchain technology, these innovative projects can attract a wider audience. This not only expands the player base for P2E games but also fosters a more diverse and vibrant gaming community. Ultimately, it will lead to a more robust and successful future for the entire P2E ecosystem. 
The future of gaming is P2E
The rise of these P2E games represents a glimpse into the future of gaming. Blockchain technology is not just about creating new experiences; it’s about empowering players, fostering community ownership, and creating a more equitable and rewarding gaming landscape. As the industry continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative P2E models emerge, transforming the way we play, compete, and potentially even earn a living in the virtual world.

Trader turns $3K into $46M in PEPE, Ethereum gas overhaul, Tornado dev guilty: Hodler’s Digest, May 12-18 - Cointelegraph Magazine


            
					
Top Stories This Week



Crypto trader turns $3K into $46M in one month as PEPE price soars



A savvy trader made $46 million in profit, which is an eye-watering 15,718-fold return on his initial $3,000 investment. The unknown wallet bought 4.9 trillion PEPE for $3,000 on April 15, which is currently worth over $56 million. The trader sold 1.41 trillion PEPE for $7.4 million and is currently sitting on 3.5 trillion PEPE, worth $38.9 million, according to a May 15 X post from Lookonchain. PEPE’s market capitalization was around $4.5 billion on May 15, making it the third-largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).



Vitalik Buterin proposes Ethereum gas model overhaul



Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed Ethereum improvement protocol, EIP-7706, which introduces a new gas model for transaction call data. This new fee would be separate from the existing gas fees for transaction execution and data storage. The proposal aims to reduce costs for transactions that are data-heavy but not computationally intensive by setting separate charges for call data, distinct from the costs of executing contract code or storing data in “blobs.” If the proposal is accepted, the Ethereum network will be responsible for setting the call data costs independently of other costs.



Tornado Cash developer guilty of money laundering



Alexey Pertsev, the developer of the cryptocurrency mixing protocol Tornado Cash, has been found guilty of money laundering, raising potentially severe implications for open-source code developers. The developer was sentenced to five years and four months in prison for allegedly laundering $1.2 billion worth of illicit assets on the platform. The sentencing came despite Tornado Cash being a noncustodial crypto mixing protocol — meaning that the funds that go through the protocol are never held or controlled by it.







Over 600 firms reveal billions in combined investment in Bitcoin ETFs

Sam Altman thinks giving everyone ‘a slice of GPT’ could pay for UBI



Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and chair of Tools For Humanity, has suggested a novel approach to universal basic income (UBI) by utilizing “compute” as a resource. In a recent episode of the All-In podcast, Altman discussed how the advancements in AI could reshape socioeconomics and possibly replace traditional monetary income with a system where everyone has access to computational resources. The executive suggested that individuals could use their allocated compute from powerful AI systems like GPT-7 for personal use, sell it, or donate it for purposes like cancer research.







Winners and Losers

Prediction of the week



Bitcoin moves toward range highs but derivatives traders watch from the sidelines



According to Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards, stock and crypto market seasonality, along with Bitcoin on-chain data, suggest that BTC price could consolidate for four-to-five months.



In a new report, Edwards said that Bitcoin continues to oscillate within the cycle range highs in the $58,000-65,000 region, with continuous weekly closes above the $58,000 “supportive of the long-term trend continuation.”



Likening BTC’s price action to gold, which formed a “massive cup and handle” pattern over the last 13 years, with the “cup” lasting four years, Edwards noted how Bitcoin appears to show the same chart pattern.



Edwards noted that given the similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there is a possibility that BTC could spend “up to 9 months in the range high forming a cup before a measured move up.” He said: 



“The technical picture remains bullish, provided the price holds above $58K. The longer we spend in the range highs, the more likely this structure will merge into a classic ‘cup and handle’ pattern, which would typically see strong price appreciation following.”







FUD of the Week



Filing suggests SEC is exploring grounds to deny spot Ether ETFs



Analysts have discovered a March filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that the regulator might consider classifying Ether as a security.

Microsoft faces multi-billion dollar fine in EU over Bing AI

Microsoft faces a fine in the European Union of up to 1% of its annual revenue if it doesn’t respond to a request for information by May 27. The threat stems from a request made under the E.U.’s Digital Services Act concerning the company’s Bing search engine and its associated generative artificial intelligence services. Source: @EU_Commission on X.com.A post on X.com compelling Microsoft to “provide information under the Digital Services Act on generative AI risks on Bing” was sent on May 17 disclosing the news to the public. “Bing may pose risks linked to generative AI, such as so-called ‘hallucinations’, deepfakes, as well as the automated manipulation of services that can mislead voters.”In a linked blog entry from the European Commission’s official website labelled “Daily News,” the Commission explained that the initial request was sent on May 14 “regarding specific risks stemming from Bing's generative AI features, notably “Copilot in Bing” and “Image Creator by Designer.”The blog post went on to explain that Microsoft “now has until 27 May to provide the requested information to the Commission.” This warning comes with a notice that the Commission “may impose fines up to 1% of the provider's total annual income” as well as “periodic penalties up to 5% of the provider's average daily income” if the E.U.’s request isn’t met by the deadline. While a 1% revenue fine might not sound like a crushing blow, in Microsoft’s case that could amount to well over two billion dollars. Its self-reported revenue for 2023 was $211 billion and, if the current market trend remains steady, it’s conceivable that Microsoft could blow past that in 2024. At these numbers, the least the Redmond company would pay, if fined, would be around $2.1 billion. It bears mention that these fines haven’t yet been levied and that, as of current, Microsoft hasn’t been found guilty of violating any E.U. laws — at least not specifically pertaining to this notice. Instead, this appears to be more of a public-facing courtesy notice that the company has effectively been serviced with a request for further information that bears consequences if ignored.Cointelegraph reached out to Microsoft for comment but didn’t receive an immediate response.

Fund managers predict SEC rejection of Ethereum ETFs next week - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            In contrast to the enthusiasm that preceded the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, reports over the past few weeks suggest that optimistic expectations for the Ethereum product’s approval have cooled down. Speaking with Bloomberg this week, Katherine Dowling, general counsel for ETF applicant Bitwise, said she anticipates rejection next week due to the lack of public activity typically seen before approval.“Most people are universally expecting a disapproval order,” Dowling noted. “You’re not seeing the types of public activities that you would see if there was going to be an approval.”In a CNBC interview, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck also predicted a likely denial. Next week, the SEC’s decision will confirm the fate of VanEck’s and Ark Invest’s filings.“We were the first to file as well for Ethereum in the US, and we and Cathy Wood, are kind of the first in line for May, I guess, to probably be rejected,” he stated.Unlike the frequent revisions made to spot Bitcoin ETF applications, there has been minimal back-and-forth between fund companies and the SEC regarding Ether ETFs. People involved in the talks with the securities agency reported that they had braced for a negative outcome.In the final month leading up to the spot Bitcoin ETF decision, the market buzzed with activity. Fund managers engaged in fierce fee competition, while industry experts placed bullish bets.Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have pegged the approval chances for spot Ethereum ETFs at a mere 25%. Seyffart recently expressed skepticism about a positive outcome, saying a nod is “not happening.”Why might the SEC decide to reject spot Ethereum ETFs?SEC Chair Gary Gensler has not been vocal about Ethereum ETF filings. However, he has clarified that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs does not set a precedent for other crypto ETFs. Concerns about the classification of most cryptos as securities remain a major obstacle to compliance.According to Scott Johnsson, Van Buren Capital’s general partner, the SEC must provide a clear and detailed explanation if they reject spot Ethereum ETF filings. One potential reason for rejection could be Ethereum’s classification.The SEC has not definitively classified Ether, and its decision might hinge on whether it considers Ether a security. If the SEC views Ether as a security, then spot ETFs wouldn’t be allowed under current regulations.The SEC’s alleged investigations into the Ethereum Foundation and the implications of Ethereum’s staking feature suggest a possible regulatory direction.The SEC might not approve all spot Ethereum ETF applications at once: CoinbaseDespite the uncertainty, Coinbase’s analyst David Han sees a 30% to 40% chance of approval by month’s end.He believes the correlation between CME futures and spot exchange rates, which was pivotal for Bitcoin ETF approvals, could similarly benefit Ethereum ETFs.However, like Johnsson, Han noted that the SEC might focus on Ethereum’s PoS mechanism as a reason for denial since regulations around staking are unclear. He suggested spot Ethereum ETFs enabling staking are unlikely to be approved.ARK Invest and 21Shares recently amended their S-1 form for the proposed spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by removing the staking component. The move is considered an effort to align the filing with SEC preferences.

Ripple Reports Surge in XRP Trading And XRPL Network Activity


Ripple has released its first-quarter report for this year, highlighting substantial network activity for its XRP token and the XRP Ledger (XRPL).
These growth metrics coincide with substantial progress in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
XRP And XRPL Wins Big in the First Quarter

XRP’s daily spot trading activities surged 40% to approximately $865 million during the reporting period. The firm noted that XRP volume across exchanges remained fairly constant, with Binance, Bybit, and Upbit responsible for over 70% of the total traded volume.
Crypto traders’ speculative interest in XRP remained high in the first quarter, hitting a daily average of $500 million. Ripple stated that the high spot and open interest volume highly correlated with general market activity, pointing towards robust XRP trading and activity across venues.
Furthermore, transactions on XRPL doubled in Q1 2024 from the previous quarter. The number of transactions soared from around 121 million in Q4 2023 to over 251 million by the end of Q1 2024. Notably, this transaction surge coincided with a significant decrease in average transaction fees, which fell about 45% to $0.000856 by the end of March.

“Average transaction fee reached a high in December due to widespread testing of inscriptions on the XRPL. As such, the decrease in average cost per transaction indicated a reset and that no network congestion occurred in the quarter,” Ripple explained.

Moreover, XRPL underwent significant technical upgrades in the first quarter. During the period, XLS-30—a non-custodial automated market maker (AMM)—was introduced to enhance on-chain liquidity and trading capabilities for DeFi developers and users.


“More XRPL traction – I’m particularly excited that the native AMM, arguably one of the largest updates to the XRP Ledger, went live in Q1,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said.

Furthermore, XRPL integrated with other platforms like Axelar. This integration expanded XRPL’s capabilities, allowing developers to easily interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications across over 55 blockchains.

Despite this ecosystem growth, Ripple’s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC continues afoot. Notably, the case is nearing its conclusion, with the SEC seeking a $2 billion fine against Ripple. Ripple has countered this request, deeming it baseless and advocating for a penalty not exceeding $10 million.

“In terms of next steps, both parties will wait for the Judge to make a determination on the final remedies – likely in the coming months. Ripple remains confident that the Judge will approach the remedies phase fairly,” Ripple concluded.

$384,000,000 To Be Handed To 191,000 Victims of Banking Giant's Illegal Practices: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - The Daily Hodl


								A US banking regulator says $384 million will soon be handed to victims of an online bank’s illegal practices.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says 191,000 people will receive the windfall of cash, which will be given to former customers of Texas-based Think Finance.










The agency filed a lawsuit against the lender in 2017, accusing the company of tricking customers into repaying loans they did not owe.
The firm’s loans in 17 states were considered illegal, void and uncollectable.
Now, the CFPB says it’s beginning to distribute $384 million from its victims relief fund to support people who got caught in the scam.
Says CFPB Director Rohit Chopra,
“Too often, victims of financial crimes are left without recourse even when the companies that harm them are stopped by law enforcement. 
The victims relief fund allows the CFPB to help consumers even when bad actors have squandered their ill-gotten profits.”
The agency began making payments to people harmed by Think Finance’s practices on May 14th.
Anyone who believes they are eligible can find out more here.
The CFPB says it’s handed out approximately $19 billion to consumers harmed by scams, frauds, and other illegal practices since 2010.

Are New Altcoins Listing On Exchanges Like Binance Profitable? This Crypto Researcher Has The Answer | Bitcoinist.com


								A crypto and macro researcher identified as “Flow” on X (formerly Twitter) has provided a detailed review of the profitability of new altcoins listed on Centralized Exchanges (CEX) such as Binance. The researcher disclosed that prominent exchanges like Binance have experienced a significant decline in the value and performance of new tokens listed on their platform. 
80% New Listed Altcoins On Binance Are Down
Reports from Flow suggest that new tokens listed on CEXs’ are not as profitable as they once were. Highlighting all the listed tokens on Binance from the past six months, the crypto researcher noted that 80% of these new altcoins have declined massively, with their value falling below their initial listing price. 

Most of these tokens were listed on Binance from November 2023 to May 2024. New tokens like BLUR, which was integrated on November 24, 2023, plummeted considerably, recording a 45.6% decrease in performance. 
Source: X
On the other hand, excluding two altcoins, all tokens listed from the beginning of 2024 have declined. The most significant drop was recorded by a token called PORTAL, which decreased 69.2% from its listing date on February 20, 2024. 
Only four cryptocurrencies recorded significant gains from the 32 newly listed tokens on Binance. Meme coins like Ordinals (ORDI) and Dogwifhat (WIF) experienced the largest gains, 261.9%,i and 117.69%, respectively. At the same time, others like Jito (JTO) and Jupiter (JUP) saw gains above 50%. 
Flow has disclosed that if investors had diversified their portfolios by investing equal amounts in each of Binance’s newly listed tokens, they would have suffered a significant 18% decline over the past six months. 
The macro researcher noted that when tokens launch at an elevated Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV), they tend to depreciate, ultimately underperforming. He disclosed that most of the tokens listed on Binance are backed by Tier1 VC and launched at extremely high prices, resulting in substantial profit taking and a significant decline. 
New Tokens Have No Real Users
According to Flow, new altcoins launching on Binance are no longer profitable investment vehicles, as their high FDV at launch removes most of their upside potential. He indicated that these newly listed altcoins currently serve as exit liquidity for insiders, who exploit retail investors‘ limited access to quality investment opportunities.

Additionally, the crypto researcher disclosed that newly listed crypto projects on Binance have no real users or a strong community backing them. Their tendency to launch at high FDV also leads to unsustainable growth, which discredits the broader crypto industry. 
Flow asserted that investing in newly listed tokens was a rigged game, highlighting a comment made by economist Alex Kruger, who stated:
Most tokens launching these days are engineered to pump and inevitably dump. This happens because founders set very short vesting schedules, fake metrics, and focus on hype rather than on user acquisition.
Kruger also revealed that automated trading bots and market makers disadvantage ordinary investors by buying large amounts of tokens at launch prices and selling them at significantly higher prices.

Altcoin Tied to Security-Focused Crypto Wallet Surges by 43% This Week Amid Rollout of New Swaps Feature - The Daily Hodl


								An altcoin linked to a security-focused crypto wallet is outperforming the broader digital asset market, surging by more than 40% this week.
Safe is a smart contract wallet that runs on multiple blockchains.










The project introduced native swaps this week.
Explains Safe,
“Batch auctions consolidate multiple transactions, reducing gas costs and the need for multiple signatures. A smoother, more efficient trading process is here. 
Built-in MEV (maximal extractable value) protection by specialized third-party solvers ensures fair and interference-free transactions. Specialized solvers compete to fill orders by accessing a broad network of decentralized liquidity sources, aiming for more competitive pricing.”
SAFE, the project’s native asset, managed to soar by as much as 43% this week after rallying from a seven-day low of $1.78 to a high of $2.55. SAFE has retraced since and is trading at $2.21 at time of writing.
Despite its recent gains, the altcoin remains more than 37% down from its all-time high of $3.56, which it set on April 23rd of this year, according to CoinGecko.
SAFE began trading in April. That month, Coinbase listed the asset with an “experimental label,” which the exchange attaches to tokens that pose certain risks such as price swings and canceled orders because of lower trading volume and availability.
The Singapore-based cryptocurrency trading platform Bitrue and the Seychelles-based exchange MEXC also listed Safe for trading starting April 25th.

Assessing the Solana ecosystem and how Jito will help it grow - AMBCrypto



Jito collected large amounts of daily fees, surpassing a vast majority of DeFi protocols.
The Solana ecosystem continued to see growth as activity on the network soared.

Solana [SOL] has been able to attract numerous users to its ecosystem over the last few months. Primarily, this growth in activity has been initiated by memecoins being attracted to the network.
Jito shows growth
However, other elements of the Solana ecosystem have also seen growth over the last few days. One of them was the Jito protocol.
At press time, Jito was generating $1.5 million in daily fees, surpassing all but a few DeFi protocols. For comparison, Lido collected $2.58 million and Uniswap collected $2.09 million in fees over the past 24 hours.
Jito’s success has several potential implications for Solana. Firstly, it demonstrates the growing DeFi landscape on Solana.
Jito’s ability to compete with established DeFi giants like Uniswap and Lido showcases Solana’s ecosystem’s potential to create highly competitive dApps.
This could attract more developers and users to the platform, further accelerating DeFi growth within the Solana ecosystem.
Secondly, Jito’s high fees indicate a healthy level of network activity on Solana. This activity could translate to increased network security and potentially higher value for SOL in the near future.
However, a large part of Jito’s fees are derived from MEV (maximum extractable value), which can sometimes lead to negative user experiences like sandwich attacks.
Solana will need to find ways to mitigate these potential drawbacks to ensure sustainable growth. Overall, Jito’s performance is a positive sign for Solana.
Source: X
In terms of overall activity on the Solana network, there was a massive uptick observed. The number of daily transactions occurring on the network grew from 17 million to 28 million over the last week.
Coupled with that, the number of daily active addresses on the network grew from 1 million to 1.5 million during the same period.
Source: Artemis
State of SOL
At press time, SOL was trading at $174.67 and its price had grown by 3.80%  in the last 24 hours.

Is your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator

The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) had surged significantly during the same period, indicating that the money flowing into SOL had surged.
However, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) had reached into the overbought territory, which could suggest a correction could be on SOL’s way in the future.

Bitcoin Ready to Break $70,000? Experts Debate Current Bull Run - DailyCoin


        
The Bitcoin price has unexpectedly climbed above $67,000 for the first time in a month.



Sentiment has reached its most bullish level since January. This major shift has coincided with the recent surge.



The fear of missing out (FOMO) has the potential to threaten the sustainability of the current rally.
Bitcoin has been on a thrill-seeker’s adventure in 2024. We soared to record highs in March, only to sputter and stall in the weeks since. The April halving event, hyped as a potential price rocket launch, fizzled instead. But hold onto your mining rigs, because Bitcoin might be pulling a surprise U-turn.Price Surge Ignites OptimismOver the past week, Bitcoin defied expectations by breaching the $67,000 mark for the first time in nearly a month. Even more intriguing? This isn’t just a blip on the radar. This price surge seems to be triggering a seismic shift in how people feel about the cryptocurrency.
Imagine a giant online mood ring for Bitcoin. That’s essentially what Santiment, an on-chain analytics firm, offers. Their “Weighted Sentiment” metric tracks the overall sentiment, positive or negative, surrounding Bitcoin. It factors in two key ingredients: the chatter (social volume) and the general vibes (sentiment score). When social media explodes with Bitcoin discussions and the overall tone is rosy, the Weighted Sentiment jumps through the roof and according to Santiment, Bitcoin’s sentiment just hit its most bullish level since January, fueled by this recent price surge. This surge in optimism rivals the euphoria that followed the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s green light for Bitcoin spot ETFs, a major vote of confidence for the cryptocurrency’s legitimacy.Don’t Let FOMO Fool YouThe good vibes aren’t just a Bitcoin lovefest. Santiment’s data reveals that Chainlink (LINK), another major cryptocurrency, is also experiencing its most bullish sentiment in over a year, coinciding with a near 20% price increase last week. This has analysts debating whether this could be the start of the second leg of the bull run.
A bullish market is generally a cause for celebration. But there’s a dark side: FOMO, the fear of missing out. When everyone seems to be striking gold in crypto, it’s easy to get swept up in the frenzy and make rash decisions. Santiment emphasizes that keeping FOMO “under control” is crucial for a sustained Bitcoin price rally and a potential push towards the highly anticipated $70,000 mark.Predicting the future of Bitcoin is like trying to predict the weather, notoriously tricky. But one thing’s for sure: the recent price surge and the shift in sentiment paint an intriguing picture for the future of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. On the Flipside
Bitcoin’s price is still highly volatile. This surge could be temporary and could be followed by another correction.



The recent rise in Bitcoin’s price also coincides with a general upswing in traditional markets. A downturn in the stock market could dampen Bitcoin’s momentum.



Bullish sentiment can be a contrarian indicator. When everyone is optimistic, it might be a sign the market is nearing a top.
Why This MattersBeyond Bitcoin’s individual price action, this surge coincides with a massive increase in positive sentiment across the market, mirroring the pre-ETF euphoria. This combined momentum could signal a broader bull run for cryptocurrencies, but cautious optimism is key to avoid impulsive investment decisions fueled by FOMO.This article explores Bitcoin ETFs attracting inflows, discussing Bitcoin surging over 7% and spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessing their second-largest inflows of the month:Bitcoin Bull is Back: Why BTC’s 7% Jump Is Just the BeginningIf you’re interested in the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price, this article about Bitcoin ETFs might be of interest:Bitcoin ETFs See $303M Inflows as BTC Soars North of $65K

Genesis wins court nod to return $3 billion to creditors - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Bankrupt crypto lending company Genesis Global Holdco received court permission to return approximately $3 billion in cash and crypto assets to its creditors as part of its bankruptcy liquidation process on Friday. US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane made the decision.In addition, Judge Sean Lane rejected Digital Currency Group’s (DCG), attempt to challenge the distribution plan for the debtors’ assets in the bankruptcy case.DCG objected to the distribution plan as it believes repayments should be capped at the crypto asset values of January 2023 (at the time of Genesis’ bankruptcy filing). Since then, the value of cryptos like Bitcoin has surged, with Bitcoin’s price jumping from around $21,000 to a current value of nearly $67,000.The firm also claimed that the plan provides too much return to creditors at DCG’s expense. Essentially, DCG feels that it is unfairly disadvantaged by how the returns are allocated.However, DCG’s arguments failed. Judge Sean Lane ruled that, as an equity holder, DCG’s financial interest isn’t directly impacted by how the assets are distributed. Equity holders only get paid after all creditors are satisfied.Additionally, given the insolvency and the massive creditor claims, DCG won’t receive any distribution under this plan.The total amount owed to creditors is billions of dollars higher than the debtors’ available assets. These claims have priority over equity holders like DCG, meaning they get paid first in line during bankruptcy.The ruling also considered the substantial $32 billion in claims from federal and state financial regulators, prioritizing them over DCG’s equity stake.Genesis had previously estimated that it could pay up to 77% of the value of customer claims, a figure subject to future market fluctuations. Hit hard by the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX, Genesis – along with other lending platforms – faced liquidity issues during the 2022 market downturn. This ultimately led the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2023.Genesis’ creditors include several prominent names, such as Gemini, Bybit’s Mirama, Decentraland, and VanEck.Adding to its troubles, Genesis Global Capital faced a legal lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC accused Genesis and Gemini of selling unregistered securities through Gemini Earn. The company reached a $21 million settlement with the SEC in March this year.

Shiba Inu Metrics Turn Bullish: Here’s How Many Wallets Stand Between Current Price And $0.000139 | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu is exhibiting interesting price action as it looks to break above a downward-sloping upper trendline under which it has been trading since the first week of March. Currently, SHIB is up by 10% in the past seven days and is at a decisive junction of a breakout that could lead to a strong bullish action. Failure to exhibit a strong breakout could lead to a reversal into bearish action. 
However, although SHIB is looking prime for a breakout, data shows there are still multiple resistance levels to overcome. Particularly, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock (ITB) reveals multiple walls of addresses between the current price and $0.000139.
Shiba Inu Looking To Break Above $0.0001
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002494. Recent price action in the past 24 hours indicates that the bulls are now looking to push the cryptocurrency above the $0.000025 price level. This indicates that many investors are still bullish on SHIB.

According to data from ITB, around 62,700 addresses purchased 69.97 trillion SHIB at this point at an average price of $0.000025. Although SHIB will eventually break through, there are still five resistance walls to overcome on its way to reaching a new all-time high. These price walls consist of a range of addresses that could initiate selloffs immediately after breaking even.
Interestingly, there are around 454,160 addresses holding over between the current price of Shiba Inu and the current all-time high of $0.00008845. The first major resistance is at an average price of $0.000028, where 98,230 addresses are holding around 40.17 trillion SHIB tokens. This range of addresses bought in at a maximum price of $0.00003 and SHIB would need to break above this price point before the next resistance.
After surpassing this maximum price, Shiba Inu would be facing another resistance at around $0.000033 where 143,280 addresses are holding 21.3 trillion SHIB tokens. Shiba Inu would need to breach an additional barrier at an average price of $0.000040. There are only 57,180 addresses waiting here with a maximum and minimum price of $0.000036 and $0.000044 respectively.

However, this level represents a major psychological barrier as SHIB has yet to perform a strong break above $0.000040 this year. A rally up to this point could lead to a consolidation in the short term as many traders sell and take profits. At the same time, it could also lead to an increase in accumulation which in turn could translate to a stronger bullish sentiment.
The path to $0.000139 includes two other resistance levels with 62,340 and 92,530 addresses holding volumes of 33 trillion SHIB and 29.73 trillion SHIB respectively. 
On the flip side, Shiba Inu would need to defend its current support at $0.000022 in the short term.

Stalin on Solana (STALSOL) to Skyrocket 13,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Stalin on Solana (STALSOL) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Stalin on Solana (STALSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because STALSOL has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Stalin on Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Stalin on Solana could become the next viral memecoin.



Stalin on Solana launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Stalin on Solana on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Stalin on Solana by entering its contract address – gJisVCA2QNsRa4j3ur1h3uzyXW5VuMQYHmQ2dQ1k4tE – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like STALSOL.

Court Clears Genesis’ $3B Bankruptcy Plan Despite DCG Objection - DailyCoin


        

The bankruptcy court has finally approved Genesis’ Chapter 11 plan.



Judge Sean Lane dismissed DCG’s objections against the bankruptcy plan.



Per the plan, users affected by the collapse will receive reimbursements soon.




The Gemini Earn nightmare appears to be nearing its end after bankrupt crypto lender Genesis secured court approval for its Chapter 11 plan on Friday, despite objections from its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DGG). 



After over a year of users’ assets stuck in limbo, the approval looks to propel them closer to full recovery as soon as next month. 



Genesis Secures Major Win



On Friday, May 17, US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane did not heed the slew of objections against Genesis when approving its Chapter 11 plan, which seeks to return over $3 billion in cash and assets to creditors this year. 




The development marks a significant milestone for Genesis and Gemini Earn users, who have been waiting for reimbursement for over a year following the chaos stirred by the collapse of Terra Luna and Three Arrows Capital. 



While DCG particularly opposed the proposal, Judge Lane did not hesitate to dismiss complaints against Genesis’ Chapter 11 plan.



Court Dismisses DCG’s Objections Against Genesis



DCG, Genesis’ parent company, did not approve of the new Chapter 11 plan. It argued that claims should have been valued in US dollars at the time of the company’s bankruptcy filing in January 2023, bypassing the crypto industry’s gains over the past year and a half.




However, Judge Lane shut down DCG’s objections, claiming that the parent company had “no economic stake” in the case. He also wrote, “The record here clearly establishes that there is not sufficient value in the Debtors’ estates to provide DCG a recovery as equity holder after unsecured creditors are paid.” 



Judge Lane further highlighted that Genesis’ approved plan involves a multi-step process to allocate assets based on whether users were owed US dollars or cryptocurrency. He pointed out that, due to the rise in digital asset prices since the resolution was reached, creditors with claims in crypto would bear some “shortfall.” 



“Due to the increase in the price of digital assets after a resolution was reached, it is currently anticipated that those creditors whose claims are denominated in U.S. dollars will be receiving 100% of their loan balance (deferring payment of post-petition interest) while creditors with claims in cryptocurrency will bear the shortfall in funds,” Judge Lane wrote. 



Now, despite DCG’s objections, Genesis can proceed with reimbursing its patient customers. 



Gemini Earn Claimants to Receive Reimbursement Soon



Following the news, Winklevoss twin-led exchange Gemini celebrated the Chapter 11 plan approval, calling it a “welcome decision.” The platform, however, did note that the ruling did not impact global settlement among Gemini, Genesis, and other creditors in the Genesis Bankruptcy previously approved by the Bankruptcy Court.



As per the approval, Gemini Earn creditors will receive their owed assets at the beginning of June. Gemini announced that approximately 97% of owed funds will be repaid initially, with payments made as in-kind reimbursements. This means that a customer who deposited one bitcoin into Gemini Earn will receive one bitcoin back rather than the US dollar value of the token at a specific date.



The approach starkly contrasts FTX’s bankruptcy plan, which values users’ claims when the exchange filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. 



On the Flipside




Genesis is slated to pay the SEC a $21 million fine from remaining bankruptcy funds to resolve the regulator’s lawsuit.



Genesis recently agreed to a settlement deal with the NY AG office. 




Why This Matters



The bankruptcy plan approval is a major win for users affected by Genesis’ collapse. It presents them with a concrete and strategic roadmap outlining the timeline for recovering their funds.

X To Unleash The Dogecoin Flood? Payments Promise Stirs Community


								The Dogecoin army is barking with excitement after an insider hinted at the long-awaited integration of Dogecoin (DOGE) into X Payments, Elon Musk’s social media platform. However, a closer look reveals a reality check is needed before Doge rockets to the moon.

Dogecoin Disciples Rejoice At Insider’s Tweet
A spark ignited the Doge community when “DogeDesigner,” an insider with both X and Dogecoin connections, tweeted about a potential late-2024 launch of X Payments with DOGE support. This unleashed a wave of enthusiasm, with both crypto enthusiasts and regular users eager to see the meme coin take center stage on the popular platform.


But Musk Remains Silent: Will Doge See The Light Of X?
The rumors of a Doge-X marriage have circulated before. Similar murmurs have inspired the crypto community—especially those sporting Doge avatars—to respond time and time again with unwavering optimism.
But Musk, the X-wielding, Doge-loving ruler, has been remarkably silent. He hasn’t specifically rejected DOGE’s inclusion, but it’s still difficult to get an official confirmation from him.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView
The lack of confirmation doesn’t dampen the Doge army’s spirits. Their unwavering optimism is fueled by X Corporation’s recent acquisition of licenses allowing them to process cryptocurrency payments in specific US states. This intriguing move has the crypto world abuzz with speculation, with many interpreting it as a potential first step towards embracing DOGE for payments.
A Reality Check Is Needed
Despite the excitement, a dose of reality is necessary. First, Musk has repeatedly and emphatically stated that neither X nor any of his ventures plan to create their own cryptocurrencies. This stance was a direct response to scams targeting unsuspecting investors and rumors of a future “X coin.” The ongoing scrutiny by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on altcoins likely plays a role in this decision.

Second, even with X Payments accepting cryptocurrencies, there’s no guarantee DOGE will be the chosen one. Several established cryptocurrencies with larger market caps and wider adoption might be more attractive options for X.

The Doge Army’s Undying Hope
These obstacles don’t seem to bother the Doge army, which is renowned for its unshakable allegiance. They cling to the hope that DOGE will be accepted as payment on X due to Musk’s previous affection for the joke coin. If their persistent optimism pays off, or if their hopes of a Doge-powered X come crashing down, remains to be seen.
Will X Payments become the launchpad for Dogecoin’s next moonshot, or will it be another case of Doge dreams deferred? The answer lies with Musk, and with the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation.

Flipped Cat (FLICAT) to Surge 8,300% Before Bitrue, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Flipped Cat (FLICAT) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Flipped Cat (FLICAT), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Flipped Cat presents a similar opportunity.



Flipped Cat has a market cap below $17,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,300% in the coming two days ahead of it being listed on giant crypto exchange Bitrue, and Flipped Cat could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap.




Currently, Flipped Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Flipped Cat on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Flipped Cat by entering its contract address – JDCyeohyUFrxX31t4tY8Fe5LzMWkstAMaVHuH8Lq71Z1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like FLICAT.

Shiba Inu's Q2 price prediction: Will SHIB retest $0.000030? - AMBCrypto



SHIB could be set to build on its recent increase, technical analysis revealed.
The difference in exchange flow suggested sideways movement before the price bursts upward.

Shiba Inu [SHIB] posted an 11.69% increase in the last seven days. However, the token has been struggling to maintain that momentum over the last two days.
Irrespective of that, some technical indicators suggest that the price could get back to its rally. One of the signals AMBCrypto observed was the golden cross on the 4-hour SHIB/USD chart.
To get a golden cross, traders look at the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This pattern forms when the shorter EMA crosses above the longer EMA.
Shiba Inu flashes a bullish sign
At press time, the 20 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 50 EMA (yellow)—A golden cross, indicating a bullish trend.
Furthermore, SHIB’s price had not slipped below the 50 EMA, meaning the thesis has not been invalidated.
However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) was down to 30.21. This decrease indicates that a lot of capital has flowed out of the SHIB market. In a bearish situation, this could lead the price to $0.000022.
However, the MFI might likely hit the oversold point, which could be around 20.00 or below. Should this be the case, the price of the Shiba Inu native token might rebound.
Sustaining the golden cross if (when) this happens could take the price higher.
Source: TradingView
The likely first stop could be $0.000027, after which, SHIB’s value could rise to $0.000030, which was close to the ceiling it hit in March.
For this, considering the technical aspect alone might be enough. Hence, AMBCrypto took things from the state of the token on-chain.
Consolidation before breakout
In doing this, we assessed the exchange inflow and outflow. If the exchange inflow is higher than the outflow, it means that the token involved could face selling pressure, and the value could drop.
On the other hand, a higher exchange outflow favors a price increase. As of this writing, SHIB’s exchange outflow was 53.20 billion. The inflow, at the opposite end, was 50.55 billion.
Historically, the 3 billion difference between the metrics might not be enough to support a one-directional movement. As such, SHIB’s price might consolidate in the short term.
Source: Santiment
From our outlook, the price might move between $0.000023 and $0.000025. Going forward, traders might need to keep an eye on the netflow.
In a case where the outflow doubles the exchange inflow, then we might see SHIB’s price move upward slowly. If sustained, a breakout to $0.00030 could be achieved.

Read Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] Price Prediction 2024-2025

A summary of the analysis suggested that this rise could come to pass before the end of May.
However, there is a likelihood that this prediction could be invalidated. Thus, traders might need to watch for changes in the status of Shiba Inu on-chain, and from the technical perspective.

Horoscope crypto from May 20th to 26th

New week, new crypto horoscope dedicated to the upcoming week from May 20th to 26th.
This week will be characterized by four transits:
The Sun enters Gemini from Monday 20/5;
Full Moon in Sagittarius on Thursday 23/5;
Venus enters Gemini on Thursday 23/5;
Jupiter enters Gemini from Saturday 25/5.
For several months now we have been dedicating space to the crypto horoscope written by Stefania Stimolo, an expert in astrology and blockchain. It is a weekly column with the horoscope of each zodiac sign available every Sunday only on The Cryptonomist. 
In our slogan “We Tell the Future”, we wanted to delve deeper into the topic, jokingly speaking, with this entertainment column. 

The crypto horoscope
We call it crypto horoscope simply because industry terminology is used. 
Words like NFT, metaverse, and Over-The-Counter to describe actions and scenarios, but also trading terminology like bullish, bull run, bear market, or dump to identify the mood of each zodiac sign during the days of the week.
Obviously, the famous to-the-moon cannot be missing to indicate the mood of that sign! 
In general, you could experience a period of “hard-fork”, intended as an “inner split”, or pass your lightning torch to the next zodiac sign, meaning that the Sun is moving to the next sign. 
Or, simply, you need to reflect on some situations that go into “verify“, that is when the planet is in dissonance with the zodiac sign. Not only that, with each new change of guard of the Sun through the constellations of the zodiac, the roadmap of each sign will touch a new step. 
Obviously no investment advice is given, in fact, it is pure entertainment, just like any other horoscope. It must be said that there are many beginners in the sector who have understood the specific crypto terminology also thanks to the horoscope on The Cryptonomist. 
“Don’t Trust, Verify”
Astrology is not an exact science, but it aims to predict the future in its own way. So why not associate the typical phrase of blockchain “Don’t Trust, Verify” here as well. 
And in fact, what the author wants to propose is her interpretation of the planetary transits that occur during the week, describing the reaction of each zodiac sign, following the “logic” of traditional astrology. 
For those who are astrology lovers, they could stay updated just by following the weekly transits that are communicated and somehow influence us. Whether it’s a Mercury Retrograde or the days of the Full Moon. 
Others, on the other hand, may access the dedicated page, which is updated every Sunday, and read the horoscope of their zodiac sign, their rising sign, or why not, even the horoscope of friends and loved ones. 
And so, just for entertainment purposes, don’t waste time and click here to read your horoscope for this week!

pump.fun relaunches with $45 million in affected liquidity, offering 0% trading fees for 7 days to rebuild confidence.




British law enforcement in London detained an individual suspected to be behind the pump.fun attack, revealed in a post by user @therollupco on X.





Pump.fun Attacker Was Arrested In London



The alleged pump.fun attacker, known as @STACCoverflow, was later released on bail and could potentially be identified as Jarett Reginald Dunn.



The attack targeted pump.fun, a popular platform for launching meme coins on Solana, resulting in the compromise of the protocol and the theft of approximately $1.9 million worth of SOL coins. Exploiting bonding curve contracts, the pump.fun attacker redirected funds intended for the Solana decentralized exchange Raydium to unrelated wallet addresses, according to insights from on-chain analysts.



Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at Wintermute, assessed the situation, indicating a possible compromise of a key, although the prospect of insider involvement remains under scrutiny. The exploit utilized flashloans, borrowed and repaid within a single blockchain block, facilitated by MarginFi’s services.




Pump.fun Rebuilds Trust After Crypto Crisis



Notably, a former pump.fun employee claimed responsibility on X shortly after the attack, boasting about their actions and acknowledging the risk of imprisonment.



Following the incident, pump.fun has relaunched, with the affected liquidity totaling around $45 million. The team has reintroduced the contract, resumed trading, and announced a 0% trading fee for the next seven days. Despite the setback, pump.fun is striving to restore trust and stability to its platform.

Kraken USDT Support Now Continues Amid Legal Challenges In Europe - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Kraken denies plans to delist Tether (USDT), maintaining support despite regulatory uncertainties.



The exchange is prepared to comply with the EU’s MiCA regulations, but Kraken USDT support will continue.



Kraken acquires TradeStation Crypto and plans a European headquarters in France or Ireland.




Kraken, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has officially denied any plans to delist Tether (USDT) in Europe despite increasing regulatory uncertainties.





Kraken USDT Support Guaranteed in Europe



The announcement of Kraken USDT support comes as the cryptocurrency world faces growing concerns about the reliability and compliance of stablecoins like Tether.



The European Union’s approval of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework has prompted exchanges to reassess their strategies to ensure compliance. Kraken’s Global Head of Regulatory Strategy, Marcus Hughes, emphasized that the exchange is prepared to meet emerging regulatory needs but clarified that there are currently no plans to delist Tether or modify its USDT trading pairs in Europe.



Hughes reiterated the Kraken’s commitment to supporting Tether and its related trading pairs, stating that the exchange has no intention of withdrawing Kraken USDT support at this time. This reassurance contrasts with earlier reports suggesting Kraken might cease support for Tether due to regulatory pressures.




Kraken Expands with New Acquisitions and Headquarters



The exchange’s stance is significant as it impacts investor sentiment and market dynamics within the crypto ecosystem. Regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins like USDT has intensified, and Kraken’s position provides some stability amidst the uncertainty.



Kraken is also expanding its regulatory footprint by acquiring TradeStation Crypto and finalizing plans for its European headquarters, which are likely to be located in either France or Ireland. This move aims to bolster its regulatory compliance and better serve its European clients.



Kraken’s decision to continue supporting Tether in Europe reflects its strategic approach to navigating regulatory landscapes while maintaining liquidity and service quality for its European users.

Bitcoin Has Completed Profit-Taking Phase Amid Backdrop of Rising Capital Flows to BTC, Says Analyst Willy Woo - The Daily Hodl


								Popular on-chain analyst Willy Woo believes Bitcoin (BTC) is now in a position to kick start a fresh leg up after months of consolidation.
Woo tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that he’s looking at Bitcoin’s spent output profit ratio (SOPR), which tracks whether coins are being sold at a profit or loss.










According to Woo, the metric currently shows that BTC holders are done taking profits close to record highs, suggesting that sell pressure is losing momentum.
“Profit-taking has completed, it took two months. A very healthy reset, against a backdrop of capital flows into the network climbing again.” 
Source: Willy Woo/X
The on-chain analyst also shares a chart suggesting that capital inflows into BTC are starting to pick up.
“Capital inflows update.”
Source: Willy Woo/X
Looking at the bigger picture, Woo believes that Bitcoin is gearing up to ignite the next leg of its bull market.
“Here’s the bigger picture of where Bitcoin is in its liquidity cycle… it’s still doing warm-up exercises.
It’s consolidating under all-time highs, during this time, long time frame risk signal is quite low. Risk only starts climbing after the floodgates open.” 
Source: Willy Woo/X
Based on the analyst’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin appears to be mirroring the bull market setups of 2017 and 2020 when BTC was consolidating close to record highs before a steep upside rally.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $67,097.

Massive Cryptocurrency Whale Has Made Huge Losses on These Two Altcoins: Makes New Move - Bitcoin Sistemi


An interesting activity was observed in the movements of a whale in the onchain data examined by cryptocurrency analysts.
The cryptocurrency whale detected by Lookonchain seems to have recently purchased a large amount of memecoin. Data shows that the whale trading on the Solana network purchased $1.85 million worth of dogwifhat (WIF) and $281,000 worth of POPCAT.


The whale, which had previously traded, bought WIF worth $2.18 million at $2.98 and POPCAT worth $361 thousand at $0.5 3 days ago.
At the time of writing this article, WIF price is traded at $ 2.54, while POPCAT is around $ 0.37.





In other words, the data shows that the whale in question has actually suffered significant damage.

With the two memecoins experiencing a significant decline, the whale lost 336 thousand dollars in WIF token and 80 thousand dollars in POPCAT.


While WIF is traded on Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, POPCAT is an altcoin with a relatively lower market value and is traded only on some smaller cryptocurrency exchanges.

BTC ETFs: Grayscale GBTC inflows near $1B in 1 week, analyst says... - AMBCrypto



Institutional interest in Bitcoin grows, adding liquidity despite Grayscale’s recent high-fee withdrawals.
Retail investors accumulate Bitcoin, enhancing decentralization, while whales show less interest.

Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency, is beginning to recover from a week-long slump, currently valued at $67,093 with a 1.28% increase in the past 24 hours.
Additionally, on the 17th of May, Farside Investors reported that Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) saw inflows of $31.6 million, and GBTC now oversaw more than $18 billion in assets.
Source: Farside Investors
Well, Grayscale has faced major challenges since converting from a trust to a spot ETF in January. However, three consecutive days of inflows have been a boon for GBTC.
What are the execs saying?  
Seeing a positive outlook of GBTC among investors, an X (formerly Twitter) user, @osf_rekt said,
Source: OSF/X
This transition has resulted in over $17 billion in withdrawals, largely due to higher fees than other options.
Additionally, a series of bankruptcies within the crypto industry over the last two years compelled companies to withdraw funds to meet creditor obligations.
Interestingly, on the 15th of May, all spot Bitcoin ETFs, apart from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), reported inflows.
Simultaneously, on a similar day, Grayscale’s GBTC notably recorded its first inflows in a week, drawing in $27 million.
This highlights that institutional investors are showing interest in Bitcoin, bringing liquidity, while crypto whales remain less enthusiastic.
Increased in retail investors 
Data from Santiment, analyzed by AMBCrypto, indicate that while whales slowed accumulation, retail investors are increasing, promoting network decentralization.
Source: Santiment
This trend of retail accumulation could benefit Bitcoin in the long run by promoting greater network decentralization.
Highlighting May’s positivity for spot Bitcoin ETFs, Eric Balchunas, Senior Analyst at Bloomberg, noted,
“The bitcoin ETFs have put together a solid two weeks with $1.3b in inflows, which offsets the entirety of the negative flows in April- putting them back around high water mark of +$12.3b net since launch. This key number IMO bc it nets out inflows and outflows (which are normal).”
Source: Eric Balchunas/X
Offering advice to investors, he further commented,
“Last two mos show why best not to get emotional over flows which come in and out, part of ETF life, but a) i think they’ll net out positive long-term b) the flow amts on either side are small relative to aum maybe (1-2%) so it’s never SO OVER or SO BACK if you think about it.”

Prominent Analyst Sees Dogecoin Poised for Explosive Growth | Cryptoglobe


                                
Kaleo, widely known in the cryptocurrency community as Crypto Kaleo, is a prominent trader and analyst with a substantial following on social media, particularly Twitter. He is well-regarded for his market analysis, trading strategies, and insights on a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and altcoins.



On 17 May 2024, Kaleo expressed his anticipation for an imminent surge in Dogecoin (DOGE) on the social media platform X, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is poised for significant upward movement. In a later clarification to a follower, Kaleo explained that while his short-term predictions for Dogecoin usually indicate a move higher, there is also a possibility of a short-term dip before an eventual rise. He emphasized the importance of continuing to accumulate Dogecoin regardless of short-term fluctuations.



On the same day, Kaleo elaborated on his bullish stance towards Dogecoin, drawing parallels between the recent meme stock mania involving companies like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) and the behavior of retail investors. He observed that the resurgence in meme stocks demonstrates that retail traders and investors are once again embracing risk. This risk-on mentality has been evident in the cryptocurrency market over the past year, particularly with the explosion of various memecoins (such as Pepe and Dogwifhat).







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Kaleo highlighted Dogecoin’s enduring status as the leading memecoin, noting its deep-rooted familiarity among retail investors and the cryptocurrency community. He pointed out that Dogecoin was the original meme that inspired belief in the potential of a community-driven cryptocurrency movement. Despite market fluctuations, he asserted that Dogecoin is far from obsolete.



Kaleo argued that as soon as Dogecoin begins to attract more buying interest, it is likely to experience a sharp vertical movement. He noted that the cryptocurrency community is currently saturated with numerous options, while retail investors are eager for the kind of excitement they recently experienced with meme stocks like GME and AMC. Kaleo believes it is only a matter of time before Dogecoin gains momentum again and emphasized his determination not to miss out on the opportunity when it happens.



At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.1547, flat on the day. Its $22.3 billion market cap makes it the 10th most valuable cryptoasset. In the year-to-date period, DOGE is up 71.22%.

Ripple CEO “Particularly Excited” About Native AMMs


Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouset recently commented on the company's most recent quarterly report, highlighting the automated Market Maker (AMMs) feature that was activated in Q1. Garlinghouse has stressed that this is "one of the largest updates" on the XRPL.  A significant milestone As reported by U.Today, the AMM feature, which makes it possible to replace traditional order books with liquidity pools, went live in late March to much fanfare. Ripple's David Schwartz claimed that the rollout of the feature had marked "a significant moment" for the XRPL. With that being said, the AMM launch was plagued by some technical hiccups. The feature's intended functionality was hindered by a critical bug. The vulnerability was later fixed by developers. The AMM functionality was then integrated into the mainnet of the XRP Ledger in early April. In future quarterly reports, Ripple will be including AMM volume in the DEX volume. Other key highlights Apart from the AMM feature, Ripple also highlighted other key developments in its most recent quarterly report. These key developments include Ripple's ongoing legal fight with the SEC over the size of fines and penalties, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs as well as global regulatory developments. Ripple has also provided an update on the state of XRP markets, noting that volatility levels remained "elevated."

Bitcoin Bull Brandt Burns Schiff: "Stop Betting on Dead Horses!"


								The world of finance is no stranger to colorful characters, and this week, the gloves came off between two titans with opposing views on Bitcoin: Peter Brandt, a crypto bull, and Peter Schiff, a Bitcoin skeptic.
Their battleground? Social media, of course.

Schiff Touts Silver’s Shine, Brandt Calls It Something Else
Schiff, a long-time gold advocate, recently set his sights on silver. He pointed to the metal’s recent price surge of over 20% compared to BTC’s more modest 2% gain, declaring:

“That’s more than 10x the bang for your buck with silver. Bitcoin is dead. Long live silver!”

Brandt, ever the Bitcoin champion, wasn’t having it. He countered that Schiff’s pronouncements were simply a ploy for attention, mockingly suggesting Schiff was having a “social media orgasm” just because silver “decided to take a jog.”


This exchange is the latest chapter in a long-running feud between the two financial figures, with Schiff consistently making bearish predictions about the top coin that haven’t come to pass.
Is Bitcoin A Hedge Against Inflation?
The debate around Bitcoin’s future extends beyond social media spats. With inflation concerns on the rise, some see Bitcoin as a potential hedge. However, recent outflows from BTC ETFs cast a shadow on this theory.
BTCUSD now trading at $67.153. Chart: TradingView
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust both experienced negative flows, totaling over $230 million in just over a week. This suggests that some investors are losing faith in the crypto asset’s ability to weather economic storms.
Schiff Doubles Down On Transaction Speed Concerns
Despite the inflation debate, Schiff remains unconvinced. A recent live debate saw him reiterate his belief that the digital currency’s slow transaction speeds and high fees render it impractical as a daily-use currency.
He stated:

“Bitcoin is a slow and expensive way to transfer value. It’s not a currency.”


Fodder For Social Media
While Brandt dismisses Schiff’s comments as self-serving noise, the debate around the crypto’s future is far from over. Investors are grappling with questions of inflation, practicality, and long-term viability.
As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, the ongoing battle between Bitcoin bulls and bears is poised to remain a prominent feature on social media and beyond.

Former FTX Executive Pleads For an 18-Month Maximum Sentence - Coin Edition


							

Ryan Salame’s lawyers have asked for a lenient sentence for their client.
The lawyers begged the court to sentence Salame to not more than 18 months in prison.
Salame served as the CEO of the Bahamian portion of FTX.




Following a guilty plea from last September, lawyers for former FTX executive Ryan Salame have asked for a lenient sentence for their client. In a recent filing, Salame’s representatives asked the court to sentence the accused to not more than 18 months in prison, noting that a lenient sentence would satisfy the purpose of sentencing while allowing him to continue contributing positively toward society.









In support of their plea, Salame’s lawyers highlighted that their client did not play a central role in FTX’s fraudulent activities. Instead, they argued that he lost most of his fortune with the collapse after the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2022.



The lawyers highlighted Salame’s contributions to the community as part of their plea bargain. According to them, those who know the accused regard him as “an outstanding member of the community.” The lawyers further noted that people around would testify that Salame is known for “contributing significantly and making a positive impact in the world.”



During his time at FTX, Salame served as the CEO of the Bahamian portion of the company and worked closely with Sam-Bankman-Fried. He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and one count of conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and defraud the Federal Election Commission. 







Salame is the only one among Bankman-Fried’s four associates who did not have a cooperation agreement during last September’s trial. However, he pleaded guilty like the others but asked the court to consider his consider his alcohol and drug-related issues ahead of sentencing.



The accused could spend up to 10 years in jail based on the magnitude of his offense. Before now, he had agreed to forfeit $1.5 billion in addition to making a restitution of $5.6 million to FTX debtors. Salame has also agreed to pay $6 million to the U.S. government and forfeit property in the Berkshires and a 2021 Porsche 911.

Why Altcoins Are The Best Investment For Now - Analyst


																Popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe continues to back altcoins to put up a spectacular bullish performance in the coming months. In a new X post on Saturday, the veteran analyst takes a deeper dive explaining the reasons behind his advocacy for altcoins investment ahead of a highly expected crypto bull run.

Investing In Altcoins Is The Best, Analyst Says Why
In his most recent bullish prediction on altcoins, van de Poppe begins by stating these tokens may not present as the most ideal investment especially considering that their combined value is down by 70% against Bitcoin in the last three months. 
The analyst has attributed this poor performance to several factors including a delay in network updates and an extended bear market. In addition, van de Poppe also notes Ethereum’s current struggles to be a significant contributor to this market downturn. 
He explains that typically the crypto bullish hype moves from Bitcoin to Ethereum, followed by tokens with big market cap, then middle-cap tokens and small-cap tokens. 
However, this cycle appears to be experiencing some delay due to a bearish cloud over Ethereum, driven by uncertainty over the approval of a proposed spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) as well as its asset class. 
Nevertheless, van de Poppe believes this delay to be quite temporary as he postulates that market traders are currently pricing in any potential negative effect from the denial of an Ethereum Spot ETF or the classification of the prominent altcoin as a security. 
Once Ethereum embarks on a bullish course, van de Poppe predicts other altcoins to follow suit. The analyst projects that certain tokens could record a 1000% gain as seen between October 2023-February 2024, amid the hype around Bitcoin spot ETFs.
However, the analyst nudges investors to buy into the altcoin market now during the period of “lowest confidence”. He believes such an act is similar to investing in Bitcoin at $3,700 at the start of 2020, thus ensuring investors generate maximum profits in the coming bull run.

Ethereum ETF Approval In The Balance
As weeks continue to progress, the approval of an Ethereum spot ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears highly uncertain. 
This sentiment is driven by the Commission’s ongoing deliberation on whether to classify Ethereum as a security as well as a lack of dialogue between the agency and prospective issuers.  The next deadline dates are for May 23/May 24, during which the SEC will respond to 2 ETF applications with many analysts expecting further delays from the Commission.
At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at around $3,123.39 reflecting a 0.53% increase in the last day.

                        The crypto market has experienced a significant surge in fundraising, reaching a whopping $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024, fueled by a shift in market sentiment and fresh inflows.According to a recent analysis by PitchBook, a leading data provider for private and public market investors, there has been a substantial increase in investment activity within the cryptocurrency sector compared to the previous quarter.The bull market witnessed during Q1 played a pivotal role in driving the surge in investments.Cryptocurrency values soared to levels not seen in months, enticing institutional investors to pour money into the market following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).VC Funds Participate in Bull Market
Venture capital funds actively participated in this bullish run.According to the PitchBook report, a total of 518 deals amounting to $2.3 billion were closed in the first quarter of the year within the cryptocurrency industry.This reflects a remarkable 40.3% increase in investments compared to the previous quarter.Considering the heightened on-chain activities observed in Q4 2023, this surge marks a substantial leap forward for the sector.Deal volume or the number of transactions also saw a notable rise of 44.7% in the preceding quarter.As asset values increased, market valuations soared throughout the year, setting the stage for a promising investment climate.The experts at PitchBook anticipate continued growth in investment activity throughout the remainder of the year.Noteworthy examples of successful fundraising within the cryptocurrency market include Zama, a crypto firm specializing in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), which secured $73 million in funding.EigenLayer, another industry player, received $100 million in Series B funding.However, the most significant deal of the quarter was Together AI, which raised $106 million, propelling its valuation to an impressive $1.1 billion.As more institutions venture into the cryptocurrency sector, a multitude of deals are driving increased valuations for various companies.VC Funding Surpasses $1 Billion for Second Consecutive Month
For the second month in a row, crypto venture capital funding has exceeded the $1 billion mark, highlighting continued investor interest in the industry.As reported, April witnessed $1.02 billion in funding spread across 161 investment rounds, slightly down from March’s $1.09 billion across 186 rounds.Nonetheless, this marks the first time since October-November 2022 that the crypto sector has seen two consecutive months of funding surpassing $1 billion.Earlier this year, Balance, a digital asset custodian based in Canada,  revealed that it has once again achieved $2 billion in assets under custody (AUC) amid the recent recovery in crypto markets. Likewise, Korea Digital Asset (KODA), the largest institutional crypto custody service in South Korea, has seen a remarkable growth in crypto assets under its custody.Just recently, the company revealed that the value of these crypto assets under its custody expanded by nearly 248% in the second half of 2023.

Ripple’s Q1 2024 Report: XRP Ledger’s Groundbreaking Innovations and Soaring Activity | Cryptoglobe


                                
Ripple’s recently published “Q1 2024 XRP Markets Report” offers an in-depth look at the remarkable advancements and developments within the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The report details several key innovations and integrations that position XRPL for substantial growth and enhanced functionality, showcasing Ripple’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology.



XLS-30 Goes Live



A significant milestone for XRPL this quarter was the activation of XLS-30 on the Mainnet, following a community vote. This update introduced a non-custodial automated market maker (AMM) as a native feature to XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX). Designed to provide on-chain liquidity and trading capabilities, this AMM aggregates order books and liquidity pools at the protocol layer, facilitating optimal price execution for DeFi developers and users.



Shortly after its launch, community developers and the RippleX team promptly addressed a bug affecting the AMM functionality. The bug fix was thoroughly tested and successfully integrated into the Mainnet by 11 April, ensuring robust performance moving forward.



XRPL Integrations



XRPL’s integration capabilities received a significant boost with several key partnerships this quarter. Axelar’s integration expands XRPL’s interoperability across over 55 blockchains, enabling developers to execute smart contract calls and deploy decentralized applications cross-chain. Zoniqx also announced plans to streamline the tokenization process for real-world assets on the XRPL, while Orchestra Finance successfully launched on the Mainnet.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Additionally, EasyA rolled out educational modules and initiatives aimed at onboarding its community of over 750,000 developers to the XRPL and its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible sidechain. This initiative is set to simplify the development of decentralized applications on the XRPL, leveraging its high-speed, low-cost infrastructure.



On-Chain Activity



The report highlights a remarkable 108% increase in on-chain transactions last quarter, alongside a 45% decrease in the average cost per transaction. Despite a spike in transaction fees in December due to widespread testing of inscriptions, the subsequent decrease indicates a reset and confirms that no network congestion occurred during the quarter. Ripple says future reports will include AMM volume in the overall DEX volume metrics, reflecting the growing impact of this new feature.



Auto-Bridging Enhancements



According to Ripple, a standout feature of XRPL’s DEX is auto-bridging, which utilizes XRP as the native currency to facilitate trades between any two assets on the ledger. This feature leverages XRP’s counterparty-free nature to find the most efficient trading routes, enhancing liquidity and trading efficiency. The recent integration of the AMM function complements auto-bridging by generating compatible trading offers, thereby expanding liquidity access and trading options.



Ripple believes that as XRPL continues to add assets and applications, the synergy between AMMs and auto-bridging will play a crucial role in enhancing ecosystem functionality and interoperability. This integrated approach is set to drive XRPL’s evolution as a premier blockchain platform.

These Are This Week's Best-Performing Altcoins as Bitcoin (BTC) Calms at $67K (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin had a quite positive trading week in which it gained over six grand and skyrocketed to its highest price tag in almost a month of over $67,000.
Most altcoins also followed suit, with SOL, AVAX, BCH, LINK, and many others registering double-digit gains.
BTC Calms at $67K
Bitcoin had retraced to just over $60,000 last Friday, but the bulls managed to defend that psychological support level during the weekend. Moreover, the asset started to climb on Monday and jumped to just over $63,000. It failed there and retraced to $61,200 on Tuesday, ahead of the US CPI announcement for April, but shot up once those numbers came out.
More precisely, the cryptocurrency gained several grand and skyrocketed to over $66,500 for the first time since mid-April. Another brief retracement followed, but the bulls went on the attack once again in the past couple of days.
This time, they pushed the largest digital asset to almost $67,500. Despite retracing slightly since then, BTC still trades around $67,000 now. Its market capitalization remains at $1.320 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 51.7% on CG.

SOL Leads the Way
Since the past 24 hours have been quite dull in terms of price movements in the crypto space, we will focus on the weekly scale in which SOL and LINK have stolen the show. The former has soared by 17.5% and trades at a multi-week high of over $170, while LINK is up by 22% and stands close to $16.5.
Next on the weekly top gainers’ list are Avalanche (14%), Bitcoin Cash (13%), UNI (13%), IMX (10%), GRT (12%), NEAR (9%), and ICP (10%).
In contrast, TON has declined the most from the larger-cap alts, having lost over 9% of value in the past seven days. BNB and TRX are also slightly in the red.
The total crypto market cap is up to $2.550 trillion on CG, which means that it has gained over $150 billion on a weekly scale.

Crypto Startups Raise $2.4B in 2024 Q1; EigenLayer Raises $100M Coin Edition


							

PitchBook reveals 2024 Q1’s substantial increase in crypto fundraising, with startups accumulating $2.4 billion.
Ethereum’s EigenLayer has raised $100 million in a Series B funding round.
Together AI secures the largest deal of the quarter, raising a $106.0 million early-stage round.




According to the latest insights from market data aggregator PitchBook, the first quarter of 2024 has seen a substantial surge in crypto fundraising. The report unveiled that Ethereum’s restaking platform, EigenLayer, has led the charge, raising $100 million in Series B funding round.





PitchBook revealed that the $2.4 billion fund accumulated by startups across 518 deals marks a 40.3% increase from the previous quarter. In addition, the platform pointed out that the figure represents “a 44.7% increase in deal volume compared with the last quarter.”



The report further spotted the significant achievement of Together AI, “developer of an open-source, decentralized cloud platform for large foundation models.” As per the report, Together AI secured the largest deal of the quarter, raising a $106.0 million early-stage round “led by Salesforce Ventures at a $1.1 billion pre-money valuation.” The round follows a $102.5 million Series A at a pre-money valuation of $463.5 million in the last quarter.









Shedding light on the segment’s fast growth, PitchBook asserted that investment rounds became “highly competitive.” Highlighting the high spirit of investment rounds, especially at the early stages, the platform added, “Early-stage deals are earning higher valuations than late-stage deals, but the sample set is relatively small, so we will see if this trend holds in the coming quarters.”



Adding more insights into the matter, PitchBoook elaborated on the median pre-money valuations for all stages. While in the pre-seed/ seed stage, the valuation marked $21.8 million, it was a staggering $72 million in the early stage. In the late stage, the valuation went down to $51.1 million. These valuations were substantially up from 2023, “representing YoY increases of 85.5%, 148.3%, and 7.6%, respectively.”

The SocialFi sector challenges Meme Coins in the crypto market

The crypto world is constantly evolving and, while meme coins have seen explosive growth, a new trend is quickly emerging: SocialFi platforms. 
These platforms are capturing the market’s attention and, in some cases, are even surpassing meme coins in terms of influence. Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, provides a detailed overview of the unique relationship between SocialFi and meme tokens, highlighting the key similarities and differences between these two phenomena.

Crypto world: Similarities in distribution strategy between SocialFi and meme coins
The SocialFi platforms use token distribution strategies similar to meme coins. For example, DEGEN tokens are not subject to pre-mining and 15% of the total supply is allocated to ecosystem development over a four-year period.
The rest is distributed through airdrops and liquidity incentives, common practices also in the distributions of meme coins. This fair and community-oriented distribution is a characteristic that both categories share.
Functional applications of SocialFi platforms
A distinctive aspect of SocialFi platforms is their ability to offer more functional applications compared to meme coins.
A significant example is the friend.tech token, which not only introduces unique applications but also engaging elements like ‘Clubs’.
These elements increase the level of engagement and challenges for users, creating a more interactive and dynamic experience. 
However, this complexity could also narrow the audience, limiting the appeal of SocialFi platforms compared to meme coins, which are often simpler and more accessible.
Bitget Wallet and meme coins: the crypto trend before SocialFi tokens
Bitget Wallet has cleverly leveraged the trends of meme coins, introducing new features and activities that support transactions with these cryptocurrencies. The company has indeed integrated the most popular blockchains, integrated support for new meme coins into the ecosystem, and improved swap transaction capabilities. 
Furthermore, the launch of their own meme coin – MOEW – and the organization of various meme-themed activities, have led Bitget Wallet to be considered a leader in the meme coin sector.
The evolution of the market and the role of DEX
Alvin Kan observes that the growth of decentralized exchanges (DEX) has provided a solid foundation for trading meme coins. 
Kan says:
“The industry has shifted from being focused on capital to being community-oriented, marking a significant transition”.
This year, in fact, the cryptocurrency market has been looking for the big narrative to follow after the era of Bitcoin ETFs. Meme coins have therefore proven to be a successful candidate.
Conclusion
SocialFi platforms represent a new frontier in the world of cryptocurrencies, challenging meme coins in terms of influence and market interest. With similar distribution strategies but more functional and engaging applications, SocialFi platforms offer an interesting alternative that could redefine the cryptocurrency landscape.

The Shiba Inu community is active on various social platforms, promoting a strong sense of unity and enthusiasm. Its price volatility attracts traders and speculators looking for quick profits.
Ripple has gained significant popularity thanks to its unique features and widespread adoption. Developed by Ripple Labs, XRP offers fast and low-cost international transactions, making it ideal for cross-border payments. 
The XRP blockchain technology enables almost instant settlements, eliminating intermediaries and reducing fees. 
Furthermore, partnerships with numerous financial institutions and banks have strengthened the credibility of XRP and increased its adoption. 
These collaborations have facilitated the integration of XRP into existing financial systems, making it a valid choice for mainstream adoption.
Dogecoin and Ethereum: two protagonists of the world of cryptocurrencies
In recent years, Dogecoin has reached unprecedented popularity, captivating both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and the general public. 
Initially conceived as a playful cryptocurrency based on the internet meme “Doge” with a Shiba Inu dog, Dogecoin has turned into a cultural phenomenon. 
Its simplicity and accessibility have attracted a diverse community of supporters who appreciate the fun and friendly nature of the currency. 
The distinctive logo and vibrant online community have contributed to its rise, with influential figures and celebrities often promoting it on social media. 
Furthermore, Dogecoin is known for its charitable initiatives, with the community often mobilizing to raise funds for various causes. 
Despite its satirical origins, Dogecoin has captured the imagination of millions of people, becoming a symbol of the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies.
Ethereum is a renowned decentralized blockchain platform known for its smart contract functionality, which allows developers to create and deploy decentralized applications (DApps). 
The popularity of Ethereum is due to several factors. First of all, it introduced the concept of programmable blockchain, allowing developers to build innovative applications and digital assets on its platform. 
This flexibility has attracted a wide community of developers, entrepreneurs, and investors, creating a vibrant ecosystem of projects and services. In addition, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is one of the largest and most recognized cryptocurrencies globally.
A spokesperson for Bombastic.com has stated: 
“The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies shows a major shift underway not only in America, but worldwide. More and more people are becoming interested in digital assets because they see how they can transform many sectors.”
The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in America represents a collective awareness that the future of finance and other sectors, such as art, music, and gaming, is shaped and advanced by blockchain technology.

Bitcoin hasn't rallied much after the 'halving.' Is $100,000 next?

One month after Bitcoin’s big halving event, people in the crypto community want to know where the major cryptocurrency is heading.Nvidia stock has all-time closing high in its crosshairsThe latest Bitcoin halving — a technical event that cuts the reward for mining new Bitcoin by half — occurred on April 19-20, which divided the reward from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125. Bitcoin’s halving, a feature to ensure the cryptocurrency’s scarcity and safeguard it from inflation, happens every four years.Right now, Bitcoin’s value is hovering around $65,000 — and it’s primarily in the green because inflation has eased and the stock market is bullish.  Bitcoin didn’t jump significantly after the halving process and currently hovers roughly 12% below its record high of $73,803 set in March; it’s still up about 140% in the past year. But historically, Bitcoin has jumped after the halving event.The first Bitcoin halving happened in November 2012, when the reward for mining a block was reduced from 50 Bitcoin to 25. At that time, Bitcoin’s price was $12. It went up to $44 in 100 days and then $135 in 300 days. The second halving event occurred in July 2016, when the reward was reduced from 25 Bitcoin to 12.5. The flagship cryptocurrency went from $658 to $1,551 in 300 days. At the third halving in May 2020,  the Bitcoin incentive was reduced by half to 6.25 Bitcoin. At that time, Bitcoin was at $8,601, moving upward to $50,941 within 300 days.Steven Lubka, a managing director at Bitcoin financial services company Swan Bitcoin, seems optimistic about the growth of the top cryptocurrency. In an email, he wrote that Bitcoin’s performance has a massive run-up ahead of the halving, which historically has not happened. “Bitcoin has never really seen a sharp rise post-halving; it generally occurs on a month-by-month basis as time progresses,” he said.Rennick Palley, founding partner at the crypto venture capital firm Stratos, adds that in the next 12 months following the halving, Bitcoin will probably continue its upward price movement.So why is this year’s halving different from its predecessors? It’s primarily because Bitcoin reached its peak a month prior, making it difficult to maintain the same momentum. Plus, experts add, the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs have changed the factors that affect the price movement of the top cryptocurrency.According to Palley, the price of Bitcoin is now largely determined by global liquidity dynamics and adoption. “As fiat money continues to be printed and as more people around the world recognize the value of Bitcoin as a store of value, the price of Bitcoin in dollar terms will continue to rise,” he said.Many will continue to be surprised by Bitcoin’s changes in dynamics, but the analysts say they won’t be surprised if the flagship cryptocurrency crosses the $100,000 mark this year. “It’s always difficult to forecast an exact timeframe, but I expect six-figure Bitcoin on the horizon,” Lubka said.CoinGecko, a crypto tracking website, finds that Bitcoin’s price has increased by 96,302% since 2013.

Nvidia and Target earnings up next after Dow, stocks have historic week

What an exceptional week it has been for the stock market. The Dow crossed the 40,000 mark for the first time in its 128-year history, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached their peaks on the same day. Nvidia stock has all-time closing high in its crosshairsThe return of “Roaring Kitty” was a surprise, but the bigger surprise was how meme stocks, such as GameStop and AMC, boomed and busted so quickly, and memecoins were unfazed by the return at all, as if they never had any relationship with meme-stock trend.Additionally, the ease in inflation has raised expectations for interest rate cuts later this year, setting the mood for the coming week’s trading. The Federal Reserve will release new home sales data on Thursday to help clarify the economy’s trajectory.This week is going to be filled with some interesting earnings reports, tech events, and some celebrations with pizzas.All eyes are on Nvidia’s earnings reportArtificial Intelligence (AI) darling stock Nvidia will announce its first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Wednesday after the closing bell.Nvidia approached all-time highs on Thursday, reaching $953.83 per share during the day before finishing lower. The stock’s record-high close stands at $950.02 per share, which it hit on March 25.Ahead of Nvidia’s first quarter earnings report next Wednesday, Wall Street is setting its expectations for the company’s first-quarter revenue at $24.5 billion, according to a FactSet poll of analysts’ estimates. However, KeyBanc equity research analyst John Vinh said Nvidia is likely to report first-quarter revenues of $26 billion and set its second-quarter guidance to around $28.5 billion.The company is expected to report a net income of $12.87 billion, showing significant growth from the last quarter of fiscal 2024 and a substantial increase from the $2.04 billion profit reported a year ago. Analysts anticipate the earnings per share will be $5.17 for the first quarter, compared to 82 cents in the same period last year.Nvidia’s stock is up about 99% so far this year; the company’s shares have rallied since it reported fourth-quarter earnings in February. The chip maker’s shares took a hit right before earnings, but made a comeback after it reported revenue of $22 billion — up nearly 270% from the previous year. The stock has climbed a whopping 226% over the last 12 months.Microsoft is holding an AI eventJust as Nvidia is thriving, it seems everyone wants a piece of AI. Tech giant Microsoft is hosting an AI event on Monday, May 20, a day before the developer-focused event Build 2024 begins.

The day is celebrated to commemorate the day that Bitcoin was first used for commercial purposes. On May 22, 2010, a man in Florida named Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 Bitcoin for two pizzas from Papa John’s. At that time, 10,000 bitcoins were worth $41; that many bitcoins is now worth a staggering $650 million.In addition to the festivities, hashtags such as #BitcoinPizzaDay and #PizzaForBitcoin trend on social media platforms at this time every year as Bitcoin enthusiasts celebrate just how far the cryptocurrency has come.-Britney Nguyen contributed to this article

Bitcoin Pizza Day celebrates the time a man spent $650 million on pizza

Illustration: Maksim Zakharau (Getty Images)On January 3, 2009, Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the Genesis Block, which contained a reward of 50 Bitcoin. The technical foundations of Bitcoin were being established at the time, but the currency did not have any real-world value.That changed on May 22, 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based programmer, offered 10,000 bitcoins to anyone who would order him two pizzas from Papa John’s.Hanyecz wrote on the Bitcoin Talk forum: “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!”He further added what toppings he likes: “I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.”“If you’re interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.”

Trump's Crypto Embrace: From "Disaster" to "I'm Good With It" ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Former U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a positive outlook toward cryptocurrencies, marking a potential shift in his stance on digital assets.



Notably, Trump’s affirmation came in response to inquiries about his position on crypto during a recent public appearance. In a statement, he declared, “I’m good with it,” signaling a willingness to embrace the burgeoning industry.



Further, in response to inquiries about crypto during his appearance, Trump acknowledged the exodus of crypto businesses from the US due to regulatory hostility. He emphasized the importance of addressing these challenges, stating, “If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be here.“



The presidential candidate also criticized the Biden administration for erecting high barriers to the crypto industry through stringent regulations enforced under the watch of SEC’s Gary Gensler.



“Biden doesn’t even know what (crypto) is…The democrats are very much against it and I say this…a lot of people are very much for it and I’m fine with it, I want to make sure it’s good and solid,” added Trump.

&nbsp



That said, Trump’s affirmation has stirred discussions within the cryptocurrency community. Trump’s stance could have significant implications for the future of digital assets in the United States should he clinch the presidency in the upcoming elections.



In a Thursday tweet, Messari Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto analytics firm, praised Trump for his stance on crypto-generated attention.



However, not everyone is convinced about Trump’s stance. Some see it as a political gimmick to garner support from younger generations, who are the biggest players in the sector.



“The devil is in the detail. He hated #Bitcoin last time he was in power. Now he wants the “crypto” vote? Will US policy towards BTC get worse or better under Trump?” wrote Simon Dixon, founder of crypto investment firm Bank of the Future.



Notably, this is not the first time Trump has shown his support for crypto despite his apparent hostility to the sector in the past. In addition to launching several highly profitable NFT projects in the past, in early March, Donald Trump presented a more neutral viewpoint on crypto, particularly during an interview with CNBC.



“I have seen there has been a lot of use of that, and I’m not sure that I’d want to take it away at this point … I can live with it one way or the other,” Trump stated when asked about his stand on Bitcoin.



Notably, this is reversed from his comments in 2021, where he had said that crypto is a “disaster waiting to happen.”

Solana Ranked The World’s Fastest Blockchain, Outshining Ethereum, Polygon ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
‘Ethereum killer’ Solana has taken the blockchain ecosystem by storm after becoming the fastest blockchain in the world with record transaction speed. Research from CoinGecko shows that the network processed an astounding 95 million transactions in a single day. This achievement is not just a technological feat but also marks a huge milestone in the blockchain and crypto industry. 



Solana Takes The Speed Crown



Solana has emerged as the cheetah of the cryptosphere thanks to its lightning-fast speed.



According to a recent research report by crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, Solana leads with the highest daily average transactions per second (TPS), clocking in at 1,053 TPS. This remarkable achievement in speed solidifies Solana’s status as a so-called “Ethereum killer,” which has long been questioned due to the constant network outages.



Sui comes in second at 854 TPS, followed by Binance Smart Chain (BSC) at 378 TPS, Polygon at 190 TPS, TON at 175 TPS, Tron at 159 TPS, Near at 117 TPS, and Avalanche at 89 TPS.



Meanwhile, established networks like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have long struggled with transaction speed limitations. Ethereum recorded an average peak TPS of 22.8, while the world’s largest blockchain, Bitcoin, processed just 10.7 transactions per second.

&nbsp



CoinGecko analyzed the processing speed of the top 30 blockchains based on their total value locked (TVL) ranking on DefiLlama as of May 15, 2024, to ascertain the fastest blockchains. Processing speed was calculated using the actual or realized TPS metric, measured as a daily average, to ensure a uniform comparison across multiple blockchains.



Solana’s peak performance was awe-inspiring, attaining 1,504 TPS on April 6, 2023, owing to an upsurge in meme coin transactions. This performance makes Solana approximately 46 times faster than Ethereum and 5 times faster than Polygon — the fastest among Ethereum scaling solutions.



CoinGecko’s study noted that despite ranking as the fastest blockchain, Solana has only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum TPS of 65,000.







Solana’s exceptional speed has not gone unnoticed in the cryptocurrency market. At press time, SOL changed hands for $173, representing a 2.7% gain on the day and an 18.2% increase on the weekly chart. This performance underscores the market’s confidence in Solana’s potential to revolutionize the digital transaction landscape.



Is Solana Truly An “Ethereum Killer?”



Solana started its mainnet operations in March 2020, with a claimed throughput of 50,000 transactions per second (TPS). The network sought to improve Ethereum’s scalability inefficiencies.



Unlike Ethereum, which relies on layer-2 scaling solutions to enhance scalability, Solana offers scalable solutions for a decentralized ecosystem. But Solana’s technique has been widely criticized following its previous repeated outages. In early April, soaring demand for meme coins caused roughly 76% of Solana transactions to fail.



Prior to that, block production on Solana halted for around five hours before developers and validators could build and test a release that contained remediation.

Crypto Analyst Envisions Record Bitcoin Gains Before October Amid Global Liquidity Shift ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Popular crypto analyst Willy Woo predicted that Bitcoin will likely experience a bullish breakout in October of this year. He predicted this even as the index posted a strong showing, rising above $67k. Some analysts were quick to predict an immediate bullish outlook for the premier digital currency, but Willy had none.



He tweeted:







In addition to predicting the resumption of the long-term bull market before October, Woo also claimed that 2025 would be a record year for Bitcoin. He focused on global liquidity statistics to make the projections.



Price Action



Bitcoin was largely sluggish for most of this month. However, the largest digital currency by market capitalization shed some value a few days before press time, followed by a half-hearted recovery. Here is how BTC performed earlier today on Bitstamp:







Time to Jump on the Bullish Bandwagon?



Several analysts, including Willy’s colleagues on X, were quick to jump on the bullish bandwagon and declare the resumption of the bull market.

&nbsp



Woo is known for his analytical approach and is a Bitcoin maximalist.



This small rally coincided with relatively positive US Labor statistics, so it could just be an anticipation of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates.



Has the Bull Market been Revived?



According to crypto billionaire Mike Novogratz, Bitcoin is likely to fluctuate between $55k and $75k for the time being until another favorable external indicator presents itself. The furor around the Bitcoin block reward halving, aka Bitcoin halving, and the spot ETF approval has died down.



While the trading range suggested by Novogratz is quite broad, it provides a sound basis for the future. Any mediocre move between $60k-$70k will not revive the long-term bull market, that is for sure. The upward forces need to move above the new all-time high of $73k to change their fortunes.

Big Debate Between Analyst Saying "Bitcoin is Dead" and a 50 Years of Economist - Bitcoin Sistemi


Peter Schiff and Peter Brandt, two analysts who frequently share analyzes about the cryptocurrency market, got into a serious discussion.
The discussion first started after gold-loving analyst Peter Schiff commented on the performance of some assets recently. Citing a previous tweet, Schiff mentioned that the price of silver has increased by 21% since the beginning of April. In addition, he said that the increase in value of Bitcoin during the same period was only 2%.


Schiff claimed that people can make 10 times more profit with silver compared to Bitcoin. He claimed that Bitcoin was dead.

In response, Peter Brandt, a trader in the market for nearly 50 years, stepped in. Brandt, who is also known for his pro-Bitcoin statements, told his followers that they should completely ignore tweets like Schiff's.





In addition, he argued that Schiff aims to gain followers and attention by saying “nonsense” like this. However, he said Schiff “is not as stupid as those in his speech.” The analyst added that although Schiff's prediction about silver, one of his many predictions, came true, his predictions have generally come true so far.

Venezuela bans crypto mining to protect power grid

The Venezuelan government has joined the list of countries that have frowned on crypto mining due to its hefty electricity demands.According to a local news outlet, Venezuela’s Ministry of Electric Power (MPPPE) has unveiled plans to disconnect cryptocurrency mining farms from the national grid. The move aims to regulate excessive energy consumption and guarantee a stable power supply for the population.An X post from Venezuela’s National Association of Cryptocurrencies stated that crypto mining is prohibited throughout Venezuela. The move prioritizes energy stability over the burgeoning crypto-mining industry.This move follows a recent crackdown that involved confiscating 2,000 cryptocurrency mining devices in Maracay, Aragua state, about 120 kilometers southwest of Caracas, as part of an anti-corruption initiative. Source: Asociación Nacional de CriptomonedasThe Ministry emphasized the need to offer efficient and reliable electrical service across Venezuela by eliminating the strain caused by these high-energy-consuming farms. According to officials, these measures are essential to stabilize the national power supply, which has been unreliable for the past decade.The country has experienced recurring blackouts, particularly since 2019, significantly impacting residents’ daily lives and the overall economic performance.Cryptocurrency mining is infamous worldwide for its hefty electricity demands. In response, countries such as China and Kazakhstan have implemented stringent regulations or outright prohibitions on the practice to safeguard their power infrastructure and prioritize energy allocation to vital public services.The government’s move against cryptocurrency mining is reportedly part of a larger anti-corruption push, leading to several top officials’ arrests. Joselit Ramírez, the ex-head of the National Superintendency of Cryptoassets (Sunacrip), is a key figure in these corruption allegations. Related: GoMining CEO bullish on Bitcoin: “The mining business remains profitable”Rafael Lacava, Governor of Carabobo state, has reportedly emphasized the importance of public collaboration in detecting illegal mining operations. He encouraged citizens to come forward and report any unlawful activities, stressing the vital role that community involvement plays in protecting the reliability of their electricity supply.However, this is not Venezuela’s first act against crypto mining activities. In March 2023, Venezuela’s energy supplier shut down crypto mining facilities nationwide to reorganize the national crypto department and corruption investigations involving the country’s oil company.Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, disclosed that government officials were allegedly running parallel oil operations with the assistance of the national crypto department.Last year, eight major cryptocurrency mining operators in Kazakhstan signed an open letter to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, complaining about the high energy prices for miners.

Archeologists Use AI to Interpret Historical Data Related to Trade Routes and Financial Systems | Cryptopolitan

Archeologists at Stanford and Duke interpreted historical data related to financial systems with the help of AI by speeding up data analysis, simulations, and visualizations.This technological revolution not only reduces time and resources but also uncovers things that cannot be discovered by traditional methods alone. By studying data from different places, AI can construct trade routes and economic links between continents.Also Read: Can AI in Archaeology Unlock the Mysteries of Ancient History?“AI is revolutionizing archaeology by enabling data analysis, simulations and visualizations at scales and speed not previously possible and by providing endless variants and processing that can multiply the human capacity to understand and rethink the past.”
Maurizio Forte, a professor at Duke UniversityScientists at Stanford Uncover Historical Trade Network Using AIResearchers at Stanford University applied AI to the assessment of the dispersion of amphorae, a kind of vessel used for transporting commodities such as wine and olive oil. The AI model uncovered the detailed trade networks that linked different regions of the empire and thus showed how complex and far-reaching Roman commerce was. This analysis was able to uncover the ways through which goods were transported, exchanged, and consumed over long distances.Also Read: AI and Ancient Wisdom – AI Deciphers 2000-Year-Old Buried ScrollApart from that, AI is also changing the way ancient trade networks are studied. Through the data analysis of different sources, like pottery distribution, inscriptions, and ancient shipping records, AI would be able to create a map indicating trade routes and economic ties that were spread over continents. AI can examine satellite images and geographical data to identify the most probable spots for economic activities.Archeologists Also Learned About the Financial Systems of MesopotamiaScientists employed AI to analyze thousands of cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia. The clay tablets were engraved with one of the oldest forms of writing. These tablets frequently included records of transactions, loans, and sales.The AI learned from the texts how to detect patterns in them, and as a result, archeologists found out about the credit systems and financial instruments used by ancient Mesopotamians. This was done through the use of promissory notes and various complex loan agreements, which showed how sophisticated the economic system was.What Do the Researchers Think About AI’s Future Potential in ArchaeologyForte stresses that AI is changing the way archeologists operate by allowing for large-scale data analysis and simulations. AI’s capacity to handle and understand enormous amounts of data makes the visualization of the past in multiple dimensions and combinations possible. This method does not center on a particular objective view; rather, it provides a multilevel understanding of historical events.AI is also advancing remote sensing analysis and classification, detection of archaeological sites, and predictive modeling. Through the analysis of satellite and aerial images, AI algorithms can automatically detect patterns and find archaeological sites. This ability has been the key to simulating ecosystems and large-scale social transformations of different societies.Forte foresees AI as the future of archaeology. It may provide a guide for museum visitors and enable real-time classification of artifacts during excavations. He also foresees a future where archaeological datasets, projects, and publications will be more collaborative and accessible.Cryptopolitan reporting by Brenda Kanana

Renowned CEO Reveals the Event That Could Bring Billions of Dollars to the Cryptocurrency Market: "Everyone Ignores But..." - Bitcoin Sistemi

In a recent statement, Coin Bureau CEO Nic Puckrin highlighted a potential catalyst in the cryptocurrency market that has been largely ignored. This catalyst involves cryptocurrency enthusiasts raising $14 billion in fiat money and potentially reinvesting that money into crypto.
It's been nearly two years since FTX's collapse, and the landscape has changed significantly since then. The primary development is the bankrupt company's plan to repay 118% of all creditor dollar demands, a staggering $14.5 billion. This money will go to people who have already invested in crypto, according to the analyst.


While some FTX creditors may choose to hold onto their dollars, Puckrin believes a significant number of them will want to reinvest that money back into the markets. This could be particularly useful at the moment as it could help counter payments from Mt Gox.
When combined with Gemini crypto payments, the total cryptocurrency sent to creditors reaches $10.6 billion. However, when FTX fiat payments are included, a net cash surplus of $3.9 billion will be paid out.





K33, Mt. Examined the net liquidity impact of various scenarios, including three scenarios where Gox/Gemini sells and two scenarios where FTX creditors buy. Results range from a net negative of $2.3 billion to a positive of $1.19 billion.
Puckrin suggests that these estimates may be too conservative. FTX envisions a scenario where at least 50% of the fiat stash returns to BTC. This would lead to net positive liquidity of at least $1.9 billion even if Gox/Gemini buyers divest 50% of their assets. In a best-case scenario, this could lead to net purchases of over $4 billion.



However, Puckrin also notes that timing is very important. While Gemini targets June and Mt. Gox's payment deadline is October, while FTX creditors are preparing for late Q4 payments. Therefore, it may take some time for purchases by FTX credit investors to impact net liquidity.
Despite this, Puckrin remains optimistic and says, “It's good to see that there may be some forces resisting the selling pressure.”

Fantom Price Continues To Shine - What's Behind The Latest 15% Surge?


																Fantom price has been such a joy to watch for investors in recent days, as a much-needed breath of fresh air continues to spread throughout the crypto market. Bitcoin and other large-cap assets seem to be recovering well after a period of sluggish and frustrating price action.
Notably, Fantom emerged as one of the best performers in the cryptocurrency market over the past week, posting a substantial 26% price increase in the last seven days. The Layer 1 token has particularly been on a hot streak in the past day, soaring by 15%.
The Catalyst Behind The Latest FTM Surge
The much-awaited Sonic upgrade has been critical to the turnaround the Fantom price has witnessed in the past few months. Sonic is expected to improve Fantom’s technology stack and introduce major scalability enhancements without a disruptive hard fork.

	Related Reading



Most recently, the Fantom Foundation unveiled the details of the upcoming layer-1 chain Sonic Network. According to the blog post, the new blockchain network will be connected to and be able to tap into vast amounts of liquidity, users, and protocols from “Ethereum and beyond” via a native layer-2 bridge.
As disclosed previously, the Sonic Network is expected to go live alongside a new token, with the ticker S. In the latest memo, the project revealed that FTM token holders will be able to migrate Sonic’s token at a 1:1 ratio, depending on the results of a governance vote.
The Fantom Foundation said in its latest blog post: 
Initially, this migration process is anticipated to be bi-directional, which will allow users to swap back and forth between $FTM and $S. Since the $S token will only exist on Sonic and $FTM will only exist on Opera, we anticipate utilizing a bridge to enable bi-directional swaps. This process enables a seamless migration for current Opera network participants to experience Sonic. After a transitional period (to be determined in the future), the migration process is expected to transition to a one-way migration of $FTM to $S.
The project noted that the supply of the new S token will match that of FTM to facilitate the token migration process after the Sonic chain launch. It is worth mentioning that the Fantom price experienced a significant surge following this update on the Sonic Network on May 17.
Fantom Price At A Glance
As of this writing, the Fantom price is around $0.908, reflecting an almost 15% increase in the past 24 hours.

Sundayfunday.sol’s Meme Coin Bet Turns $2,275 into $2.26 Million


Meme coins have become the Wild West of the crypto space, offering both high rewards and significant risks. Over the weekend, on-chain tracking platform Lookonchain noticed that some crypto whales had engaged in substantial meme coin transactions, with some recording gains while others witnessed losses.
This activity showcases the allure and volatility of meme coins, where fortunes can be made overnight.
Wild Weekend for Meme Coins

According to Lookonchain, the address sundayfunday.sol turned 13 Solana (SOL), worth about $2,275, into $2.26 million in just 8 hours by buying the 1DOL meme coin. From this transaction, they earned a staggering 993x return.
Lookonchain further noted that sundayfunday.sol is the largest participant in the BOOK OF MEME (BOME) presale. They had spent 421 SOL (about $72,000) to buy BOME.
Sundayfunday.sol received 1.43 billion of BOME, valued at $40 million during the asset’s peak price. They then sold 530 billion BOME for 38,305 SOL, roughly $7.66 million, and currently hold 894 billion BOME, valued at $10.5 million.

Additionally, Lookonchain noticed that the address “4pV17t9g4qdH3HWZzq6dZ62785pDYhkKUSPai8FHvQTH,” suspected of being the crypto market maker Wintermute, spent 2,000 SOL ($337,000) to buy MANEKI at $0.0098 on May 18. The same address previously spent 1,300 SOL ($201,000) to buy MICHI nine days ago. Following the transaction, MICHI became a popular meme coin over the past week.
In contrast, Lookonchain also reported significant losses among other crypto whales. On May 18, a crypto whale sold 732,481 dogwifhat (WIF), worth $1.85 million, at a loss. This whale initially purchased 732,481 WIF for $2.18 million at $2.98 per coin just three days earlier. The sale at around $2.52 per coin resulted in a loss of $330,000.

Other meme coins like PONKE and 1CAT also marked significant gains over the last 24 hours. DEX Screener data shows 1CAT surged by 1,320% and is now trading at $0.001017. PONKE rose around 54% since May 18 and is currently trading at $0.3458.
The case of these meme coin whales illustrates the thrilling yet risky aspects of meme coin trading. Ken Timsit, managing director at layer-1 blockchain Cronos, emphasized the challenges of trading meme coins. He noted that there is no sure formula for a regular person to trade meme coins.

“Meme coin investors spend a lot of time on X (Twitter), Farcaster, and Discord to get a feel for the community sentiment, and they are able to act on that sentiment within hours. While the dream of overnight riches can be compelling for many people, it is important that users and developers continue to pay attention to other blockchain use cases such as DeFi, Web3 gaming, decentralized social platforms, and decentralized infrastructure,” he told BeInCrypto.

Indeed, this weekend’s events and Timsit’s insight highlight the need for meme coin traders and investors to approach these assets with caution and strategic insight.

Solana‘s 4-hour chart highlights the pivot point at $171.79, which is critical for Solana’s near-term price action. Immediate resistance is identified at $176.66, followed by $183.26 and $188.53.On the downside, immediate support is found at $165.72, with further support levels at $156.75 and $151.08. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 73, indicating overbought conditions.The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $155.79, supporting the overall uptrend.The upward channel supports the current bullish trend, but resistance is emerging around the $175 mark. The trendline extending through this level indicates a potential barrier to further price gains.Solana Price PredictionOn the lower side, the $171.79 pivot point is crucial, acting as immediate support. If Solana maintains its position above this pivot point, it could support continued upward momentum.However, a break below $171.79 could trigger a sharp selling trend, pushing the price towards the next support levels at $165.72, $156.75, and $151.08. The market’s reaction to these key levels will be vital in determining the near-term direction of Solana’s price.In conclusion, Solana’s technical outlook remains bullish as long as it stays above the $171.79 pivot point. The immediate resistance at $176.66 will be the first hurdle to overcome, followed by $183.26 and $188.53.The RSI’s high value suggests caution, as overbought conditions may lead to a pullback.

'XRP $1 Price' Eruption Looks Nigh As Ripple's Foray Into Africa Proves Game-Changing ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ripple’s recent announcement of its ambitious expansion plans into the African market has significantly boosted the trajectory of its cryptocurrency, XRP. The crypto asset has responded favorably, currently trading at around $0.52. This development has fueled speculation within the crypto community about whether XRP can muster enough momentum to push past its next resistance level of $0.55 and potentially reach the coveted $1 mark.



As Ripple aims to tap into the vast potential of the African continent, leveraging its blockchain technology for cross-border payments and banking solutions, the crypto world watches with keen interest to see if this strategic move will propel XRP to new heights, solidifying its position as a major player in the digital asset arena.



Ripple, a major leader in cross-border payment solutions, is set to introduce its XRP Ledger (XRPL) and a suite of crypto-native services, including custody solutions, to the African continent.







This strategic move is in partnership with MFS Africa, a leading payments firm operating in 35 African countries. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, which leverages XRP to facilitate swift and cost-effective cross-border transactions, will be at the forefront of this expansion.



This collaboration aims to streamline and enhance the efficiency of the region’s remittances and other payment processes, tapping into a vast market with significant growth potential. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasized the company’s commitment to establishing a robust presence in emerging markets through innovative crypto services.

Market Reaction and XRP Price Surge



The announcement had an immediate impact on XRP’s market performance. The cryptocurrency increased from $0.48 to $0.52, reflecting a 1.4% rise. This surge underscores the market’s positive reception to Ripple’s strategic expansion plans and its potential to drive further adoption of XRP across the African market.



XRP’s market capitalization currently stands at $28.7 billion, and its 48-hour trading volume has reached $1.1 billion, indicating strong investor interest and trading activity. Technical indicators suggest XRP could see further gains, with the next resistance level at $0.55. If bullish momentum continues, the digital asset might target the $1 mark, a significant psychological and technical milestone.



Ripple’s foray into Africa is part of a broader vision to leverage blockchain technology for various financial services beyond cross-border payments. The introduction of custody services and other crypto-native solutions reflects Ripple’s strategy to diversify its offerings and provide comprehensive financial tools to businesses and consumers in the region.



This expansion comes amidst Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security and is seeking approximately $2 billion in fines. Ripple, however, disputes this figure, arguing that the appropriate penalty should be around $10 million. Despite these legal challenges, Ripple continues to pursue its growth agenda.



XRP Technical Analysis and Prediction



XRP has struggled to gain momentum, consistently hitting a wall at the $0.55 resistance level. This stagnation is evident across various timeframes, with the cryptocurrency experiencing declines over the past month, week, and even the last 24 hours. Currently, XRP is trading at $0.52, a slight uptick from its position a week ago.



Despite the sluggish market, analysts offer a more hopeful outlook. They forecast a notable rise for XRP, suggesting that the coin could reach $0.65 by mid-week. This would mark an impressive gain of over 25%.



From a technical analysis perspective, breaking past the $0.55 resistance is crucial for XRP to enter a bullish phase. If the analysts’ optimistic forecast materializes, it could reinvigorate investor confidence and drive further price increases. Conversely, failure to break this barrier might lead to a period of consolidation, with prices potentially stabilizing around $0.50.



The primary challenge with XRP is that its value is largely driven by its underlying fundamentals rather than market hype. As a result, big returns might take longer to materialize.

'Binance Pump' Doesn't Exist Anymore as Listed Tokens Mostly Lose Value

Tokens listed on Binance used to fuel long-term bullish rallies for various tokens back in 2017 and even 2021. However, things have changed drastically after the composition of early investors shifted toward VCs and various funds that use retail investors as exit liquidity.Everyone is talking about the VC + CEX cartel, where teams are pushed to launch at the highest possible fully diluted valuation (FDV) on tier-1 centralized exchanges to provide exit liquidity for VCs and insiders. The result: New coins are not great investments anymore. But how real is this claim? Numbers suggest it is. Researcher Flow, known on X as @tradetheflow_, analyzed the performance of 31 tokens listed on Binance over the past six months. Only five tokens have increased in price compared to their listing time: ORDI +261.9%, JTO +62%, JUP +58%, WIF +117%. The biggest decliners include NFP -62%, PORTAL -69%, AEVO -68%, SAGA -63%, DYM -55%, AXL -55%, BOME -55%, W -58%. The average FDV when Binance listed these tokens was as high as $4.2 billion.Most of the new Binance listings are tokens backed by tier-1 VCs and launch at inflated valuations. The average FDV on Binance listing dates is over $4.2 billion, with some even reaching a staggering $11 billion. Often, these projects have no real user base or strong community support. If you held a portfolio investing an equal amount in each new Binance listing, you would be down over 18% in the past six months.More often than not, tokens launching on Binance no longer serve as solid investment vehicles — their upside potential is already exhausted. Instead, they represent exit liquidity for insiders who capitalize on retail investors' lack of access to quality early investment opportunities.Launching at high FDVs just results in token price bleed and zero mindshare, ultimately leading to the token's collapse.

Polkadot Creator Gavin Wood Says One Blockchain Use Case Crucial for Mass Adoption - The Daily Hodl


								The creator of interoperability blockchain Polkadot (DOT) says that one use case for the blockchains is crucial for their mass adoption.
In a new interview on macro guru Raoul Pal’s podcast, Polkadot creator Gavin Wood says that proof of personhood – or a mechanism that digitally verifies a person’s humanity – could be the killer blockchain application that triggers widespread adoption.










“What I’ve come to think about in this regard [during] the last couple of years is that blockchains have so far only really mastered doing scale of value – money basically. They haven’t mastered the concept of personhood, it’s something that we rely on in everyday life for almost everything. 
You go to a shop to buy, I don’t know, a big piece of computer equipment [and] they make sure that you are a person before you can spend over $1,000. You don’t notice it, but it’s a necessary element of modern society, at least in the West.” 
Wood goes on to note just how prevalent proof of personhood is in Western society but warns that we should not rely on governments to verify who is and isn’t a person.
“We just do it naturally, [we] expect to be able to see a face and so many transactions rely on that. So much of our social fabric relies on [proof of personhood] that it needs to be part of blockchain before blockchain is going to be a big part of society… 
The question is: how do you do it without relying on things like governments to tell you who’s a person who’s not? I’m not a big fan of the Worldcoin approach, I think that’s just too much trust in the Worldcoin apparatus. I’m not a big fan of the KYC (know-your-customer) passport approach, I think it’s too much reliance on governments…
 I wouldn’t, broadly speaking, rely on any government stuff to power blockchain and this needs to sit at a pretty low level for it to be useful so we need to come up with quite a lot more inventive means of building personhood into blockchain.”

Kraken Dismisses Rumors of Delisting USDT in Europe


Crypto exchange Kraken has dismissed rumors about delisting Tether’s USDT stablecoin for its European users.
Kraken’s Global Head of Asset Growth and Management, Mark Greenberg, clarified this in a May 18 post on X (formerly Twitter).
Kraken to Continue Listing USDT in Europe

BeInCrypto reported that Kraken was considering ceasing support for USDT in the EU if the stablecoin fails to comply with the forthcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, set to take effect in July.
This regulatory framework is designed to provide clear guidelines for crypto asset developers and service providers. It ensures adherence to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) regulations.
The news sparked reactions within the crypto community. They pointed out that USDT is the largest stablecoin and among the most traded digital assets in the industry. Tether has a market cap of over $110 billion, representing about 69% market share.

However, Greenberg has addressed these concerns, stating that the platform intends to maintain support for USDT in Europe. He emphasized the value of USDT for European clients, adding that Kraken was exploring all options for offering USDT under the new regulatory regime. Regarding the MiCA regulations, Greenberg also affirmed that Kraken will comply with all legal requirements, even those with which they may disagree.

“We know our European clients value access to USDT and we continue to look at all options to offer USDT under the upcoming regime. We will of course follow all legal requirements, even those we disagree with. But the rules are not finalized yet and we continue to do everything we can to continue to offer all relevant stablecoins to our European customers,” Greenberg added.


While the crypto community welcomed MiCA’s regulatory clarity, industry figures like Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino have reservations. Ardoino highlighted the need for stablecoin issuers to avoid uninsured cash deposits. Instead, he advocates for maintaining 100% reserves in treasury bills to mitigate the risk of bank failures.
Ardoino pointed to past incidents involving banks and stablecoins in the US as examples of the risks associated with uninsured cash deposits. He stressed the importance of learning from these events to ensure the stability and security of stablecoins in the future.

“We should learn from what happened with Silicon Valley Bank and another major stablecoin in the US. If a bank goes bankrupt, uninsured cash goes into bankruptcy. Stablecoins should be able to keep 100% of reserves in treasury bills, rather than exposing themselves to bank failures keeping big chunk of reserves in uninsured cash deposits. In case of bank failure, securities return back to the legitimate owner,” Ardoino stated.

Ethereum Co-Founder Comends Community’s Free-Speech Culture - Coin Edition


							

Vitalik Buterin sparked free speech discussion among crypto community members.
Buterin commended Ethereum community for their free-speech culture.
Users believe Buterin wants devs to amp up activities and build more blockchain apps.




Recent comments by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have sparked widespread discussion about freedom of expression in the cryptocurrency industry. In a post on X, Buterin commended Ethereum’s culture, highlighting that the community does not try to prevent people from speaking their minds.







According to Buterin, the Ethereum community does not practice controlled speech. He highlighted that even people with negative feelings toward the protocol or ecosystem express themselves without restriction, noting that some users wave the ideal of “open discourse” as a flag while others take it seriously.



As it turns out, Buterin’s comments sparked widespread discussion among crypto community members, many of whom responded to his post. Most of the respondents supported the Ethereum co-founder’s view. They agreed to the existing free-speech culture in the Ethereum community, criticizing the contrasting approach of most web3 ecosystems for prioritizing censorship.



According to reports, Buterin’s message revolves around the crypto movement’s ultimate goal of a free and open internet. The Ethereum chief’s focus is on the need for practical application of blockchain technologies against getting lost in theoretical discussions. Several users consider Buterin’s call for free speech a signal for developers to increase their efforts to build more blockchain applications, considering Ethereum’s recent market decline.







Ethereum has lost a significant portion of its market share in the last two weeks. TradingView’s data shows that ETH’s dominance dropped from 17.51% on April 28 to 15.41% as of May 17, 2024. The flagship crypto has struggled to recover from a pullback after reaching a yearly high of $4,093 in March.



The flagship altcoin traded for $3,109 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView, as the bulls attempt to reestablish a bullish momentum ahead of a potential bull run.

Bitcoin whale trader turns bullish, stacks $175 million BTC in May


A Bitcoin (BTC) whale turned bullish in May and recently restarted accumulating coins. The address went from a nearly $20 million worth balance to $175 million this month, holding over 2,600 BTC.
Notably, the Bitcoin Whale address possibly belongs to a cryptocurrency trader, as it shows a high buying and selling activity. Historically, ‘124BPp9mTaXxTXiRx8cxEZDd4sGjoxGk9F‘ received a total of 150,435 BTC and spent 147,831 BTC—consistent trading activity since 2018.

In particular, the whale sold over 2,800 Bitcoin from March to April, holding a remaining 287 BTC bearish balance. However, it started gradually stacking coins on May 3, with its most relevant activity happening in the past 24 hours.


Since May 18, this trader bought 1,590 BTC, adding to an already increasing balance of 1,014 BTC by May 17. Before May, its 287 BTC balance was worth less than $20 million, now sitting in a nearly $175 million stack.

Bitcoin whale activity
Interestingly, the overall Bitcoin whale activity has signaled a bullish year-over-year price action for BTC, aligning with this trader’s accumulation. Vini Barbosa retrieved data from Santiment’s SanBase Pro for Finbold, showing this aforementioned activity.
As observed, Bitcoin addresses holding from 1,000 to 10,000 BTC have aggressively accumulated nearly 5 million coins. It is worth noting the cross-over of addresses with less than 1,000 BTC a few months before Bitcoin reached new all-time highs: Whales accumulated more, while retail was selling aggressively.

Specifically, the Bitcoin whale trader ‘124BPp9mTaXxTXiRx8cxEZDd4sGjoxGk9F’ sold most of its one-year accumulation at the top and has started accumulating again.

In closing, this recent Bitcoin whale activity could be seen as a bullish signal for the leading cryptocurrency. The address in question has shown a solid history of making good trading decisions and has already stacked $175 million. Should this signal play out, BTC could be heading toward $72,000 and beyond.

These Traditional Finance Giants Bought Bitcoin ETFs Last Quarter


																Bitcoin keeps touching new levels of adoption in the real world, with traditional finance (TradFi) firms embracing the digital asset at a remarkable pace. The significant investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) signifies growing institutional interest in crypto assets.
Last quarter, a staggering number of U.S. banks, investment managers, hedge funds, and professional firms bought spot Bitcoin ETFs, as seen in their 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
A tweet by the digital assets investment analysis platform K33 Research revealed that 937 professional firms in the U.S. were invested in the spot Bitcoin ETF market as of March 31. Hence, it may be difficult to know and list every TradFi firm that jumped on the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon in the first three months of the year.
TradFi Giants Jump on BTC Bandwagon
Some of the largest Bitcoin ETF investments came from Millennium Management, a heavyweight hedge fund, and Susquehanna International Group (SIG), a global quantitative trading firm. The firms reported investments of $2 billion and $1 billion in the Bitcoin products, respectively.
Millennium Management and SIG’s investments were followed by Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund that manages money for top universities like Yale and Princeton, and Boothbay Fund, another fund manager based in New York. The entities purchased ETFs worth $434 million and $377 million, respectively.
Substantial ETF disclosures also came from top U.S. banking firm Morgan Stanley and advisory company Pine Ridge Advisers, with investments totaling $269 million and $205.8 million, respectively.
In addition, alternative asset manager Aristeia Capital, investment firm Graham Capital, and hedge fund manager Crcm LP reported significant exposures of $163.4 million, $102.6 million, and $96.6 million, respectively, to the Bitcoin ETFs.
States to Follow?
Many other professional firms disclosed smaller investments in the Bitcoin ETF market. Some of them include Hightower Advisors with $68 million exposure, Fortress Investment Group with $53.6 million, Cambridge Investment Research with $40 million, Sequoia Financial Advisors with $12 million, Integrated Advisors with $11 billion, and Brown Advisory with $4 million.
Noteworthily, major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo invested even smaller amounts, totaling $760,000 and $143,000, respectively, in the Bitcoin ETF market.
It is also worth mentioning that most of these firms spread their investments across several ETFs, with Grayscale’s GBTC, BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark Invest’s ARKB seeing the largest allocations.
Meanwhile, the digital asset market may soon witness an influx of investments from state-owned professional firms. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board has already set the pace with a $163 million exposure to Bitcoin ETFs.

Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum Statement Raises Rumbling on X, Here's Why


Vitalik Buterin's most recent statement should not have caused what it did. The Ethereum co-founder, who spoke about free speech on Ethereum, faced backlash from regular users who suffered from Ethereum influencers who could not take any criticism.However, this statement triggered a wave of criticism from the community. Many users shared their negative experiences with Ethereum influencers, highlighting a contrast between Buterin's ideal of open discourse and the reality of censorship they face.One user questioned, "Do they ever discuss ETH/BTC chart?" implying that meaningful discussions are often sidestepped. Another user shared their experience, saying, "I've been blocked by just about every Ethereum influencer because they don't like my criticisms." It kind of highlights a significant disconnect between Buterin's vision and the actual behavior of influential figures within the Ethereum ecosystem.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewComments poured in, criticizing the mainstream culture of censorship and manipulation within the Ethereum community. One user remarked that censorship culture is prevalent in the Web3 industry, pointing out that the issue of silencing dissenting voices is not unique to Ethereum but prevalent across the decentralized web space.The backlash also included personal anecdotes, with one user recalling times when Ethereum fees were ridiculously high, any influential figure in the ETH community would silence anyone who criticizes it. The frustration many users feel when trying to engage in critical discussions about Ethereum's shortcomings is a massive sign that the community might not be as open and kind as Vitalik Buterin is trying to portray it.However, it might not be that big of a deal. The Ethereum community, like any other crypto community, is intrinsically open, allowing anyone to express their thoughts and opinions on public forums like X, Warpcast and others. You are also free to mute whomever you want if you do not agree with them.

XRP Price Rebounds, Fueled by Whales Amid Cooling U.S. Inflation | Cryptopolitan

XRP is currently seeing a notable uptick in its market value, with a more than 2% rise in the last 24 hours, pushing the price to $0.525. This increase is a significant recovery of approximately 25% from a month-ago low of $0.423.Market Recovery Boosts XRPThe broader crypto market is showing signs of recovery, and XRP is riding this wave, aided by substantial whale activity.Yesterday’s upward trajectory for XRP is tied to positive shifts in market sentiment and significant acquisitions by large-scale investors, known as whales.Related: Ripple Lawsuit Nears Conclusion With SEC Final ResponseRecently, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data indicated a cooling of inflation, with core inflation climbing just 0.3% to 3.6% in March, the lowest increase since April 2021 excluding food and energy costs.Source: TradingViewThis update has ignited a bullish sentiment among bond traders, who have now moved their forecasts for the year’s first rate cut from November to September, reflecting growing optimism in financial markets.Following this CPI announcement, XRP’s price has climbed by 5%, suggesting that the reduced rate cut expectations have boosted crypto investors’ confidence, leading to increased buying activity.Whale Movements Propel XRPThe recent price surge is also closely aligned with notable buying patterns among XRP’s largest holders. Data from Santiment indicates that accounts holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have collectively increased their holdings by 110 million tokens, valued at around $55 million, over the past two weeks.Source: SantimentThis whale activity coincides with a 10% price increase for XRP, showcasing strong investor confidence that may stabilize the currency’s market position.From a technical analysis standpoint, XRP is also showing promising patterns. The currency has been interacting with the lower trendline of a long-standing descending triangle pattern.As of the latest updates, XRP is aiming to settle above its 200-week and 50-week exponential moving averages (EMAs), located at around $0.55 and $0.60, respectively.Also Read: ChatGPT Forecasts XRP Price for May 31, 2024Breaking these levels could position XRP to challenge the upper trendline of the triangle, potentially reaching up to $0.585.Bold Predictions for XRPDespite its current gains, XRP’s performance throughout the year has been relatively modest compared to other cryptocurrencies.Currently trading around $0.51, the asset has seen only slight improvements from last month. However, some market analysts are very bullish about XRP’s future.A notable prediction from the analyst Dark Defender suggests that XRP could climb to $5.85 and even reach $18.22, supported by a five-phase Elliott Wave structure.This optimistic scenario hinges on maintaining current price levels between $0.3917 and $0.6649, considered normal fluctuations.Earlier this year, predictions even stretched as high as $20. Meanwhile, EGRAG CRYPTO has advised the XRP community to remain vigilant as a significant price “ignition” may be imminent.JackTheRippler’s extraordinary forecast positions XRP to soar to $100, showing a level of optimism unmatched by typical market forecasts.CryptoBull, in 2023, took this a step further by projecting that XRP could skyrocket to an unprecedented $470 in the future.Cryptopolitan reporting by Jai Hamid

XRP Drops Below $0.5250 Ahead Of Crucial Date in Ripple Vs SEC Case - Coin Edition


							

XRP pulled back on Saturday after Friday’s 1.61% gain.
The embattled altcoin fell below $0.5250 amid profit-taking by investors.
Ripple has revealed plans to “expand heavily” in the Middle East.




XRP pulled back on Saturday, May 19, after recording slight gains a day before. A 0.46% decline by the embattled altcoin chopped off part of its Friday gains when the top altcoin rallied to $0.52932 before closing the session at $0.52358, according to data from TradingView.









Saturday’s pullback came amid Brad Garlinghouse, the Ripple CEO’s bullish comments, noting his excitement about his firm’s achievement in the last quarter. Despite Garlinghouse’s observations, XRP declined, suggesting a broader investor outlook on the events surrounding Ripple and XRP.







Following XRP’s slump in the middle of April, the altcoin has oscillated around $0.5250, swinging above and below the price level at regular intervals. Most of the time, developments in the ongoing litigation between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have influenced XRP’s price movement around the oscillating point.





As of Saturday, XRP slumped below the $0.5250 significant level as the final stages of the Ripple Vs SEC case came into play. The litigation-influenced sentiment caused increased caution among investors taking profit ahead of Monday’s deadline for the parties to file their opposition briefs. That could be a significant date for the ongoing case as it nears its final stages, with the possibility of an appeal.



Also playing a role in the XRP price trend is the growing awareness and potential adoption increase in the Middle East. Recently, Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa noted his company’s plans to expand their services in the region. Merrick cited the Middle East’s clear and friendly regulatory framework as motivation for his company’s plans.



The Ripple chief noted that such a regulatory atmosphere allows businesses to build out their operations. According to him, Ripple will capitalize on the opportunity and “expand heavily” in the region.

Cardano whale activity up 10x; Will ADA break the $1 barrier?


As the market started to get exciting with several cryptos registering green, Cardano  (ADA) also stood out, showcasing notable developments
Cardano has seen a significant surge in whale activity recently, leading to speculation about its future price potential. 
Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Cardano whales—those holding between 100 million and 1 billion ADA—have added 11% more ADA to their holdings over the past month. 



These large investors now control 6.71% of the total ADA supply, indicating a bullish sentiment
The increase in whale holdings is often seen as a precursor to a price rally. Large-scale purchases by these investors can lead to significant price movements. 
Retail investors are also showing strong interest in ADA. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a bullish bid-ask volume imbalance and an uptick in the ‘InThe Money’ metric. This indicates that most investors are currently profiting from their ADA holdings.
Growing optimism in the Cardano ecosystem
Confidence in Cardano is growing. DeFiLlama reports an increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Cardano network over the past week. Additionally, trading volume on the network has increased, suggesting that more users are actively trading ADA.
However, despite the bullish outlook, there are concerns about declining user activity on the Cardano network.
Data from Artemis shows a significant drop in daily transactions, now around 48,000 compared to 96,000 two months ago. 
Daily active addresses have also decreased, recently dipping below 34,000. These trends raise questions about the network’s current usage and adoption despite the overall positive sentiment regarding ADA’s price potential.
ADA price analysis
At press time, Cardano is trading at $0.4791 with a market capitalization exceeding $17.09 billion, making it the 10th largest cryptocurrency. 
However, a change might be on the horizon. World of Charts highlighted that ADA’s price recently broke above a bullish flag pattern on its 8-hour chart. This pattern suggests ADA is currently at nearly a 10% profit, with the potential to surge by 100%. 
If this occurs, Cardano could reach $1 in the upcoming weeks.
ADA MVRV Velocity and Volume . Source: Santiment
Santiment’s data shows an improvement in ADA’s MVRV ratio, a bullish indicator. Trading volume has remained high, supporting the recent price surge. However, Cardano’s velocity dropped last week, indicating reduced transaction activity.

Furthermore, analysis from Coinglass suggests Cardano might see a significant liquidation near the $0.492 mark. This could lead to price corrections, but if ADA breaks above this level, it could reach $0.5 or $0.528 shortly.
The recent surge in whale activity and growing optimism within the Cardano ecosystem suggest a promising outlook for ADA. While there are some concerns about declining user activity, the overall sentiment remains positive.
Investors should watch key price levels and market indicators closely as ADA continues to navigate these dynamic market conditions.

Ethereum's transaction size falls 54%: Why it's not bad news for ETH - AMBCrypto



ETH could be close to its bottom after the transaction size failed to spike.
While the price might slip, traders are convinced of a quick recovery.

On the 19th of May, AMBCrypto observed that Ethereum’s [ETH] average transaction size had fallen to $2,767. This was a 54.13% decline from the metric when the month began.
At that time, the average transaction size was $5,893, according to data from IntoTheBlock.
For the uninitiated, the average transaction size checks in dollar terms the mean transaction value for an asset on a particular day.
Historically, spikes in this metric signal high user activity—Especially from large investors and institutions. But when it decreases, it implies an absence of institutional interaction.
Institutions out, retail in
As such, the recent state of Ethereum implies a presence of more retail users. Apart from that, this indicator identifies potential tops and bottoms.
From the value mentioned, it was obvious that ETH seemed closer to its bottom than the top. At press time, ETH’s price was $3,106, indicating that it had swung around the same range in the last 24 hours.
Source: IntoTheBlock
Going by the analysis above, the price of the cryptocurrency could be set to hit a higher value in the short term. However, other metrics need to be considered.
As a result of this, AMBCrypto looked at the Ethereum Exchange Net Position Change. According to data obtained from Glassnode, the Exchange Net Position Change has been in the negative region for most of the last 30 days.
ETH gets set for a big move
This metric tracks the 30-day change of the supply held in exchange wallets. A positive value indicates that more coins are in exchanges.
On the other hand, a negative value indicates increased withdrawals from exchanges.
One thing we noticed was that the metric suddenly became positive on the 18th of May. As of this writing, the ETH net position change was 81,715.
This increase could be a sign that Ethereum participants are taking profits off the 6.50% increase within the last week.
If this number continues to increase, then ETH’s price might decrease below $3,000 before the potential rally happens.
Source: Santiment
However, if exchange withdrawals intensify once more, the price might begin a slow increase toward $3,500. In a highly bullish situation, an increase to $4,000 could be an option.
On Friday, the 17th of May, AMBCrypto reported how options traders were expecting ETH’s price to hit $3,600 between May and the end of June.
At press time, Glassnode data showed that the sentiment had not changed. This is because of the signals from the Put/Call Ratio (PCR).

Is your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator

If the PCR is over 0.70, it implies a bearish sentiment and there are more puts than calls.
However, a reading below 0.50 implies otherwise. At press time, Ethereum’s Put/Call Ratio was 0.35, meaning that most traders expect the value of the cryptocurrency to increase in the coming weeks.

Coinbase Research Says ‘Surprise to the Upside’ Possible for Ethereum ETF Decision - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								Research from Coinbase suggests that decisions on a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) could surprise investors.
In a new note, Coinbase Institutional says that an ETH ETF is a question of when, not if, and that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely looking at the decision with the same rationale that it did when approving the Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs earlier this year.










Coinbase notes that the SEC looked at the strong correlation between the price of spot BTC on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) – something that is also true for Ethereum.
“While there is uncertainty around a timely approval given the SEC’s apparent silence with issuers, we think that the existence of a US spot ETH ETF remains a question of when, not if. In fact, the primary rationale used to approve the spot BTC ETFs applies equally to spot ETH ETFs. That is, the correlation between the CME futures product and the spot exchange rates is sufficiently high such that ‘CME’s surveillance can be reasonably expected to detect… misconduct [in the spot market]’. 
The period of correlation study in the spot BTC approval notice began in March 2021, one month after CME ETH futures launched. We think this evaluation period was deliberately chosen so that a similar reasoning could be applied to ETH markets. Indeed, correlation analysis previously presented by Coinbase and Grayscale suggests that the spot and futures correlation for ETH markets is similar to that for BTC.”
Coinbase says that despite the low odds of an Ethereum ETF being approved in May, markets could be in for an unexpected sign-off from the SEC.
“We think there is room for surprise to the upside on this decision. Polymarket is pricing in odds of a May 31, 2024 approval at 16%, and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) is trading at a 24% discount to net asset value (NAV). We believe the odds of approval are closer to 30-40%.
As crypto begins to take form as an election issue, it’s also less certain in our view that the SEC would be willing to front the political capital necessary to support a denial. Even if the first deadline on May 23, 2024 encounters a rejection, we think there is a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision. It is also worth noting that not all spot ETH ETF applications necessarily need to be approved at the same time. In fact, Commissioner Uyeda’s approval statement regarding the spot BTC ETF criticized the disguised “motivation for accelerating the approval of the applications, which is to prevent a first-mover advantage.”

Polkadot (DOT) Ecosystem Recap: The Most Recent Advancements


																TL;DR


Polkadot partnered with Founder Institute to launch a Web3 cohort and introduced Asynchronous Backing to enhance scalability.
Some of its parachains, such as Acala Network and Moonbeam Network, have also made notable advancements in security, governance, and community engagement initiatives.


Summary of the Latest Developments
Polkadot’s ecosystem continues to advance due to frequent improvements in its operations and vital partnerships. Most recently, the blockchain protocol shook hands with Founder Institute (a leading business incubator that turns ideas into fundable startups). 
The latter described the collaboration as “groundbreaking,” adding that it marks the start of “an exciting chapter” related to the launch of the first Web3 cohort in its Core Program. “Our cooperation is set to revolutionize the landscape of startup acceleration and Web3 technology education,” the team stated. 
Founder Institute explained that the program’s launch is set for May 28, and it will be guided by top experts from the Polkadot community. 




Earlier this month, the blockchain protocol enabled Asynchronous Backing on the network. It is a mechanism designed to improve the scalability and efficiency of the entire ecosystem. The Asynchronous Backing also represents “an optimized approach for how parachain blocks are validated” by the central chain – Relay Chain.
Polkadot’s team revealed that blocks are produced twice as fast, whereas available blockspace was boosted by 6-10 times following that upgrade.
“Async Backing boosts throughput by 8x, without sacrificing security, paving the way for supporting Web3 applications across verticals such as gaming and DeFi. It brings Web2 scale into the reach of Web3, which is crucial for large-scale platforms like Mythical Games,” they added.
Another major development that took place as of late is the release of the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper. It is a technical upgrade that outlines an innovative approach for improving the performance and scalability of blockchain networks, particularly in the context of Polkadot’s ecosystem. It combines elements of Polkadot and Ethereum and “provides a global singleton permissionless object environment.“
The blockchain protocol is also looking for external partnerships such as a potential deal with the American soccer club Inter Miami. Last month, Nico Zini – the team’s commercial manager and in charge of TV rights – revealed that both sides may join forces on an $8.8 million sponsorship partnership. 
For the uninitiated, Inter Miami’s co-founder is David Beckham, while its biggest stars on the pitch include the Argentine legend Lionel Messi and the Uruguayan Luis Suarez.
Zini previously served as FC Barcelona’s Business Development Manager in North America. The Catalan club was contemplating striking a deal with Polkadot in 2022 but eventually chose Spotify.
How About the Parachains?
Some of Polkadot’s parachains – individual blockchains that run in parallel with the Polkadot ecosystem – have also advanced lately. One of the most popular – Acala Network – completed the Sinai Upgrade at the beginning of May. 
It aims to strengthen security measures, empower the community to participate in governance decisions, improve Acala’s capabilities to interact seamlessly across different blockchains, and simplify the user experience. 
Moonbeam Network introduced “the Moonbeam Odyssey Program Trials,” which emphasizes community involvement with various events and educational initiatives.
“Anyone can join! Test your skills, strengths, and abilities to emerge victorious from the Trials and become an Odyssey Trailblazer,” the team stated.

Research: The Last 31 Binance-Listed Coins Analyzed - All But These 5 Are in Loss - Bitcoin Sistemi

A recent study by cryptocurrency researcher Flow analyzed the performance of 31 tokens listed on Binance over the past six months. The results are quite surprising and reveal that more than 80% of these tokens have lost value since their listing.
Only five tokens showed price increases compared to when they were listed: ORDI with a staggering increase of 261.9, JTO and JUP continuing the Solana momentum with increases of 62% and 58% respectively, and WIF, a memecoin with an increase of 117%. The other remaining token is MEME, another memecoin.


On the other hand, the biggest decreases were in NFP (-62%), PORTAL (-69%), AEVO (-68%), SAGA (-63%), DYM (-55%), AXL (-55%), BOME ( -55%) and W (-58%).
When Binance listed these tokens, their average fully diluted market cap (FDV) was $4.2 billion, with some even reaching a staggering FDV of over $11 billion. Many of these new listings were tokens backed by top venture capitalists and launched at exorbitant valuations.






However, it is worth noting that most of these projects often lack real users or a strong community behind them. If an investor had a portfolio where they invested an equal amount into each new Binance listing, they would have experienced a decline of over 18% in the last six months.
This study highlights a worrying trend in the crypto market. Most of the time, tokens launched on Binance are no longer considered investment vehicles, having already been stripped of all their upside potential. Rather, they represent exit liquidity for insiders who take advantage of retail investors' lack of access to quality early investment opportunities.

Big Solana Wallet Now Top Utility App on Apple Store Amid Bull Frenzy - Coin Edition


							

Solana wallet Phantom now ranks third among utility apps on the Apple Store in the U.S.
The Phantom Wallet team recently celebrated attaining 7 million monthly active users. 
Phantom’s top ranking coincides with the frenzy around Solana tokens WIF and BONK garnering billion-dollar valuations.




Phantom, a non-custodial wallet based on the Solana blockchain, has recently made a significant mark. It now ranks among the leading utility mobile applications on the Apple App Store.









This noteworthy achievement was recently brought to the forefront by Evan Luthra, a widely followed Bitcoin investor on the X platform. Indeed, Phantom has emerged as the third trendy utility app on the Apple App Store in the U.S., trailing only the Google app and Google Chrome browser. 



With this significant achievement, Luthra emphasized the potential of tokens on the Solana network, suggesting that they now appear more promising than ever. “Seems like the SOL season is going to be BIG,” Luthra remarked.







Notably, Phantom Wallet’s top ranking came just after the team celebrated reaching 7 million monthly active users. 



Regarding its overall standing in the Apple App Store, Phantom Wallet holds the 32nd position across all categories. It comes in after X (formerly Twitter) and the AI chatbot ChatGPT. On the other hand, the mobile app of the prominent U.S. exchange Coinbase currently ranks 288th on the Apple App Store. 



Notably, App Store rankings are determined by various factors, not just download counts. For instance, MetaMask, despite being 75th in the same category, reported 10 million monthly active users as of February 2024.





Initially, Phantom Wallet was exclusive to the Solana blockchain but expanded its support to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon networks. The self-custodial wallet allows users to maintain control over their keys, offering an alternative to storing assets on exchanges. 



Notably, the prominence of the Solana wallet coincides with the ongoing frenzy surrounding Solana-based tokens. This includes the success of meme coins on the network, such as WIF and BONK, which boast several billion-dollar valuations.

Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Reveals What's Behind 'Bitcoin Is Dead' Claim of Peter Schiff


The recent 9.3% rise in the price of Bitcoin, which pushed it over $67,000 per BTC by the end of the week, has sparked new discussions among financial experts. This is the first significant weekly increase since early March, following a period of decline after an all-time high of $74,000 per BTC was hit.BTC to USD by CoinMarketCapPeter Schiff, a prominent precious metals advocate and cryptocurrency critic, dismissed the significance of Bitcoin's recovery. He noted that silver has gained more than 21% since the beginning of April, compared to cryptocurrency's modest gain of less than 2% over the same period. Schiff argued that silver offers higher returns and declared Bitcoin a failed investment, saying that it is "dead."Veteran trader Peter Brandt responded to Schiff's comments by advising the public to ignore them. Brandt, who is known for his analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggested that Schiff's statements were aimed at attracting attention rather than truly understanding the situation.Who you are betting on?He suggested that despite his criticism, Schiff understands the value of cryptocurrencies, but prefers to promote silver due to his long-standing preferences. Brandt accused Schiff of exaggerating silver's recent performance in order to undermine BTC. In response, Schiff said that his views on cryptocurrency are sincere. He warned of the high risks associated with investing in Bitcoin, calling it a speculative asset with no intrinsic value. Schiff believes that many investors could suffer significant losses by betting on what he calls an "imaginary horse."This public disagreement between Schiff and Brandt underscores the ongoing debate in the financial community about the future of cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin continues to rally and show potential for significant gains, opinions remain sharply divided.Which side will win in the long run? Will Bitcoin prove its skeptics wrong, or will traditional assets like silver offer more reliable returns?

A Cryptocurrency Whale Turned $2,275 into $2.26 Million Last Night - Here's the Memecoin That Brought 993x Rise - Bitcoin Sistemi

A crypto whale has accomplished something incredible, according to a development reported by analysts at cryptocurrency data provider Lookonchain.
The wallet named sundayfunday.sol turned the memecoin called 1DOL into 2.26 million dollars, in which it invested only 13 SOL, or 2,275 dollars, last night. This shows that the whale wallet made 993x profit in 8 hours.


However, it appears that the whale wallet in question has made similar transactions in the past. According to Onchain data, sundayfunday.sol is also an address associated with BOME, which experienced incredible hype for a while and is currently among the memecoins with a market value of 780 million dollars.
sundayfunday.sol, which participated in the BOME pre-sale with the largest amount of assets, spent 421 SOL, or 72 thousand dollars, for this pre-sale. However, a total of 1.43 trillion BOMEs were distributed to the whale wallet, and these tokens reached a peak value of $ 40 million.






At the time of writing, BOME is trading 59% lower than its all-time high price level.
sundayfunday.sol wallet sold 530 billion BOME for 7.66 million dollars in transactions made after the BOME launch. However, the whale wallet is still the largest owner of this altcoin with 894 billion BOME tokens worth $ 10.5 million.


Although sundayfunday.sol wallet is lucky, it should not be forgotten that the majority of cryptocurrency users in memecoins lose large amounts of money.

Update: Kraken says no plans to delist USDT in Europe - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Kraken is exploring all options to continue offering USDT for EU customers.
Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s Global Head of Asset Growth and Management, confirmed this via a post on X.

Kraken is not looking to end support for Tether (USDT) in the European Union, a company official has confirmed.
A Bloomberg report on Friday stated that Kraken was “actively reviewing” plans to end support for the stablecoin in the EU. The exchange’s apparent position related to upcoming implementation of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, according to an official. 
Kraken to continue offering USDT for EU customers
Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s Global Head of Asset Growth and Management, has now provided an update on the matter. He commented on the issue on Saturday. 
In a post on X, Greenberg said the exchange has no plans to delist Tether. He also emphasised USDT’s role and importance as the world’s largest stablecoin to Kraken’s business and customers in Europe.
“Let’s be clear: [Kraken] continues to list USDT in Europe and we have no plans to delist at this time,” Greenberg posted.
Per the update, Kraken is exploring all options towards the continued support for USDT.  The exchange is indeed looking to comply with the MiCA regulations, Greenberg added.
“We know our European clients value access to USDT, and we continue to look at all options to offer USDT under the upcoming regime. We will, of course, follow all legal requirements, even those we disagree with. But the rules are not finalised yet, and we continue to do everything we can to continue to offer all relevant stablecoins to our European customers,” Greenberg noted.
As highlighted in our previous report, EU’s MiCA regulations are set to come into effect starting this July with stablecoin rules and on December 30, 2024 for crypto exchanges.

Bitcoin Whales Balance Returns To Pre-FTX Collapse Levels - Impact On BTC Price? | Bitcoinist.com


								Heading into the year 2024, Bitcoin spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and the halving event were arguably the biggest narratives in the crypto space. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first BTC spot products in the US early on, driving the coin’s price to a new all-time high.
The halving event, on the other hand, has not exactly led to the highly-anticipated positive run for the Bitcoin price, which has rather struggled over the past few weeks. The premier cryptocurrency has witnessed a steady increase in its value over the past few days, slightly nullifying the period of stagnation seen in the past month.
Whales Have Added 250,000 BTC Since ETF Approval: IntoTheBlock
In a recent post on the X platform, blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock disclosed that a particular class of Bitcoin whales have been on an accumulation spree in the past few months. This on-chain revelation is based on the Whales Balance metric, which tracks the total amount of Bitcoin held by addresses with more than 1,000 BTC. 

According to data from IntoTheBlock, the balance of this particular set of whales has jumped by roughly 250,000 BTC since the debut of spot ETFs in the United States. This recent accumulation has pushed the balance of whales holding more than 1,000 BTC closer to its level before the collapse of the FTX exchange.
Source: IntoTheBlock/X
The catastrophic fall of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX led to a widespread loss of faith in the cryptocurrency industry. This caused many large investors and holders to leave the market and liquidate their positions. So, this latest development might be the ultimate proof that the market turmoil from the exchange’s collapse is over.
The steady rise in these Bitcoin holdings suggests that large institutions have increased confidence and demand for the premier cryptocurrency, especially after the SEC approved the spot BTC ETFs. These investment products offer a regulated and more accessible avenue for institutional investors, particularly traditional institutions, to gain exposure to BTC.
Crypto whales are key players in the market, as their activities can influence the prices of assets. Hence, the accumulation of BTC by whales can be seen as a bullish signal for the coin’s price and a vote of confidence in its future trajectory.
Bitcoin Price At A Glance
The Bitcoin price has somewhat cooled off after surging from $61,000 to above $67,000 to close the week. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around $67,170, reflecting no significant change in the past day. On the weekly timeframe, though, the premier cryptocurrency is up by an impressive 10%.

Sell-off alert: Over $1 billion in token unlocks this week


Over $1 billion in token unlocks will hit the cryptocurrency market starting on Monday, May 20. This could result in a massive sell-off event, mainly affecting Pyth Network (PYTH) and Avalanche (AVAX) investors.
Previously, Finbold reported that May would see over $4 billion in token unlocks from multiple projects. Last week, Aevo (AEVO) unlocked $1 billion, which we featured as a cryptocurrency to avoid trading due to this inflation.
Now, in the next seven days, the market will see $1.27 billion worth of token unlocks from six cryptocurrencies. PYTH dominates the seven-day overall inflation with $905.72 million worth of unlock, inflating its supply by 141.7%. 


Moreover, Avalanche will release $348.18 million in AVAX, while SpaceID (ID), Acala (ACA), Euler (EUL), and 1inch (1INCH) compose the remaining $16.1 million. Finbold retrieved this data from TokenUnlocksApp on May 19.
Cliff Unlocks Next 7 Days, May 19. Source: TokenUnlocksApp
Pyth Network (PYTH) to unlock nearly $1 billion in tokens
Pyth Network unlock will open the inflationary week, releasing 2.13 billion tokens on May 20. Over half of this amount is reserved for Ecosystem Growth, which is controlled and allocated by Pyth’s team. Similarly, $320 million is reserved for Publisher Reward and Protocol Development, while 250 million PYTH is for  “Private Sales” investors.
As of this writing, Pyth Network was trading at $0.42 with a $630 million market cap and 1.5 billion PYTH circulating. Therefore, crypto traders should expect this massive token unlock to affect its price as sell-offs occur in the following weeks.
Pyth Network (PYTH) token unlock, May 20. Source: TokenUnlocksApp
Avalanche’s 9.55 million AVAX unlock
In the meantime, Avalanche will follow up with its monthly token unlocks on May 22. Like in previous months, the protocol will release 9.55 million AVAX, this time worth nearly $350 million.
As for the distribution, the Team will receive 4.50 million AVAX, currently worth nearly $165 million.
Furthermore, Strategic Partners and the Foundation will increase their treasury by 2.25 million and 1.67 million AVAX, respectively. This will open a future sell-off threat of over $142 million by these entities alone.
However, the most liquid unlock will be 1.13 million AVAX ($41.05 million) for community airdrop.

However, despite significant supply inflation with the unlocks, these tokens could still display positive price performance in the next few days. The cryptocurrency market is unpredictable, and everything can happen, even in unfavorable economic conditions.

Here's when Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $100k


Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable uptrend this week, propelling the asset’s value to $67,000 as it aims for a new all-time high following a challenging start to May.
One prevailing market sentiment suggests that Bitcoin’s next record-high target is $100,000, with speculation mounting that the milestone might be attained during the projected post-halving rally.
In line with this sentiment, trading expert TradingShot shared insights in a TradingView post on May 18, drawing from Bitcoin’s technical indicators to outline the potential factors that could drive the asset to $100,000 and a possible timeline.


TradingShot’s analysis centered around the inverse head and shoulders (IH&S) pattern, a bullish reversal formation observed in technical analysis. Since May 6, the expert noted that expectations have been high for Bitcoin to break out above the lower highs trendline, a key indicator for the IH&S pattern. True to expectations, Bitcoin duly delivered on this front.

Timeline for Bitcoin to $100,000
Highlighting historical precedents, TradingShot noted that the previous two instances of IH&S bottom formations resulted in significant price rises of around 95%. Moreover, the one-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator reinforces the bullish outlook.
Based on this analysis, TradingShot predicted that Bitcoin will likely hit the $100,000 psychological target sometime after July.

“With the 1D MACD on the same Bullish Cross that was present on both of those bottoms, we are expecting the $100,000 psychological target to be reached after July, which will even be a rise below +90%,” the analyst noted. 

While the precise timing remains uncertain, the projection underscores Bitcoin’s prevailing bullish sentiment. This sentiment follows a significant correction in early May, with the asset dipping as low as $56,000.
Bitcoin next trading pattern
Indeed, the breach of the $65,000 resistance level was a critical juncture likely to dictate Bitcoin’s trajectory toward a new record high. Notably, the maiden cryptocurrency is consolidating around $67,000, a pattern that some analysts anticipate will continue.
For instance, in a recent X post on May 19, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe advised investors not to anticipate further volatility in Bitcoin’s price.

“I’m not expecting massive volatility to come. I’d rather expect consolidation and slow upwards movements towards the all-time high,” he said. 

At the same time, according to a report by Finbold, crypto analyst RLinda suggested that Bitcoin bulls could be on the brink of breaking existing resistance levels. In this scenario, she highlighted key resistance levels to monitor at $67,250, $71,500, and $73,700 while emphasizing watching crucial support levels at $65,250, $64,500, and $61,500.
Bitcoin price analysis

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a staggering 3,015% surge in large holder NetFlow, which provides an idea of the change in positions of whales. However, this remarkable spike comes with a catch.A positive NetFlow typically suggests accumulation, where whales are buying up SHIB tokens, while a negative NetFlow can imply reduced positions or selling.According to IntoTheBlock data, Shiba Inu is seeing a negative 3,015% NetFlow, indicating that whales may be reducing their positions given the ongoing market uncertainty.This NetFlow surge is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it reflects increased interest in SHIB, as large holders transfer substantial amounts of the token. On the other, it raises questions about whales' positioning. Are whales positioning themselves for a sell-off or protecting their assets in response to market conditions?The timing of this NetFlow spike is particularly noteworthy as Shiba Inu faces a tough battle at the daily SMA 50. Shiba Inu faces tough battle at key resistanceRecently, SHIB enthusiasts watched with bated breath as the token surged, only to face a formidable barrier at a key resistance level.SHIB/USD Daily Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewShiba Inu saw a massive surge on May 15, surging from lows of $0.00002286 to highs of $0.00002558, printing a giant green candlestick in the process. SHIB sustained its gains to reach highs of $0.00002589 on May 16 after which it faced rejection owing to the massive barrier around this range.The resistance in question has proven to be a big barrier to SHIB's price, which is currently struggling to maintain its upward momentum. Technical analysts closely monitoring SHIB's performance note that the token's price has been attempting to break through this resistance for several days.The resistance level, identified by the daily simple moving average (SMA) 50 at $0.00002487 has been a tough nut to crack. Despite several attempts by the bulls to push the price beyond this level, SHIB has continually closed lower, signaling a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers.At the time of writing, SHIB was down 0.40% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002476.

Pump dot Fun exploiter identified and arrested in London - Blockworks


The alleged exploiter of Solana memecoin protocol Pump dot Fun has been arrested in London.
British police apprehended Jarett Dunn, a former contractor for the protocol, who is known online as @STACCoverflow, in the early morning hours of Saturday, according to a source familiar with the operation.
A third-party stakeholder contracted with a private intelligence firm to locate Dunn, the source told Blockworks.
A screenshot of Dunn’s Binance account linked to his pseudonym and circulating online is authentic, the source confirmed.
Read more: Pump.fun pauses trading after apparent flash loan attack
The 26-hour intelligence operation, which the source described as “a slow burn,” used Instagram posts and other “open source intelligence” to identify Dunn’s approximate whereabouts in London.
“A massive manhunt” using local operatives, known as “auxiliaries,” contracted by the firm, then ensued.
After canvasing the area, Dunn was ultimately located in a room at the Middle Eight Hotel, in London’s Covent Garden neighborhood, where he was arrested 7 hours later.
The timing aligns with the last X post of @STACCverflow, made Friday evening London-time. The profile name references “j’arrête” — meaning “I’m done” in French — but appears to carry a hidden double meaning to his real first name, Jarett.

Dunn was subsequently released on bail according to @JarettDunn on X, and confirmed by the intelligence firm source. 

He is expected to remain in the UK pending a further court-mandated appearance in August.
Dunn is alleged to have exploited admin keys to the protocol and was able to siphon roughly $2 million in funds from newly launched memecoins over a period of approximately 100 minutes last week, then randomly airdropping the proceeds to Solana users.
The team then redeployed the smart contracts under new admin privileges to restore safe access, according to the site’s official X account, and has pledged to compensate adversely affected users, while pursuing the perpetrator.

dogwifhat [WIF] sees $1M in long liquidations as price tumbles: What now? - AMBCrypto



WIF witnessed a massive decline in price over the last few days, causing a surge in long liquidations.
Market sentiment fell, while other cryptocurrencies gained.

Dogwifhat [WIF] has been the darling memecoin for the cryptocurrency sector since quite some time. With a large number of investors backing up the memecoin, the token witnessed massive growth.
Traders take a hit
However, due to recent price fluctuations, traders have suffered significantly when it has come to WIF’s price action.
Over the last 24 hours, more than $1 million worth of long positions have been liquidated. This has occurred due to the significant price decline that WIF saw during this period.
The price of the memecoin fell by 7.26% and was trading at $2.59 at the time of writing.
This decline wasn’t a momentary correction and was part of a larger trend. Since the beginning of May, the price of WIF had declined.
During this period, the token showcased multiple lows and lower highs, indicative of a bearish trend.
The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) also fell significantly during this period, implying that the overall flow of money into the token declined.
Coupled with that, the RSI (Relative Strength Index)also fell, indicating that the bullish momentum around WIF had waned materially.
If WIF’s price continues to face this kind of selling pressure, it could move past the $2.4794 level soon.

Looking at the Social Volume
Due to this decline in price, traders had turned skeptical. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Coinglass’ data indicated that the percentage of short positions taken by the bears had increased to 52% over the last few days.
The overall sentiment of the traders could further drive down WIF’s price going forward.
Also, AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that Social Volume around WIF had declined significantly. This meant that the number of negative comments around the token had surged.
The declining Social Volume coupled with the declining Weighted Sentiment can add significantly high amounts of selling pressure.

What could add insult to injury for holders would be the overall state of the memecoin sector. Over the past week, WIF’s competitors, DOGE, SHIB and FLOKI have seen a positive surge in price.
If this trend continues, WIF could lose significant market share.

DOGE or SHIB? We asked ChatGPT-4o which asset is a better buy for summer 2024


As we approach the summer of 2024, investors are keenly evaluating potential opportunities within the cryptocurrency market, particularly with popular meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).
Both of these digital assets have captured significant attention due to their vibrant communities, substantial volatility, and developmental trajectories. However, the current market conditions leave investors wondering which of these two meme coins will perform better.
To address this question, Finbold asked ChatGPT-4o which meme coin, Shiba Inu or Dogecoin, is poised to be the best performer.


We used the following prompt with ChatGPT-4 to get the recommendation:

“Which meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB), is better for investment in the summer of 2024, considering each coin’s attributes (e.g., year-to-date performance, volatility, development activity, community support, market trends, potential for growth, and overall stability)? I want the objectively best option for potential short-term gains and long-term value with higher scores for these attributes. Justify your answer“

ChatGPT-4o:Shiba Inu (SHIB) emerges as the better investment option for the summer of 2024
ChatGPT-4o named SHIB as the better investment option for summer.
Notably, it highlighted SHIB’s ongoing development activities and optimistic market trends, suggesting it is building a robust ecosystem with multiple use cases, enhancing its long-term viability. 
The strong community support for SHIB, combined with potential price surges, makes it an attractive investment. Despite the volatility, the active development and positive projections for SHIB indicate higher scores across key attributes, making it a better option for investors seeking substantial returns.

As of now, DOGE is trading at $0.1518 with a year-to-date (YTD) increase of 67%, while SHIB is priced at $0.00002407, showing a YTD growth of 132%. 
DOGE might be the better option for investors seeking relative stability and potential short-term gains driven by social media hype and endorsements, as its higher liquidity and market cap provide a cushion against extreme volatility.
On the other hand, SHIB could be more attractive for those looking for higher potential returns and long-term value.
Diversifying investments between both assets could also be a prudent strategy to mitigate risks and capitalize on the strengths of each coin.
Balancing the stability and immediate appeal of DOGE with the promising growth potential of SHIB can help create a well-rounded and resilient cryptocurrency portfolio for the summer of 2024 and beyond.

Bitcoin Selling Pressure Subsides as Demand Stabilizes: CryptoQuant


																The price of bitcoin (BTC) has surged past the $60,000 level to the $67,000 zone due to news of a lower-than-expected inflation rate in the United States.
According to the latest CryptoQuant weekly report, bitcoin’s latest rally has also been sustained by a recent decline in selling pressure. However, demand for the cryptocurrency has yet to pick up.
Bitcoin Selling Pressure Declines
The fall in BTC selling pressure can be seen in the on-chain activity of short-term holders and the balances on over-the-counter (OTC) desks.
The BTC balance on OTC desks has stabilized since late April, indicating less bitcoin supply from market participants. The balance on OTC desks began to rise by 60,000 BTC on March 10 when the asset hit an all-time high of $73,000; however, it has been flat since late last month.
Similarly, the profit margins of short-term BTC holders are currently at low or negative levels following high margins that triggered high selling pressure in early March. Since they have depleted all profits accumulated in 2024, traders are now faced with unrealized losses on the positions. Historically, this has coincided with a local bottom in prices.




The possibility that the market has bottomed is substantiated by miners’ low profitability. CryptoQuant analysts said Bitcoin miners are extremely underpaid at the moment, and their profitability has plummeted to levels last seen since March 2020, a few days after the COVID market crash. Historically, extremely low miner profitability has been associated with price bottoms.
Demand is Yet to Pick Up
On the other hand, Bitcoin demand growth appears to be stabilizing following a month of deceleration. The rise in the BTC balances of permanent holders and large investors indicates higher demand from these market participants.
Nonetheless, BTC demand would need to surge further to enable the market to sustain the latest price rally. The demand could come from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market and other Bitcoin investment funds.
Per CryptoQuant analysts, the crypto market needs a new wave of spot Bitcoin ETF purchases to refresh demand growth. Demand for these products appears to be picking up already, with the funds seeing total inflows of more than $560 million in the last two trading days.
Additionally, stablecoin liquidity growth is surging, signaling potential movement to the upside for BTC.

Half Trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 24 Hours: Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Hiding Something?

Shiba Inu saw another surge of activity in the market over the last 24 hours. Various entities, including whales and exchanges, have been actively moving their SHIB holdings, pushing the number of whale-tier transactions up. Here's a breakdown of these transactions and the potential reasons behind them.Recent data highlights significant movement within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. For instance, a Robinhood hot wallet transferred 45.01 billion SHIB (valued at approximately $1.13 million) to another Robinhood wallet. Additionally, a Symbolic Capital Partners MEV Bot executed multiple transactions, each involving around 50 billion SHIB, with values ranging from $1.23 million to $1.26 million per transaction. Uniswap also saw notable volume, with transactions like 50.8 billion SHIB ($1.26 million) and 50.4 billion SHIB ($1.23 million) being recorded.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThis heightened activity correlates with the on-chain data, revealing that in the last 24 hours, there were 86 large transactions, totaling approximately 1.14 trillion SHIB. This surge marks a significant increase from the seven-day low of 14 transactions and the seven-day high of 378 transactions. Similarly, the volume of these large transactions reached 1.14 trillion SHIB in the past 24 hours, compared to the seven-day high of 9.6 trillion SHIB and the seven-day low of 415.2 billion SHIB.SHIB has been trading within a symmetrical triangle pattern, suggesting indecision in the market. The recent uptick in whale transactions and large transfer volumes may indicate an impending breakout or a significant price movement. However, SHIB's price has been relatively stable, fluctuating around the $0.00002450 mark, with resistance at $0.000025 and support at $0.00002234.Considering the lack of volatility on the Shiba Inu market, the most likely reason behind those transfers is whales and institutional investors repositioning their portfolios, or exchanges might be preparing for upcoming market events.

This Week Spotlight: Solana, LINK Outshine as Bitcoin Stabilizes at $67K - Coin Edition


							

Bitcoin reclaims the $67K threshold following the U.S. CPI report for April.
Solana, LINK, and FTM registered double-digit percentage growth this week.
However, WIF and TON experienced the most significant drop among the larger-cap altcoins.




The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a relatively calm period, with Bitcoin (BTC) consolidating around the $67,000 mark. After a brief dip to $60,000 last Friday, the premier digital asset has shown resilience, bouncing back significantly following the U.S. CPI announcement for April.









Bitcoin’s journey saw it climb to over $63,000 at the start of the week, only to experience a minor pullback to $61,200 prior to the CPI data release. However, the figures acted as a catalyst, propelling BTC to a high of over $66,500, a price point not seen since mid-April. 



Although there was a slight retracement, the bulls maintained their momentum, nearly touching $67,500. Currently, Bitcoin’s market cap stands at $1.320 trillion, commanding a 51.7% dominance over altcoins.



Amid Bitcoin’s movement, certain altcoins have made impressive strides over the week. Solana (SOL) has surged by 18.85%, reaching a multi-week peak above $175.78. Similarly, Chainlink (LINK) has witnessed a 23% increase, approaching $16.79. 







Other notable weekly gainers among the most prominent assets include Avalanche (AVAX), which has registered a 15% growth, having reclaimed $37.73. Also, NEAR and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) recorded a 13% gain, while Fantom (FTM) saw a more substantial 23% uptick.



On the flip side, Dogwifhat (WIF) has experienced the most significant drop among the larger-cap altcoins, shedding over 14.47% of its value over the past week. Likewise, Toncoin (TON) saw a comparable loss of 9% in its one-week trajectory. BNB, Optimism (OP),  and Tron (TRX) have also seen marginal losses.

AntPool's 7-Block Streak Fuels Bitcoin Mining Centralization Fears


Concerns about Bitcoin mining centralization have resurfaced following a notable event involving AntPool, the second-largest BTC mining pool
On May 17, AntPool mined seven consecutive blocks between block heights 843,893 and 843,904 in one hour and thirty-eight minutes.
AntPool Mines 7 Consecutive Blocks

During this period, the mining pool confirmed over 20,000 transactions and earned 23 BTC—21.875 BTC in mining rewards and 1.283 BTC in fees.

This impressive streak caught the crypto community’s attention, highlighting the prevalence of dominant pools like AntPool and Foundry USA. These two mining pools control over 50% of Bitcoin’s hashrate, raising centralization concerns. For context, Foundry USA mined the block before AntPool’s streak and the two blocks immediately after, resulting in ten consecutive blocks mined by these two pools in one day.

Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr has previously warned about the risks posed by the dominance of large mining pools. He argues that such centralization threatens Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, potentially leading to censorship and control issues. Crypto analyst TOBTC also shared similar concerns.

“This centralization trend, driven by economies of scale, allows these pools to censor transactions, as seen with F2Pool’s compliance with OFAC sanctions. Such power concentration poses an existential threat to Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and its foundational principle of trustlessness,” TOBTC remarked.


Meanwhile, these pools’ dominance is considerably unsurprising, as the current economic realities make it challenging for smaller miners to compete. Banking giant JPMorgan reportedly stated that the current hashrate and power consumption on the BTC network had pushed the average mining cost to about $45,000.
Moreover, the recent regulatory scrutiny will likely intensify the pressure on Bitcoin miners. Bitcoin mining is now viewed as a national security issue in the US. President Joe Biden recently ordered Chinese-backed MineOne Partners Ltd. to halt construction of a crypto mine in Wyoming and sell the property.

Meanwhile, other countries are concerned about energy consumption. Venezuelan authorities recently announced plans to disconnect all crypto mining farms from their energy grid. Similarly, The Norwegian government is also focused on regulating data centers and curbing its energy use for Bitcoin mining.

As Bitcoin (BTC) experiences a period of price pause, Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, has made a public declaration that has resonated throughout the cryptocurrency community. His message is simple and direct: "Bet on Bitcoin."Saylor's statement comes at a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. After significant price movements, the world's biggest cryptocurrency is seeing unusual calm.In a recent tweet, Saylor reinforced his unwavering confidence in Bitcoin, saying to "bet" on the digital asset despite the current price pause. This bold proclamation is not out of character for Saylor, who has consistently championed Bitcoin as a superior store of value and a hedge against inflation. MicroStrategy, under Saylor's leadership, has been at the forefront of corporate investment in Bitcoin. The company's aggressive acquisition strategy has seen it amass a substantial Bitcoin portfolio, making it one of the largest institutional holders of the cryptocurrency. Saylor's latest message "Bet on Bitcoin" might be a reaffirmation of his belief in Bitcoin's long-term potential.The timing of Saylor's statement is noteworthy as it coincides with a broader market sentiment that is cautiously optimistic.On Friday, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month, as bulls emerged after eight weeks of sideways to lower movement. Following this feat, the Bitcoin price has shown relatively little movement, failing to reach $68,000 as bulls take a little respite.Bitcoin was trading up 0.06% in the last 24 hours to $67,007, having reached intraday highs of $67,701. Bitcoin is still up 10% over the last seven days. As the market watches and waits for Bitcoin's next move, Saylor's voice serves as a bullish counterweight, encouraging crypto holders to remain firm in their beliefs.

Bitcoin’s price has increased by more than 10% in the last seven days. 
BTC was testing resistance, and a breakout could start another bull rally. 

Bitcoin [BTC] surprised investors last week as its price rallied by double digits. The trend sparked excitement in the market as expectations of BTC reclaiming $70k increased. 
In fact, if the latest data is to be considered, this possibility doesn’t seem to be a long shot. 
Bitcoin to repeat history?
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that BTC’s price rallied by more than 10% in the last seven days, allowing it to sit above $67k.
 At the time of writing, the king of cryptos was trading at $67,115.81 with a market capitalization of over $1.32 trillion. 
While BTC’s price action favored the bulls, Titan of Crypto, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development. 
As per the tweet, BTC was targeting the upper line of its realized price. If this translates into reality, then investors might witness BTC run above $100k in the coming weeks. 
The possibility of that happening was likely, as similar episodes happened in the past. To be precise, Bitcoin has touched the upper line of its realized price during each and every cycle in the past. 
Things in terms of on-chain metrics also looked pretty optimistic for Bitcoin. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed BTC’s net deposit on exchanges was dropping, hinting at low selling pressure. 
Its MPI was green, meaning that miners were selling fewer holdings compared to its one-year average. However, at press time, BTC’s aSORP was red, suggesting that more investors were selling at a profit. 
In the middle of a bull market, it can indicate a market top.

What to expect in the short term?
Apart from aSORP, a few other metrics also raised red flags. For instance, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Glassnode’s data revealed that BTC’s accumulation trend score had a value of 0.0107. 
The accumulation trend score is an indicator that reflects the relative size of entities that are actively accumulating coins on-chain in terms of their BTC holdings.
 A value closer to 0 means that investors are distributing or not accumulating BTC.

Apart from this, BTC’s fear and greed index had a value of 72. This meant that the market was in a “greed” phase, which often results in price corrections. 
So, AMBCrypto analyzed BTC’s daily chart to see which direction it was headed in the short-term. We found that BTC was testing its resistance at the $67.3k mark at press time. 
Likewise, its price remained above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

Additionally, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick, suggesting that BTC might flip its resistance into its support. If that happens, then things will remain bullish in the near term. 
Nonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) went southward, hinting at a price correction soon.

This crypto whale lost $300K in 2 days trading PEPE


The meme coin boom in 2024 has attracted greedy speculators looking for quick gains in a player-vs-player trading landscape. Despite some successful stories that made it to the spotlight, most traders have accrued losses—as with a PEPE whale who lost over $300,000 in the last two days.
In particular, data by SpotOnChain estimates this cryptocurrency whale has lost $188,000 in a 15-day $15.10 million trade. As suggested by on-chain activity, the whale started trading PEPE on May 4 with a $2.68 million purchase.
On May 5, the trader bought another stack of PEPE worth $7.754 million. Later, the multisig wallet likely sold it all on May 7 for $10.557 million and a $123,000 profit.


PEPE whale FOMO and realize losses
However, the ‘Fear of Missing Out’ (FOMO) dominated the whale, as PEPE pumped in a meme coin mania comeback. Thus, the trader purchased $4.853 million worth of tokens on May 16 to sell two days later with losses.
On May 18, the whale deposited all its PEPE tokens on Binance at an estimated value of $4.542 million. This last trading activity resulted in losses of $311,000, overcoming the previous profits.

Known cryptocurrency influencers wonder whether the meme coin mania is finally over.

Meme coins and the greater fool theory
In conclusion, the trader’s unfortunate loss serves as a cautionary tale for those considering investing in meme coins. The risks associated with trading these highly volatile and speculative cryptocurrencies cannot be overstated.
Meme coins, such as PEPE, often lack fundamental value and are driven by hype and social media buzz. Traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.
This mentality aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a “greater fool.”
However, this theory also highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down, and demand dwindles, traders can be left holding worthless assets, leading to substantial financial losses.
The story of this trader’s misfortune should serve as a reminder to approach meme coin investments cautiously. It is crucial to conduct thorough research, understand the risks involved, and never invest more than one can afford to lose.

One of the Largest Cryptocurrency Exchanges Responds to "Tether (USDT) Will Be Delisted" Claim - Bitcoin Sistemi


Kraken, the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, announced that it will continue to list Tether (USDT) on the European market despite regulatory uncertainties.
The announcement comes in response to recent news suggesting that Kraken may cancel its support for USDT in the EU region in line with upcoming EU CryptoAsset Markets (MiCA) rules.


Mark Greenberg, Kraken's Global Head of Asset Growth and Management, clarified the company's stance in a statement:

“Let's be clear: Kraken continues to list USDT in Europe and we have no plans to delist at this time. We know our European customers value access to USDT and we continue to evaluate all options to offer USDT in the upcoming system.”


Greenberg emphasized that Kraken will comply with all legal requirements, even those it disagrees with, but the rules are not yet finalized. “We continue to do everything we can to continue offering all relevant stablecoins to our European customers,” he added.





This announcement follows OKX's decision in March to delist most of its USDT trading pairs in the EU.

Analyst Says Markets ‘100% Underestimating’ Odds of Ethereum ETF Approval, Warns Top for Memecoins in Sight - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst thinks that market participants are too pessimistic about the odds that regulators will green-light a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Psycho tells his 501,800 followers on the social media platform X that people are not bullish enough on ETH right now.










“Markets 100% underestimating odds of an ETH ETF.
It’s also underestimating the price impact it’ll have.
Buying ETH under $3,000 pre-ETF will eventually be an obvious hindsight trade. Just like how it’s now obvious you should have bought Bitcoin pre-ETF.” 
Data from the Ethereum-based prediction market platform Polymarket shows that only 13% of traders believe that an ETH ETF will be approved by the end of the month.
Looking at the broader digital asset market, Altcoin Psycho thinks that market participants will eventually rotate their capital to blue-chip crypto projects at the expense of memecoins.
“At some point all this scattered attention will narrow via a flight to quality, which also means a memecoin sell-off. I don’t think the cycle top is in but I think the memecoin top is not far away. Memecoins are a gateway drug not the end game, study past cycles if you disagree.” 
As for the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) sector, the analyst says that while many are calling for the AI bubble to burst, he thinks it’s still in its earlier stages and set to become one of the biggest speculative manias ever seen.
“Most say the AI bubble will soon burst, I’ll be the contrarian and say the bubble’s just starting.
It’s my highest conviction take since saying SOL at $15 was a must-buy…
99% of AI startups will fail. When this happens, naysayers will prematurely claim victory. But once the dust settles, the surviving 1% will be so valuable that they’ll alone carry the bubble beyond any other bubble we’ve seen.”

Crypto Hiring: Eclipse Labs names new leader in week of CEO updates - Blockworks


Two crypto companies named new CEOs this week. What some would consider an anti-crypto firm did too.
Vijay Chetty replaced Neel Somani as Eclipse Labs’ chief executive, the company said in a Wednesday X post.
Chetty had been the blockchain startup’s chief growth officer for the last year or so. He previously held leadership roles at Uniswap Labs, dYdX Trading and Ripple Labs.
His promotion came after sexual misconduct allegations surfaced against Somani — claims the now-former CEO called “false.”
Hack VC, which co-led a $50 million Series A funding round for Eclipse Labs in March, said Somani’s alleged behavior was “unacceptable.”

“Since learning about the allegations, we [have] worked hard with other investors and the team to correct the situation, including urging Neel to resign, and we are pleased to see that happen,” Hack VC added.

A second CEO development this week is a temporary appointment. 
Bitcoin miner Bitfarms on Monday named co-founder Nicolas Bonta the company’s interim president and CEO while an executive search continues. The switch happened the same day that Bitfarms ousted Geoffrey Morphy from the CEO post.
The mining company had said in March that Morphy would be leaving the role only after his replacement was found. That transition was accelerated after Morphy last week filed a statement of claim against Bitfarms in the Superior Court of Ontario.
Morphy is claiming $27 million worth of damages for alleged breach of contract and wrongful dismissal. Bitfarms said the claims are “without merit,” noting the company “intends to defend itself vigorously.” 
A third CEO update came from a company nobody would call crypto-focused. 
Vanguard, a fund giant with more than $8 trillion assets under management, named the former head of BlackRock’s ETF business as its incoming CEO. Salim Ramji will fill the role in July, replacing the retiring Tim Buckley.  
Why might this be notable from a crypto standpoint?
Well, Ramji helped the world’s largest asset manager launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) — a fund that, in four months on the market, has grown to roughly $18 billion in assets. 
BlackRock’s spot bitcoin fund launch reflected an effort to “help investors gain access to parts of the market that otherwise have been more difficult or really expensive or opaque for them to access otherwise,” Ramji said in a July 2023 interview on Bloomberg TV. 
Read more: Yes, Vanguard’s new CEO supported BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF launch
He now leads a company that has called crypto’s investment case “weak.” Vanguard also does not allow users of its brokerage platform to buy and trade bitcoin ETFs.  
Some expect the hire could spark a change in Vanguard’s attitude toward the space, even if gradual.
Ramji signaled in an interview with Barron’s this week that he may not push a change, noting “it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer.”
But never say never, as the adage goes.
“Eventually…Vanguard will indeed offer bitcoin ETFs,” Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Blockworks. “From a purely business perspective, it’s foolish not to. And Salim is not foolish.”
Other notable hiring news

Jack Melnick, who left Polygon Labs last week, joined layer-1 Berachain. His title — head of DeFi — remained the same.    
Luc Froehlich, who formerly led the digital assets unit at Fidelity International, is now chief commercial officer of decentralized credit intelligence platform Synnax.
Ava Labs marketing executive Jay Kurahashi-Sofue said Friday he would be leaving the company after four years there. His next role was not immediately clear.  
Noah Levine is set to help lead Visa’s on-chain analytics efforts as a crypto analyst. He was previously a data and analytics lead at RTFKT.
Crypto-focused lawyers Lewis Rinaudo Cohen, Gregory Strong and Sarah Chen joined Cahill Gordon & Reindel as partners of its digital assets and emerging technology practice.

Unexpected Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Ban Comes from a Country Struggling with US Sanctions - Bitcoin Sistemi

Venezuela has announced plans to disconnect all Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining facilities from the national electricity system in order to control energy demand.
The Ministry of Electric Energy (MPPPE) announced the initiative on Friday, which includes a plan to monitor high energy users participating in this activity.


“The goal is to disconnect all cryptocurrency mining facilities in the country from the National Electricity System (SEN), preventing the high impact on demand and thus enabling us to continue providing an efficient and reliable service to all Venezuelan people,” MPPPE said in a statement on its Instagram account. said.
The measures were announced after at least 2,000 cryptocurrency mining machines were seized on Thursday in Maracay, Aragua state, about 120 kilometers southwest of Caracas.





According to local media reports, this action is linked to an anti-corruption operation launched by the Venezuelan government last year, which resulted in the arrest of dozens of officials from Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the National Inspectorate of Cryptocurrencies (Sunacrip) and other state institutions.
Since last year, Sunacrip has been under the control of a restructured board following the arrest of Chief Inspector Joselit Ramírez, who was linked to former Oil Minister and former PDVSA President Tareck El Aissami. El Aissami's arrest was announced by the prosecutor's office early last month.



El Aissami was accused of “treason, seizure of public property, verification of relationships or influence, money laundering and organization.”
Carabobo state governor Rafael Lacava stated that they restricted cryptocurrency facilities, which he said consumed a significant amount of megawatts, which led to power outages.





There has been an electricity crisis in Venezuela since 2009. Due to major outages in 2019, many cities were left without electricity for seven days.

Solana Leads with 91M Daily Transactions, Surpasses Ethereum: CoinGecko Report


                        
                            Solana Leads with 91M Daily Transactions, Surpasses Ethereum: CoinGecko Report

                        Solana has proven to be the fastest among large blockchains, processing a staggering 91 million transactions in a single day.According to a recent update by CoinGecko, on April 6, Solana achieved a record-breaking daily average of 1,504 transactions per second (TPS) during the memecoin frenzy.This makes the blockchain an impressive 46 times faster than Ethereum and over 5 times faster than Polygon, which boasts the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.Solana Achieves 1.6% of Maximum Speed
Despite its position as the fastest blockchain, Solana has only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS.The surge in the number of transactions has led to network congestion, raising questions about how quickly Solana can achieve higher real TPS after implementing its upcoming upgrades.The second-fastest blockchain identified in the report is Sui, another non-EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) platform.Sui recorded its highest real TPS of 854 in July 2023, driven by the popularity of the on-chain game Sui 8192.Other notable non-EVM blockchains include TON with 175 TPS and Near Protocol with 118 TPS.On the lower end of the spectrum, Aptos registered 49 TPS, Starknet had 12 TPS, Bitcoin achieved 11 TPS, and Thorchain recorded 2 TPS.When comparing the non-EVM blockchains to the EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains, the former outperformed the latter with an average peak TPS of 284, while the 17 largest EVM-based blockchains had an average of just 74 TPS.Binance Smart Chain (BSC) stood out as the fastest among the EVM blockchains, reaching a real TPS of 378 on December 7, 2023, driven by increased on-chain activity.Polygon, the leading Ethereum scaling solution, achieved 190 TPS on November 16, 2023, making it 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself.Ethereum Layer 2 Solutions Yet to Exceed Layer 1 Blockchains
The report indicates that Ethereum scaling solutions and layer 2 solutions have yet to surpass other layer 1 blockchains in terms of real processing speed.This may be attributed to the lower number of on-chain transactions on Ethereum scaling solutions, resulting in slower realized TPS for these blockchains.In total, Ethereum and its ten largest scaling solutions achieved a combined real TPS of 500, surpassing BSC but still trailing behind Solana and Sui.Other scaling solutions that outpaced Ethereum in terms of TPS include Arbitrum (59 TPS), Linea (56 TPS), Base (37 TPS), and Mantle (25 TPS).Over the past year, 24 out of the 25 blockchains analyzed experienced their highest real TPS, with activity levels reaching new heights.This surge can be attributed to the rise of inscriptions and memecoin speculation, which have fueled increased on-chain activity.As reported, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed the launch of over 1 million new tokens since the beginning of April.Ethereum and Solana, in particular, have been at the forefront of this token frenzy, with Ethereum hosting over 370,000 new tokens and Solana boasting an impressive 640,000 new tokens, mostly consisting of memecoins.

Will Washington Wreck Or Welcome Crypto? Looming Vote Holds Bitcoin's Fate


								With Bitcoin rocketing in value and Wall Street circling like a hawk, the US crypto industry is holding its breath as a crucial vote approaches in Washington next week. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or Fit21, could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets, potentially welcoming the industry into the fold or slamming the brakes on its recent growth spurt.

Fit21: A Lifeline Or A Leash?
Fit21 proposes a major shift in how the US government handles digital currencies. Currently, the regulatory landscape is fragmented, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) both having a say.
Fit21 would establish the CFTC as the primary regulator for crypto, giving the industry a clearer picture of the rules it needs to follow. The bill would also set up guardrails to protect consumers from risky behavior and establish protocols for how these assets are held and treated in bankruptcy proceedings.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView
The bicoin industry has thrown its weight behind Fit21, calling it “crucial” for the future of the US digital asset market. The lack of clear regulations has been a major sticking point for the industry, with some companies even threatening to abandon the US altogether.
The Crypto Council for Innovation worries that the US is falling behind other countries in embracing bitcoin innovation. In an open letter to lawmakers, it argued:

“By passing this legislation, we can accelerate the growth of blockchain technology and digital assets, fostering financial inclusion and protecting national security.”

Wall Street Enters The Crypto Fray
Adding another layer of intrigue to the upcoming vote is the recent entry of Wall Street giants into the crypto space. The approval of a wave of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January has opened the door for Wall Street to get a piece of the crypto pie.
These ETFs allow traditional investors to invest in Bitcoin without having to directly buy and hold the cryptocurrency themselves. The potential for hefty fees associated with custody of these ETFs has some industry observers worried that Wall Street’s involvement could stifle innovation.

Will Bitcoin Find A Home In The US?
With the price of Bitcoin on the rise and pressure mounting from both the digital asset industry and Wall Street, the upcoming vote on Fit21 is a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies in the US. If passed, the bill could usher in a new era of regulatory clarity and foster the growth of the industry.

However, if the bill is defeated, the future of crypto in the US remains uncertain, potentially leading to an exodus of crypto companies and hampering innovation. With 10 days left until the vote, all eyes are on Washington as lawmakers decide whether to welcome crypto with open arms or keep it at bay.

New bitcoin addresses at multi-year lows: What's behind the decline?


Bitcoin (BTC) network activity has shown a significant downward trend in the creation of new addresses, reaching its lowest level since July 2018. 
Data from market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock reveals a 7-day average of only 276,000 new addresses. This decline suggests fewer new investors are entering the cryptocurrency space.
The “New Addresses” indicator monitors the daily creation of new addresses on the BTC network. When this metric is high, it typically indicates an influx of new investors.

However, returning investors and holders creating multiple wallets for privacy can also increase this number. Overall, these factors contribute to some level of adoption, suggesting that a high number of new addresses can be a long-term bullish signal for Bitcoin
Decline in new addresses: Analyzing the causes
The recent approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has offered investors a new way to gain exposure to Bitcoin. 
These ETFs provide a more traditional investment route, potentially drawing interest away from on-chain Bitcoin transactions and, hence, could cause the observed decline in new addresses.
The high transaction fees that followed the excitement around Runes caused a significant drop in active addresses, with the 7-day moving average falling below 700,000 for the first time since March 2020.  Although fees have stabilized, with the average fee dropping from $31.4 on April 23 to $2.97 on May 18, the number of active addresses remains low.
Broader market slowdown

The broader cryptocurrency market slowdown could also be contributing to the decline. 
Lower network activity, indicated by a multi-year low in the 30-day active address count, suggests reduced demand for Bitcoin transactions. This metric, which tracks distinct addresses participating in transactions over 30 days, dropped to 12.64 million, a level last seen in February 2019.
The decrease in new Bitcoin addresses and overall network activity raises questions about the health and demand of the Bitcoin market.
While high network activity typically correlates with increased demand and price stability, the current decline could indicate a shift in investor behavior, possibly towards derivatives speculation rather than organic use.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $66,897 with daily gain of 0.27%, while on the weekly chart, BTC is up almost 10%.

The decline in new Bitcoin addresses reflects a complex interplay of factors, including the introduction of spot ETFs, transaction fee dynamics, and broader market trends. 
Understanding these elements is crucial for interpreting the current state and future direction of Bitcoin’s market demand.
While the lower number of new addresses might suggest reduced interest, it also highlights evolving investment behaviors and the ongoing impact of transaction fees and market conditions on the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

We asked ChatGPT-4o what will be Cardano price at the end of 2024; Here's what it said


Decentralized finance (DeFi) project Cardano (ADA) has seen an uptick in whale activity that has surged at least tenfold. Indeed, the increase in whale activity can potentially influence ADA’s price trajectory.
In this context, ChatGPT-4o, OpenAI’s advanced and recent artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot model, has offered insights into how ADA is likely to trade by the end of 2024. The chatbot is more accurate, faster, and cost-effective than other models.
The tool provided both conservative and optimistic price estimates. ChatGPT-4o suggested that if the general crypto market experiences steady but moderate growth, the ADA price could range between $1 and $2 by the end of 2024.


On the other hand, the AI platform offered a more optimistic scenario in which, if positive trends and significant developments occur, ADA could potentially climb higher, reaching between $2 and $5. Indeed, if ADA hits $5, the price movement will represent an increase of over 1,000% from the current valuation.

Factors influencing ADA’s price 
ChatGPT-4o also highlighted several factors likely to impact ADA’s price. The tool acknowledged that increased holdings by whales suggest strong confidence in ADA. This scenario potentially indicates a bullish outlook due to higher demand from large investors.
At the same time, positive developments, such as institutional adoptions or technological advancements within Cardano, could drive prices higher, while negative news could have the opposite effect.
According to the tool, continued network development, enhanced smart contract capabilities, and achieving key milestones will likely positively influence ADA’s value. Notably, recent data from Cardano developer IOHK, released on May 17, reveals ongoing growth in several metrics. The number of smart contracts on the network has reached 46,060, with 171 projects launched.

The AI model also noted that ADA investors should be on the lookout for regulatory changes, broader economic conditions, such as global stability, interest rates, and market liquidity.
ADA price analysis 
Currently, ADA continues to trade below the $0.50 resistance zone, and reaching the $1 level would be significant for the asset’s growth. Notably, whales have aggressively accumulated ADA tokens at this level. 
Beyond the factors highlighted by the AI tool, Cardano will likely benefit from increased exposure. For instance, reports suggest that crypto exchange Gemini might be planning to list ADA.
At the time of reporting, ADA was trading at $0.47, having faced a short-term correction of 1.51% in 24 hours. However, the token remains bullish on the weekly timeframe, having rallied over 6%.

Overall, ADA bulls have significant work ahead to move the token away from the consolidation below $1.

Majority of Binance-Listed Tokens Decline Within 6 Months


More than 80% of the tokens listed on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, have dropped in value since their listing over the past six months.
Crypto researcher Flow reported that many of Binance’s new listings are tokens supported by top-tier venture capital firms and introduced at high valuations.
Binance Listing Now Provides ‘Exit Liquidity’ For VCs

According to Flow, only 5 out of 31 selected tokens on Binance have seen price increases since their launch. These tokens—ORDI, JUP, WIF, JTO, and MEME—are primarily meme coins or projects without major venture capital backing.
Over the past six months, these tokens have surged individually by over 50%. Specifically, ORDI rose by approximately 262%, JTO increased by 62%, and JUP by 58%. WIF and MEME also saw gains of more than 117% and 8.5%, respectively.
Conversely, tokens backed by top VCs have performed poorly. Binance Labs’ NFP token, Pantera Capital-backed OMNI, and AEVO, supported by VCs including Coinbase, Paradigm, and Dragonfly, have plummeted by about 63%, 52%, and 68%, respectively.

“If you held a portfolio where you would invest an equal amount at each new Binance listing, you would be down over 18% in the past 6 months,” Flow stated.

Flow furthered that many of these projects launch at high fully diluted values (FDVs). He said an average FDV for a Binance listing could exceed $4.2 billion, sometimes reaching as high as $11 billion with “no real users or a strong community behind” these projects.

Notably, Flow’s finding starkly contrasts last year’s analysis by crypto investor Ren & Heinrich, which found that token prices rose 73% in the first 30 days following their listing on Binance. At the time, Ren & Heinrich suggested that Binance’s emergence as the dominant global crypto exchange gave its token listings much more attention among industry players.

Market experts have explained that Binance’s dominance and high liquidity have made it attractive for insiders to exit their investments in these assets.

“More often than not, tokens launching on Binance are not investment vehicle anymore – all their upside potential are already taken away. Instead, they represent exit liquidity for insiders who capitalize on retail lack of access to quality early investment opportunities,” Flow explained.

Bitcoin soars as exchange withdrawals dip: Further gains for BTC? - AMBCrypto



Despite the massive price surge, BTC withdrawals from exchanges were relatively low.
Activity on the Bitcoin ecosystem continued to decline.

Bitcoin [BTC] has seen an unexpected surge in price over the last few days, which has inspired hope amongst traders and holders. Due to the surge in optimism, addresses have been holding on to your BTC.
Withdrawals decline
A minor withdrawal of Bitcoin occurred yesterday, with 10,000 BTC leaving exchange wallets. The total value of the withdrawn Bitcoin is estimated to be around $630 million.
This strong demand for Bitcoin suggests a potential resurgence of interest in the cryptocurrency market.
Analysts note that the level of consistent demand for Bitcoin hasn’t been this high since late 2020, marking a significant shift in investor sentiment.
Source: X
At press time, BTC was trading at $67,049.74 and its price had declined by 0.74% in the last 24 hours. Most holders of BTC were profitable, as BTC was just $6,000 dollars away from its all-time high.
The velocity at which BTC was trading at had declined. This meant that the frequency at which BTC was trading at had declined.
Even though this can be perceived as a negative sign for BTC, a declining velocity also meant that a lot of addresses were holding onto their Bitcoin and were refusing to sell.
Additionally, the total number of holders of BTC has also surged, indicating that a large number of addresses have accumulated significant amounts of BTC.
Coupled with the rising number of holders, there was an opposite pattern seen in miner holdings. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the supply held by miners had significantly fallen.
This could prove to be positive for BTC in the long run. If miners fail to generate high amounts of fees, it becomes difficult for them to remain profitable.
To keep their business sustainable, they sometimes resort to selling their holdings, which ends up adding selling pressure to BTC.
A lower supply of BTC held by miners means that these sections of holders would have less of an impact on the price of BTC going forward.

Activity on the decline
One of the reasons why miners fail to generate fees is due to inactivity on the network. Over the last few weeks, the number of daily active addresses on the Bitcoin network had fallen.
Coupled with that, the number of NFTs being traded on the network also declined. This suggested a waning interest in Bitcoin’s ecosystem.

'The Dogecoin Explosion Made Something Click In Me:' Veteran Trader Shares Secrets To Turning Pennies Into Millions With Meme Coins - Benzinga

Meme coins, with their wild price swings and internet-fueled frenzy, have become a land of opportunity for some cryptocurrency traders. Millionaire trader Unipcs, also known as the ‘Bonk Guy‘, is a shining example, having amassed significant wealth by riding the surges of these digital assets.In an interview with Benzinga, Bonk Guy offered a rare glimpse into his strategies and insights on the meme coin market, shedding light on the world of high-risk, high-reward crypto investing.Early Recognition And Pattern HuntingHis foray into meme coins predates the rise of popular names like Bonk and Wif. “I’ve been trading meme coins for a very long time,” he says, “and prior to Bonk BONK/USD and Wif WIF/USD existing.”He credits the 2021 Dogecoin DOGE/USD surge and the retail investor movement on WallStreetBets for sparking his interest. “Seeing all the retail buzz around the GME GME/USD short squeeze, the WSB memecoin mania, and the resulting Dogecoin explosion made something click in me,” Bonk Guy explains.He soon noticed a pattern with meme coins and was able to predict which ones were likely to explode, allowing him to invest strategically.The Power Of Community And LiquidityBonk Guy emphasizes the crucial role strong community backing plays in a meme coin’s success. “I make sure there is a strong community because meme coins thrive on strong community,” he states.He thrives on projects with “retarded cult-like believers who think their meme coins will flip Bitcoin BTC/USD, go to 100 billion dollars market cap, and cure world hunger,” he says with a touch of amusement. “The more irrational their passion for their meme coins, the better,” he adds. According to Unipics, this fervent loyalty is crucial for propelling a meme coin towards significant price increases.Liquidity is another key factor. While meme coins offer the potential for explosive growth, they require sufficient trading volume to be readily convertible into cash. “Eventually, for any meme coin to go mainstream it needs liquidity,” Unipics explains. “So, I also pay attention to volume and CEX listings over time.”The Bonk Bet: A Case Study In Meme Coin ManiaUnipics’ sizable investment in Bonk, a Solana SOL/USD based meme coin, serves as a prime example of his approach. While initially skeptical, he was swayed by a combination of factors: the influence of a respected crypto analyst, Bonk’s status as the leading meme coin on Solana, and the potential for Solana’s own price appreciation. Diamond Hands: Riding The RollercoasterMeme coin trading is a wild ride, and Unipics acknowledges the emotional toll it can take. He advocates for a “moon or bust” mentality, where investors write off their holdings and focus solely on reaching their target profit or accepting a complete loss. “Once I buy an asset, I just write it off in my mind,” he explains. “I’m not moved or fazed if it goes to zero. I simply give myself a target and hold until it reaches my target or goes to zero. Nothing else matters.” This approach, he argues, allows for a more detached and less stressful trading experience.Also Read: Before You Trust Another Crypto Guru, Read This Study’s ResultsLooking Ahead: Bonk, Floki, And BeyondBonk Guy remains bullish on Bonk, citing its association with Solana and the potential for further growth.“I’m obviously very bullish on Bonk for reasons I already listed,” he says. “I’m the ‘bonk guy’ for a reason.” He also highlights Floki FLOKI/USD, another meme coin with a strong track record, as an underrated gem. “Besides Bonk, I’m very excited about Floki,” he reveals. “It is my biggest memecoin bag, and I think it is currently the most underrated major memecoin.While Floki launched in 2021, it has outperformed every other major memecoin including PEPE PEPE/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, DOGE, except WIF, this year. “Yet barely anyone talks about it on CT [Crypto Twitter]. I think it will surprise many this year,” he predicts.He also expressed interest in smaller cap meme coins like Lmeow on Ethereum ETH/USD and Linda on Linea chain.For those looking to make substantial profits from meme coins, he advises paying attention to his previous strategies and maintaining a strong, patient mindset.Read Next: Crypto Traders As Socially Valuable As Escorts To Brits, Study FindsImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

OpenAI leadership responds to former employee safety allegations

Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, the CEO and president of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, respectively, recently took to X.com to publicly discuss the recent departure of Jan Leike, arguably the company’s former top safety officer. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Leike was the head of alignment. He resigned his post on May 17 citing irreconcilable differences with the company’s leadership. Source: @janleike on X.com.Among Leike’s allegations was the assertion that “safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products” at OpenAI. It didn’t take long for Brockman and Altman to respond, both taking to X.com within 24 hours of Leike’s post to respond.As for Brockman’s part, he laid out a long and winding post replete with a three-pronged strategy for safety alignment at the company. He began by expressing gratitude for Leike’s work at the company before disputing claims that OpenAI wasn’t focused on safety. Source: @gdb on X.com.“First, we have raised awareness of the risks and opportunities of AGI,” Brockman wrote, pointing out that the company has “called for international governance of AGI before such calls were popular.”“Second, we have been putting in place the foundations needed for safe deployment of increasingly capable systems. Figuring out how to make a new technology safe for the first time isn't easy.”The final prong of Brockman’s lecture was to mention that “the future is going to be harder than the past. We need to keep elevating our safety work to match the stakes of each new model.”He further intimated that the company wasn’t following the big tech prescription of moving fast and breaking things. “As we build in this direction, we're not sure yet when we’ll reach our safety bar for releases, and it’s ok if that pushes out release timelines.”Sam Altman, co founder and CEO, kept his message short but did mention that he’d have more to say on the subject in the coming days:“He's right.” Altman posted, referring to Leike’s comments, adding “we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it.”Related: Reddit shares jump after-hours on OpenAI data-sharing deal

Funding Wrap: Polymarket gets backing from Vitalik Buterin, Founders Fund in $70M raise - Blockworks


This week’s funding was led by the betting platform Polymarket, which disclosed a whopping $70 million raised from two separate rounds. 
The announcement was slightly unusual in that it revealed its Series B raise while also revealing a previously undisclosed Series A round.
The Series A — which raised $25 million — was led by General Catalyst, with Airbnb’s Joe Gebbia and Polychain also participating.
The Series B raised $45 million, and saw participation from Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum (like he needs an introduction at this point though), with Founders Fund leading the round.

In the announcement, which took place earlier this week, Founders Fund partner Joey Krug offered an inside scoop on his company’s interest in the prediction market platform.
“Internally at Founders Fund, we developed a habit of checking Polymarket at times of breaking news. The tangible benefits of using Polymarket as a complement to consuming news on social and mainstream media was obvious. It became clear to us that Polymarket was the winner in this market,” he said.
Trading on Polymarket is prohibited in the US, though anyone can view the forecasts. But the funding announcement does come as the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission proposed a new rule to ban derivatives on election bets (and potentially other events). 
Polymarket does currently allow people to place bets on potential winners of the presidential election. Currently, former President Donald Trump has the lead with 51%. President Joe Biden is a close second at 42%. Roughly $127 million has been placed on potential election winners.

In the distance, a unicorn earns its horn
Decentralized identity project Humanity Protocol announced a $30 million seed round led by Kingsway Capital. The Worldcoin competitor, which uses palm recognition technology instead of iris-scanning software, emerged from stealth back in February. 
The round, announced Wednesday, saw participation from Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com, Hashed and Shima Capital, among others. 
Humanity Protocol previously announced a fundraising round, saying that it received funds from 20 crypto native venture capitalists. 
The raise puts the protocol’s valuation at $1 billion, officially making it a crypto unicorn. 
“As an advocate for true digital property rights, I’m very passionate about ensuring that users’ digital identities remain secure and protected. Traditional proof-of-personhood methods often come with drawbacks, whether they’re too invasive, complicated or cumbersome,” Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu said in a statement.
Other notable funding news

Subquid raised $17.5 million in “recent rounds” that included investments from Hypersphere, Zee Prime, CFG, Lattice and Blockchange.
Param Labs, a gaming platform, raised $7 million round in a round led by Animoca Brands. Delphi Ventures and Cypher Labs participated in the round. 
Zeta Market announced a $5 million round led by Electric Capital.

Ethereum Researcher Justin Drake Has Joined EigenLayer


Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake revealed that he became an advisor to the EigenFoundation, an independent non-profit focused on the restaking protocol EigenLayer.
In an extensive May 19 post on social media platform X, Drake revealed the extent of the relationship with the project and how he plans to operate.
EigenLayer Gets New Advisor

The Ethereum researcher explained that he took the job because he felt he “did too little too late with regard to liquid staking,” and this was “an opportunity to not repeat the mistake with restaking.” So, after an extensive consultation period that exceeded a year, he accepted the new role at EigenLayer. 
His new role would entail focusing on restaking risks, and his default public stance would be critical of EigenLayer. However, he promised to make his criticism constructive and advocate for mitigating risks like the erosion of solo validators and the intersubjective overloading of Ethereum consensus.
Drake also dismissed concerns that EigenLayer might be systematically bribing or corrupting the Ethereum Foundation (EF). He noted that the EF is a large organization with over 300 people, making it unlikely for EigenLayer to influence.

“To my knowledge, three EFers have a formal relationship with EigenLayer entities: one as an early EigenLabs investor and two as recent EigenFoundation advisors. EFers are among the highest integrity people I know, and I don’t see the 1% of EFers formally involved with EigenLayer compromising their morals,” he added.

Meanwhile, his new role offers significant incentives that could run into “millions of dollars of tokens vesting over 3 years.” However, he plans to reinvest these proceeds within the Ethereum ecosystem.
Also, Drake emphasized that his commitment to the EigenLayer advisory role is rooted in its alignment with Ethereum’s interests. Any misalignment, he asserted, would result in the termination of the appointment.


“I pledge to reinject all advisorship proceeds towards worthy projects within the Ethereum ecosystem, either as investments or donations. I also stand ready to end the advisorship at any time, e.g. should EigenLayer go in a direction I deem to be against Ethereum’s interests,” Drake stated.

EigenLayer is a platform that enables users to re-stake their Ethereum to secure third-party networks. DeFiLlama data shows EigenLayer now has over $15 billion worth of total value locked (TVL) in the platform since its launch.

Despite its success, EigenLayer faces strong competition from rivals like Symbiotic, reportedly backed by the co-founders of the Ethereum liquid staking platform Lido.

Tornado Cash verdict has chilling implications for crypto industry

The conviction of Alexey Pertsev, a developer of coin-mixing protocol Tornado Cash, comes from a chilling interpretation of criminal liability likely to have wider ramifications for crypto.The Dutch court’s guilty verdict means Pertsev must now serve a sentence of five years and four months for money laundering through Tornado Cash. This is despite the fact that Pertsev had no direct involvement in the laundering itself.Andrew Balthazor, a litigator with the legal firm Holland and Knight, spoke with Cointelegraph to explain the implications of the verdict.“Mr. Pertsev’s conviction reinforces the views of several governments that software developers who make their software available to the public will be held liable for the foreseeable consequences of the public’s use of that software,” said Balthazor.“Under this theory of liability, it is no defense to disclaim knowledge of a specific criminal act or to point to the software’s technical limitations in preventing its misuse by criminal actors. [...] It is the developer’s responsibility to create mechanisms to reduce or prevent foreseeable criminal use of their software.”When asked if the governments taking that view included the U.S. Balthazor said, “Yes, that appears to be the position of the U.S. as demonstrated by the Tornado Cash indictments brought domestically by the DoJ - [Department of Justice].”This interpretation of liability significantly differs from how most understand it in the traditional sense. Natalia Latka, director of public policy and regulatory affairs at blockchain analysis firm Merkle Science, told Cointelegraph how the theory has progressed over time.“Historically, software developers were seen as neutral creators of tools and platforms, responsible for their technical functionality but not for how those tools were used,” said Latka.“This perspective largely stemmed from the idea that technology itself is neutral, and its use depends on the intentions of the users. This perspective has been shifting, especially with the rise of decentralized networks that challenge traditional regulatory frameworks.”Latka explained that developers “must now consider the legal implications and potential misuse of their creations.”Crypto understands impact of court decisionThe crypto community quickly grasped the importance of Pertsev’s trial, taking to social media to condemn the conviction.Source: Eléonore BlancEléonore Blanc, founder of CryptoCanal — the events firm behind the ETHDam conference in Amsterdam — took to X to discuss the implications of the trial on social media. She conducted a thought experiment to ask whether “Tornado Cash” could not just as easily be “any cryptocurrency of your choice.”Blanc told Cointelegraph why she found the case so concerning.“They’ve systematically disregarded all arguments from the defense,” she said. “As such, you can easily extrapolate and see how this specific court verdict could be interpreted at a larger scale to more use cases in the crypto industry.”Blanc went on to further personalize the ruling on X, stating, “As crypto builders, we are all Alexey. We keep fighting for him, his legacy and the cypherpunk values.”Fewture, another X community member, went on to consider what this model of liability would mean if it were applied outside the world of software development.Source: fewtureBalthazor argued that if community members instinctively knew how dangerous the ruling was for privacy, there would be further ramifications to consider.Risks to immutability and decentralizationThe first and most obvious casualty of the Tornado Cash ruling may be privacy, but this is not the only challenge stemming from the case. The immutability of the blockchain and smart contracts is also at risk.“This theory of liability renders immutable smart contracts highly risky for developers to make available to the public,” said Balthazor.“Reducing risks to developers may require publicly available programs be amendable so that software developers can respond to law enforcement or regulators’ requirements.”“For example, certain stablecoin issuers possess a feature allowing the stablecoin to blacklist blockchain addresses controlled by sanctioned entities. Failing to include such a feature would increase the risk to those issuers of their stablecoins being used by sanctioned entities,” he said.Balhazor concluded that the ruling “increases the risks associated with decentralized projects” because their “decentralized nature may make course corrections difficult due to the consensus needed to make major code or operational changes.”Turning the screwsWith Pertsev receiving such a punitive sentence, it’s understandable if blockchain developers are now nervous about potential legal action. Latka said that “compliance by design” will become “crucial for developers and organizations in the crypto space. This involves integrating regulatory compliance into the design and development process from the outset.”This is because “courts will assess whether developers knowingly created tools for illegal purposes or were willfully blind to their misuse, with evidence of intent or negligence significantly impacting legal outcomes.”But if developers have to sacrifice privacy, immutability and decentralization to protect themselves and make their protocols compliant by design, what will remain of blockchain?

Ethereum Foundation Staff Tied to EigenLayer, Disclosure Prompts Call for Risk Mitigation - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Three Ethereum Foundation staff members disclosed ties with EigenLayer entities, raising concerns over potential conflicts of interest.



Justin Ðrake, a prominent figure, may receive millions of dollars’ worth of tokens over three years as an advisor, sparking debate over transparency and accountability.



Despite affiliations, Ðrake pledges to maintain a critical stance on EigenLayer and advocates for constructive criticism and risk mitigation within the Ethereum community.




Justin Ðrake, a prominent figure within the Ethereum Foundation, revealed that three staff members have established formal ties with EigenLayer entities. 





Among these connections, one staff member served as an early investor in EigenLabs, while two others assumed roles as advisors for EigenFoundation.







The revelation comes amidst growing scrutiny surrounding potential conflicts of interest within the Ethereum ecosystem. With Ethereum being one of the largest and most influential blockchain platforms, any perceived conflicts or improprieties involving its key figures can have far-reaching implications.

Commitment to Transparency and Critical Advocacy





Of particular concern is the possibility of financial incentives influencing decision-making processes within the Ethereum Foundation. Ðrake’s disclosure revealed that he himself may receive millions of dollars worth of tokens over a three-year period as compensation for his advisory role with EigenLayer. While such arrangements are not inherently unusual within the cryptocurrency space, they do raise questions about transparency and accountability, especially when individuals holding influential positions are involved.



In response to these revelations, Ðrake has emphasized his commitment to maintaining transparency and addressing potential conflicts of interest. He asserts that his public stance will remain critical of EigenLayer, despite his formal relationship with the organization. Furthermore, he vows to strive for constructive criticism and advocate for risk mitigation measures within the Ethereum community.



Skepticism persists among some observers regarding the adequacy of these assurances. Critics argue that even with the best intentions, the inherent complexities of navigating personal interests alongside professional responsibilities in the cryptocurrency space can pose significant challenges.

Crypto price prediction: Floki, BitBot, Arweave



                    

                    Cryptocurrency prices did moderately well last week as investors embraced a risk-on sentiment in the financial market. Bitcoin jumped to above $67,000 for the first time in over a month while BitBot continued its token sale, raising millions of dollars. This article focuses on BitBot, Floki, and Arweave.
Arweave price forecast
Arweave is one of the biggest players in the web 3 industry with a market cap of over $3 billion. It is disrupting the online storage industry by providing permanent storage solutions for developers. Developers can also launch smart contracts that handle transactions within seconds using its Warp technology.
Arweave’s price has done well in the past few weeks as it defied the gravity that we have seen in the crypto industry. It jumped to a high of $50 last week, its highest level since January 2022. It has soared by over 1,150% from its lowest point in 2023. Most recently, it has jumped for four straight weeks.
Turning to the weekly chart, we see that the AR token price has been in a strong bull run in the past few weeks. It has remained comfortably above the 50-week and 25-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA).
It is now hovering at $48, its previous highest point this year, meaning that it is forming a double-top pattern, a popular bearish sign. Arweave is also nearing the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level.
Therefore, while Arweave’s token price outlook is bullish, buyers must now move above the crucial resistance level at $49.70. If this happens, the next point to watch will be the 61.8% retracement point at $60.

Floki price prediction
Like Arweave, the price of Floki has defied gravity in the past few weeks. It jumped to a high of $0.0002290 last week, its highest swing since April 2nd. At its highest point this month, the token was up by 105% from its lowest point on April 13th. 
Floki Inu has now pulled back and moved below the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has also remained above the 50-day and 25-day moving averages and the lower side of the Andrews Pitchfork tool. 
Therefore, the outlook for Floki is neutral for now. A break below the pitchfork tool will point to more downside, with the next point to watch being at $0.00018. The alternative is where it rebounds and retests last week’s high of $0.00022.

BitBot analysis
The other notable cryptocurrency is BitBot, which has already raised over $3.5 million from global investors. BitBot is a company that seeks to change the trading industry by leveraging the concepts of technical analysis and artificial intelligence (AI).
It will be a comprehensive trading bot that anyone can use to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The app will be distributed in Telegram, a leading social media platform with over 900 million users globally. 
Unlike other trading bots, BitBot will have several important features. First, it will be a non-custodial bot, meaning that the developers will not have access to your funds. Second, holders of the $BITBOT token will have access to additional staking rewards. Third, these holders will take part in its governance. You can buy the BitBot token here.

PEPE: Profit-taking sparks price fall? Investors in profit reach 92% - AMBCrypto



The meme coin was down by more than 6% in the last 24 hours. 
Market indicators and metrics hinted at a further price decline. 

Pepe [PEPE] had a major setback on the 18th of May as the meme coin price witnessed a steep decline. A check of its metrics pointed out a few possible reasons behind this bearish price action. 
Let’s take a look at the entire picture. 
Are PEPE investors taking profits?
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that PEPE’s price started to decline sharply in the last few hours. Because of that, the meme coin’s daily price dropped by more than 6%.
 At the time of writing, it was trading at $0.000009426 with a market capitalization of over $3.9 billion, making it the 27th largest crypto. 
AMBCrypto’s look at IntoTheBlock’s data revealed a possible reason behind this. We found that over 92% of PEPE investors were in profit. 
This might have motivated investors to sell their holdings, in turn pushing the meme coin’s price down. 
To see whether that was the case, AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data. As per our analysis, the meme coin’s exchange inflow spiked multiple times last week. 
It was interesting to note that after a dip, the meme coin’s Supply on Exchanges started to increase. Meanwhile, its Supply outside of Exchanges started to decline on the 18th of May, signaling a sell-off. 
Moreover, after a sharp rise on the 14th of May, the meme coin’s supply held by top addresses dropped slightly. 
This suggested that a few whales also sold their holdings, possibly causing the meme coin’s price to plummet. 
Source: Santiment
PEPE’s troubles aren’t over 
The dark days might continue for the meme coin, as few other metrics gave away a bearish notion. 
For instance, PEPE’s Social Volume declined sharply over the last week, reflecting a dip in the meme coin’s popularity. On top of that, its Weighted Sentiment also sank over the last few days. 
So, bearish sentiment around the meme coin was high, indicating that investors were expecting its price to go down further. 
Source: Santiment
Like metrics, several market indicators also supported the bears. The meme coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a decline. At press time, the RSI had a value of 58.7.
 Likewise, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also went down, indicating that the chances of the bearish price trend continuing were high. 

Realistic or not, here’s PEPE’s market cap in BTC’s terms   

As per our analysis, PEPE’s price was still well above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
 Therefore, if the price decline continues, the meme coin’s value might drop to its 20-day EMA, which might act as a support.

In July of 2021, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) filed a complaint against insurance company Seeman Holtz for multiple violations of securities laws. The complaint alleges that Seeman Holtz engaged in the sale of unregistered securities after issuing $300 million in promissory notes that were supposedly backed by life settlement policies.
But the OFR says Seeman Holtz used the funds from new investors to pay off older investors to create the illusion of profitability. At the time, Seeman Holtz set up accounts at Wells Fargo that held funds from new and old investors.
According to the lawsuit, Wells Fargo allowed Seeman Holtz to redirect money from new investor accounts to accounts designed to hold old investor funds.
Plaintiffs say that “Wells Fargo knew, or should have known, of the Ponzi scheme and extensive fraud” because the banking titan monitored “both sides of the scheme.”
The lawsuit says the Ponzi scheme fleeced over 1,000 victims, including seniors and investors who lost their entire nest egg after being promised annual returns of as much as 18%.
“Most of the investors in the notes have lost their entire investment which, in some instances, was their life’s savings. Many of the investors have no other income, subsist almost exclusively off Social Security benefits, and are now struggling desperately to find the means to sustain their livelihood.”
The suit is asking Wells Fargo to return all income and fees received from the accounts involved in the scheme on top of interest and other costs.
Wells Fargo has not yet responded to the lawsuit and says it has no comment.

Kraken to keep USDT in the E.U. despite regulatory challenges


Despite regulatory challenges, Kraken, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has no plan to delist Tether’s USD stablecoin (USDT).
On May 19, Mark Greenberg, Global Head of Kraken’s Asset Growth & Management Business, communicated the company’s stance in a post on X amid rumors of a possible delisting. Greenberg recognized the demand for USDT from European customers, saying they would “look at all options” to keep it listed.

However, the cryptocurrency executive warned that the company will follow all legal requirements, which have yet to be defined in Europe. Therefore, delisting USDT is still possible in the near future despite Kraken’s desire to keep it.


Delisting speculations started on May 17, following a Bloomberg report stating Kraken was “actively reviewing” Tether’s status under MiCa rules.
Kraken plans to relist delisted cryptocurrencies from Germany
Recently, Kraken announced a new partnership with DLT Finance for its operations in Germany. As a result, the company removed dozens of cryptocurrencies not supported by its new partner, creating uncertainty for the region.
On that note, Mark Greenberg commented in response to a user, stating they plan to “relist some of these assets soon.”

OKX delisted Tether’s USDT in Europe due to upcoming regulation
In March, crypto exchange OKX delisted Tether’s USDT stablecoin for users in the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA), citing a focus on expanding euro-denominated liquidity in the region. OKX limited spot crypto trading to USDC and euro pairs, while USDT could only be traded against USDC and euro.
Nevertheless, the exchange stated that the decision would only impact a small subset of its user base. Moreover, it had recently expanded its product offering in the EEA by introducing various euro fiat onramps and euro pairs. USDT remained available for EEA-based users to deposit, withdraw, and trade on over-the-counter (OTC) markets.
The move by OKX could be a sign of upcoming regulatory challenges for USDT in the region as the European Union prepares to implement its comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework called MiCA later this year.
In particular, the new rules will require stablecoin issuers to be regulated as electronic money institutions, potentially making many stablecoins currently offered in Europe illegal if they are not authorized and regulated as e-money transmitters. Circle, the issuer behind USDC and EURC, has already taken steps to comply with the upcoming regulations by applying for an electronic money institution license in the E.U.

ChatGPT Compares: Which Meme Coin Will Perform Best This Year


																TL;DR

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are top meme coin contenders for 2024, with DOGE benefiting from endorsements and a strong community, while SHIB has shown significant yearly gains.
ChatGPT also outlined the chances of Pepe (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF), and Bonk Inu (BONK) due to their recent price rallies and solid support base.


DOGE and SHIB Are Among the Contenders
The meme coin sector has captured the attention of industry participants in the past several months, with numerous assets experiencing substantial price surges. The niche witnessed the progress of some recently launched tokens and the success of others that have been part of the industry for years.
Considering the huge interest in the topic, we decided to ask ChatGPT which meme coin will perform the best in 2024. The AI-powered chatbot started its estimation with the leaders in terms of market capitalization – Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.
Despite being created as a joke in 2013, DOGE saw a remarkable rally in the past few years, reaching an all-time high of over $0.70 in 2021. Currently, it hovers around the $0.15 mark, which represents a substantial plunge from the peak but also a 100% increase compared to the figures observed in May 2023.

The asset has a devoted community, while endorsements from high-profile figures like Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk are beneficial for its performance. Not long ago, the EV giant officially integrated DOGE as a payment option on its website.




Shiba Inu (SHIB) – known as the Dogecoin killer – has also made great strides. Its price is up over 180% yearly, while a recent study estimated that it has the strongest supporter base in the meme coin realm.

Its future success relies on multiple factors, such as the further development of its layer-2 blockchain solution – Shibarium, its burning mechanism, adoption levels, and overall investor interest. 
It is worth noting that the L2 network recently underwent two major upgrades aimed at improving user experience and enabling compatibility with popular wallets, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. Those interested in learning more about Shibarium, feel free to take a look at our dedicated video below:
VIDEO
The Chances of the Rivals
ChatGPT continued its prediction with Pepe (PEPE), noting its solid community and recent price rally. As CryptoPotato reported, the frog-themed meme coin hit a new all-time high on May 15, with its market cap nearing the $5 billion milestone.
Subsequently, the chatbot claimed that dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK) also have chances to finish 2024 as the niche’s top performers. Both assets are built on the Solana blockchain and have become sensations in the past months. 
WIF gained support from prominent industry participants such as Arthur Hayes, while fans of the token recently raised $650,000 to put its logo on the Sphere – a famous entertainment arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.
“WIF has garnered a strong community following and significant attention on social media, which are crucial for the success of meme coins. Its current market cap and trading volume indicate a solid interest from investors,” ChatGPT stated. 
At one point this year, WIF’s market cap spiked to almost $5 billion, becoming the third-biggest in the cohort. Currently, it is placed fourth, trailing behind PEPE.

BONK’s success has been just as impressive. Launched in December 2022, it started making the headlines towards the end of 2023 after an exponential price rally. Its uptick was fueled by significant hype from investors and support from leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance, Bybit, and Coinbase are among the leaders allowing trading services with BONK. 
According to ChatGPT, the meme coin may advance even more before the end of 2024 as long as it benefits from the potential growth of the Solana ecosystem.

Renowned crypto trader's last insights before a 'couple of weeks' break


The cryptocurrency market led by Bitcoin (BTC) rose this week, but the resurgence stalled momentarily, with the maiden digital asset appearing to consolidate at around the $67,000 level. 
Overall, the market remains on edge regarding the next movement, especially for Bitcoin and altcoins. In this line, crypto trading expert Credible Crypto (Credibull), in a YouTube video posted on May 19, shared insights and outlook for several digital assets before what he termed taking a break. Below are some of the cryptocurrencies highlighted by the expert. 
Bitcoin (BTC)
The analyst noted that if Bitcoin is to experience a significant downside move, it should happen from the main resistance area, currently around $71,000. He identified $62,300 to $63,300 as a potential bounce zone, with $59,000 being the ideal target if this area fails.

He elaborated on the factors to watch for to determine Bitcoin’s next move. Two key indicators include an impulsive move off the lows and the behavior of open interest (OI). Credibull noted the absence of an impulsive move and a concerning ramp-up in OI, suggesting potential for a corrective move rather than a bullish breakout.
The analyst warned that if Bitcoin fails to break through this resistance level convincingly and OI remains high, it could lead to a significant price correction, possibly back to the $59,000 level.

“I’m cautious right now. I’m not super bullish as we push up into major resistance with a ramp-up in OI back to the levels that we were at before we broke down,” he said. 

Dogecoin (DOGE)
Transitioning to altcoins, Credibull expressed interest in shorting Dogecoin (DOGE). He highlighted that his primary area of interest for shorting Dogecoin lies around the $0.18 mark. He explained that this level offers an ideal risk-to-reward ratio for short positions.
The analyst called for patience, stating that he would not initiate a short position until Dogecoin reached the $0.18 zone. He acknowledged the possibility of several scenarios playing out before this level is hit.

For instance, Dogecoin could experience a pullback, potentially moving down and bouncing back up to the short zone. Alternatively, Dogecoin might directly ascend to the short zone without a significant Bitcoin pullback.
Regardless of the immediate movements, Credibull stressed that his strategy is not driven by emotions but by technical analysis and risk management. He pointed out that entering a short position below the $0.18 mark could expose traders to unnecessary risk, especially if the market experiences a bullish breakout.
Solana (SOL)
For Solana (SOL), the analyst identified vital resistance levels and potential shorting opportunities. He mentioned that Solana has room for a 5% to 10% upside. The expert pinpointed a move above the previous highs above $180 as the optimal short entry. 
He expects a rejection at this level, followed by a significant move down to the range lows, around $115. This represents approximately a 35% move from the current levels to the downside.

Credibull also highlighted the confluence of resistance levels on the SOL/USD and SOL/BTC charts, reinforcing his bearish outlook. He pointed out that both pairs are hitting key resistance zones, making them prime candidates for short positions with a favorable risk-to-reward ratio.
Chainlink (LINK)
In his analysis for Chainlink (LINK), Credibull noted that the token has been on a prolonged upward trend for almost a year, with only two months of correction, which makes a deeper retracement likely.
Credibull identified a point of breakdown and a subsequent range between $16 and $12 that LINK has established. Currently, LINK is pushing into an area of resistance around $18, making it an ideal spot for a short position. He emphasized the importance of either shorting directly into this resistance or waiting for a structural shift and falling back into the range to confirm the short.
LINK price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Credible Crypto
One of Credibull’s critical indicators for the LINK short is the massive rise in open interest during the recent push to the upside. This increase suggests that many leveraged players have entered the market, creating a potential for significant downside if these positions start to unwind. 
He identified a target move back down to around $11.96, which, from the current levels, represents a 27% to 30% move to the downside.
Dogwifhat (WIF) 
Credibull noted that while WIF has broken down from a lower level, there is still ample downside liquidity, suggesting the possibility of a fakeout after consolidation. He cautioned about initiating a short position on WIF until it recovers further and potentially reclaims higher levels.

One key reason Credibull is hesitant to short the meme coin at its current level is the risk-reward ratio. He emphasized the importance of waiting for rejection confirmation at resistance before considering a short position. 
The expert also highlighted the significance of shorting at extreme areas, such as the range highs, to minimize risk and maximize potential returns.
Overall, despite the technical indicators, the mentioned cryptocurrencies are highly susceptible to general market sentiment.

Important Statements from Vitalik Buterin, Wrote About Ethereum's Problems and Solutions - "Traditional Finance Could Revive If It Fails" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed criticism and concerns regarding Ethereum's centralization in a recent blog post.
The article covers three key topics: MEV (miner or maximum extractable value), liquid staking, and hardware costs involved in running an independent node.


Buterin acknowledged that these concerns are widely expressed and admitted that he has had them himself on many occasions. However, he also suggested that these problems may not be as insurmountable as some believe.
MEV refers to the financial advantage advanced node operators can gain by reordering transactions within a block. Buterin highlighted two approaches to combating MEV: minimization and quarantine. Minimization involves reducing MEV through smart protocol design such as CowSwap, while quarantining attempts to reduce or eliminate MEV through in-protocol techniques.





Buterin warned that MEV quarantine, while appealing, carries centralization risks. “If developers had the power to completely exclude transactions from a block, there are attacks that could occur quite easily,” he wrote. Despite this, Buterin expressed support for founders working on MEV quarantine through concepts such as transaction inclusion lists, which prevent developers from excluding transactions entirely.

Buterin also touched on the issue of individual Ethereum staking. Given the complexity, hardware requirements, and need for at least 32 ETH to run a standalone Ethereum node, most stakers choose to stake with Coinbase or a decentralized intermediary like Lido or RocketPool.


While Buterin acknowledged the progress made in reducing the cost and complexity of running an individual node, he suggested more could be done, such as reducing the time to withdraw staked ETH or lowering the 32 ETH minimum requirement for individual staking.
Buterin concluded his words by warning that wrong solutions could lead Ethereum to the path of centralization and revive the traditional financial system.

Find Out 3 Major Token Unlocks of Next Week


Token unlock involves releasing tokens that were previously blocked under fundraising terms. Projects carefully schedule these releases to avoid market pressure and prevent a drop in token prices.
However, factors like lack of liquidity or early investor profit-taking can significantly impact an asset’s dynamics. Here are three major token unlocks to watch next week.
Pyth Network (PYTH)

Unlock date: May 20
Number of tokens unlocked: 2.13 billion PYTH
Current circulating supply: 1.5 billion PYTH


Pyth Network is a decentralized oracle that supplies real-time financial market data to blockchain applications. It gathers high-quality pricing information from various sources, including trading firms and exchanges. The project aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of data used in smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.
The PYTH token has a maximum supply of 10 billion. On May 20, the project will unlock 2.13 billion tokens, which exceeds the current circulating supply. Approximately 800 million PYTH will go to private sale participants and publishers, with the remainder allocated for protocol development and ecosystem growth.
Crypto community members have polarized opinions on how the unlock will affect PYTH price. Some believe the altcoin is headed for a significant collapse, while others are confident that tokenomics design will allow it to hold its ground.

“Pyth unlock worth $910M is on 20th May. 141.67% of current supply is being unlocked. AEVO dumped 25% after the unlock. Most of PYTH holders have staked so they can’t sell their bags. Regardless i am looking for shorting setups,” one crypto trader noted.

There is Some Good News From India, Known For Its Anti-Cryptocurrency Attitude - Bitcoin Sistemi

In a significant development, India's market watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), has recommended that multiple regulators oversee cryptocurrency trading, according to documents seen by Reuters.
This is the strongest indication that some authorities in the country are open to the use of private virtual assets.


SEBI's stance contrasts with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which argues that private digital currencies pose a macroeconomic risk. Both sets of documents were presented to a government panel responsible for making policy for the finance ministry to consider.
India has taken a tough stance on cryptocurrencies since 2018, when its central bank banned lenders and other financial intermediaries from dealing with crypto users or exchanges. However, this move was later overturned by the Supreme Court.





In 2021, the government prepared a bill to ban private cryptocurrencies, but it has not yet been implemented. As G20 president last year, India called for a global framework to regulate such assets.

RBI continues to support banning stablecoins. A source with direct knowledge of the panel's discussions said the panel plans to finalize its report as early as June.


SEBI, however, has opposed a single unified regulator for digital assets, recommending that different regulators oversee activities linked to cryptocurrencies falling within their purview. He proposed that his agency oversee cryptocurrencies in the form of securities and new offerings called Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and issue licenses for stock market-related products.
This approach mirrors that in the United States, where securities and crypto exchanges fall under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SEBI has also suggested that crypto assets backed by fiat currencies can be regulated by the RBI and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) should regulate insurance and pension-related virtual assets.






SEBI also recommended that the complaints of investors trading in cryptocurrencies be resolved under India's Consumer Protection Act.
In its presentations, the RBI had warned of fiscal policy risks, including potential tax evasion and reliance on voluntary compliance in decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) activities in cryptocurrencies. He also highlighted the potential loss of “seigniorage” income, the profit a central bank makes from money production.
Although the RBI's 2018 orders were challenged and overturned by the Supreme Court, the central bank asked financial institutions to strictly comply with stringent anti-money laundering and foreign exchange rules and completely excluded cryptocurrencies from India's formal financial system.

However, the trade gradually increased and in 2022 the government introduced a tax on crypto transactions in India to discourage such transactions.

Crypto Institutions Gobble Up Billions In Bitcoin ETFs, Stockpiling 250,000 BTC - Details


								The tides are turning in the cryptocurrency world, with institutional investors making a big splash in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) while retail investors seem content to bob on the sidelines. A recent report by IntotheBlock paints a picture of a two-tiered market, where hedge funds and even pensions are accumulating Bitcoin through ETFs, but the average investor remains cautious.

Institutional Investors Set Sail With Bitcoin ETFs
The launch of Bitcoin ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange in early 2024 was a watershed moment, finally opening the floodgates for institutional money to enter the crypto market. This has been a boon for Bitcoin whales – investors with significant holdings – who have been snapping up large amounts of the cryptocurrency through these new financial vehicles.
IntotheBlock’s data shows that these whales have collectively amassed an additional 250,000 Bitcoins, bringing their coffers back to levels last seen before the FTX collapse in 2023.
Source: IntoTheBlock
Hedge funds, long expected to be the driving force behind institutional adoption, have lived up to the hype. Financial giants like Millennium Management have reportedly invested billions in Bitcoin ETFs, signaling their confidence in the future of the cryptocurrency. Public pensions are also getting into the game, with the state of Wisconsin making a splash with a $160 million investment in Bitcoin ETFs.
US ETF Frenzy Fizzles, But The Voyage Continues
While the initial reception for US Bitcoin ETFs was euphoric, with record-breaking inflows in January propelling the entire crypto market upwards, the party seems to be slowing down. Experts believe the early surge may have been fueled by a limited number of enthusiastic institutional adopters. Inflows have tapered off in recent weeks, suggesting a wait-and-see approach from some investors.
BTCUSD trading at $67.032 today. Chart: TradingView
Across the Pacific, the recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong met with a muted response. The first day of trading saw a mere $12.7 million in volume, a far cry from the $4.6 billion recorded by US ETFs on their debut. This lukewarm reception suggests that the Asian market may not be as eager to embrace the crypto just yet.
Retail Investors Drop Anchor, Unconvinced By The Hype
Adding another layer to the complex story is the apparent lack of enthusiasm from retail investors. The report highlights a significant decrease in the creation of new Bitcoin addresses, a metric often used to gauge retail participation. This suggests that many individual investors are staying on the sidelines, unconvinced by the recent surge or wary of the volatility associated with cryptocurrency.

The reasons for this hesitancy could be manifold. The FTX collapse may have left some investors with a bitter taste in their mouths, and the overall market correction in early 2024 could be prompting caution. Additionally, the complexities of ETFs, coupled with the novelty of cryptocurrency investing for some, might be creating a wait-and-see attitude among retail investors.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,032, up 0.7% in the last 24 hours, and sustained an impressive 11.0% price increase in the last week, data from Coingecko shows.

Roaring Kitty Goes MIA as GameStop Dumps on Retail Investors | Cryptopolitan

GameStop, the video game retail giant, is hitting the market hard with plans to sell up to 45 million new shares. This decision came hot on the heels of a major stock price jump, catalyzed by the unexpected comeback of day trader Keith Gill (AKA Roaring Kitty).  GameStop is bracing for a drop in first-quarter net sales compared to the previous year. With shares closing 19.9% lower at $22.21 in New York, the potential revenue from these shares could hit around $1 billion if fully capitalized.GameStop Shares New Strategy for SharesOn Friday, GameStop revealed this strategy in a filing to the US securities regulator, alongside some sobering preliminary financial results.Last week was nothing short of a rollercoaster for GameStop’s stock, which saw an almost fourfold increase to a Tuesday peak of $64.83—the highest since mid-2021. By week’s end, GameStop reported a 27.2% rise in share price.However, the company acknowledged that these dramatic price fluctuations seem disconnected from its actual business performance or operational results.Source: TradingView GameStop’s anticipated net sales are set between $872 million and $892 million, marking a decline of at least 27% from last year and falling short of the $1.05 billion analysts had projected.Expected net losses could range from $27 million to $37 million, improving slightly from the previous year’s $50.5 million loss.AMC Joins GameStop in Market SurgeThe meme stock frenzy wasn’t limited to GameStop. AMC Entertainment, another key player from the 2021 stock surge, also capitalized on market trends.Related: Could Gamestop & Amc Pumps Spark a New Meme Coin Season?Last week, AMC entered an agreement to exchange nearly $164 million of subordinated debt due in 2026 for approximately 23.3 million newly issued shares, valued at about $7.33 each. Despite closing at $4.40, AMC’s stock experienced a 51.2% increase over the week.Investors Scramble as Shares FluctuateKeith Gill’s posts sparked a significant rally in GameStop shares. However, he has gone silent on Twitter for nearly 48 hours since then.This sudden disappearance has left investors and followers speculating about his next move, especially as the stock faces volatile swings.Also Read: Roaring Kitty Makes an Iconic Comeback – Gamestop Is on Fire!After the initial surge that brought GameStop shares to unprecedented heights, Roaring Kitty’s silence has raised concerns among investors about potential “pump and dump” schemes. Allegations have surfaced suggesting that Kitty may have artificially inflated the stock price only to profit from its peak, leaving many to hold depreciating assets.The rapid rise and fall of the stock highlight the risky nature of investing based on social media trends, where the line between influence and manipulation can often become blurred. Many investors who joined the frenzy, attracted by the potential for quick profits, now face significant losses.The lesson is simple. Jumping into highly volatile stocks on the back of internet hype—without solid fundamentals to back the investment—can be a precarious venture.

Peter Schiff Tired of Traders Accusing Him of Using Bitcoin to Chase Clout

Peter Schiff, a gold enthusiast and trader, has never shied away from encouraging stock investors to choose gold over Bitcoin. However, his position has led to criticism from the crypto community.Today, Peter Schiff took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify his position on using Bitcoin to grow his influence. He said:“I’m tired of people claiming I’m only against #Bitcoin to generate social media engagement. That’s ridiculous.”Peter Schiff Does Not Need Bitcoin to Grow InfluenceRenowned financial expert Peter Schiff has once again stirred the crypto market by refuting the notion that he uses BTC to chase clout. Schiff, known for his bearish views on crypto, based his latest remarks on BTC’s recent performance against silver and gold, drawing attention to the sharp difference. However, the crypto community will not buy that stand. One X user by the name @AndersonJoby  told Schiff: “Peter, if that’s true than never bring up $BTC again. But it’s not, so you will. By going anti Bitcoin that is what drives your engagement and you know this. Nobody believes anything you say lol. You have become the poster child for the $BTC community by being wrong over and over and over again about it.”Also Read: Is This the End of Bitcoin’s Bull Run? Peter Schiff Thinks SoSchiff says that silver has gone up 21% since April, while Bitcoin has only gone up 2%. He says that this poor performance is proof that Bitcoin is about to die. On the other hand, Bitcoin supporters say that Schiff only uses short-term data to back his story. Bitcoin has gone up by almost 60% so far this year, while silver has only increased by 14.46%. This contrast drives ongoing arguments between people who support traditional assets and people who support digital currencies.On today’s X post, Peter Schiff adds: “I think Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, a literal blockchain letter […] If Bitcoin pumpers stop claiming Bitcoin is digital gold then I won’t need to post about it.”To that end, one X user added: “Oh come on, we both know Bitcoin’s been the star of the show. You get the whole debasement thing, right? And let’s be honest, you’re kicking yourself for not hopping on the Bitcoin train ten years ago.” The Crypto Market over the WeekendHistorically, the crypto weekend is known to come with negative sentiments. To that end, the market has had rather an opposite sentiment weekend. Currently, the value of Bitcoin stands at $66,979.31, reflecting a slight 0.3% increase over the past hour and a 0.1% increase since yesterday. Today, the global crypto market cap stands at $2.53 trillion, with a slight decrease of 0.43% in the last 24 hours and a significant increase of 115.88% compared to a year ago. Currently, BTC’s market cap stands at $1.32 trillion, indicating a Bitcoin dominance of 52.02%. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market cap stands at $162 billion, representing a 6.39% share of the overall crypto market cap.Also Read: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024-2030: Will BTC Price Surpass $100K Post-Halving?Today, the value of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $3,078.71, reflecting a slight 0.4% increase compared to an hour ago. However, it has experienced a 1.2% decline since yesterday. The current value of ETH has increased by 4.9% in the past 7 days.Cryptopolitan Reporting by Florence Muchai

Cardano network activity on the rise, but will it be enough for ADA? - AMBCrypto



Activity on the Cardano network surged significantly over the last few days.
Interest in Cardano’s NFT sector waned.

Cardano [ADA] has been one of the major networks that has been consistently growing in terms of development activity.
Despite the high number of developments occurring on the Cardano network, it failed to attract a large number of addresses to Cardano.
A rise in activity
However, in the last few days, there was a resurgence in activity observed on the Cardano network. It was seen that the number of daily active addresses on the network has grown above the 30,000 mark.
Coupled with the rise in active addresses, the number of transactions occurring on the network also grew. However, the surge in active addresses wasn’t as significant.
On the 10th of March, the number of active addresses on the network had soared to more than 60,000, double what they were at the time of writing.
A positive indicator of the Cardano ecosystem being healthy would be if the network sees the same amount of activity in the next few days.
Source: Artemis
Due to the rising activity on the Cardano network, the TVL (total value locked) on the protocol also surged, implying that interest in Cardano’s DeFi sector had grown.
If Cardano can continue to attract users to its DeFi dApps, its ecosystem could have a shot at a revival.
Source: Artemis
Some challenges ahead
However, the waning interest in the NFT sector may add some hindrance to Cardano’s recent growth.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of TapTools’ data revealed that the floor price of popular Cardano NFT collections such as EarthNode, Book.io and The Ape Society witnessed a significant deduction.
Moreover, the volume at which these NFTs were trading also plummeted materially.
If Cardano’s growth is driven solely by its DeFi sector and other sectors such as NFTs get left behind, it may cause problems for its ecosystem in the long run.

Bitcoin (BTC) Mirroring Pre-Parabolic Rally That Led to Over 1,200% Gains in 2017, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin’s (BTC) current market structure looks similar to 2017, just before its massive 1,200% rally to its previous record high of $20,000, according to widely followed crypto analyst TechDev.
The pseudonymous analyst shares with his 450,000 followers on the social media platform X a chart that suggests the current market cycle has been strikingly reminiscent of the 2017 Bitcoin bull run.










TechDev’s chart highlights that both bear markets bottomed out during the crash of two major crypto exchanges, followed by repeated rallies and consolidation phases.
“The more things change, the more they stay the same.”

Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that BTC is currently in a consolidation phase similar to 2017 when it was trading at around $1,500 before a parabolic run to a cycle high of $20,000.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $67,060.
The analyst also looks at Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), which aims to gauge the momentum of an asset. According to TechDev, Bitcoin has historically topped out when its RSI reaches the top of a long-term channel, which has not yet occurred.
“You’re in the green zone. Don’t waste it.”
Source: TechDev/X
TechDev is also looking at the OTHERS chart, which tracks the market cap of all crypto excluding the top 10 digital assets and stablecoins. Specifically, he’s looking at the chart’s stochastic RSI, moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and logarithmic Bollinger Band indicator.
The MACD is traditionally used to pinpoint reversals based on the convergence or divergence of moving averages, and the Bollinger Bands are meant to identify periods of impending sharp price movements based on volatility contraction.
According to the analyst, OTHERS, which is often used to gauge the strength of altcoins, has reached a “max compression” zone, suggesting that a big move to the upside is on the horizon. He also notes that the setup coincides with the return of “Roaring Kitty,” the leader of the movement that pumped the price of Gamestop (GME) in 2021.
“Roaring Kitty returns as this alt setup reappears.
There are no coincidences.”

Brandt Mocks Schiff's Non-Stop Attacks on Bitcoin, Schiff Insists He Is Just Being 'Honest' | Cryptoglobe


                                
Peter Schiff, an American economist, financial broker, and author, is renowned for his bearish outlook on the U.S. economy and his accurate prediction of the 2008 financial crisis. Born on 23 March 1963 in New Haven, Connecticut, Schiff holds a degree in finance and accounting from the University of California, Berkeley. Starting his career as a stockbroker, he later co-founded Euro Pacific Capital, where he currently serves as CEO and Chief Global Strategist. An advocate of the Austrian School of economics, Schiff is a vocal critic of monetary stimulus policies and a well-known skeptic of Bitcoin, often comparing it to the tulip mania bubble. He prefers investments in gold and other hard assets and has authored several books, including “Crash Proof: How to Profit from the Coming Economic Collapse” and “The Real Crash: America’s Coming Bankruptcy.”



On 2 April 2024, when Bitcoin was trading at around $65,469, Schiff took to the social media platform X to comment on the market. He noted that gold had risen over 1% to hit a new record high, while silver had surged nearly 4%. He emphasized that silver still had significant room to grow to reach a new record high and remarked that Bitcoin had fallen almost 6% that day. Schiff provocatively stated that silver is the new Bitcoin, dubbing it “Bitcoin 2.0.”



Fast forward to 18 May 2024, with Bitcoin trading at around $67,613, Schiff revisited his earlier post. He highlighted that since 2 April, silver had increased by over 21%, while Bitcoin’s gains were less than 2%, asserting that silver offered more than ten times the return compared to Bitcoin. He declared, “Bitcoin is dead. Long live silver.”







Then, Peter Brandt, a highly respected trader and author with over four decades of experience in the commodity and futures markets, entered the fray. Brandt began his career in 1976 with ContiCommodity Services and later founded Factor LLC, a proprietary trading firm. Known for his expertise in classical charting techniques and disciplined risk management, Brandt has authored several influential books, including “Diary of a Professional Commodity Trader,” which provides an insider’s perspective on trading. Brandt is recognized for his successful use of classical chart patterns and is frequently sought for his market insights. He also shares his extensive knowledge through Factor Trading, offering educational content on chart analysis and trading strategies.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

On 18 May 2024, Brandt responded to Schiff’s comments about Bitcoin and silver, advising people to ignore such posts. He suggested that Schiff makes these statements to attract attention and followers, adding that Schiff has been betting on “dead horses.” Brandt dismissed Schiff’s enthusiasm for silver as overblown, stating that just because silver had seen a recent uptick, it didn’t validate Schiff’s overall bearish stance on Bitcoin.



Schiff quickly responded to Brandt, urging him to consider that his views on Bitcoin are genuine. Schiff argued that investing in Bitcoin is like betting on an imaginary horse and warned of the high risks involved, asserting that many would lose money by betting on Bitcoin. He reiterated that his criticism of Bitcoin is not merely for social media engagement but a sincere belief in its high risk and lack of intrinsic value.







In a subsequent post, Schiff expressed frustration with accusations that he criticizes Bitcoin only to generate engagement. He argued that if his goal were to maximize engagement, he would endorse Bitcoin instead. Schiff maintained that he wouldn’t sacrifice his integrity for popularity and described Bitcoin as a pyramid scheme, a “literal blockchain letter.” He contended that Bitcoin promoters mislead people into choosing Bitcoin over gold and declared that if Bitcoin advocates stopped calling it “digital gold,” he would cease his critical posts about it.

Bitcoin Leads Crypto Market Rally as Bulls Regain Control - DailyCoin


        

Bitcoin has surged above key levels, potentially sparking a bullish week for cryptocurrencies.



Eight out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies have seen gains, with Solana emerging as the top performer.



Not all coins have benefited. BNB and Toncoin have bucked the trend with price drops.




In a bullish week for cryptocurrency, Bitcoin surged above key moving averages on May 15. Bulls then successfully defended this level during a retest on May 16, solidifying the upward momentum. This positive movement in Bitcoin has a ripple effect throughout the market, with 8 out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies experiencing gains over the past week.



Solana Emerges as Top Performer



Solana emerged as a standout performer, climbing an impressive 18% over the last 7 days. Bitcoin followed closely behind with a 10% gain, further solidifying its dominance as the leading cryptocurrency. 




Several other major players also saw significant growth, with Shiba Inu, Avalanche, and Cardano each registering gains exceeding 8%. Shiba Inu rose 8.9%, Avalanche gained 8.4%, and Cardano climbed 8.3%.



Established players like Dogecoin and Ethereum also recorded positive movement, increasing 6.2% and 6% respectively. Rounding out the top gainers list, XRP managed a more modest but still positive 2.5% price increase over the past week.



Not all cryptocurrencies shared the bullish sentiment. Two tokens, BNB and Toncoin, fell out of favor with investors, experiencing losses of 2% and 8% respectively over the same period. Overall, the week painted a positive picture for the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin leading the charge and many altcoins experiencing significant gains.



Winners



All but 2 of the top 10 cryptocurrencies experienced price increases over the past week. Here’s a look at them:

Losers



Only 2 of the top 10 cryptocurrencies experienced price losses over the past week. Here’s a look at them, ranked by their percentage decrease:

This is just a snapshot of the current market conditions at the time of writing. Cryptocurrency prices are constantly fluctuating, so it’s important to do your own research before making any investment decisions.



On the Flipside




While the past week saw a surge, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. This positive movement might not translate to sustained growth.



Looking at a single week’s data offers a limited view. Analyzing longer timeframes provides a clearer picture of overall market health.




Why This Matters



Bitcoin’s surge above key moving averages and subsequent hold solidifies a bullish trend, potentially sparking a domino effect that lifts the entire crypto market. This positive week, with even established altcoins like Ethereum and Dogecoin experiencing gains, suggests a wave of investor confidence that could propel the industry forward.

Bitcoin bulls take charge as SOL, AR, GRT and FTM flash bullish signs

Bitcoin (BTC) has risen over 8% this week, indicating that lower levels continue to attract buyers. Generally, in a range, traders buy near the support and sell close to the resistance. This suggests that the price may reach the top of the range at $73,777, but clearing this hurdle might be difficult.Analysts are divided in their opinion about Bitcoin’s next directional move. Some believe that the correction is over and Bitcoin will break out to a new all-time high, while others expect Bitcoin to turn down to retest the $60,000 support and go lower. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout from a range with certainty. Hence it could be prudent to wait for the price to start a new trend before establishing large trading positions.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360As Bitcoin consolidates, traders may look toward altcoins for short-term trading opportunities. Although a full-blown altseason has still not arrived, select altcoins are likely to present trading opportunities. Could Bitcoin’s potential rise above its near-term resistance boost sentiment in the crypto sector? Let’s study the top 5 cryptocurrencies that look promising on the charts.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin has been facing resistance near $68,000, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded ground to the bears.

If the price rebounds off this level, it will improve the prospects of a rally above $68,000.Conversely, if the price breaks below the 20-EMA, it will signal that the bullish momentum is weakening.

If that happens, the AR/USDT pair may surge to $68.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply and plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are rushing to the exit.

Epik Duck: From Joke to $25 Million Solana Meme Coin - Decrypt

It took just one flicker of an idea, two minutes of typing, and four SOL. Within an hour, Michael Anderson had created a financial asset worth in excess of $25 million. “I’m sitting here going, ‘What the hell has just happened?’” Anderson, better known by his crypto moniker Mando, told Decrypt. The absurd tale of the asset in question, a Solana meme coin called “Epik Duck,” has particular resonance in crypto at the current moment—one in which a meme coin frenzy has resuscitated long-sagging enthusiasm within the industry, but also threatened to consume it with a naked form of gambling that typically lacks any pretense of technological progress or utility.Last month, during a weekly podcast he hosts with another crypto influencer, Keyboard Monkey, Mando began riffing about making his own meme coin. In recent months, meme-inspired crypto tokens have risen from worthlessness to multi-billion dollar valuations.It used to be that meme coins—first created as jokes poking fun at the sheer volume of worthless, hollow projects flooding the crypto industry—required some amount of technical prowess to create and launch. But even that barrier has fallen away: Services like Pump.fun now allow users to generate new meme coins on Solana in seconds, without writing a single line of code, for a few dollars’ worth of SOL. While recording his live podcast, Mando logged onto Pump.fun and chose an image of a favorite meme of his: the Epik Duck, a Roblox character that resurfaced as a viral joke on Twitter in 2021. Mando titled his new coin “Epik Duck,” and filled in the meme’s pre-existing tagline: “The Epik Duck is coming.” He then paid 4 SOL to launch the token—more than needed—and clicked “launch.” The whole thing took less than two minutes. Epik Duck instantly went viral, in part thanks to Mando’s podcast listeners, who jumped on the token. Within 10 minutes, the coin reached a market capitalization of $1 million. Within an hour, it surpassed $25 million.The 4 SOL Mando had used to launch Epik Duck? That sum, initially worth about $740, bought the influencer 15% of his own token supply—a bag suddenly worth $3.75 million.That’s when a ridiculous situation suddenly got a lot less funny, as Mando tells it. Within hours, the token's market cap plummeted back down to $2 million. In the process, many Epik Duck holders won and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mando says he moved to burn his own tokens, fearful that people would get the wrong idea about his intentions. “I'm not going to get canceled for this,” Mado said he told himself at the time. “I didn’t want people to think I'd made money off this, that I planned to. It’d just gone absolutely insane.”What had started as a joke quickly morphed into something more serious: a multi-million dollar enterprise with thousands of holders, and Mando suddenly and unwittingly in the CEO’s chair. “From then on, it became a reputation thing,” Mando said. “I was a man on a mission to make this work.”But what, exactly, does it mean to make a meme coin work? Unlike other arguably worthless assets floating around the cryptosphere, meme coins, by self-definition, have no purpose. Their entire utility was once pointing out, as meta-commentary, crypto’s lack of utility. Mando sees things differently—but he’s not your average trader. The crypto influencer previously worked at Barclays and Goldman Sachs trading distressed and high-yield bonds before emptying his and his wife’s savings accounts in 2021 to purchase 80 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. (He ended up selling them for 700% profit.)To Mando, in their total absence of any pretense of meaning, meme coins are the purest form of currency. “We all believe in the dollar. It is a meme,” Mando said. “We all believe in Bitcoin—it is a meme.”“Meme coins, for me, are crypto in its purest form,” he continued. “Meme coins are a speed run in believing in the intrinsic value of something.”Thus, making Epik Duck work was just like making anything else work, in a world bereft of natural value. It was just a game of convincing people. So Mando started a website for Epik Duck, along with a Twitter account and Telegram channel—and then a Chinese Telegram channel and WeChat account. He hired moderators for his social media operations, and he pushed Epik Duck as hard as he could. He said he barely sleeps these days as the Duck increasingly dominates his life.The work’s had mixed results. While the token’s dropped off a fair bit since last month, some people still believe that Epik Duck has value; or at least, some people still believe that other people believe it has value. Since falling from its $25 million peak, the coin still retains a $12 million market cap at writing, per CoinGecko.In the interim, Mando has repurchased an undisclosed sum of the token—mainly, he says, to pay exchanges and market makers and fund community rewards programs. He says he owns somewhere between 3% and 5% of the token’s supply.He’s also invested, along with his business partners, in Pump.fun, praising the Epik Duck saga as proof of the protocol’s democratizing potential to allow any crypto user to—like him—make something out of nothing. Not all see Pump.fun’s ascendancy so positively. Last month, a top executive at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz derided the current explosion of meme coin generation as “undermining the long-term vision of crypto” by turning the industry into “a risky casino.” “This deeply affects adoption, regulation/laws, and builder behavior,” the executive, Eddy Lazzarin, said. “I see the damage every day. You should too.”On Thursday, a disgruntled former Pump.fun employee hacked the protocol in a $2 million exploit that caused the site to temporarily shut down. The hacker later said he had intended to “kill” Pump.fun with the attack. “It’s inadvertently hurt people for a long time,” the former employee later said, when explaining his motivations for attacking the site. On Friday, over 23,000 new fungible tokens were created on the Solana network, an all-time daily record. Just months ago, that figure hovered, on average, at around 300 per day.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Shiba Inu Could Hit Insane '$0.001 SHIB Price' and Spark Another Wild Millionaire Boom ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Numerous memecoins have emerged in the wild, uncharted territory of cryptos, yet few have managed to seize the public’s imagination and evoke such fervor as Shiba Inu. Its staggering 2021 rally turned small investments into life-changing fortunes, fueling dreams of overnight millionaires.



SHIB has had a wild ride, especially during the meme coin craze of late 2020, when its value soared. The idea of SHIB reaching $0.001 has been circulating for some time, contributing to the ongoing speculation around the coin. Despite some analysts’ doubts, the $0.001 target resurfaces in discussions about Shiba Inu’s potential.



Now, as Shiba Inu claws its way back from a steep post-2021 crash, investors are wondering: can it reach $0.001 and ignite another frenzy of wealth creation?



Shiba Inu’s Astronomical Rise and Recent Performance



Rewinding to 2021, Shiba Inu was the talk of the town, boasting an eye-popping gain of over 45,000,000%. For those who had the foresight to invest just $3, they were looking at a cool million in returns. However, the euphoria was short-lived as Shiba Inu plummeted by 92%, mirroring the broader crypto market turmoil triggered by the 2022 FTX contagion.



Fast-forward to 2024. There’s a resurgence of investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market, and Shiba Inu is capitalizing on this trend. Its value has already surged by 120% in 2024, outperforming Bitcoin, which has seen a 50% increase. This raises the question: Could Shiba Inu replicate its historic rally and reach $0.001 from its current price of $0.0000248?

Shiba Inu’s journey to mainstream adoption is still fraught with challenges, even as its price stages a comeback. The token’s utility in the real world remains limited, with just 933 merchants accepting it, as per data—a stark contrast to more established cryptocurrencies. Despite initiatives like Shibarium, which aims to lower transaction costs through a Layer-2 blockchain solution, Shiba Inu has struggled to gain widespread acceptance.



The community has also tried to enhance Shiba Inu’s appeal through projects like Shiba Eternity, a digital card game created in 2022 to expand the token ecosystem. However, these efforts have not translated into widespread adoption, raising questions about Shiba Inu’s long-term sustainability.



Speculation vs. Utility



Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise in 2021 was largely fueled by speculation, with investors banking on its price continuing to soar. However, the token’s subsequent crash served as a stark reminder of the risks associated with speculative investments. To maintain its value and create more, Shiba Inu needs widespread adoption and utility, aspects it currently lacks.



While Shiba Inu’s community is actively working to address these issues, the token’s path to $0.001 remains uncertain. The token’s market capitalization and supply would need to change significantly to support such a price, making it a challenging goal to achieve.



Analyzing potential drivers, such as integrating SHIB into gaming and the metaverse and sustained retail interest, provides a glimpse into what might boost SHIB’s value. Yet, it’s essential to stay realistic and avoid overly optimistic projections, especially regarding SHIB reaching $0.001.



Like many other altcoins, SHIB’s price tends to follow Bitcoin’s movements. While a bullish crypto market could lift SHIB, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies highlights the need for prudent risk management strategies.

Mike Novogratz Says Bitcoin Won't Reach a New All-Time High Till This Happens ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp
Market enthusiasts and investors closely monitor the predictions of influential figures. One such prominent voice is Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, who recently shared his insights on Bitcoin’s future trajectory. In a candid interview on Galaxy Digital’s podcast, Novogratz sends a cautious yet insightful warning: Bitcoin (BTC) probably won’t reach new all-time highs without significant macroeconomic shifts.



The Prediction in Detail



Novogratz forecasted that Bitcoin’s price will likely remain within a trading range of $55,000 to $75,000 in the near term. He pointed out that substantial changes in the macroeconomic environment are essential for Bitcoin to break past its previous high of $73,000. Specifically, he mentioned Federal Reserve rate cuts as a critical catalyst that could drive Bitcoin higher.



“I think we’re in a bit of a range – $55,000 to $75,000. It’s probably closer to $57,000 than $73,000. We’ve probably put the low and the high in. I do believe the next move is up because I do think we’re going to get closer to the election, and [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome] Powell is going to want to cut rates,” Novogratz stated.



The Impact of Economic Conditions



Novogratz discussed how a slowing economy might benefit Bitcoin. However, he stressed that for Bitcoin to make significant gains, either the Federal Reserve needs to act by cutting interest rates or there must be a major development in crypto regulations. Both scenarios probably won’t happen soon, and Bitcoin may continue to trade sideways.



“There’s a resurgence of the ‘Oh my God, the economy’s slowing down’ narrative, which will be helpful. I don’t think Bitcoin will take out the old high, the $73,000 high, unless we get the Fed in action, or we get some big regulatory breakthrough. Those are both probably low delta,” he explained.

Bitcoin as Digital Gold



One of the critical factors Novogratz pointed out is the influence of US federal government spending and the increasing national debt. He believes these economic conditions will drive more investors towards Bitcoin, viewing it as a digital equivalent of gold. According to Novogratz, Bitcoin benefits from the same forces that drive gold’s value up but at a faster rate due to its newer technology and adoption cycle.



“Right now, I talk about two things: crypto regulation and the debt. And they’re at odds with each other. If we had an administration, Biden or Trump, that addressed this 26% of GDP federal budget, which should be 20%, it would not be good for Bitcoin,” Novogratz noted. “And so having really crappy policymakers and profligate spenders and populists in Washington, great for my net worth. That’s just the story of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is going up for the same reason gold is going up. It’s gone up faster because we’re a newer technology, we are a newer commodity, and therefore the adoption cycle is happening faster.”



Mike Novogratz’s insights provide a nuanced perspective on Bitcoin’s potential price movements. While the biggest cryptocurrency may benefit from macroeconomic instability and increasing government debt, significant gains to new all-time highs will likely require more substantial changes, such as Federal Reserve rate cuts or major regulatory advancements.

Ripple records a strong Q1: What does the future hold for XRP? - AMBCrypto



Ripple made massive progress in Q1 in many areas.
Development activity on the network fell.

Ripple [XRP] saw massive fluctuations in terms of price over the last week. However, the progress of Ripple in the first quarter of 2024 could lay the foundation for XRP’s growth in the long run.
Looking at Q1
According to Ripple’s Q1 2024 XRP Markets Report, the number of transactions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) more than doubled from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the end of the first quarter of 2024, while the average transaction cost almost halved.
Published on the 17th of May, the report reveals that XRPL on-chain transaction activity surged by 108% during Q1 of 2024, reaching approximately 251.39 million transactions, compared to 121.03 million in Q4 of 2023.
Furthermore, the average cost per transaction dropped by 45% to approximately $0.000856.
 
Throughout the first quarter, the distribution of XRP trading volume among cryptocurrency exchanges remained stable, with Binance, Bybit, and Upbit collectively accounting for over 70% of the total traded volume.
Source: Ripple
The report also notes a shift in trading dynamics, as the proportion of volume traded via fiat pairs decreased from 15% in Q4 to 11% in Q1, with most XRP trading now occurring against Tether.
Legal battles
Addressing the ongoing lawsuit with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in December 2020, Ripple responded to the SEC’s request for $2 billion in remedies on the 22nd of April.
Ripple argued that the law doesn’t permit the SEC to demand disgorgement or interest on disgorgement unless they can prove someone was harmed.
Ripple stated,
“In terms of next steps, both parties will wait for the Judge to make a determination on the final remedies – likely in the coming months.”
Development activity
In terms of overall development, it was observed that the number of core developers on Ripple’s team had increased. However, the number of code commits being made by these developers had fallen significantly.
This implied that the overall development activity on the network had fallen.

Is Ethereum Foundation Connected to EigenLabs? | Cryptopolitan

Recent developments have revealed that three staff members from the Ethereum Foundation are formally connected to EigenLayer entities, sparking discussions within the community. The revelation was made by renowned Ethereum researcher Justin Drake as he disclosed his own involvement with EigenLabs.Justin Drake recently became an advisor to the EigenFoundation, a decision accompanied by a huge financial incentive involving EIGEN tokens potentially valued in the millions, vested over three years. This arrangement underscores the significant financial stakes involved, as Ðrake noted, “We’re talking millions of dollars of tokens vesting over three years.”Researcher Gives Back to EthereumDespite the lucrative deal, Ðrake pledged to channel all proceeds from his advisory role back into the Ethereum ecosystem, in the form of investments or donations. This decision aims to reinforce his commitment to the community, maintaining a balance between personal gain and collective benefit. In his words:I pledge to reinject all advisorship proceeds towards worthy projects within the Ethereum ecosystem, either as investments or donations.He also mentioned his readiness to step back if the direction of EigenLayer diverges from the interests of Ethereum, reflecting his cautious approach to maintaining ethical integrity.Exploring the Advisory ConditionsThe decision to accept the advisory role was not taken lightly; Ðrake mentioned he had turned down over a hundred similar offers before. His engagement began only after a year-long discussion, emphasizing the careful consideration he gave to this role.Also Read: Vitalik Buterin Shares Plans to Improve Ethereum’s DecentralizationThe researcher’s involvement is strictly regulated, focusing on mitigating risks associated with restaking technologies, which is a critical area for Ethereum’s future.Despite his new role at EigenFoundation, Ðrake said he intends to maintain a critical perspective on EigenLayer’s developments. He plans to steer the organization toward practices that safeguard the Ethereum network, particularly against risks that could undermine its decentralized nature, such as the erosion of solo validators.Researcher Pledges Integrity Amidst Formal TiesThe relationship between Ethereum Foundation staff and EigenLabs is not widespread, involving only three of the over 300 members, according to Drake. This limited involvement has, however, raised questions within the community about the potential for undue influence.Ðrake reassures, “EFers are some of the highest integrity people I know,” acknowledging the concerns but defending the ethical standards of his colleagues. His advisory role, while significant, is framed as an independent activity separate from his responsibilities at the Ethereum Foundation.Related: Why Is Ethereum Still Performing Badly?I do acknowledge that accepting the EigenFoundation advisorship inevitably comes with downside risk beyond my personal reputation. I hope the above shows that it is at least a considered move with calculated risks.
Justin DrakeTurning his attention back to Ethereum staking, Drake said he sees restaking risks as either ‘chronic,’ like the erosion of solo validators, or ‘acute,’ such as catastrophic infrastructure failures. His strategies include decoupling execution proposing from validation, capping economic stakes to limit risk, and introducing intersubjective slashing with EIGEN tokens to absorb system shocks.Cryptopolitan reporting by Jai Hamid

Hong Kong's Crypto Ambitions Hit Snag: Can ETFs Steer the Ship? - DailyCoin


        
Hong Kong has launched the region’s first crypto ETFs, aiming to be a financial powerhouse.



Early signs have indicated investor outflows, raising questions about the ultimate success of the strategy.



Despite the challenges, some analysts have predicted a potential surge in assets under management.
Hong Kong’s reputation as a global financial powerhouse took a hit in recent years. Now, the city is looking to a new asset class to revive its mojo: cryptocurrency. But their gamble on crypto ETFs isn’t playing out quite as planned. Will Hong Kong manage to lure investors and become a crypto hub, or will their efforts fizzle out?Hong Kong’s Crypto GambleUnlike the typical “all or nothing” approach to crypto, Hong Kong has taken a measured step. They launched their first Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in late April, hoping to snag a slice of the booming US market already valued at a staggering $55 billion. But instead of a windfall, Hong Kong’s ETFs have seen a concerning trend: investor outflows. The initial excitement quickly fizzled, leaving analysts scratching their heads. So, what’s behind this crypto conundrum? Experts point to two main culprits. 
First, the US stole the show. By launching their ETFs months earlier, they established a dominant position, leaving Hong Kong playing catch-up. Second, the shadow of China looms large. Is Hong Kong the Next Crypto Hub?China’s strict stance on cryptocurrencies has investors jittery, unsure of how much support Hong Kong’s crypto ambitions truly have from their mainland neighbor. But here’s the twist: despite the rocky start, some analysts are bullish on Hong Kong’s crypto future. Rebecca Sin from Bloomberg highlights the fact that despite the outflows, total assets under management (AUM) still surpass $250 million. This suggests there’s underlying interest, and with more players entering the market, the AUM could balloon to a cool $1 billion within two years.
Hong Kong’s crypto play is a high-stakes gamble. Can they overcome the challenges and become a frontrunner in the crypto space, or will their efforts be overshadowed by regional rivals like Singapore and Dubai? Buckle up, because the next chapter in Hong Kong’s financial story is still being written.On the Flipside
Hong Kong’s ETFs come with hefty management fees compared to similar products in the US, potentially deterring cost-conscious investors.



Hong Kong’s regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could create hesitancy among investors seeking clear guidelines.



Established financial institutions in Hong Kong may be slow to embrace crypto, limiting the overall market size and investor pool.
Why This MattersHong Kong’s struggle to attract investors with their new crypto ETFs highlights the challenges traditional financial centers face in capturing a slice of the booming cryptocurrency market. The outcome could set a precedent for how established financial hubs navigate this new asset class, with implications for global crypto adoption and regulation.This article explores why Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs are failing to meet expectations, while the US market is thriving:HK’s Bitcoin ETFs Fizzle, Casting Doubt on Crypto Hub DreamsThis article discusses how the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong could potentially allow Chinese investors to indirectly invest in crypto:Are Bitcoin ETFs Poised To Reshape China’s No-Crypto Stance?

Ripple Publishes Expert Warning on Quantum Threat

Ripple published a message by mathematician Massimiliano Sala expressing his fear of the dangers quantum computing poses to blockchain encryption. Sala, a professor at the University of Trento, discussed the problem during Ripple’s university lecturer series, stressing the importance of creating robust and quantum-secure cryptosystems.Also read: Quantum Computing’s Impact on Digital SecurityPotential Risks by Quantum Identified by Mathematician SalaProf. Sala asserted that quantum computers can somehow solve digital signature-based problems easily, an opportunity that could cause a platform security breach in blockchains. This advancement, dubbed “Q-day,” will likely render present public key cryptosystems vulnerable to quantum attacks. The most likely consequence is compromised user assets and data integrity.Sala proclaimed that quantum computers can break encryption standards safeguarding blockchain systems. This implies that the security of digital assets would be greatly compromised.Development of Quantum-Resistant CryptographySala highlighted the immediate need to develop and apply quantum-resistant crypto methods to protect against forthcoming quantum attacks with blockchain technologies. This change is necessary to ensure the security and integrity of blockchain services amid the increased prevalence of the new generation of quantum technology.Sala reiterated the need to take the transition towards quantum-facing cryptosystems seriously to ensure the well-being of digital structures and cautioned that catastrophic threats of failure might affect many industries heavily dependent on blockchain.Also read: The Race to Quantum-Proof Blockchain TechnologyGlobal Efforts to Address Quantum ThreatGlobally, governments and scientific entities attentively accept the threat of quantum computing and are actively developing plans to mitigate its effects. Recent advances in quantum algorithms and hardware have increased the pace at which useful quantum systems are being employed, thus presenting a more challenging and immediate threat, Sala noted. Sala proposes to continue working with blockchain developers and encryption experts, including the current standards and innovations in quantum-safe cryptography in the designed technology. Such a preventive method is no longer a choice as risks should not be taken with digital assets, and there is a need to maintain the reliability of blockchain systems.Cryptopolitan Reporting by Emman Omwanda

India's Securities Regulator and RBI Clash Over Crypto Regulations | Cryptopolitan

India’s debate over cryptocurrency regulation heats up as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) present contrasting views to government panels. The ongoing discord highlights the struggle to align on the approach towards the cryptocurrency space, which has been a popular issue within the country’s financial and regulatory circles.Reportedly, the SEBI has taken a proactive step by suggesting that various regulators should oversee the cryptocurrency market, indicating a change towards more open regulatory attitudes. But then here comes the RBI. Will they let that happen?SEBI Proposes Multi-Regulator OversightSEBI has put forward a proposal suggesting that cryptocurrency trade should be overseen by multiple regulatory bodies, according to newly surfaced documents. This recommendation marks a clear departure from previous more cautious stances, showing a willingness among some Indian regulators to embrace the complexities of cryptocurrencies.Related: Binance and Kucoin Resume Crypto Services in IndiaSEBI’s proposal includes allowing different entities to regulate specific aspects of the cryptocurrency market. For instance, assets tied to insurance and pensions could fall under the purview of the IRDAI and the PFRDA, respectively.In addition to general oversight, SEBI also sees itself potentially regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies that are considered securities, similar to practices in the United States. This approach would involve issuing licenses for equity market-related products within the crypto industry, aiming to integrate these assets into the traditional financial system while ensuring proper oversight.RBI Maintains Call for a BanContrasting sharply with SEBI’s openness, the RBI continues to push for a complete ban on stablecoins and maintains a conservative position on private cryptocurrencies. The central bank argues that these pose a macroeconomic risk and could lead to issues like tax evasion and loss of seigniorage.According to a person close to the panel’s discussions, the RBI’s submissions emphasized the dangers of decentralized, peer-to-peer platforms which operate based on voluntary compliance, highlighting risks to fiscal stability.The RBI’s stringent view follows its historical approach that began in 2018 when it initially banned financial institutions from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges and users—a decision that was later overturned by the Supreme Court. Despite the court’s ruling, the RBI has encouraged banks to adhere strictly to stringent money laundering and foreign exchange guidelines to reduce the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.Government Weighs its Regulatory OptionsAs the government panel tasked with deciding on these recommendations moves closer to finalizing its report, the tension between SEBI’s progressive proposals and RBI’s conservative views captures a historical moment in India’s cryptocurrency regulation drama.Also Read: India’s Economic Growth Is Proving to Be SustainableThe ongoing debate also reflects a global dilemma over how best to regulate cryptocurrencies. As India dealt with its presidency of the G20 last year, it called for a global framework to regulate such assets, indicating its recognition of both the international implications and the need for a coordinated approach to cryptocurrency governance.Now the clock ticks towards the defining moment in June, and India is standing right at the edge of a regulatory revolution. Will the nation embrace crypto once and for all, or will it officially kick it to the curb?Cryptopolitan reporting by Jai Hamid

Solana hits $175, faces pullback: What's next for SOL? - AMBCrypto



Solana’s price increased by more than 20% in the last seven days. 
If the bull rally resumes, then SOL might go above $180.

Solana [SOL] managed to reclaim $175 on the 18th of May, but it soon witnessed a price correction, pushing the token’s value down. Does this mean SOL is bound to go down further in the coming days?
 Let’s take a look at SOL’s current state to find out. 
Solana back to $175
Last week was a tremendous success for Solana, as the token’s price rallied substantially. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL’s price surged by more than 20% in the last seven days, allowing it to touch $175.
 However, SOL couldn’t hold that spot as it dipped. 
At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $174.39 with a market capitalization of over $78.2 billion. 
The decline from $175 also had a negative impact on the token’s social metrics. Its Weighted Sentiment dropped sharply, meaning that bearish sentiment around it was dominant in the market. 
Nonetheless, its Social Volume remained stable.
Source: Santiment
Investors shouldn’t get disheartened, as a recent analysis suggested that SOL’s price might skyrocket. Alex Clay, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development. 
In a monthly time frame, SOL displayed a rounding bottom pattern. If this pattern tests out, then investors might soon witness SOL reach new highs. 
What to expect in the short term
AMBCrypto then analyzed SOL’s on-chain metrics to see whether investors should expect a massive surge in the near term. As per our analysis, SOL’s Funding Rate had increased sharply. 
A rise in the metric meant that derivatives investors were buying SOL. According to Coinglass’ data, SOL’s Open Interest also increased, which might serve as a push for the coin’s weekly rally.

However, concerns still remain. The coin’s fear and greed index had a value of 75% at press time, meaning that the market was in an extreme greed phase. Such numbers often result in price drops. 
We then analyzed SOL’s daily chart to see which way it was headed.
 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) looked pretty bullish, as it had a value of 64. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved in the other direction. ‘
Additionally, Solana’s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, indicating a possible price correction.

Confidential UN Report Exposes Lazarus Group's $147.5M Stolen Crypto Transfer to North Korea


																A confidential United Nations report obtained by Reuters reveals that North Korea’s notorious cybercriminal group known as the Lazarus Group transferred millions of stash of stolen cryptocurrency back to the Asian country last year.
In March 2023, these North Korean hackers illicitly took $147.5 million worth of cryptocurrency from HTX, a crypto exchange owned by TRON founder Justin Sun. A year later, they funneled the funds into the isolated nation using the sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash.
North Korea’s Cyber Warfare
According to a report submitted last week, the monitors told a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions committee that they had been probing 97 suspected North Korean cyberattacks on cryptocurrency firms between 2017 and 2024, valued at approximately $3.6 billion.
The monitors also reported that North Korean IT workers abroad earn significant income for their country based on information from U.N. member states and private companies. They were also looking into a New York Times report from February 6, which claimed that Russia had released $9 million out of $30 million in frozen North Korean assets and had permitted Pyongyang to open an account at a Russian bank in South Ossetia, facilitating better access to international banking networks.
The Lazarus Group and other North Korean hackers have executed some of the most lucrative hacks in the crypto and DeFi sectors, and Tornado Cash has been their go-to tumbler.




In 2022, the US sanctioned Tornado Cash, accusing it of aiding North Korea. In 2023, two of its co-founders were charged with facilitating over $1 billion in money laundering, including for a cybercrime group associated with North Korea.
North Korea’s Diverse Targets in $1B Crypto Theft
An earlier report released by the UNSC revealed that North Korea acquired 50% of its foreign exchange earnings from cyberattacks. The nation expanded its targeting of cryptocurrency platforms in 2023, hitting more than ever before.
However, the total amount stolen was lower compared to 2022, according to Chainalysis. Despite this decrease, the number of hacks reached a record high of 20, coinciding with a general downturn in the crypto market.
In 2023, the blockchain analysis firm estimated that the total stolen cryptocurrency amounted to just over $1 billion. Notably, North Korean hackers concentrated on DeFi, stealing approximately $429 million in the process. They also targeted centralized services, exchanges, and wallet providers, where they pilfered $150 million, $330.9 million, and $127 million, respectively.

Ripple publishes math prof’s warning: ‘public-key cryptosystems should be replaced’

Professor Massimiliano Sala, of the University of Trento in Italy, recently discussed the future of blockchain technology, as it relates to encryption and quantum computing, with the crew at Ripple as part of the company’s ongoing university lecture series. Sala’s discussion focused on the potential threat posed by quantum computers as the technology matures. According to the professor, current encryption methods could be easy for tomorrow’s quantum computers to solve, thus putting entire blockchains at risk. Source: @Ripple on X.com.Per Sala:"Quantum computers could easily solve problems that are foundational to digital signatures, thus potentially undermining the mechanisms that protect users' assets on blockchain platforms."What the professor is referring to is a hypothetical paradigm called “Q-day,” a point at which quantum computers become sufficiently powerful and available for bad actors to break classical encryption methods. While this would have far-reaching implications for any field where data security is important — including emergency services, infrastructure, banking, and defense — it could theoretically devastate the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain.Specifically, Sala warns that “all classical public-key cryptosystems should be replaced with counterparts secure against quantum attacks.” The idea here being that a future quantum computer or quantum attack algorithm could crack the encryption on these keys using mathematical brute force. It bears mention that Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency and blockchain, would fall under this category. While there currently exists no practical quantum computer capable of such a feat, governments and science institutions around the globe have been preparing for Q-day as if it’s an eventuality. For his part, Sala says that such an event may not be imminent. However, physicists at dozens of academic and commercial laboratories have demonstrated breakthroughs that have led many in the field to believe such systems could arrive within a matter of years. Ultimately, Sala says he’s satisfied with the progress being made in the sector and recommends that blockchain developers continue to work with encryption experts who understand the standards and innovations surrounding quantum-proofing modern systems.

Is XRP in 'Crab Market'? Solana (SOL) Reaches Major Resistance Level Before $200, Ethereum (ETH) Really Needs This Price Level

It seems like XRP is not making any attempt to break through the currently shown tendency in the market. The asset has barely moved since the beginning of the month, and the most recent breakthrough attempt at $0.54 only pushed the asset back below $0.50. The cryptocurrency is moving up again, but it will most likely end up in a "crab market."The term "crab market" is a state where an asset's price moves sideways without significant upward or downward trends. XRP’s price action is a textbook example. Despite occasional spikes, the overall movement is horizontal. This lack of direction can be frustrating.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewLooking at the chart, XRP has been struggling to break past the resistance levels defined by the 50-day EMA and the 100-day EMA, both of which hover around $0.54 and $0.55, respectively. These moving averages have been acting as strong barriers, preventing any substantial upward movement.Moreover, the volume is another indicator suggesting a lack of strong buying interest. Over the past weeks, the trading volume has been relatively low, indicating that traders are hesitant to commit significantly in either direction. This low volume typically accompanies a "crab market," reinforcing the idea that XRP might stay in this pattern for a while.For XRP to break out of this stagnation, it would need a significant catalyst, either from a fundamental development in the cryptocurrency market or a strong technical breakout above the resistance levels.Solana's major resistanceSolana has finally reached a crucial resistance level, which is possibly the last threshold it will have to break in order to come closer to the long-desired $200 mark. However, it is not yet obvious if Solana will be able to break through.Solana is currently testing the resistance around $175, a level that has previously acted as a strong barrier. This resistance is reinforced by the 50-day EMA, which is converging around the same price point. The recent price action suggests that bulls are trying to push the price higher, but the real test will be breaking above this resistance and sustaining the momentum.Over the past few days, there has been a noticeable increase in trading volume, indicating growing interest among traders. Increase in volume suggests there is significant buying power backing the recent price surge. For Solana to break past the $175 resistance and aim for $200, it will need continued strong volume.As for the RSI, it is approaching the overbought territory. While this indicates strong bullish momentum, it also suggests that the asset might be due for a short-term correction or consolidation before attempting another upward move. If the RSI can remain above the midline after a potential pullback, it would signal sustained bullish momentum.Historically, Solana has faced significant resistance around the $175-$180 range. Breaking this level would be a major milestone and could open the path to $200. However, failure to break through could lead to a retracement back to support levels around $155 or even $143.Ethereum needs itEther has not been the strongest cryptocurrency on the market since the beginning of the year. It struggled to hit an all-time high (ATH), lagged behind Bitcoin's performance, and the overall ecosystem did not flourish during the bull market. With ETH's price reaching a critical level, we should all hope bulls will be able to push it just a bit further.Ethereum is currently facing a significant resistance level around $3,150, marked by the 50-day EMA and the historical zone of surging selling pressure. The last time Ethereum reached the aforementioned area it quickly retraced toward $2,900.Volume is a key indicator to watch. Over the past few days, there has been a noticeable increase in trading volume, which is a positive sign. Higher volume indicates stronger buying interest and market participation. For ETH to break past the $3,150 resistance, sustained high volume is necessary.The RSI is currently hovering around the midline, suggesting that ETH is neither overbought nor oversold. This neutral RSI provides room for further upward movement if buying pressure increases. However, if the RSI approaches the overbought territory without a significant price increase, it could signal a potential pullback or consolidation.Support levels to watch include the 50-day EMA around $3,050 and the psychological support at $3,000. If ETH fails to break the $3,150 resistance, it might retrace back to these support levels. On the other hand, a successful breakout could see ETH targeting higher resistance levels around $3,300 and potentially $3,500.

Analyst Issues Chainlink Warning, Says 55% Correction for LINK Natural and Healthy Following 4X Rise - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist is warning that Chainlink (LINK) may be on the verge of a massive correction.
Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 394,500 followers on the social media platform X that the native asset of the leading decentralized oracle network appears to have printed a mid-cycle top.










According to the analyst, a deep corrective move is now in the cards for LINK after witnessing massive rallies in the last few months.
“I understand that after 10 months of up only and a 4x rally, a pullback lasting 2-3 months with a 50-60% drawdown is normal, natural and healthy.
Further, anything deeper than that but above the origin of the impulsive move is a higher low and technically totally fine.” 
Source: Credible/X
The trader uses the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rise before pulling back. Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that LINK has completed its five-wave rally and is now poised for a correction toward support at $7.26.
At time of writing, LINK is worth $16.49.
Credible is also bearish on Ethereum (ETH) scaling solution Polygon (MATIC), predicting that the altcoin will fall to support at $0.585.
“Hello MATIC my old friend, it’s time to short you once again.
Up to 5-8% more potential upside, looking for 20% downside at minimum.” 
Source: Credible/X
At time of writing, MATIC is worth $0.706.

                        The government of Paraguay will ask lawmakers to approve a bill that proposes jailing illegal Bitcoin (BTC) miners for up to 10 years.The presidential spokesperson Paula Carro told reporters on Friday May 17 that the government has sent the bill to parliament “as a matter of urgency.”
10 Years in Jail: Illegal Bitcoin Miners Face Longer Prison Terms
Carro said that the bill seeks to “punish” illegal miners with “multiple years in prison.”The draft law will also allow Paraguayan police and prosecutors to seize mining equipment from illegal operators.Per Criptonoticias, Carro also said the bill “seeks to protect the state-owned National Electricity Administration (ANDE).”She added that the “theft of large amounts of energy by illegal Bitcoin mining operators” was posing a “threat” to ANDE.The terms of the bill allow courts to impose “a maximum sentence” of a decade in jail “for the crime of energy theft.”The proposals also allow ANDE to ask police to seize mining rigs and sell these off, with the state-run firm to be “the beneficiary of the proceeds.” Bitcoin mining has boomed in Paraguay, where lawmakers have fought to bring it into the legal sphere.The country has considerable power resources that BTC miners find ideal – namely surplus hydroelectric energy.However, in recent years, many Paraguay-based miners have sought to create illegal connections to grids.And power providers have complained they are facing overloads and other issues.Police have responded by launching a crackdown.

ANDE has taken part in some 17 raids on illegal BTC and altcoin mining farms nationwide since the start of 2024.This has also led to a flurry of activity in parliament. At least 14 lawmakers have backed a private member’s bill that would effectively ban Bitcoin mining in the country.The bill proposes a “temporary” block on BTC mining “until the problem of illegal mining is resolved.”However, this bill has not yet cleared the committee phase, and it is not certain that it will reach the house for a vote.Should the government succeed with its own bill, this private member’s bill will likely be shelved.Carro that the government’s bill has the backing of the Public Ministry, ANDE, and the Paraguayan Judiciary.She concluded that illegal BTC mining “has resulted in millions of dollars worth of losses” for Paraguayan power providers.

Kraken Claims “No Plans” to Delist USDT From EU Exchange - DailyCoin


        

Kraken clarifies its stance on potentially delisting USDT. 



A company executive assures Kraken has no immediate plans to remove USDT from its listings.



Despite this assurance, the looming MiCA regulations could compel Kraken to delist USDT if Tether doesn’t comply.




Recently, rumors swirled that Kraken could be considering cutting support for USDT in the European Union ahead of the upcoming MiCA regime, which will kick in this July.



A Kraken spokesperson hinted at the exchange bracing for the worst, given Tether’s apparent disinterest in aligning with the new rules. As anxiety grew among users, Kraken’s Global Head of Asset Growth and Management, Mark Greenberg, stepped forward to set the record straight.



Kraken Sets The Record Straight



“We have no plans to delist at this time,” Greenberg said, dismissing rumors about Kraken potentially dropping USDT from the EU market. He emphasized that Kraken recognized USDT’s role in the European market and would continue to support it.




Greenberg explained that Kraken is exploring all options to keep USDT available under the upcoming MiCA regulations. He added that Kraken will comply with all legal requirements, even those they may disagree with, hinting that if Tether is ultimately banned, Kraken will adhere to the law. 



Greenberg noted that the MiCA rules regarding stablecoins still need to be finalized. Until the regulatory position is clearer, Kraken will continue offering all relevant stablecoins to its European customers.



However, with the new regulations set to take effect in July, the future of stablecoins in the EU remains uncertain.



MiCA’s Looming Threat to Stablecoins



Although they have yet to be finalized, the upcoming MiCA regime could challenge the legitimacy of many stablecoins in the region, particularly USDT. Regulators stress that many stablecoins currently in circulation in Europe have yet to be authorized and regulated.




MiCA regulations stipulate that only EMIs and credit institutions can legally issue fiat stablecoins within the European Economic Area trading bloc. This means that stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle must either become an EMI or partner with one to continue offering their products legally in the region.



Tether’s CEO confirmed that the company had no plans to comply with the new MiCA regulations in the medium term, expressing concerns about the potential risks and impacts of the new rules.



“That would pose severe risks to stablecoins regulated in the EU,” Ardoino said in response to MiCA’s added scrutiny on stablecoin issuers. He urged regulators to learn from incidents like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and its impact on a major US stablecoin. “If a bank goes bankrupt, uninsured cash goes into bankruptcy,” he warned.



Until MiCA amends its current regulations or Tether announces compliance, USDT’s legal status in the EU is expected to become illegal after July, presenting a complex dilemma for users and companies in the region.



On the Flipside




Due to USDT’s lack of interest in complying with the new MiCA rules, OKX has already removed support for the stablecoin in the EU.



MiCA is still being finalized and is expected to be fully implemented by 2025.



USDT issuer Circle is also relocating its operations from the EU to the US.




Why This Matters



The new MiCA regime can shake up the crypto industry in the EU, particularly impacting the stablecoin market. If Tether remains steadfast in its protest against the new rules, exchanges like Kraken will be forced to delist the token, leading to far-reaching implications for the trading bloc.Charles Hoskinson airs his frustration:Cardano’s Hoskinson Predicts Crypto to Decide 2024 ElectionsGenesis’ Chapter 11 receives court approval:Court Clears Genesis’ $3B Bankruptcy Plan Despite DCG Objection.

Crypto exchange Kraken has ‘no plans’ to delist USDT in Europe for now

Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has “no plans” to delist Tether (USDT) in Europe at the moment despite a recent report claiming the firm was “actively reviewing” the decision to remain legally compliant.“[Kraken] continues to list USDT in Europe and we have no plans to delist at this time,” stated Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of asset growth and management in a May 18 X post.The firm will continue to follow all legal requirements — even those that it disagrees with — Greenberg iterated. “But the rules are not finalized yet and we continue to do everything we can to continue to offer all relevant stablecoins to our European customers.”Source: Mark GreenbergA May 17 article from Bloomberg reported Kraken was “actively reviewing” plans to comply with the European Union’s upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework.“We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT,” said Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy at the time. “It’s something that we’re actively reviewing, and as the position becomes clearer, we can take firm decisions on that.”The rules applicable to stablecoins under MiCA will come into force on June 30, while cryptocurrency service provider rules will take effect six months later on Dec. 30.Related: Kraken exchange rolls out self-custody crypto wallet, following other CEXsOne of Kraken’s biggest competitors, OKX, made the move to delist USDT in Europe in March.Binance announced plans to make a similar decision last September — citing a need to comply with MiCA — but the firm hasn’t followed through with those plans yet. Kraken recently ended support for the Monero privacy token (XMR) for its Belgium and Ireland customers in April. Meanwhile, the crypto exchange has continued to expand its services in Europe. It recently secured a virtual asset service provider registration in Spain and the Netherlands, as well as an electronic money institution license in Ireland.Magazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’: Meet Vance Spencer, permabull

Crypto Whales Bet Big on Mollars, Toncoin, and Cardano


                        
                            Crypto Whales Bet Big on Mollars, Toncoin, and Cardano                        
                        

                         The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a significant shift when it comes to mainstream adoption. Embarking on the Bitcoin halving, and BTC ETF hype, the space is seeing an increase in its users.On that trend, crypto whales—investors capable of moving market trends due to their sizable funds—are also becoming more active. Interestingly enough, whales appear to be diversifying their holdings, betting on promising altcoins capable of becoming industry giants in the futureToncoin (TON): Climbing the Ranks
Toncoin has made a dramatic entrance into the top ten cryptocurrencies, surpassing well-known assets like Shiba Inu and Cardano. The catalyst for this ascent was the March announcement of Telegram’s potential initial public offering (IPO), prompting whales to accumulate TON in anticipation of a price surge. This accumulation was reflected in a significant rise in transactions valued over $100,000 and even those surpassing $1 million. Toncoin’s price experienced a staggering 238% increase, peaking at $7.24 before stabilizing around $5.35 as the initial rally cooled off.Cardano (ADA): A Steady Accumulation
Since November 2023, Cardano (ADA) has seen a notable increase in accumulation by crypto whales. This trend has picked up significantly in recent days, with transactions exceeding $100,000—typically the hallmark of whale activity—becoming more frequent.Although this surge in whale activity hasn’t yet translated into a significant price increase, the growing interest from these big players could eventually provide a boost to Cardano’s market value. Despite holding less than 10% of ADA’s circulating supply, these whales play a crucial role in driving daily trading volumes, suggesting that their sustained interest could herald positive price movements in the near future.Arbitrum (ARB): Preparing for a Rally
Despite undergoing price corrections for nearly two months, Arbitrum (ARB) remains a focus for crypto whales. These investors have been steadily accumulating ARB, possibly to stave off further price drops and to position themselves advantageously for future gains.The anticipation of a Bitcoin halving event has driven much of this activity, as whales prepare for a potential market rally. Additionally, the upcoming token unlock on May 16, which will introduce over $100 million worth of tokens into the market, is expected to impact prices. Whales might be looking to sell before this event to capitalize on their investments. Mollars (MOL): The New Darling of Whales
According to a recent report from CryptoNews, whale investors are moving their profits from Shiba Inu (SHIB) to the up-and-coming Mollars (MOL), reflecting a broader trend of seeking high-potential opportunities. A prominent investor known as ‘King Shrimp’ has been gradually acquiring Mollars during the presale, employing a Dollar Cost Averaging strategy to mitigate market volatility and optimize returns. This methodical approach highlights the confidence that large investors have in Mollars’ growth potential.Mollars’ presale has gained substantial traction, buoyed by announcements from major exchanges such as BitMart, LBank, and XT that they will list $MOL on their platforms post-ICO on May 31st. So far the new project sold over 28% of its total supply, garnering over $1.3 million from sales.This has generated considerable excitement within the crypto community, as the token’s design as a deflationary store-of-value asset, combined with its scarcity—capped at just 10 million tokens—positions it as a highly desirable investment. The prospect of Mollars becoming one of the year’s most sought-after tokens seems increasingly likely, especially given the strong early interest and strategic whale investments. With its strategic exchange listings, Mollars is set to be introduced to over 24 million users worldwide, further enhancing its market presence and appeal.

Bitcoin repeats THIS historical pattern: Is a bull rally coming? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin saw a sharp rally in early May.
The drop below the SSR oscillator bands was seen then- but will we see an extended rally hereon?

Bitcoin [BTC] was trading at $67k at press time and threatened to break out past the range that it consolidated within over the past month.
Fears around sell-offs around the halving period were losing strength.
Bitcoin ETFs also saw inflows over the past week, indicating a tangible increase in demand. The push to the range highs relieved the selling pressure of recent weeks, but can the bulls manage a breakout?
Gauging the ammo reserves of the bulls
A crypto analyst highlighted in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) oscillator showed bullishness.
The technical indicator assesses stablecoin market sentiment relative to Bitcoin over time.
It is calculated by taking the current SSR and its difference with the 200-period simple moving average. This value is divided by its standard deviation over the same period to arrive at a set of Bollinger Bands (BB).
The current stablecoin supply is plotted over these bands to give traders insights into what the market sentiment is like.
When the SSR falls below the lower Bollinger Band, it indicates low stablecoin dominance and potential bullish sentiment.

The chart above highlights how the market tends to pull back when the oscillator is overheated. Conversely, when the lower bands are breached, it generally provides a good long-term buying opportunity.
Like any other technical indicator, the SSR oscillator was not infallible, and each signal was not a guarantee of a price move in the expected direction.
We are still within a “buy” signal

The stablecoin supply ratio was below the 200-period SMA but above the lower BB. It fell below this band in early May, when Bitcoin prices reached $56k. However, the price immediately rebounded higher.
The oscillator was still in the lower BB and suggested that further gains were likely. The SSR also saw a downtrend over the past month.

The metric has been aggressively trending higher since October 2023. Periods of stasis or pullback such as early January and mid-May were present.
A month after the January pullback, Bitcoin prices rocketed higher to breach the $46k resistance with ease. Perhaps in the next 2–4 weeks, we might see a Bitcoin rally push well beyond the $73k resistance.

                        A Russian court has sent a Finiko executive to prison for three years, after finding her guilty of helping to mastermind the biggest crypto scam in “post-Soviet history.”Per Izvestia, Liliya Nurieva, the former head of networks at Finiko, was handed a four and a half year term at a court in Vakhitovsky, Kazan on May 17.However, the court said it would consider the time she had already spent in pre-trial custody as “time served.”The judge rejected prosecutors’ requests to jail Nurieva for six and a half years.Finiko Crypto Scam: First Exec Jailed
The media outlet explained that Nurieva had been facing a 10-year jail term before her trial.But, it revealed, the former executive struck a “pre-trial agreement” with prosecutors.The executive’s lawyer told media representatives that Nurieva intended to appeal the sentence. She was found guilty of fraud and organized crime-related offences.Former Finiko executive Liliya Nurieva at her trial in Kazan on May 24.

And Finiko offices throughout the country closed “almost overnight.”The Finiko executives have since blamed one another for the collapse. But during its heydey, Finiko was a huge hit on social media.Investors Attend Court Hearing
Initial reports claimed that almost 10,000 people may have invested their money on Finiko platforms.The firm was given a veneer of authenticity through the well-spoken Doronin.Sabirov, meanwhile, is the former business partner of Russia’s ex-Communications Minister Nikolai Nikiforov.Nuriyeva’s lawyer told the court that her client had no idea that Finiko was a scam when she joined the company.The lawyer added that Nuriyeva had even invested her own money in the company, and only realized it was fraudulent “during her later communication with senior executives.”Several Finiko investors attended the trial. Izvestia quoted one of them, Lyudmila Yamshchikova from Kazan, as explaining:“At one point the [Finiko] payments stopped. They just stopped, all of a sudden. I invested almost [$11,000]. I was counting on the payments, as I was using them to pay off my mortgage. Half of our city bought apartments, cars, and took out loans because of Finiko. But then the withdrawals just dried up.”

Vitalik Buterin Says 'Proud' Ethereum Doesn't Censor Critical Views, Social Media Users Complain The Reality Is Opposite - Benzinga

Ethereum ETH/USD co-founder and one of the biggest voices in the cryptocurrency space, Vitalik Buterin, praised the ecosystem's free speech ideals. However, the assertion faced backlash from a group of people on social media.What Happened: The man behind one of the biggest blockchain projects took to social platform X to take pride in Ethereum's culture of welcoming criticism and not silencing voices with negative feedback on its work."Some wave the ideal of “open discourse” as a flag, some take it seriously," Buterin said, in an apparent dig at censorship happening on other blockchain platforms. These claims, however, were challenged by social media users who narrated facing significant censorship by Ethereum influencers. An X user going by the pseudonym dubzy responded, "Well I told someone that eth fees were expensive and he abused me for 13 minutes, explain that?" Matthew Gould, founder and CEO of blockchain firm Unstoppable Domains, said he faced the exact opposite of what Buterin preached, including heavy censorship by some projects on the network and condemnation of divergent opinions on their operations.Why It Matters: Constructive criticism of technology and processes is critical to any industry’s overall progress, as any expert will tell you.Solana SOL/USD co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko endorsed Buterin's view and deemed it an industry-wide phenomenon."The whole industry is awesome. You don't see Microsoft and Google and Apple engineers all in one chat room constantly challenging each others design decisions," Yakavenko wrote while responding to Buterin's post.Price Action: At the time of writing, Ethereum was exchanging hands at $3,089.07, down 1.43% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Photo by Alexey Smyshlyaev on Shutterstock.Read Next: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum Retrace On Profit-Taking By Retail Investors: Analyst Predicts Parabolic Rise For King Crypto Following Consolidation Phase

London Police Arrest Alleged Pump.fun Exploiter


British police reportedly have arrested Jarett Dunn, known online as @STACCoverflow, for allegedly exploiting the Solana meme coin protocol pump.fun.
The arrest follows an over 24-hour intelligence operation that tracked Dunn’s movements through social media and other open sources.
London Police Arrest Alleged Pump.fun Exploiter Jarett Dunn

The pump.fun protocol, exploited on May 16, had previously employed Dunn. After the attack, he openly criticized the company on social media. Dunn expressed his intention to disrupt the platform and stated he was not worried about going to jail.
A private intelligence firm, hired by a third-party stakeholder, tracked Dunn’s movements using his social media posts and other open-source intelligence. The timing of his last post on the X account @STACCverflow matched the arrest. A recent Instagram post showed him at a London strip club, which helped identify his whereabouts.
After hours of search in London’s Covent Garden neighborhood, local authorities found Dunn at the Middle Eight Hotel and arrested him.

Dunn’s arrest has sparked significant reactions in the crypto community. On his @JarrettDunn X account, he confirmed spending the night in custody.

“I spent overnight in custody as the Pump team alleges I stole $2 million of their ill-gotten gains with conspiracy to steal another $80 million,” he wrote.

Dunn explained that the pump.fun’s team appeared to be claiming total value locked (TVL) as their money in the charge. Therefore, he urged investors to withdraw their money from pump.fun immediately. He also called for UK citizens to file charges against a company he identified as pump.fun’s corporate entity.

Dunn plans to remain in the UK until his court appearance, which is scheduled for August. He was released on bail.

Shiba Inu: Shibarium transactions decline massively: Will it affect SHIB? - AMBCrypto



Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain for Shiba Inu, has seen a big drop in transactions by 97%.
SHIB’s price has increased by 10% over the last month, maintaining its market rank at No. 12 with a $14.6 billion cap.

Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain underpinning the popular meme coin Shiba Inu [SHIB], is experiencing a huge drop in transaction activity. 
For about a month now, transaction volumes have plummeted dramatically by nearly 97%. This decline has triggered an examination into the state of Shibarium and its potential impact on SHIB’s price.
Despite these challenges, the overall transaction volume on Shibarium since its launch last August reflects a total of 417,479,277 transfers, so there is a slow but steady growth in activity, year-on-year.
A closer look at the tumble
The transaction peak on Shibarium reached an all-time high of 562,990 daily transactions on the 17th of April. Fast-forward to today, and the figure has drastically fallen to just 11.
Source: Shibariumscan.io
The press time price of Shiba Inu stood at $0.0000248, with SHIB maintaining its position as the 12th ranked cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, which was around $14.6 billion at press time. 
Despite the transaction slowdown, SHIB has seen a price increase of 10% over the past month and a modest 2.44% rise over the last seven days. 
These price movements tell us that investor sentiment may still be relatively bullish on the second-largest meme coin.
The press time market sentiment towards Shiba Inu, as indicated by technical indicators, remained overwhelmingly bullish with an 83% bullish rating. 
Additionally, the Fear & Greed Index shows a score of 73, classified under ‘Greed’. The bulls were still in control.
How SHIB is doing now
Coinglass data showed that there has been a 19.24% drop in trading volume, coupled with a slight 1.58% decline in Open Interest.
This reflected reduced trading activity and potentially waning short-term interest among traders.
Source: Coinglass
The recent market activity for SHIB demonstrates a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, as shown by the inconsistent trading volumes and uncertain market sentiment.

Read Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] Price Prediction 2024-2025

Given the current inconsistency and volatility shown in the chart, SHIB might continue to experience fluctuations with a slight bearish bias in the short term. 
Investors and traders should watch for either a sustained break below the 0.00002475 support or a rebound that pushes past the recent high for clearer direction.

Cardano's Hoskinson Predicts Crypto to Decide 2024 Elections - DailyCoin


        

Charles Hoskinson airs his frustrations against President Biden’s administration. 



The Cardano Founder makes eye-opening allegations and statements.



Hoskinson warns that crypto will be the kingmaker for the upcoming elections.




The US crypto industry has barely had time to catch its breath in its intense multi-year battle with the current administration. The relentless push for onerous regulations and regulatory crackdown on digital assets has driven countless companies to seek friendlier shores, costing the US economy trillions in potential revenue.



As the industry continues its exponential growth and increasing influence, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson claims President Biden’s staunch anti-crypto stance might cost him another term in the White House.



Hoskinson Notes There’s a Systematic Effort to Hurt the Industry



Charles Hoskinson does not mince words when it comes to his dissatisfaction with President Biden’s administration and its anti-crypto stance. In his latest social media post, the Cardano founder aired his frustrations, vividly depicting the industry’s tireless efforts to engage with key decision-makers. 




He noted that the crypto community has spared no effort in fostering understanding, highlighting numerous policy meetings, private dinners, and open letters as part of their efforts. However, despite these endeavors, regulators remain persistent in their campaign against the industry.



The crypto pundit pointed to high-profile cases, such as Robinhood, Coinbase, Binance, and Uniswap, all receiving Wells notices from the SEC, as evidence of regulators’ systematic effort to hurt the crypto industry. 



While expressing his frustrations, the Cardano founder singled out Senator Elizabeth Warren as the driving force behind the current administration’s anti-crypto stance.



Hoskinson Singles Out Sen. Elizabeth Warren 



The Cardano founder raised eyebrows by suggesting a clandestine pact between President Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. He insinuated that Biden brokered a deal with Warren to drop out of the presidential race in exchange for control over domestic treasury policy.




Hoskinson added that Warren, known for her staunch anti-crypto stance, extended her influence into the treasury department, handpicking people who shared her distaste for the crypto industry, leading to an administration that heavily leaned anti-crypto. 



The crypto pundit lamented the prevailing anti-crypto narrative, and actions painted crypto as fundamentally harmful to the American people. This perception, he argued, effectively labeled a vast portion of the population as criminals.



“53 million Americans, regardless of their politics and preferences, are soft criminals,” Hoskinson claimed. 



The Cardano founder conveyed deep concern over the repercussions of this hostile environment, citing that many of his friends, including Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, are currently in jail because of it. 



He expressed a sense of defeat, suggesting little hope for the industry. 



Hoskinson Claims Crypto Will Be Kingmaker



The Cardano founder noted the dichotomy of the Biden administration’s inviting crypto companies to register and engage in dialogue without providing a solid and transparent regulatory framework for them to do so effectively. He underscored the urgent need for clarity and consistency in regulation to ensure the industry’s legitimacy and growth.



Amidst his frustration, Hoskinson offered an eye-opening insight: the potential political ramifications of the administration’s anti-crypto stance. 



“If this President loses his job and crypto is the decider, no Democrat running in 2028 will be anti-crypto,” Hoskinson asserted. 



The Cardano founder further noted that the current administration is campaigning against the crypto industry because it believes there are no political consequences to its actions. Hoskinson emphasized that it is up to the voters to create that political consequence by voting President Biden out. 



Hoskinson ended his video by emphasizing the pivotal role of voters in shaping the political landscape, highlighting the importance of electing officials who embrace crypto. He envisioned a future where the next generation of congress members, senators, and presidents are crypto natives, paving the way for a more inclusive and progressive regulatory environment.



On the Flipside




In response to Biden’s anti-crypto stance, former President Donald Trump promised support for the besieged US crypto industry. 



At press time, only 17% of Americans have invested in digital assets. 



Charles Hoskinson believes the current administration has a hidden agenda of integrating CBDCs called Chokepoint 2.0. 




Why This Matters



The crypto industry will certainly play a deciding factor in the upcoming elections. As the industry faces numerous punitive measures and crackdowns, frustrations against the current administration have reached an all-time high. Charles Hoskinson’s prediction carries significant weight in this context.Genesis’ Chapter 11 plan greenlit:Court Clears Genesis’ $3B Bankruptcy Plan Despite DCG Objection.Will Kraken delist USDT?Kraken Mulls Delisting Tether’s USDT From the EU Market

In November 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated a lawsuit against Kraken. The SEC alleged it had been operating an unregistered securities trading platform. This suit came months after settling charges over Kraken’s former staking service.In February 2024, Kraken filed to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that it relied solely on a registration-based argument regarding Kraken’s operation as an unlicensed securities entity. Kraken argued that cryptocurrencies listed as SEC-compliant should be treated like commodities and not securities.However, now Kraken has escalated its position, urging the court to dismiss the claims to avoid a “significant reordering” of the US financial regulatory structure, according to court filings submitted in the Northern District of California on Thursday.The SEC filed an opposition to Kraken’s motion to dismiss, asserting that its enforcement action falls within its congressionally granted authority. They emphasize its role in enforcing registration requirements for securities intermediaries. Kraken urged the U.S. court to dismiss the SEC claims against it to avoid a “significant reordering” of the US financial regulatory structure.There has been discussion over stablecoins Tether’s USDT and USD Coin USDC specifically exploring which one is safer.  In April, USDT’s market capitalization of $104 billion is more than triple USDC’s $32 billion market capitalization. Part of the delta can be attributed to the network effect. USDT launched in 2014, whereas USDC launched in 2018, long after USDT became a popular asset for trading pairs on crypto exchanges. The exchange role in USDT’s dominance is evident in daily trading volume in which USDT trading volume is 7.5 times as high as USDC trading volume.

Peter Schiff Says 'Bitcoin Is Dead, Long Live Silver' But Is It Really True? - Benzinga

Well-known economist and fierce Bitcoin BTC/USD critic, Peter Schiff, tried downplaying the cryptocurrency's recent surge, highlighting its underperformance relative to silver.What Happened: Using a previous April 3 post as a reference, Schiff underlined how the King Crypto has grown only 2% since then, while silver racked up gains of 21% in the same period.At his usual taunting best, the precious metals advocate addressed the pro-Bitcoin crowd, saying, "That’s more than 10x the bang for your buck with silver. Bitcoin is dead. Long live silver."Well-known cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen responded to Schiff's post with a GIF saying, "Cherry picking of data is an old problem."Why It Matters: Schiff has been criticized for coming up with small timeframe windows as per his liking to highlight Bitcoin's weaknesses and exaggerate the performance of assets he supports. Over a longer period, though, Bitcoin was seen outperforming the white metal. Year-to-date, the apex cryptocurrency jumped 58% in value, while silver grew by 35%. In the last year, Bitcoin has surged nearly 150%, dwarfing silver's gains of 34% in the same time. In a cheeky retort, a user digged out one of Schiff's old posts from 2018 and highlighted how Bitcoin surged over 1000% since then while gold—another precious metal that Schiff heavily endorses—grew by less than 60%. While the bullion market gains in 2024 have been noteworthy, few assets are presently matching Bitcoin’s remarkable climb this year, driven largely by its increased exposure to traditional markets via spot ETFs.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $$66,698.41, down 0.80% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Vitalik Buterin Says ‘Proud’ Ethereum Doesn’t Censor Critical Views, Social Media Users Complain The Reality Is Opposite

Tether Mints $1 Billion in USDT, Paving the Way for Bitcoin's Next All-Time High



                    

Tether‘s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, has minted another $1 billion, raising its market capitalization to over $110 billion. 



This could potentially drive Bitcoin to new all-time highs.




In the past 24 hours, Tether’s treasury minted $1 billion worth of USDT, bringing its annual total to $31 billion. 



According to a May 17 post from Lookonchain, this significant minting contributed to Bitcoin’s price rise from $27,000 to $73,000.



Tether is also directly investing in Bitcoin. 



The company plans to invest 15% of its net profit in Bitcoin to diversify its stablecoin’s backing assets. 



As of March 31, Tether had acquired 8,888 BTC worth $618 million, making it the seventh-largest Bitcoin holder globally, per Bitinfocharts. 



Currently, Tether’s wallet holds over 78,317 BTC, valued at more than $5.18 billion, one year after announcing its diversification plan.



Bitcoin’s price movements are also influenced by institutional investments in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 




According to Dune, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have seen over $200 million in net inflows over the past two weeks.

These institutional inflows have been crucial to Bitcoin’s current rally to new all-time highs. 



By February 15, Bitcoin ETFs accounted for about 75% of new investments in Bitcoin as it crossed the $50,000 mark.



On May 16, Bitcoin’s price confirmed a breakout on the daily chart, with $65,000 acting as strong support, according to TradingView. 



Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted in a May 16 X post that Bitcoin had turned its old resistance into support on the monthly chart, indicating a bullish trend.



However, Bitcoin might still experience a temporary correction to below $63,500 before reclaiming the $70,000 psychological mark. 



ScorehoodAI’s prediction algorithm suggested a pullback to around $63,000-$63,500, calling it a healthy correction to liquidate high-leveraged positions. 



A drop below $63,500 would liquidate over $1.76 billion in leveraged long positions, and under $63,000, liquidations would reach $1.87 billion, according to Coinglass data.

BNB Coin Price Hits Critical Support Level: Is a Rebound on the Horizon?


																BNB price started a downside correction from the $585 zone. The price must stay above $570 to start a fresh increase in the near term.

BNB price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $585 resistance zone.
The price is now trading below $580 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $570 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance).
The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $570 support.

BNB Price Holds Support
After a decent increase, BNB price struggled near the $585 resistance. As a result, there was a bearish reaction below the $580 support, like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
The price dipped below the $575 support and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It traded as low as $571 and is currently consolidating losses. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $570 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair.
There was a minor upward move above the $575 level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $586 swing high to the $571 low. It is now trading below $580 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
Immediate resistance is near the $578 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $586 swing high to the $571 low. The next resistance sits near the $582 level.
Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com
A clear move above the $582 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $588. A close above the $588 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $600 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $612 level in the coming days.
More Losses?
If BNB fails to clear the $582 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $572 level and the trend line.
The next major support is near the $562 level. The main support sits at $550. If there is a downside break below the $550 support, the price could drop toward the $532 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $525 level.
Technical Indicators
Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone.
Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level.

Venezuela Pulls Plug on Crypto Mining to Prevent Grid Overload - DailyCoin


        

The Venezuelan national power grid is under a lot of stress due to increasing demands.



The government has taken action against high-consumption activities like crypto mining to alleviate pressure on the power grid.



The government has banned all crypto mining to regulate the country’s power grid. 




Crypto mining emerged as a beacon of hope for many grappling with Venezuela’s skyrocketing inflation and economic instability. With electricity costs among the lowest in the world, crypto mining offered a lifeline to citizens and businesses seeking financial refuge. 



Yet, as the allure of crypto mining in the country grew and more Venezuelans turned to digital assets, the strain on the country’s power grid became palpable. Faced with this dilemma, the government could no longer ignore the impact on the nation’s energy resources, prompting an unfortunate but much-needed response. 



Venezuela Bans Crypto Mining



Amid Venezuela’s struggle with energy shortages and infrastructural challenges, the Venezuelan National Power Ministry announced plans to disconnect all Bitcoin and crypto mining farms from the national grid. 




The agency explained that it aimed to regulate excessive energy consumption by banning all crypto mining farms in the country from the national grid. 



Spearheading this initiative, Rafael Lacava, governor of Carabobo, led a series of decisive actions resulting in the seizure of over 11,000 ASICs and the shutdown of numerous mining farms.



Governor Lacava has also prompted public collaboration in detecting illegal crypto mining operations in the country, encouraging citizens to report any unlawful activities.  




Lacava emphasized that such measures were essential to stabilize the country’s power grid and offer reliable service to its citizens, especially since the country has been experiencing recurring blackouts since 2019, which have had far-reaching implications for overall economic activity. 



While the authorities have yet to clarify the permanence of these actions, Governor Lacava warned that the national grid would disconnect more bitcoin farms and undertake other measures, including announcing a national executive order to reduce the energy consumption of state agencies in the next few days.



On the Flipside




In March 2023, Venezuela’s energy supplier shut down crypto mining facilities nationwide as part of corruption investigations involving the country’s state oil company.



A recent crackdown in Venezuela involved the confiscation of 2,000 crypto mining ASIC in Maracay as part of an anti-corruption initiative.




Why This Matters



Crypto mining emerged as a saving grace for countless Venezuelans grappling with soaring inflation and instability. Yet, this lifeline came at a cost—frequent blackouts and energy shortages. While the ban aims to restore stability to Venezuela’s energy infrastructure, it poses a dilemma for those dependent on crypto mining for their livelihoods.Will Kraken delist USDT from its exchange?Kraken Claims “No Plans” to Delist USDT From EU ExchangeCharles Hoskinson predicts crypto to be kingmaker for 2024 elections:Cardano’s Hoskinson Predicts Crypto to Decide 2024 Elections

Will This Week’s Economic Events Rattle Crypto Markets?


																The highlights of the economic week ahead are the Federal Reserve meeting minutes and a big earnings report from semiconductor giant Nvidia.
There are also reports on global manufacturing and services indexes and consumer inflation expectations which could influence markets a little.
Economic Calendar May 20-24
Last week saw the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) cross the 40,000 mark for the first time. The stock rally was boosted by favorable figures in the CPI report, which ignited speculation that the US economy is cooling and that the central bank may cut rates in the next few months.
The minutes of the Federal Reserve FOMC May meeting will be revealed on Wednesday this week. These may offer more insight into monetary policy going forward and a projected rate-cut timeline.
On Thursday, May’s Global Manufacturing PMI preliminary report will be released, capturing business conditions in the manufacturing sector.




May 23 also sees a similar PMI report for the services sector. This is a crucial leading indicator since the services sector is responsible for over 70% of the total US GDP and a signal for changing economic conditions.
Friday, we will see May’s Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which measures inflation expectations. These reports portray the results of a monthly survey of consumer confidence levels in the country.


Wednesday also has a highly-anticipated quarterly revenue report from semiconductor giant Nvidia which could keep tech stocks and crypto on a roll.
“Bulls want Nvidia to extend the run into record highs, and bears want Nvidia to mark the top,” commented the Kobeissi Letter on May 19.
Markets in Asia ticked up on Monday, May 20, tracking Wall Street gains. Investors in the region are awaiting their own sets of economic data this week with eyes on Japan for inflation data and South Korea for a rates decision.
Crypto Market Impact
With no major economic events this week, it is unlikely that crypto markets will be heavily impacted, and volatility is likely to remain low.
Crypto markets were buoyed last week, with total capitalization topping $2.5 trillion and holding gains over the weekend. They have dipped a little over the past 24 hours, however, with a 1.2% decline.
Bitcoin fell to an intraday low of $66,000 but found support there and returned to $67,000 at the time of writing during Monday morning’s Asian trading session.
Ethereum has dropped 1.3% on the day in a fall back to $3,078 after reaching a weekend high of $3,142. The altcoins were predominantly in the red this Monday morning.

                        Judge Sean Lane greenlit Genesis Global’s Chapter 11 plan on Friday, allowing the defunct crypto lender to repay creditors roughly $3b in crypto and cash.In a win for customers, the judge’s decision paves the way for Genesis to return frozen assets finally. Withdrawals have been halted on the platform since Nov. 2022, following the downfall of other major crypto firms.Bloomberg reported that Judge Lane dismissed Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) legal challenge, stating that Genesis’ parent company lacked the authority to contest the Chapter 11 plan. As an equity holder of Genesis, DCG stands last in line for repayment, according to Judge Lane. The judge noted that creditors are prioritized ahead of DCG and are not receiving full repayment.Genesis’ parent company, DCG, might challenge Judge Lane’s decision in court.Bitcoin Boom Triggers Legal Battle as Genesis Clashes with DCG Over Windfall
A surge in crypto prices since Genesis’s bankruptcy filing has sparked a fight between the lender and its parent company, DCG. Their disagreement centers on who gets the windfall, with Bitcoin jumping from around $21,000 in Jan. 2023 to $67,000 today.On Friday, Genesis attorney Sean O’Neal disagreed with DCG’s claim that customers could receive payment “in full” considering the lower crypto prices observed in Jan. 2023.“Given the size of the creditor claims, DCG is out of the money as an equity holder by billions of dollars,” Judge Lane said.Bitcoin Stability Key to Genesis Fulfilling Creditors’ Claims in Bankruptcy
Genesis anticipates being able to fulfill claims from a minimum of 77% of its customers. This is contingent on Bitcoin’s value remaining stable. However, it faces even more obligations to state and federal regulators for $32b.Most creditors who were owed money approved the lender’s bankruptcy plan. This involves participants in Gemini Earn. Genesis operated this lending program with Gemini Trust Co., which is owned by the Winklevoss twins.Genesis is prioritizing returning crypto to customers wherever possible. However, it lacks enough crypto to fully repay everyone it owes.In February, Genesis received approval to sell its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares valued at more than $1.3b, as part of efforts to repay customers.

Former Binance CEO CZ Zhao Plans to Write During Four-Month Prison Term



                    

Former Binance CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, plans to “write something” during his upcoming four-month prison term. Judge Richard Jones sentenced Zhao on April 30 to four months in prison after he pleaded guilty to one felony charge for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance. 



Zhao is expected to serve his time either at the Federal Correctional Institution Sheridan in Oregon or the Federal Detention Center SeaTac in Washington, though the reporting date was not determined at the time of publication.




Despite his legal troubles, CZ has remained active on social media. 



He launched Giggle Academy, a youth-focused crypto and blockchain education program, and engaged with his 8.9 million followers on X, seeking suggestions on how to pass the time in prison.



With a net worth of $33 billion, CZ would be one of the wealthiest individuals to serve time in prison. 




His legal team argued that his wealth and status could make him a target for theft and extortion, potentially influencing the judge’s decision to allow him to remain free until the Probation or Pretrial Services Office decides his reporting details.



During this period, Zhao has kept himself busy, mentioning on X that he has “nothing else to do” but read books and wait for his reporting date.

He pleaded guilty in November 2023 and has since been free on a $175 million bond, restricted to travel within certain U.S. areas.




The Federal Bureau of Prisons is likely considering which facility would be safest for Zhao, given that both FDC SeaTac and FCI Sheridan house violent offenders. 



According to the Probation or Pretrial Services Office of the Western District of Washington, presentence reports help the Bureau designate suitable institutions, select prison programs, and develop case plans for custody and eventual release.



In November, Zhao paid a $50 million penalty as part of a deal between Binance and U.S. authorities. 



Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion to settle civil regulatory enforcement actions, though this did not resolve a separate lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

                        LayerZero Labs has identified a total of 800,000 addresses as potential sybil addresses, rendering them ineligible for the full token allocation.Initially, the team had identified over two million addresses as potential sybils, but they later refined their criteria to minimize false identifications.In a recent post on X, the team announced the end of the sybil self-reporting phase in their initiative to combat sybil activity, commonly known as “airdrop farming.”The project aims to address the issue of users creating multiple fake accounts to gain unfair advantages in token allocations.According to LayerZero, addresses meeting the specified criteria will receive 15% of their expected token allocation, while the remaining 85% will be redistributed to eligible users.LayerZero Reveals List of Sybil Addresses
The complete list of addresses, including both self-reported ones and those identified through initial examinations conducted by LayerZero, Chaos Labs, and Nansen, has been made public.On May 3, LayerZero introduced a self-reporting mechanism, offering sybil users 15% of their planned token allocation as a reward for honesty within a defined 14-day period. The team clarified that the initial analysis aimed to identify large-scale industrial sybil clusters and that the released list aims to exclude these clusters from bounty hunting eligibility.However, it should be noted that the list is not considered definitive until the final report is published, as addresses may be removed or added as calculations are refined.The sybil bounty hunting process commenced on May 18 at 2:00 pm UTC and will continue until May 31, 11:59 pm UTC.Participants are required to report a minimum of 20 addresses along with a clear methodology to be eligible for a reward of 10% of the intended token allocation for each reported sybil address.The bounties will be awarded to the first eligible reporter of a specific address.The LayerZero team is continuously working to improve the accuracy of their methodology, but the initial list of identified addresses will remain unchanged throughout the bounty hunt.Bounty hunters can proceed with their work without concerns about the initial list, as the final and authoritative list will be shared once the bounty hunt concludes.Sybil Farming Becomes Prevalent
Sybil farming, the act of creating multiple fake accounts to unfairly acquire tokens or rewards, has become a prevalent issue in decentralized finance protocols.Airdrops, which reward early users with newly issued cryptocurrencies, are widely employed by these protocols to generate more engagement.LayerZero’s ZRO was the first Hyperp (Hyperliquid-only perp) to launch on the HyperLiquid perpetual futures decentralized exchange in September 2023.Instances of sybil farming have been observed in the crypto space before. In 2022, Optimism disqualified over 17,000 suspected wallets engaged in sybil activity from its airdrop, accounting for 6.83% of eligible wallets.Similarly, in September, a network named ZkSync Era discovered 21,877 wallets involved in sybil farming activities, where the wallets were transacting a closed-source token among themselves using a private decentralized exchange.

                        Ripple’s recent report highlights Professor Massimiliano Sala’s call for new cryptographic systems to protect blockchain from quantum computing threats.In an interview with Ripple, the mathematics professor at University of Trento explained that current encryption methods might be vulnerable to quantum computers as they evolve. He emphasized the importance of developing ‘quantum-resistant’ cryptographic systems.Ripple and Professor Address Quantum Computing Threats
When addressing the industry’s future, Sala highlighted the vulnerabilities quantum computing introduces to blockchain security. He noted that quantum computers could solve problems foundational to digital signatures, threatening blockchain platforms.“Quantum computers could easily solve problems that are foundational to digital signatures, thus potentially undermining the mechanisms that protect users’ assets on blockchain platforms,” said Sala.Despite these concerns, he pointed out the proactive efforts within the cryptographic community to develop “post-quantum” cryptographic schemes, aiming to secure blockchain systems against quantum attacks.According to Sala, the transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems is vital for maintaining the integrity and security of blockchain infrastructures.“All classical public-key cryptosystems should be replaced with counterparts secure against quantum attacks,” said Sala.Technical Challenges and Educational Need
He also elaborated on the technical difficulties, such as increased computational demands and larger data sizes for secure transactions. Yet, Sala remained optimistic about the ongoing research to optimize these implementations for practical use.Sala praised international collaboration efforts, such as the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization process, which promote the creation of cryptographic standards resistant to quantum attacks.He stated that this collaborative approach could ensure new schemes undergo rigorous community-wide evaluation, enhancing their reliability and security.In addition, Sala suggested the integration of modern cryptographic methods into traditional academic curricula for education, targeting the emerging challenges in the sector.“The probability of quantum threats materializing may not be imminent,” said Sala. “But it is significant enough to warrant proactive measures.”

Linux Inventor Says He Doesn’t Believe in Crypto


Finnish-American software engineer Linus Torvalds, who is best known for creating the Linux operating system, does not believe in cryptocurrencies, according to his recent forum post.  The 54-year-old computer scientist slammed the newfangled asset class as a "great vehicle for scams." He also went on to mention that cryptocurrencies function as a typical Ponzi scheme that aims to find "the next sucker holding the bag.""Nor do I believe in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, or the Easter bunny," he quipped. A Satoshi candidate? It is worth noting that the godfather of the open-source movement, who has also created the distributed version control system Git, was once rumored to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Torvalds, who created the Linux kernel when he was 21, had the necessary set of skills for coming up with the idea of Bitcoin, which made him one of the likely candidates. The rumors were fueled by Torvalds allegedly changing a single name in the Linux Kernel to "Name = I am Satoshi" back in January 2022.However, Torvalds explained that it was simply a "jokester" who took advantage of GitHub's modus operandi to make it seem like their git object was in his tree.  He went on to clarify that the rumors were just "empty noise," adding that he was not the owner of a huge Bitcoin fortune. No technological singularity In his post, Torvalds also rejected the idea of technological singularity, dismissing it as a "bedtime story for children". "But unlike the very hungry caterpillar, it also makes for great click-bait stories that you can make up," he joked.Even though the legendary computer scientist admits that it is a great sci-fi concept, continuous exponential growth does not make sense to him. "We are very much seeing the limits getting closer," Torvalds added.

This is Why Bitcoin DeFi Could Be the Next Big Thing


Bitcoin developers are exploring the next growth frontier, i.e., programmability through decentralized finance (DeFi). Recent developments suggest that Bitcoin’s adaptability could soon rival Ethereum’s, potentially catalyzing significant market expansion.
Following the launch of the first US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the latest Bitcoin “halving,” the community has turned its focus toward the future of Bitcoin’s ecosystem. 
Bitcoin Developers Work on Enabling Programmability

The spotlight is now on DeFi’s potential to transform Bitcoin from merely digital gold into a more dynamic, programmable platform. Toby Lewis, the co-founder of the Ordinals project – OrdinalsBot, believes that the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could grow to be the largest in the entire crypto ecosystem.
Currently, the Bitcoin total value locked (TVL) stands at $1.137 billion.

“It is possible that the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could grow to trillions of dollars of market cap over the next few years, and it appears to be one of the major drivers of growth in crypto this cycle.”

Traditionally, Bitcoin has been viewed as a store of value with limited functionality beyond investment. Unlike Ethereum, which supports a rich ecosystem of apps and smart contracts, Bitcoin has lacked these capabilities. However, developers are now pushing to bridge this gap through innovative solutions.
One of the most talked-about advancements is the introduction of Bitcoin layer 2 networks such as Lightning, which aim to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and utility for applications like payments. Despite previous setbacks and vulnerabilities, the community’s relentless pursuit of robust and secure solutions has led to the development of groundbreaking protocols.
In 2023, the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol marked a significant milestone by enabling the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This was further expanded by the proposal of BRC-20 tokens by an anonymous developer known as Domo. These tokens leverage a similar inscription mechanism, significantly enhancing Bitcoin’s programmability.
Developers are also exploring other avenues, such as OP_CAT, a potential software upgrade that could simplify the implementation of programmability on the Bitcoin network. This proposal is under review, with significant backing from the developer community.

However, integrating programmability into the Bitcoin network has its challenges. The recent launch of the Runes protocol, which facilitates the creation of altcoins on the Bitcoin blockchain, initially surged network activity, but later, the hype cooled down.

Ether Price Surges 5.5%, Nears $3,100 Amid Market Optimism and Legal Boost



                    

On May 17, Ether’s price surged by 5.5%, nearing $3,100 for the first time in ten days. Analysts attributed this rally to a decline in demand for fixed-income instruments following stagnant U.S. retail sales data for April. 



This data heightened market expectations of a potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy.




Expansionary measures by the central bank are typically seen as bullish for risk-on markets, due to increased monetary supply or reduced credit costs for businesses and individuals. 



Investors sought exposure to scarce assets, including cryptocurrencies, leading to gold reaching $2,410, just 0.8% below its all-time high.



A U.S. Department of Justice indictment unsealed on May 15 also boosted Ether’s surge. 




The indictment accused two individuals of wire fraud and money laundering by manipulating the Ethereum blockchain. 



The document stated that “Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain […] without the need for a trusted intermediary” and added, “No central actor runs the Ethereum Network.”



Additionally, the court noted that Ethereum smart contracts enable transactions without a trusted intermediary. 



These statements boosted Ether investors’ confidence, especially after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Wells notice to Robinhood on May 4 over alleged securities violations related to crypto listings and custodian operations.




Orlando Cosme, founder and CEO of Lexproof, remarked that this verdict contradicts regulators’ classification of ETH as a security, “as there would be no management or entrepreneurial efforts of others.”

While this analysis does not change the approval odds of U.S. spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it certainly lifted investors’ spirits.



The U.S. SEC is expected to provide its final ruling on VanEck’s spot Ether ETF request on March 23 and rule on the conversion of Grayscale’s ETHE fund by June 18. 



Although analysts predict approval odds below 35%, the regulators’ case for classifying Ether as a security instrument has weakened, contributing to the rally above $3,050 on May 17.



Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko praised Ethereum’s network security, highlighting how coordinating “an invalid state transition or double spend attack” would be nearly impossible. 



In a May 17 post, Yakovenko added that layer-2 scaling reduced costs without compromising security due to the network’s large number of validators and operators.



Investors realized that Ethereum’s setbacks, including high transaction fees and slow scalability efforts, were decisions prioritizing security and decentralization. 



Meanwhile, competitors Solana and BNB Chain opted for higher processing capacity solutions, increasing dependency on fewer entities.



Ethereum’s strength is evident in its dominance in decentralized application (DApp) activity. 



The growth of layer-2 solutions such as Base, which gained traction due to its low fees and integration with Coinbase, reinforces Ethereum’s potential as a global settlement layer.



Ethereum’s $181.5 billion in DApp volume over 30 days is more than seven times larger than its direct competitor, BNB Chain.



This volume declined merely 3% compared to the previous month, while BNB Chain and Solana experienced 52% and 41% decreases, respectively.



Analyzing unique active addresses engaging with DApps yields similar results, with Ethereum gaining 3% in 30 days, while BNB Chain and Solana faced steep declines. 



Highlights from the Ethereum network include Balancer, which saw a 34% volume increase, Morpho Optimizers with an 80% gain, and DODO with a 61% boost.



In essence, even if U.S. spot Ether ETF approval odds remain low, the network’s dominance in the DApp ecosystem remains unaffected.



This realization contributed to the ETH price gains on May 17.

Weak Correlation, Security Issue Hamper Spot Ethereum ETFs


As the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nears its decision on spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), skepticism grows among crypto industry experts. They highlight concerns over the complex links between Ethereum (ETH) futures and spot markets and potential security issues.
This skepticism dims the outlook for these ETFs’ regulatory approval.
Potential SEC Roadblocks for Spot Ethereum ETFs Approval

Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, highlighted the necessity for SEC approval on both a 19b-4 change in trading rules and an S-1 registration statement for any ETF launch. However, the process may face delays, especially in S-1 approvals, even if 19b-4s get approval.
In a separate discussion, James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, expressed strong doubts about the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. He pointed to the weak correlations between futures and spot markets observed in 2021.
Read more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works

“Overall, I think it’ll be something somewhat objective that just kicks the can down the road. […] If I had to guess, I’d say correlations. Primarily pointing to the futures and spot correlations from 2021, which were quite weak over 1 min and 5 min intervals,” Seyffart said.


Seyffart further explained the possibility of the SEC by stating that “the futures market hasn’t been sufficient on a 3-year look back period for detecting fraud and manipulation in the spot market.” It is important to note that the same argument got the agency sued by digital asset manager giant Grayscale.
However, Seyffart emphasized that this is just a complete guess. He said a better timeline will be revealed “when we see these 19b-4 orders and the SEC’s official correlation analysis data.”
Proof-of-Stake Mechanism and Staking Complexities
Furthermore, security classification concerns form another significant hurdle. Scott Johnson, a general partner at Van Buren Capital, highlighted that the SEC is considering treating Ethereum as a security in the upcoming spot ETF order.
The current law requires the SEC to provide “notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration.” This cited question was asked and noticed in all the Ethereum filings. Yet, Johnson believes the SEC never asked such questions when filing a Bitcoin ETF.

“The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security,” Johnson said.

David Han, an institutional research analyst at Coinbase, added another layer of complexity to the debate. In a recent report, he points out the differences between Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) and Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms.

He mentioned the regulatory environment for asset staking remains unclear, especially for spot Ethereum ETFs that allow staking. Han argued that the risks associated with staking, such as slashing conditions, validator client variations, fee structures, and liquidity issues, make it unlikely for the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs soon.

This perspective aligns with recent adjustments by ARK Invest and 21Shares. The firms reportedly amended their spot Ethereum ETF application to remove clauses related to staking. Initially, they aimed to stake Ethereum (ETH) held by the firm, which would have counted as income for the fund.
The SEC’s upcoming deadlines to respond to spot Ethereum ETF applications from VanEck and ARK Invest are May 23 and 24, respectively. As the SEC deliberates, the crypto community watches closely. They are eager to see if the SEC addresses these hurdles or further delays the spot Ethereum ETFs’ introduction to the market.

Magic Eden's Coinbase Account Used to Bear "Significant" Dust Fees - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The platform shifted small transaction fees to Magic Eden’s Coinbase account, making Coinbase handle the consolidation costs.



Coinbase integrated 92,400 small inputs a day from Magic Eden, resulting in significant fees and losses.




In a recent revelation, Danny, the founder of Deezy, highlighted on social media platform X, that NFT marketplace Magic Eden executed a clever maneuver against Coinbase. Danny described this move as one of the “most hilarious finesse moves” he had seen.





Magic Eden’s Coinbase Account Leads to Exchange Losses



Magic Eden‘s strategy involved attaching tiny outputs for marketplace fees to each transaction. These small outputs, ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 satoshis, are inexpensive to create but costly to consolidate later. This clever tactic shifts the burden of managing these outputs onto Coinbase rather than Magic Eden itself.



Instead of using its own address to collect these small unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), the platform directed them to Magic Eden’s Coinbase account. Consequently, these numerous small deposits went into Magic Eden’s Coinbase account, making the exchange responsible for the integration and consolidation fees.



Controversial Tactics in Crypto Transaction Management



Supporting this, Mempool founder @mononautical noted that in the past 24 blocks, Coinbase Prime had to integrate 92,400 small transaction inputs from Magic Eden’s address. These were spread over 308 transactions, incurring fees at a rate of approximately 7 satoshis per virtual byte (sats/vB). The total cost amounted to roughly 0.59 BTC in fees to recover about 1.75 BTC.




This scheme resulted in significant losses for Coinbase, attributed to its large scale and slow response. Danny commented that Coinbase, due to its size and operational sluggishness, failed to recognize and efficiently manage the consolidation of these transactions, leading to substantial financial losses.

Quant Analyst PlanB Says Bitcoin Flashing ‘2017 Vibes,’ Hints at Final Chance To Accumulate BTC Below $70,000 - The Daily Hodl


								Well-known quant analyst PlanB says that Bitcoin (BTC) looks the same as it did in 2017 before witnessing a meteoric ascent.
PlanB tells his 1.9 million followers on the social media platform X that BTC is currently four months into its bull market phase, indicated by the four red dots on his chart.










“2017 vibes.”
Source: PlanB/X
Based on PlanB’s chart, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at around $1,200 when it was at its fourth red dot in 2017 but quickly rallied to the $20,000 mark by the end of the year.
The quant analyst is also looking at different variations of Bitcoin’s realized cost price indicator, which measures the value of a given cohort’s coins at the price they were last transacted. PlanB’s chart shows three variations of the metric including the five-month, two-year and total realized cost price of BTC.
The analyst’s chart also shows that BTC’s price is above all three metrics, suggesting that we may be seeing the final days of BTC trading at current levels.

PlanB also says that based on the historical correlation between miner revenue and price action, BTC should go “vertical” later in 2024 as the industry’s revenue recovers from the halving.
“Historically, Bitcoin miner revenue recovers two to five months after a halving, and after that Bitcoin price goes vertical.”

Why Bitcoin could hit $60,000 before a rally to $72,000 - AMBCrypto



A crucial resistance at $68,000 could trigger a BTC pullback.
While the coin might recover to $72,000 later, the price might trend higher.

AMBCrypto’s market analysis revealed that Bitcoin’s [BTC] jump to $67,740 does not mean that the price would no longer nosedive. In fact, there is a chance that BTC could drop to $60,000.
To arrive at this conclusion, the liquidation heatmap came into play. The liquidation heatmap helps traders to prevent further losses. High liquidation areas could be support or resistance areas.
North is not the only way
According to data from Coinglass, there was a big cluster of liquidity from $67,626 to $68,000, indicating that Bitcoin could approach the levels one more time.
On the downside, there was a major level at $60,160. As such, resistance between $67,000 and $68,000 could force BTC to drop to $60,000 which could later act as support.
Source: Coinglass
However, the most concentrated area of liquidity was $72,000, meaning that the next uptrend could push Bitcoin to this point. Establishing this bias was the Realized Price.
Realized Price measures the average price divided by Bitcoin’s supply. This helps to understand the economic state of the coin. Like the liquidation heatmap, this metric can act as on-chain support or resistance.
Bitcoin is not back to the bear market
If the Realized Price hits or crosses Bitcoin’s value, it means that the coin has fallen into a bear phase. For example, the metric flipped BTC in November 2022, confirming a crash in the price.
As of this writing, the Realized Price was $29,142— two times less than the press time value. With this position, one can infer that BTC has not hit the top of this cycle.
Source: Glassnode
In addition, we assessed the SOPR Ratio. SOPR stands for Spent Output Profit Ratio. By definition, SOPR measures the profit ratio of the entire market.
The value of this metric is calculated as the division of the long-term holder’s SOPR by that of the short-term holder. A high SOPR ratio means higher profits for long-term holders than short-term holders.
If this is the case, it means that the market is close to the top. Conversely, a low SOPR ratio indicates that short-term holders have made more gains than their long-term counterparts.
At press time, the ratio was 2.08. Falling to this level suggests that Bitcoin’s price can move higher. For example, the ratio hit the same reading before Bitcoin’s all-time high in March.
Source: CryptoQuant
Furthermore, the current state of the metric implied that BTC could rally again. This time, a move to $72,000 could be validated.

But as mentioned earlier, the first step to hitting the region could be a correction to $60,000.
In the meantime, BTC could undergo a consolidation phase first. After that, more liquidity could flow out of the coin which could propel the downturn before the upswing.

Ethereum SEC Coin (ETHSEC) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Ethereum SEC Coin (ETHSEC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because ETHSEC has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Ethereum SEC Coin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Ethereum SEC Coin could become the next viral memecoin.



Ethereum SEC Coin launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Ethereum SEC Coin on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Ethereum SEC Coin by entering its contract address – DeCpC881FwUmN4HrwHdxTXCfMiSoo69BLMWavA5DjoJd – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ETHSEC.

Ripple's Stablecoin Set For 'Great Impact': Top Economist


								In a recent contribution for Finextra, Carlo R.W. de Meijer, an independent economist and owner of De Meijer Independent Financial Services Advisory (MIFSA), provided an in-depth analysis of Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin launch. De Meijer, with nearly four decades of experience at institutions such as ABN, ABN AMRO, and the Royal Bank of Scotland, describes the initiative as a potential “game changer” for both the crypto sector and traditional finance (TradFi).
On April 4, Ripple unveiled its plan to introduce a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, aiming to be a crucial development in bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This move has been positively received across both sectors, reflecting rising institutional interest in the stablecoin market. De Meijer remarked, “Ripple’s stablecoin launch is expected to be a game changer for the XRP Ledger ecosystem.”
Ripple’s stablecoin will be backed by a combination of US dollar deposits, short-term US government bonds, and high-grade commercial paper, ensuring transparency and reliability. The reserves will undergo periodic audits by a reputable third-party accounting firm, with monthly attestation reports made public. This “compliance-first” approach aligns with global regulatory standards, a strategy designed to maintain trust among Ripple’s primary clientele of institutions and governments.
The stablecoin will initially launch on both the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum blockchain, adhering to the ERC-20 token standard. This dual launch is intended to enhance adoption and utility across different blockchain ecosystems. Ripple plans to expand to additional blockchains and DeFi protocols over time, emphasizing interoperability and seamless interaction between various networks.
What The Economist Expects From Ripple’s Stablecoin Launch
Integrating the stablecoin with major cryptocurrency exchanges could increase its accessibility and liquidity, facilitating easier trading and wider adoption by individual users. However, no decisions have been made on which exchanges it will initially trade on.

The initial launch will target the US market, focusing on enterprise customers and banking institutions. De Meijer notes that regional variations for markets in Europe and Asia might follow, driven by demand from emerging markets for stablecoin payouts.
Ripple’s shift to stablecoins for US transactions highlights the ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP and should be seen as a response to regulatory challenges. “By offering a stablecoin backed by dollar based reserves, Ripple aims to provide a regulatory-compliant alternative to XRP, thereby mitigating concerns related to regulations and investor protection,” de Meijer remarks.
He identifies several strategic motivations behind Ripple’s stablecoin initiative. One primary driver is the enhancement of the XRP Ledger ecosystem. The issuance of a stablecoin is expected to attract more users, boost liquidity, and drive the development of new financial applications.

Ripple envisions its stablecoin as a pivotal asset in expanding its digital payments footprint, strengthening its strategic position, and forming new financial market alliances. The stablecoin is also intended to enhance Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, addressing the volatility issues associated with XRP. This stablecoin could enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of ODL, enabling rapid transactions and providing a more stable asset for financial institutions and DeFi ecosystems.
Moreover, this development could unlock new opportunities for institutional and DeFi use cases across various industries, driving more adoption and development within the XRPL ecosystem.
Despite the ongoing legal battle with the SEC, Ripple remains optimistic about launching its stablecoin by the end of the year. De Meijer highlights that the introduction of a stablecoin could pave the way for new applications beyond cross-border payments, such as remittances, micropayments, and various DeFi activities.
This could increase demand for XRP and stimulate the growth of the XRPL ecosystem. The stablecoin’s compliance with high regulatory standards and its integration into major crypto exchanges could further bolster Ripple’s market presence.
De Meijer believes the stablecoin could revolutionize cross-border payments, enhance the functionality of the XRP Ledger ecosystem, and solidify Ripple’s position as a leading force in the blockchain and digital currency sectors. [The launch] may have a great impact on both the crypto world as well as the traditional financial world, further narrowing the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi),” the economist concludes.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.51603.

XRP Ledger doubles transactions in Q1 amid SEC case


The XRP Ledger (XRPL) recorded a 108% surge in on-chain transactions in the first quarter of 2024. 



The XRPL’s transactions exceeded 251 million, with a notable decrease in average transaction fees by 45%. 



XRPL transactions increase from roughly 121 million in the last quarter of 2023 to over 251 million in the first quarter of 2024. 



Daily spot trading volumes on major exchanges have risen by 40%, with Binance, Bybit, and Upbit leading the pack, accounting for more than 70% of the total volume.

	
	
	
	


Meanwhile, the XRPL’s integration with platforms like Axelar has expanded developers’ access to smart contracts and decentralized applications, connecting them to over 55 blockchains.



This uptick in network activity occurred as Ripple Labs, the company that has built its payments infrastructure around the XRP cryptocurrency, nears the conclusion of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.



The SEC is seeking a US$2 billion fine. 



Ripple is pushing for a significantly lower penalty, not exceeding US$10 million.

SEC on the Clock: Will Ethereum ETFs Finally Get Approved?


							

SEC deadline for Ethereum ETFs looms this week.



Approval could boost Ethereum adoption, trading.



Delay raises concerns about crypto regulation.




The SEC faces a crucial deadline this week to decide on the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ethereum, according to a social media post by Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store.



Geraci, an industry expert on ETFs, highlighted the SEC’s two-pronged review process in his online post. The process requires approval of both the 19b-4 filings, which address exchange rule changes, and the S-1 registration statements. Both filings are essential for bringing Ethereum ETFs to market.



Geraci expressed concern that the SEC might delay approval of the S-1 filings even if the 19b-4 filings are greenlit. This speculation stems from the SEC’s recent lack of engagement on the issue, and the inherent complexities of cryptocurrency products. Such delays would allow listing of the ETFs, but they could not be traded until the S-1 filings receive approval.



The SEC’s decision on Ethereum ETFs is keenly awaited. Approval could facilitate broader mainstream adoption of Ethereum, offering a more regulated and secure investment option for cryptocurrency investors.









Conversely, delays or denials could underscore continuing regulatory anxieties regarding the stability and security of cryptocurrency investments. A key question remains: Is Ethereum a security or a commodity? While SEC Chair Gary Gensler has declined to comment on ETH’s classification, he has suggested in public appearances that it might be considered a security.



The SEC’s decision will be a bellwether for the future of cryptocurrency regulation. Approval of Ethereum ETFs could signal a shift towards a more accommodating regulatory environment, potentially boosting investor confidence and propelling Ethereum further into the mainstream. However, a rejection or delay could cast a shadow over the industry, raising questions about the regulatory viability of other cryptocurrency-based investment vehicles.

Hong Kong trials digital yuan for retail and cross-border payments


The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced Friday the launch of a digital yuan pilot program.



The digital yuan, or the e-CNY, allows retail transactions and cross-border payments within the city.



It is designed to offer a digital alternative to cash payments for Hong Kong residents while integrating China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) into its financial system.



The pilot allows residents to create digital yuan wallets linked to their mobile numbers and fund them via 17 local banks using the Faster Payment System (FPS). 

	
	
	
	


This collaboration between the FPS and the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China is the first time any CBDC has connected with a rapid payment system.



The e-CNY wallets are expected to gain more functionalities as merchant adoption grows, facilitating wallet top-ups without the need for a mainland bank account.



The program sets transaction and balance limits to regulate the digital yuan’s circulation and ensure financial stability. 



Individual transactions and daily spending are capped at 2,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan, respectively, with a maximum wallet balance of 10,000 yuan. 

	
	
	

	


These controls are intended to manage usage and maintain economic equilibrium.



The digital yuan has facilitated 1.8 trillion yuan (US$250 million) in transactions recorded as of June 2023. 



Over 10 million merchants across 17 provinces and cities in mainland China now accept the digital currency.



The HKMA’s future plans include enhancing e-CNY wallets with real-name verification and exploring corporate applications for cross-border trade settlements.

Ethereum dev’s paid EigenLayer role sparks debate on ‘conflicted incentives’

An Ethereum Foundation researcher’s decision to take a paid adviser role for the foundation behind EigenLayer has sparked criticism on social media, with one commentator suggesting it could create “conflicted incentives.”In a lengthy May 19 X post, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake disclosed he had taken an adviser role at EigenFoundation that “comes with a significant EIGEN token incentive” vested over three years worth “millions of dollars” and “more than the combined value of all my other assets.”EigenLayer is a protocol that partially launched on mainnet last month and allows users to stake liquid staked Ether (ETH) tokens — which are derivative tokens for ETH staked in a protocol such as Lido — effectively allowing ETH to be staked twice.Drake said he took the role on the condition he was limited to researching restaking risks and claimed his default stance would “continue to lean critical of EigenLayer” while acknowledging the role “inevitably comes with downside risk beyond my personal reputation.”“By being an adviser, I hope to have a front-row seat to restaking issues and steer EigenLayer from within,” Drake wrote. “I feel I did too little, too late with regard to liquid staking. This is an opportunity not to repeat the mistake with restaking.”A day earlier, crypto trader and UpOnly co-host Jordan Fish, who goes by Cobie, asked Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin his thoughts on Ethereum Foundation staff “taking life-changing [monetary] packages” from projects that “may have conflicted incentives with Ethereum” — giving EigenLayer as a theoretical example.Source: Jordan FishOn the other hand, others including Polygon vice president of governance Hudson Jameson, zkSecurity co-founder David Wong and Standard Chartered ventures crypto investments director Robbie Nakarmi praised Drake for being transparent.Related: Is onboarding too hard? Crypto adoption still faces major obstaclesIn his X post, Drake aimed to quell claims that EigenLayer is “trying to systematically ‘bribe’ or ‘corrupt’” the Ethereum Foundation.“The EF is a large organization with 300+ people,” he wrote “To my knowledge 3 EFers have a formal relationship with EigenLayer entities: one as an early EigenLabs investor, and two as recent EigenFoundation advisors.”He added he didn’t “see the 1% of EFers formally involved with EigenLayer compromising their morals” and that he was also ready to “end the advisership at any time” such as if EigenLayer went in a direction “against Ethereum’s interests.”Earlier in May, EigenLayer airdropped 28 million more of its EIGEN token to users after it faced backlash from users claiming its program was too restrictive.Magazine: Ethereum restaking — Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?

JackTheRippler acknowledges XRP is the next Bitcoin


							

Cyrpto analyst contends XRP as the next Bitcoin, reflecting on CEO’s earlier remarks.



XRP’s value could rise if regulatory challenges addressed



XRP up 4% in a week, trading volume surges 27%




JackTheRippler, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst recently echoed the optimistic views of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on the future of the company’s native token, XRP



In a social media post, JackTheRippler pointed to Garlinghouse’s previous interview with Bloomberg, where the CEO discussed the potential of XRP. Garlinghouse acknowledged that XRP’s value could rise if certain challenges are addressed.







The analyst’s post is based on Garlinghouse’s previous interview with Bloomberg, where he elucidated the future of Ripple’s native token, XRP. While the host enquired about the potential of XRP to become the next Bitcoin, Garlinghouse shared his optimistic views. He asserted that XRP’s value could be raised if the prevailing problems are sorted. He cited,




 “If we work with the system to solve this problem and the problem is in trillions of dollars, then there is a great opportunity to create value in XRP.” 




Some experts have pointed out XRP’s past performance as evidence of its potential. The token reportedly surged by about 25,000% in 2017. However, Garlinghouse’s suggestion that XRP could surpass Bitcoin in the future remains a topic of debate within the cryptocurrency industry



Garlinghouse also addressed the ongoing concern about regulatory uncertainty in the crypto space. He emphasized Ripple’s commitment to regulatory compliance, highlighting their collaboration with regulators and financial institutions.









Despite a recent downturn with its price currently at $0.5131, XRP has seen a notable increase of over 4% in the past week. Additionally, a substantial 27% surge in trading volume suggests a rise in demand for the token.



Overall, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain. While some analysts see it as a potential contender, others believe it is unlikely to replace Bitcoin.

5 of 7 on-chain indicators suggest the bull run is just beginning

Despite crypto markets having consolidated sideways for the past three months, at least five on-chain indicators suggest the bull market may just be getting started, according to an analyst. Since the end of February, the total market capitalization of crypto has been range-bound at around $2.5 trillion. Market observers are conflicted about whether the cycle is already over or not.These five on-chain indicators, as highlighted by analyst “ELI5 of TLDR” in an X post on May 19, suggest it is just beginning.Source: ELI5 of TLDRBitcoin market dominance above 56%Historically, crypto bull markets start with a high level of Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, with most traders selling their altcoins during the prior bear market cycle.On the other hand, when BTC dominance drops and altseason begins, it signals the next stage of the bull cycle, bringing it one step closer to its end, but this doesn’t seem to be the case just yet.

PEPE prices at risk? Here's what the week holds for the memecoin - AMBCrypto



PEPE was the best-performing memecoin last week. At press time, it was among the worst-performing.
Bears appeared to be in control, but indicators suggest that the decline is likely temporary.

Everyone’s favorite memecoin is currently in a bit of a bind. PEPE, the Solana-based memecoin that made a lot of people millionaires last week, has been dropping, not so slowly for about three days now. 
At press time, it has tumbled by over 8% in the last twenty-four hours just as the community was starting to cheer for memecoin season. What is going on? Why is PEPE backsliding?
Reasons for PEPE’s descent
PEPE rallied by over 500% at some point last week. But it wasn’t an isolated trend. Meme stock legend Keith Gill made a comeback on social media, sending both meme stock markets and memecoin markets into a frenzy.
Traders lost it. Investors jumped in. But just as it came, the hype went away, along with Gill. Now the coins and the stocks have cooled down by a mile, with PEPE’s daily chart painted in red.
Source: TradingView
The PEPE/USDT chart shows a notable bearish trend throughout the session, with price action marked by a series of red candles. Such a sharp decrease, supported by high volume, typically indicates that bears are in control. 
This could potentially drive the price down further unless there is a significant change in market dynamics or external influences that could encourage the bulls to flip the script.
Data from Coinglass showed that the trading volume for PEPE has increased by 14.02% to $697.64 million, suggesting a heightened trading activity and possibly a growing interest in PEPE among traders.
However, the open interest has seen a decrease of 10.09%, standing at $105.29 million, which might indicate that some traders are closing their positions, focused solely on taking profits.

What to expect from PEPE this week
If PEPE holds above the 0.00000900 support and sees increasing buyer volume, along with a bullish MACD crossover and an RSI recovery above 30, there could be a potential for a short-term price recovery.

Realistic or not, here’s PEPE’s market cap in BTC’s terms

The RSI was below the 30 mark at press time, meaning that PEPE is in an oversold condition.
Should these indicators align positively, PEPE could see a recovery in the near future, testing higher resistance levels. All in all, the memecoin seems to be in consolidation mode, so the decline could be just temporary.

Why Is The Crypto Market Down Today?


The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) and Bitcoin’s (BTC) price took a short break over the weekend from the ongoing rally. Although the intra-day candlestick is green, the bearishness from the last two days has also been extended to today, keeping the overall growth minimal.
This has impacted Pyth Network (PYTH), which is currently experiencing a drawdown on the daily chart.
In the news today:-

Genesis secures court approval to distribute $3 billion to its creditors, enabling the users impacted by the bankruptcy to receive 77% of their claims.
Crypto exchange Kraken’s Global Head of Asset Growth and Management, Mark Greenberg, reassured that they have no plans to delist Tether (USDT) in Europe.


The Total Market Cap Is Facing Resistance
The total market capitalization is presently at $2.36 trillion, just under the resistance of $2.40 trillion. This resistance has been tested twice in the past, and TOTAL has failed to breach it. 
This is the current situation, and TOTAL might also observe some struggle to breach it again. The dip noted over the weekend did not hurt the recent growth. However, the green candlestick from the intra-day trading did not initiate recovery either, keeping TOTAL at the same mark it was at two days ago.

Extended bearish cues will only bring TOTAL down to $2.29 trillion, which has been a key support floor in the past.

Bitcoin’s Price Rise Halts
Bitcoin’s price is above $67,100 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency witnessed a minor dip in the last two days, which resulted in the ongoing rise experiencing a short pause. The 1.26% growth observed today has recovered most of the dip, but Bitcoin is still performing only slightly better than yesterday.
The chances of BTC’s price action in the future is consolidation between $68,500 and $64,800. This will continue until either of the levels is broken through or below.

However, a fall below $64,800 will invalidate any chances of a bullish outcome. Instead. it could further extend the decline to $63,700.
Pyth Network Hits Four-Month Low
Pyth Network’s price has been consistently declining for the last two months. Following the cues of BTC and the rest of the market, PYTH fell by 13% on Sunday. As a result, the altcoin is trading at $0.38, which is above the key support of $0.35.

If this support is lost, the decline will continue. On the other hand, if PYTH bounces back from this support, a recovery to $0.46 is possible. Breaching this will invalidate the bearish thesis.

Cat Wif RPG (CATRPG) Will Surge 11,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Cat Wif RPG (CATRPG) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Cat Wif RPG (CATRPG), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Cat Wif RPG presents a similar opportunity.



Cat Wif RPG has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days before it will be listed on KuCoin – a massive cryptocurrency exchange – and Cat Wif RPG could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Cat Wif RPG can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Cat Wif RPG on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Cat Wif RPG by entering its contract address – GZiCTFbVMumaRv8PPCXv721vLSQdKb9x4WfizzB4Z8eG – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CATRPG.

                        A group of developers believes introducing programmability to the Bitcoin blockchain could drive the next rally for the largest cryptocurrency.While Bitcoin is currently seen as digital gold, with its primary use being a store of value, developers argue that the addition of programmability would unlock a range of functionalities and applications.Unlike its rival Ether, which allows for the creation of smart contracts and the development of decentralized applications on the Ethereum network, the Bitcoin blockchain lacks the ability to support such features.Over the years, developers have attempted to address this limitation by creating “Layer 2” networks like Lightning, aimed at scaling Bitcoin for payment applications.However, many of these solutions have proven unreliable, and the associated bridges, used to transfer tokens between networks, have been susceptible to hacks, leading to user apprehension.Developers Work on Enhancing Bitcoin’s Programmability
Despite the lack of widespread adoption for payment purposes, developers have recently made progress in enhancing Bitcoin’s programmability.Projects like Bitcoin Ordinals, which enable the creation of non-fungible tokens by embedding data onto satoshis (the smallest denomination of Bitcoin), have paved the way for further advancements.The introduction of BRC-20 tokens, proposed by an anonymous developer named Domo, has sparked a search for ways to enhance Bitcoin’s programmability even more.Proposals like OP_CAT, a potential software upgrade to the Bitcoin network, are being considered to facilitate easier implementation of programmability.Startups like Arch, which recently raised $7 million in funding, and the Layer 1 Foundation are actively working on solutions to enable greater programmability in Bitcoin.Arch aims to run an application platform on top of Bitcoin, potentially allowing apps from the Solana network to be ported onto Bitcoin.The Layer 1 Foundation is developing a programmable module for the BRC-20 metaprotocol, which enables the storage and execution of code on the Bitcoin blockchain.These initiatives have attracted the interest of around 20 developer teams who are building apps for borrowing, lending, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, and more.TVL on Bitcoin DeFi Market Amounts to $1 Billion
While some members of the Bitcoin programming community remain skeptical about the future of Bitcoin’s programmability, believing that Layer 2 solutions will prevail, these new ventures are betting on the potential influx of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps on Bitcoin.Currently, the total value of tokens locked in the Bitcoin DeFi market amounts to about $1.1 billion, significantly lower than Ethereum’s $52.7 billion.However, proponents of Bitcoin’s programmability envision a future where the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem could rival or surpass Ethereum’s, potentially driving significant growth in the crypto market.It is worth noting that some analysts have turned bullish on Bitcoin following weeks-long consolidation.Leading trading firm QCP Capital has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s price momentum, forecasting a potential return to the highs of $74,000.In a recent note, the firm said it has observed substantial buyers acquiring 100,000 to 120,000 BTC Calls for December 2024, indicating confidence in the upward movement of the cryptocurrency.Likewise, technical analyst Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin has emerged from the post-halving “danger zone” and entered an accumulation phase, as indicated by weakening selling pressure.

Pump Fun Implodes: Ex-Employee Turned Hacker Exposes Alleged Shady Practices


								Jarett Dunn, the alleged hacker behind the Pump Fun exploit, secured bail after his arrest in London. Dunn, known online as StaccOverflow, is accused of draining nearly $2 million from the Solana-based memecoin marketplace on May 16th. However, in a surprising twist, Dunn isn’t pleading innocence.
Instead, he’s claiming the real crime lies with Pump Fun itself.

Pump Fun: Alleged Heist Or Robin Hood Act?
Pump Fun aimed to capitalize on the memecoin craze sweeping the crypto world. However, the platform remained obscure until Dunn’s alleged hack thrust it into the spotlight.
While details remain scarce, Dunn, posting from a different online account while in custody, claims he plans to challenge the prosecution (“argue with the crown” in his words) by portraying Pump Fun as the true criminal.
It’s interesting to note that Dunn’s arrest followed his last social media post on X, in which he revealed his identify in a subtle way. According to his own post on X and the intelligence company, Dunn was freed on bond after his detention.


Dunn’s accusations paint a picture of a potentially fraudulent operation. He alleges Pump Fun functioned as an unregistered securities exchange or gambling site, lacking proper licensing. Furthermore, he claims the platform failed to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, raising red flags about potential illegal activities.
His claims extend beyond financial regulations. Dunn alleges Pump Fun blacklisted in Saudi Arabia for operating as a casino and accuses them of misleading investors by presenting a minimal staff structure while potentially employing overseas workers.
Solana is now trading at $177. Chart: TradingView
The most shocking accusation involves insinuations of “child abuse intentions,” though Dunn offers no concrete evidence beyond the possibility of a subpoena for Telegram communications.
Crypto’s Wild West: Hacks, Refunds, And Legal Battles
The legitimacy of Dunn’s claims remains to be investigated. However, the case highlights the often-murky ethical landscape surrounding crypto hacks.
Dunn isn’t the first hacker to challenge the status quo. In 2021, the infamous Poly Network hack saw the return of over $610 million in stolen funds. This incident suggested a hacker with a conscience, returning ill-gotten gains.
Unresolved Questions And A Murky Future

The Pump Fun hack case raises more questions than it answers. Will Dunn’s accusations hold any weight in court? What were his true motives for the hack? Does his defense strategy represent a new frontier in crypto crime, where hackers become self-proclaimed enforcers against perceived injustices within the system?

Smart Ethereum Whale Started Selling Profits After a Long Time! Estimated Profit: 171 Million Dollars! - Bitcoin Sistemi

This week is critical for Ethereum. Because the SEC will announce its decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications.
While the general consensus is that the SEC will not approve spot ETH ETFs, ETH whales have also taken action.


According to Lookonchain's post, the giant whale, which collected 120 thousand ETH at approximately $ 1,600, started selling profits.
At this point, the whale, who deposited 15,000 ETH worth $46,000 million in Kraken, made a total profit of $171 million from his ETH investment.






“A giant whale worth 120,874 ETH ($370.6 million) deposited 15,000 ETH ($46 million worth) on Kraken 3 hours ago.
This whale had withdrawn 120,874 ETH ($199 million) from Kraken between August 31, 2022 and September 9, 2022 at $1,647.
Currently, the whale has 105,874 ETH left (worth $325.3 million) and his profit is $171.5 million.”

Etheruem, which fell to $ 2,800 last week, accompanied the rise in Bitcoin and rose above $ 3,000 again.

Bitcoin Pizza Week: Crypto Spent On 2 Yummy Pies 14 Years Ago Could Now Buy Jeff Bezos' Yacht And Elon Musk's Jet Fleet - With Spare Change! - Benzinga

Hurray! Bitcoin BTC/USD Pizza Week is finally here, reminding us of the time when this prized digital currency was used for the first time for commercial purposes. But do you know that the Bitcoin spent on two Papa John’s pizzas that day could purchase you ultra-luxury products owned by billionaires today? What Happened: An event immortalized in the cryptocurrency realm, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based programmer, disclosed on a Bitcoin Forum on May 22, 2010 that he "successfully traded" 10,000 Bitcoins for pizza.According to the conversation on the Forum, 1 Bitcoin was worth $0.0041 on the historical day, taking the total purchase amount to $41. Seems a long time ago, isn’t it?Why It Matters: Cut to May 2024 and Bitcoin has exploded since its early days. It is the largest digital currency in terms of market cap as of this writing, with 1 Bitcoin worth more than $67,000, according to data from Benzinga Pro.That takes the total worth of 10,000 Bitcoins to nearly a whopping $670 million.So, if our dear friend Laszlo had resisted using up his Bitcoin holdings to pay for Pizzas that day, he could have easily purchased Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos' superyacht ‘Koru.' The $500-million sailing boat made waves last year due to its humongous size and high operating costs. Interestingly, Hanyecz would still have been left with $170 million, more than enough to buy the entire fleet of Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk's private planes, which are valued at over $100 million.These events help in understanding Bitcoin's stupendous growth trajectory over the last decade, making the fortunes of several of its loyal enthusiasts who stuck with the asset through the highs and lows of the market.Read Next: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum Retrace On Profit-Taking By Retail Investors: Analyst Predicts Parabolic Rise For King Crypto Following Consolidation Phase

XRP: the latest news on Ripple's cryptocurrency

In recent days, the price of XRP, the Ripple cryptocurrency, has slightly increased, probably due to some positive news that circulated last week. 

The trend of XRP and the latest crypto news on Ripple
Currently the price of XRP is about $0.51.
This is a price level in line with that of October 2023, before the recent bull run started.
However, it is also the price level it had in June of last year, and it turns out to be lower than that of the beginning of 2021. 
Actually, it is even in line with that of October 2018, so much so that it could even be stated that the price of XRP has been moving sideways around the half dollar for almost six years now, although during this period it has not been at all still. 
In 2017, before the great bull run that brought it to its historical highs of $3.8 in January 2018, its price was just under $0.3, so the current price is only 70% higher than it was seven years ago. 
When the first major speculative bubble burst in 2018, the price of XRP first dropped to 0.5$, and then fell below 0.3$. The worst, however, came in the following years, with a decline to 0.15$ in March 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic. 
In the rest of 2020, it managed to approach 0.3$ again, before jumping up to almost 0.7$ by the end of the year. However, at that point the SEC started the lawsuit against Ripple and XRP, and during the great bull run of 2021 the price failed to exceed 2$. 
With the burst of the second bubble in 2022, the price of XRP returned to around $0.3, and since then it has continued to fluctuate between $0.3 and $0.7 with a very brief exception in July 2023 thanks to the favorable ruling in the lawsuit against the SEC. 
Current trend
During 2024 it first dropped from $0.63 to $0.5, then rose to $0.71 but only to fall back to $0.48 in April. In the last month it has fluctuated within a very narrow range, between $0.48 and $0.56.
Starting from May 7th, it had begun a descent that brought it down to $0.49 last week, before rebounding slightly and bringing it back above $0.52 last Friday. 
Yesterday, however, it slightly dropped to 0.50$, before rising back up to 0.51$ today. 
Practically in the last twelve days it has fluctuated between $0.49 and $0.52. 
So even though last week saw a small rebound, it is simply normal movements within the sideways range that has been going on for two months now. 
Furthermore, even extending the analysis a little further back in time, it has been since July of last year that it has not been well above $0.7. However, at least it has been more than a year since it has not fallen below $0.48. 
The crypto news on Ripple (XRP)
Given that it has been twelve months since nothing really interesting has happened to the price of XRP, neither positively nor negatively, recent news has only been able to move it within the sideways trading range. 
Surely last week the good news about inflation in the USA also had positive consequences on the price of XRP. However, they were not able to unlock the crypto market, now relatively flat for some weeks.
One interesting thing has happened. 
Indeed, according to Santiment data, XRP whales (wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP) have increased the total number of XRP held by a whopping 110 million, thus increasing their wealth in this cryptocurrency by about 55 million dollars in just the last two weeks. 
This suggests a period of accumulation. 
Furthermore, on-chain transactions have increased by 108% in the first quarter of 2024, with a total of 251.39 million transactions in three months on the XRP Ledger. 
This is a number not much lower than that of the Ethereum blockchain, which however does not include transactions on layer-2.
What is surprising, however, is the cost of transactions, because on the XRP Ledger the average cost in the first quarter was only $0.000856 per transaction, while on Ethereum it is more than a thousand times higher. 
Quantum computing
In addition, yesterday Ripple published an article regarding the potential issues that cryptocurrencies could face due to quantum computers. 

The article concerns the insights of Professor Massimiliano Sala, a mathematics professor at the University of Trento in Italy, regarding the impact of quantum computing on blockchain. 
According to Sala, quantum computers could easily solve fundamental problems for digital signatures, potentially undermining the mechanisms that protect users’ resources on blockchain platforms. 
However, Sala also highlighted the progress made by the cryptographic community towards the development of “post-quantum” cryptographic schemes designed to resist potential attacks carried out using quantum computers. 
It is therefore a real problem, although not current, and well known, for which some possible solutions are already known. 
However, Sala advises crypto organizations to start transitioning to quantum-resistant technologies now, because although such threats are not imminent, they would be significant enough to justify proactive measures. 
In this regard, Ripple is organizing a national XRPL Hackathon involving over 20 universities and 60 developers from November 21st to 23rd, 2024 in Rome.

Bitcoin Worth $1B Transferred By Just Paying $7.30 In Fees: Can Traditional Banking Carry Out Such A Feat? - Benzinga

A mammoth transfer of more than a billion worth of Bitcoin BTC/USD, accomplished by paying a fraction in fees, grabbed the market's attention, leading to discussions around the nature of the transfer.What Happened: In a social media post on X, well-known Bitcoin influencer Vivek highlighted a transaction showing the movement of 16,445.82 units of Bitcoin, worth $1.1 billion at current market prices. The fascinating bit was that the transfer was performed by paying just around $7.30 as transaction fees.The sheer size of the transfer left on-chain observers in awe, with Vivek predicting it to be a purchase by a nation-state.Another popular cryptocurrency analyst, MartyParty, informed that the withdrawal was from cryptocurrency exchange Binance, possibly going to a new buyer, or cold storage as a safety measure.Why It Matters: Typically, such mammoth transfers, when executed using the traditional finance system, cost an order of magnitude higher. According to a report by Coinbase, crypto international money transfers were found to be 96% cheaper than the legacy process of sending money abroad. Apart from the cost advantages, crypto transfers could also cut settlement time significantly. While it may take anything between 1-10 days before the recipient gets the money through traditional transfers, the average wait time for crypto transfers was just 10 minutes. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $67,180.06, an increase of 0.02% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Peter Schiff Says ‘Bitcoin Is Dead, Long Live Silver’ But Is It Really True?

Finiko's $55 Million Crypto Ponzi: Executive Sentenced to 3 Years


The Vakhitovsky District Court of Kazan has sentenced Lilia Nuriyeva, a key participant in the notorious Finiko Ponzi scheme, to three years in prison. 
Nuriyeva was found guilty of defrauding private investors and participating in an organized criminal community, reflecting the gravity of the charges brought against her.
How Crypto Ponzi Scheme Finiko Conducted $55 Million Scam

Finiko, often compared to the infamous MMM Ponzi scheme, lured investors with promises of high returns through a purportedly unique cryptocurrency and stock market trading system. The scheme, masterminded by Kirill Doronin, operated from 2018 until its collapse in 2021, leaving a trail of financial devastation. 
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the scheme caused over 5 billion rubles (~ $55 million) in damages.
The investigation revealed that Doronin and his accomplices traveled across Russia, conducting master classes to attract thousands of investors. They promised substantial returns through an “automatic profit generation system,” persuading people to invest by taking out loans and selling their homes.

Initially, investors received dividends paid in Bitcoin, which they could withdraw. However, the launch of Finiko’s own cryptocurrency saw its value plummet within a month, wiping out investors’ savings.
In 2021, the Central Bank identified Finiko as a financial pyramid, listing it among companies with signs of illegal activity. Despite this, the scheme continued to attract significant investments until its abrupt collapse. 
Offices nationwide closed, and the company’s website went offline. Doronin assured investors it was a technical glitch, but investigators later found that his associates had fled abroad with the funds.
One investor, Lyudmila Yamshchikova from Kazan, recounted her ordeal to the Russian outlet – Izvestia. 

“Payments suddenly stopped. I invested nearly a million [rubles], intending to use the interest to pay off my mortgage. Half of the city was buying apartments, cars, and paying off loans. But then withdrawals were blocked,” Yamshchikova said.

Nuriyeva’s sentence was notably lenient due to a pre-trial agreement. She will spend only three years in the prison. Initially, she faced up to ten years in prison.

Currently, Doronin and nine other accomplices are in pre-trial detention. They face charges of organizing and participating in a criminal community and large-scale fraud. The General Prosecutor’s Office approved their indictment, and the case was sent to the Vakhitovsky Court on April 27.

The Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network (FinCEN) identified Finiko as one of Bitzlato’s top three receiving counterparties. Bitzlato, a Russian P2P exchange, saw its founder charged with money laundering by the US in 2023.

Optimistic price predictions for the crypto Solana (SOL)

Some recent forecasts indicate that the price of the crypto Solana (SOL) could rise towards $170, with the possibility of reaching $1,000 by June. 
In addition, Solana leads the market with 91 million daily transactions, surpassing Ethereum, according to a report by CoinGecko.
On the other hand, Phantom Wallet has reached the third place in the utility category on the Apple App Store, and many cryptocurrency experts see this as a bullish indicator for Solana. 
Let’s see below all the details. 

The crypto Solana (SOL) towards new price targets: forecasts by June
The crypto Solana (SOL) is currently trading at around $172.84, recording a decrease of 0.53% in the last 24 hours, with a daily trading volume of $2.19 billion. 
Ranked fifth, Solana has a market capitalization of $77.59 billion and a circulating supply of 448.92 million SOL coins.
On the 4-hour chart, the key pivot point is at $171.79, crucial for short-term price action. Immediate resistance is at $176.66, followed by $183.26 and $188.53.
On the downside, immediate support is at $165.72, with further levels at $156.75 and $151.08. The relative strength index (RSI) is at 73, indicating overbought conditions.
The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $155.79, supporting the overall bullish trend. The bullish channel confirms this trend, but the resistance around $175 could represent a significant barrier.
If Solana remains above the pivot point of $171.79, it could support its bullish momentum. However, a drop below this level could trigger a selling trend, bringing the price towards supports at $165.72, $156.75, and $151.08. 
The market response at these levels will be crucial in determining the short-term price direction. Solana’s technical outlook remains positive as long as it stays above the pivot point of $171.79. 
The immediate resistance at $176.66 will be the first obstacle to overcome, followed by $183.26 and $188.53. The high RSI suggests caution, as overbought conditions could lead to a pullback. 
The 50-day EMA at $155.79 provides a solid foundation for the upward trend currently in place.
Solana leads the blockchain market with 91 million daily transactions
Solana has proven to be the fastest blockchain among the main ones, processing an incredible number of 91 million transactions in just one day.
According to a recent update from CoinGecko, on April 6th Solana recorded a daily average of 1,504 transactions per second (TPS) during the memecoin frenzy.
This makes it 46 times faster than Ethereum and over five times faster than Polygon, which is the fastest scaling solution of Ethereum.
Despite its position as a leader in speed, Solana has only reached 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS. 
The increase in transactions has caused congestion on the network, raising questions about Solana’s ability to achieve higher real TPS after the upcoming updates.
The second fastest blockchain, according to the report, is Sui, another platform not based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which reached a real TPS of 854 in July 2023 thanks to the popularity of the on-chain game Sui 8192. 
Other non-EVM blockchains include TON with 175 TPS and Near Protocol with 118 TPS. On the other hand, Aptos has recorded 49 TPS, Starknet 12 TPS, Bitcoin 11 TPS, and Thorchain 2 TPS.
Non-EVM blockchains have outperformed EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains with an average peak TPS of 284, compared to just 74 average TPS of the 17 top EVM-based blockchains. 
Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has distinguished itself as the fastest among EVM blockchains, reaching a real TPS of 378 on December 7, 2023, thanks to the increase in on-chain activity. 
Polygon, the main scaling solution for Ethereum, reached 190 TPS on November 16, 2023, resulting in being 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself.
Phantom Wallet conquers third place on the Apple App Store: what does it mean for Solana?
The cryptocurrency Phantom Wallet portfolio recently reached the third position on the Apple App Store in the utility category, just behind Google and Google Chrome apps.
Crypto commentators suggest that this rise could indicate a bullish future for the Solana (SOL) token, as Phantom Wallet was originally launched as an exclusive wallet for Solana. 
The cryptocurrency entrepreneur Evan Luthra commented on X on May 19 as follows:  
“It seems like the SOL season will be great! Which SOL coins should I buy?.” 
The crypto influencer Borovik has added: 
“Phantom wallet is the third most important utility app, I am so bullish on cryptocurrencies and Solana.”
Phantom Wallet has recently surpassed seven million monthly active users, as reported in a post on April 29 on X. The crypto community usually sees an increase in monthly users as a sign of broader adoption. 
Currently, Phantom Wallet is ranked 32nd among all categories in the Apple App Store, behind X and the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. Although initially designed for Solana, Phantom Wallet now also supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon.
The cryptocurrency trader Shear believes that if the exchange Coinbase, currently ranked 288th, and Phantom Wallet were to enter the top 10 of the Apple App Store, it could mark a market peak. 
Shear, in a post on May 18th, stated: 
“These are my favorite indicators, I will sell everything when they are both in the top 10.”

ETFs buy 3X new BTC supply - 5 Things to know in Bitcoin this week

Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week in fighting form as $67,000 returns with TradFi markets.The largest cryptocurrency is edging closer to a rematch with final resistance around all-time highs past and present at $69,000 and $73,800.Whether it gets there in the coming days is the main preoccupation facing market participants, and various factors could contribute to a bullish continuation.These include United States economic policy cues as the Federal Reserve releases minutes from its May meeting, while U.S. unemployment data is also waiting in the wings.When it comes to BTC price action, traders are getting ever more confident that a local bottom has come and that upside is what should result after two months of consolidation.Meanwhile, a refreshing divergence may be playing out — prices are higher, but sentiment is lingering around lower levels than during the March peak.Could a more sustainable journey to price discovery be on the cards?Against this backdrop, Cointelegraph takes a closer look at the issues surrounding Bitcoin markets this week.Bitcoin bulls keep up pressure below all-time highsBitcoin certainly feels back in business this week, returning to near $67,000 into the Asia session after briefly dipping into the weekly close, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.That brief spate of weakness accompanied geopolitical uncertainty from Iran, but markets soon forgot this as BTC/USD preserved its 10% May gains.The latest data from monitoring resource CoinGlass now shows that the bulk of immediate overhead resistance lies just below $68,000.BTC liquidation heatmap (screenshot).

At the weekend, trader and commentator Credible Crypto revealed a belief that $60,000 or even lower should come next for BTC/USD.U.S. jobs data, Fed headline macro weekThe macro landscape will not be dominated by U.S. economic reports in the coming days.Instead, the Fed takes center stage in the form of a slew of speaking appearances from senior officials.While Chair Jerome Powell is not due to be among them, markets nonetheless watch the language used by governors and others for cues as to future policy.The minutes from the May meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where interest rates were discussed, are due for release on May 22.Thereafter, U.S. jobless claims could provide another bout of volatility for risk assets, continuing a trend in May and previous months.At the same time, attention is increasingly focusing on favorable liquidity conditions in both the U.S. and beyond. In his latest X content, financial commentator Tedtalksmacro suggested that crypto bull run is “far from over” as a result.Tedtalksmacro flagged an early liquidity cycle now beginning, along with M2 money supply displaying “plenty of room to the upside for easing liquidity conditions.”“While liquidity is definitely back in crypto (BTC ETFs), the velocity of inflow has not yet seen a manic phase consistent with cycle tops,” he continued about crypto market trends.U.S. M2 money supply.

Last week, inflows hit almost $1 billion — the best weekly performance since March.“Expect these to only increase as price drifts higher and tradFi once again renew faith in the asset,” Tedtalksmacro concluded.ETF demand lies within a new landscape. Bitcoin’s block subsidy is half of what it was in March, and large inflows cause the ETF providers to purchase much more BTC than that which is added to the supply by miners daily.“Bitcoin ETFs have purchased 21,700 BTC ($1.5B) in the month to date,” Thomas Fahrer, CEO of crypto reviews portal Apollo, revealed last week. “This is 3X the supply of new bitcoin from miners.”Bitcoin ETF net flows.

Three years later, the reserves have decreased to about 2 million Bitcoin, yet the trading prices are nearing historical highs,” CryptoQuant contributing analyst meanwhile wrote in one of its Quicktake market updates last week. “The recent halving event has effectively cut the potential new supply from miners by half, significantly reducing the likelihood of new Bitcoin entering the market through sales. Given these dynamics, it becomes challenging to maintain a bearish stance on Bitcoin.”Sustainable greed?In what could become an encouraging sign for short-term market sentiment, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is not rushing to extremes on the current BTC price move higher.Related: Bitcoin preps ‘golden cross,’ which last sparked 170% BTC price gainsThe index, which uses a basket of factors to determine the sustainability of overall crypto sentiment, currently stands at 70/100.Crypto Fear and Greed Index (screenshot).

Dogecoin Founder Billy Markus has shared an important message to advertisers on social media platforms like X. Known as a vocal activist on X, the Dogecoin founder uncovered key reasons why users block ads that pop up on their timelines.Malware challengeAccording to the Dogecoin founder, users are less likely to block ads if advertisers on websites stop making a habit of creating pops up with malware and other nonsense. His comments come amid growing concerns regarding scams on social media platforms like X. Especially in the Web3 world, many people use social media as a major channel to connect with users, and scammers generally take advantage of this. On different occasions, crypto projects like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple have issued warnings to their communities to beware of bogus claims on X.As Billy Markus noted, advertisers are to blame for users blocking their ads. Reacting to the post by the Dogecoin founder, users noted that it remains more helpful if projects, websites or advertisers just stick to telling the truth about their offerings.Users will always need to protect themselves, especially in the crypto ecosystem, where one click on social media can lead to account draining.Solving scams in cryptoAs the digital currency ecosystem evolves, so too does the criminal activity grow more sophisticated. Just last week, U.Today reported that a Bitcoin whale lost a total of 1,155 BTC, marking one of the biggest heists of 2024.While many such related scams have been recorded over the past few years, there has always been one strategy to combat this unending fraud. This hinges on raising community awareness.Besides the regular sensitization from Shiba Inu and Ripple executives, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson also recently joined the trend, shining the spotlight on the role of AI Deepfakes overall. The bottom line is, too-good-to-be true offers in advertisements are a potential fund drainer to beware of.

Daily Shiba Inu burn rate has demonstrated a substantial increase with several millions of meme coins transferred out of the circulating supply.SHIB burns increase overnightData published by the Shibburn explorer reveals that within the last 24 hours, the SHIB burn rate has staged a major rise of 62.58%.This way, the Shiba Inu community has successfully disposed of 6,985,600 SHIB meme coins in total thanks to ten burn transactions. The largest burn transfers registered by this tracker included 2,555,239, 1,500,000 and 1,045,369 SHIB.In the meantime, over the past seven days, the SHIB community has managed to get rid of 57,671,544 SHIB. However, this is almost 57% less than was sent to unspendable blockchain wallets a week before – the weekly SHIB burn rate is in the red. Overall, a staggering amount of 410,726,422,225,031 SHIB has been so far burned in total from the quadrillion supply created by Ryoshi when SHIB was launched in 2020. The supply of Shiba Inu that is currently circulating on the market equals 582,992,864,057,113 SHIB meme coins. 6,280,713,717,854 SHIB have been locked in staking platforms.Shiba Inu price performanceOver the period of the past 24 hours, the second largest meme cryptocurrency SHIB has staged a major decline of slightly over 4%, coming out of the range it had been moving for three days prior to that.Shiba Inu price has dropped from the $0.00002504 level to $0.00002397, where it is changing hands at the time of writing this article.cardShibarium transaction activity keeps plummetingThe Shibariumscan explorer shows a continuous decline in on-chain activity on this layer-2 solution.The daily transaction count has dropped to the 11,910 mark compared to 16,900 on Saturday. This is a more than 97% plunge compared to the 562,990 transactions spotted on Shibarium on April 17.As for the total count of transfers on this progressive blockchain platform, it has by now shown a rise to 417,490,509 with the number of connected wallets sitting at 1,803,114.The massive decline in transaction activity might be caused by the current upgrades implemented on Shibarium – last week the charismatic SHIB lead Shytoshi Kusama announced that finally a new version of the ShibaSwap dex has been bridged from the Ethereum blockchain to Shibarium, thus expanding the range of opportunities for SHIB users.

Ripple (XRP) Price Faces Decline: Buying Opportunity Near?


Ripple’s (XRP) price rallied to a one-month peak of $0.56 on May 6. But has since shed 9% of its value.
Although the altcoin remains at risk of a price decline in the short term, it may present a buying opportunity for traders looking to trade against the market. 
Ripple Has Little to Offer in the Interim
XRP currently trades below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.51. The token’s price crossed under this key moving average on May 13, confirming the uptick in its sell-offs among market participants. 

When an asset’s price falls below its 20-day EMA, it signals that its value trades under its average price of the past 20 days. It is interpreted as a bearish signal and a shift in momentum from buying to selling. 
Market participants view it as a sign that an asset’s price might initiate a downtrend or continue to fall.

Further, readings from XRP’s Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) showed its MACD line (blue) resting below its signal (orange) and zero lines. 
This indicator identifies the changes in an asset’s trend or momentum during a specific period.

Ripple Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
When an asset’s MACD line is positioned under its signal and zero lines, it signals that its short-term moving average has fallen below its long-term moving average. It is a bearish sign; market participants view it as a sign to exit long and open short positions. 
XRP Price Prediction: Time To Buy?
XRP’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio observed using 30-day and 365-day moving averages posted negative values of -1.3% and -9.8%, respectively. This may be a good buying opportunity for those looking to buy the dip and trade against current market movements. 
The MVRV tracks the ratio between an asset’s current market price and the average price of its coin or token circulation. When an asset’s MVRV ratio is negative in this manner, it is undervalued because its current market price is less than the average purchase price of all its tokens in circulation. 

This is seen as a buy signal. It suggests that the asset in question currently trades at a price lower than its historical cost basis.

Further, XRP’s positive funding rates in its futures market suggest that traders continue to hold long positions despite the token’s recent price troubles. 

If XRP sees significant accumulation, the bulls may be able to push its price above $0.53 and toward $0.57.

However, if the current bearish trend gains momentum, the token’s value may fall under $0.5 to trade at $0.44.

Notcoin (NOT) Turns From Telegram Crypto Hype To Investor Tears In Just A Week On Intense Profit-Taking - Benzinga

A cryptocurrency heavily endorsed by social media giant Telegram turned out to be a dud in its opening week, leaving investors who bought into the hype with heavy losses. What Happened: Notcoin NOT/USD debuted on the Toncoin TON/USD network–another project closely linked with Telegram–last week after nearly $1 billion worth of tokens were airdropped to eligible investors, alongside high-profile listings on exchanges like Binance. Note that Notcoin is a Telegram-based game with an impressive 35 million user base. Users who play the in-app game have the option of converting their currency into NOT. The project has been promoted by none other than Telegram founder Pavel Durov, who heaped praise for Notcoin on his Telegram Channel. He noted, " We are now seeing a large wave of new mini-apps being built on Telegram and TON. Notcoin used its mighty paws to pave the way for many apps to come."Price Action: Barring the initial euphoria that saw the crypto gain 30% on its debut on May 16, the price action has disappointed investors. NOT was trading 62% down over the week, according to CoinMarketCap, with double-digit losses in the past 24 hours. Why It Matters: The price slump happened as most investors immediately resorted to profit-taking after receiving the airdrop rather than holding them for future gains.This happened despite the project introducing stalking services to restrict users from spending away their coins. The sharp fall since the hype created last week reflected the topsy-turvy world of cryptocurrencies, which, despite the considerable stability seen in some of its blue-chip assets, remains a very volatile industry. Read Next: Bitcoin Worth $1B Transferred By Just Paying $7.30 In Fees: Can Traditional Banking Carry Out Such A Feat?Image via ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Bitcoin's most recent reversal at $67,000, toward $65,880, was a worrying sign for investors as it would mean that the asset could not gain a foothold above the 50 EMA resistance level. Luckily, the situation has changed, and Bitcoin managed to paint a green candle in the last few hours. This could be a sign that BTC is gearing up for another push toward the long-anticipated $70,000 mark.Bitcoin has been consolidating between $65,000 and $67,000 in the last few days, trying to break above critical resistance levels. The 50 EMA has been the most important threshold for BTC to break, and the recent bullish momentum suggests that BTC might be able to overcome this barrier and leave it behind. A successful breach of the 50 EMA could set the stage for a rally toward $70,000.Bitcoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the on-chain data, we see a substantial number of large transactions, which indicates increased activity among whales. Over the last 24 hours, there have been 11.8K large transactions, hitting the seven-day high of 17.89K on May 15, 2024. This surge in large transactions is a positive sign, as it shows that big players are still actively trading Bitcoin, potentially driving the price higher.Furthermore, the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) data reveals that a significant number of addresses are "in the money" at the current price levels. Approximately 5.96 million addresses, or 71.14%, are profitable, which provides a solid foundation for bullish sentiment. These addresses could act as a support level if Bitcoin faces another downturn, as holders might be less likely to sell at a loss.The next major resistance levels are between $66,628 and $67,788. If Bitcoin can break through this zone, it will likely target the $70,000 mark. The data suggests that there is a strong chance of this happening, especially with the current bullish momentum and the increased activity among large traders.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Unstable at $67K, Altcoins Turn Red (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin’s price dropped below $67,000 on a few occasions in the past 24 hours but has reacted well to each correction and now sits at that line once again.
The altcoins are slightly in the red on a daily scale, with TON, ADA, and SHIB retracing by around 3%.
BTC Goes Down and Up
It was less than a week ago – last Tuesday – when the primary cryptocurrency’s price had declined to just over $61,000 amid some Coinbase issues. However, the asset bounced off almost immediately and started a notable rally on Wednesday after the US CPI numbers were announced.
In a matter of hours, BTC jumped by several grand and exceeded $66,000. It corrected on Thursday to just under $65,000 but reversed its trajectory once again by the end of the week.
This culminated in a couple of price pumps above $67,500, the latest of which came on Sunday. However, the bears intercepted the move and pushed BTC down to just under $66,000. A bit more volatility followed with another brief decline, but bitcoin currently stands close to $67,000 once again, being down less than 0.5% in a day.

Alts See Red
Most altcoins have mimicked BTC’s performance in the past 24 hours, posting minor losses. ETH is close to breaking below $3,100 after a 0.4% daily decline as anticipation for the SEC’s decision on Ethereum ETFs grows. Binance Coin has decreased by a similar percentage to $576.
More losses from the larger-cap alts come from XRP, DOGE, AVA, DOT, TRX, and BCH, while TON, SHIB, and ADA are down by 2.5-3%.
In contrast, Solana’s native token has jumped by 2.5% and sits close to $180. WIF, PEPE, NEAR, and GRT are also slightly in the green.
The total crypto market cap has shed some value since yesterday and is just under $2.550 trillion on CG now.

US economist accuses government of causing inflation


As the United States grapples with inflation, renowned American economist Peter Schiff has accused the government, particularly the US Federal Reserve as one of its branches, of causing it, challenging the widely accepted viewpoint of rising salaries as the actual source of the price increases.
Specifically, Schiff has challenged the narrative of increased salaries causing inflation, arguing that, instead, inflation can lead to higher nominal salaries, whereas pointing the finger at, in his view, the real culprit – the US government and the Fed, according to his X post on May 20.


Indeed, Schiff has been warning about inflation for some time now, including last month, when he referred to this threat as “gravely understated” by those who are trying to curb inflation fears, stressing that the current situation was “just the tip of an inflation iceberg.



At the same time, the prominent economist declared that a full-blow inflationary depression or ‘stagflation’ was coming that would shadow previous financial crises and make them look tame by comparison, calling it a recession “on steroids,” as Finbold reported on April 30.

Moreover, recent data indicates that auto loan serious delinquency rates have surged to 2.8% in the first quarter of 2024, the highest level in nearly 15 years, or since 2010 – in the aftermath of the financial crisis, as US households continue to miss loan payments, reminiscent of past recessions.

Inflation concerns
Meanwhile, Paul Dietrich, a veteran Wall Street analyst who accurately predicted the 2008 recession, has long warned about a potential downturn, pointing at several red flags, including unexpectedly high inflation in the first quarter of 2024 and increased market volatility. As he said:

“The economy and the stock market have never seen anything like this in history. (…) Everything reminds me of the Dot-com bubble in 2001-2002. (…) Since the current deficit spending is unsustainable, it will end at some point. When it does, the effect will be brutal for jobs, the economy, and the global stock markets.”

Interestingly, Schiff, a well-known Bitcoin (BTC) skeptic, has earlier acknowledged that Bitcoin holders are “right about the Fed and inflation,” arguing that other investors were largely unaware of the current financial crisis and the “far greater currency and sovereign debt crisis it will ultimately become.”
In the meantime, Bitcoin and tech stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are among the market participants that have beaten inflation in the last 10 years.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC) halted its decline and regained traction, rising above $67,000 and reaching an intraday high of $67,600.After briefly dipping below $66,000, Bitcoin bounced back due to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and increasing tensions in the Middle East, particularly following the helicopter crash involving Iran’s President.These factors have led investors to view Bitcoin as a hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainty.Looking ahead, crypto traders will focus on speeches by Fed officials Bostic, Bullard, Waller, Evans, and Mester, as these will provide insights into future monetary policy.Hawkish comments from these officials could limit Bitcoin’s upward trend by signalling tighter monetary policy, reducing the appeal of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin as a Safe Haven Asset Amid Geopolitical Unrest
Bitcoin often gains value as a safe haven asset during periods of geopolitical turmoil or economic uncertainty. Recently, Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian tragically died in a helicopter crash in East Azerbaijan province. Rescuers found the crash site after searching in challenging weather conditions.
Iran’s vice president will assume presidential duties.
New elections are scheduled within 50 days.
Middle Eastern countries are showing solidarity with Iran during this difficult time.
The perception of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset can lead to increased demand and a higher BTC price amid such crises.Fed Rate Cut Expectations Boost Bitcoin Amid Economic Uncertainty
The broad-based US dollar edged lower as investors anticipated potential Fed rate cuts. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin noted that while inflation is easing, reaching the 2% target will take more time. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester stated that the current monetary policy is appropriate as they continue to assess economic data.Fed Governor Michelle Bowman mentioned that while the policy is restrictive, she is open to hiking rates if inflation stalls.
According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets have priced in a 10% chance of a rate cut in June and nearly 80% in September.The prospect of Fed rate cuts and cautious monetary policy comments contribute to increased uncertainty and volatility in financial markets. This environment leads investors to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, boosting its price.

Senate Passes Bipartisan Crypto Bill, Biden Faces Dilemma Over SEC Veto Threat



                    

On May 16, 2024, a majority of U.S. Senators approved a Congressional Review Act (CRA) to review the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). 



The Senate passed H.J.Res. 109 with a 60 to 38 vote, a rare bipartisan achievement. Notably, 51 of the votes came from Democrats. 




Senator Cynthia Lummis highlighted this as a historic moment, marking the first time Congress passed standalone crypto legislation.



President Biden had previously threatened to veto any resolution overturning the SEC policy. 



The White House stated its strong opposition to disrupting the SEC’s efforts to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and the broader financial system. 




Despite the threat, historical data shows that around one-third of threatened vetoes are never executed, making the outcome uncertain.



The bipartisan support for the crypto bill was emphasized by Perianne Boring, CEO of the Digital Chamber, who noted that the controversy around SAB 121 led 21 Democratic Senators to break ranks. 



Among the supportive Democrats was Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Boring suggested that Schumer’s support could prompt the White House to reconsider its stance, indicating a shift in Washington’s attitude towards crypto.

The Biden administration faces pressure from beyond the political sphere as well. 



The American Bankers Association has urged President Biden to sign H.J.Res. 109 to protect consumers, highlighting the banking sector’s interest in offering custody services for cryptocurrencies.



With broad support for H.J.Res. 109, the Biden administration must decide whether to veto the resolution, potentially causing internal conflict within the Democratic Party as elections approach. 



Patrick Kirby of the Crypto Council for Innovation explained that Biden has 10 days to sign, veto, or allow the resolution to become law without his signature. 



Alternatively, Biden could use a pocket veto if Congress is not in session.



Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance further complicates Biden’s decision, as Trump could leverage this position in the upcoming election. 



Kirby noted that if Biden vetoes H.J.Res. 109, Congress could attempt to override it with a two-thirds majority in both chambers.



A possible resolution could come from the SEC itself. Republican Wiley Nickel suggested that SEC Chair Gary Gensler could revoke SAB 121, removing the need for Biden’s veto. 



SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce criticized SAB 121 at a Blockchain Summit, saying it hampers industry growth by requiring companies to record crypto assets as both assets and liabilities, contrary to conventional asset custody practices.



Pierce welcomed Congress’s involvement in crypto regulation, viewing it as a positive development for consumers and financial innovation. 



As the SEC holds the power to resolve this issue, the next move is theirs.

                        The Hong Kong Institute for International Finance (HKIIF) Chairman Xiao Geng recently highlighted the potential benefits of a CNY-pegged stablecoin for Hong Kong during an event.According to a report by Xinhua Finance, Xiao delivered a speech at “The First Shenzhen Finance Forum and The Opening Ceremony of Shenzhen Finance Institute.” The event was hosted by Renmin University of China and had a session focused on digital finance.Hong Kong’s Special Status for Chinese Yuan
During the speech, Xiao emphasized that a stablecoin pegged to Chinese yuan could enhance the offshore CNY market and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center.Xiao said that Hong Kong plays a crucial role in the international promotion of the Chinese yuan, serving as the world’s largest offshore CNY business hub. He noted that the Greater Bay Area’s cross-border CNY products are particularly innovative.Xiao highlighted Hong Kong’s tradition as a testing ground for financial innovations, supported by a robust institutional and market foundation that allows for trials with minimal resistance.He also acknowledged the city’s capability to support and develop advanced digital financial infrastructures.Therefore, Xiao advocated for the creation of a Greater Bay Area stablecoin linked to the Chinese yuan. This stablecoin, based on regulated blockchains and digital smart contracts, elevate Hong Kong’s status in the global financial sector.Benefits of CNY-Pegged Stablecoin
He explained that such a stablecoin could solidify Hong Kong’s position by leveraging its role as an experimental zone for CNY internationalization and its novel boundary-less CNY products.In addition, this initiative could further integrate the financial systems of the Mainland Onshore and Hong Kong-Macau Offshore special economic zones.According to Xiao, the stablecoin could balance the USD-dominated international financial system while enriching the spectrum of offshore CNY market products.On the other hand, the stablecoin would construct “firewalls” and “spare tires” to guard against systemic risks that might arise from a potential collapse of the USD, where the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar.

Solana memecoin protocol pump.fun exploit mastermind arrested in London - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Jarett Dunn, aka @STACCoverflow, arrested in London for Solana memecoin exploit.
Dunn used flash loans to manipulate pump.fun, stealing $2 million in liquidity.
Released on bail, Dunn confessed online, citing mental health struggles and grief

The alleged orchestrator of the recent Solana memecoin protocol pump.fun exploit, Jarett Dunn, known online as @STACCoverflow, has been arrested in London.
The arrest follows a sophisticated 26-hour intelligence operation spearheaded by a third-party stakeholder who had enlisted a private intelligence firm to track Dunn’s activities.
Jarett Dunn arrested in Middle Eight Hotel
The operation culminated in the early hours of May 18 when local operatives, or “auxiliaries,” pinpointed Dunn’s location at the Middle Eight Hotel in Covent Garden.
After a seven-hour search, British authorities apprehended Dunn, who has since been released on bail pending his court appearance in August.
The Pump.fun flash loan exploit
Dunn, a former contractor, is accused of exploiting the Solana-based pump.fun protocol by utilizing flash loans from the Raydium lending platform.
Flash loans allow users to borrow large sums of capital without collateral, provided the loan is repaid within the same transaction.
Dunn allegedly manipulated the pump.fun bonding curves to access and withdraw substantial liquidity, profiting $2 million in the process.
In the aftermath of the exploit, Dunn took to social media to confess his involvement. His posts on X (formerly Twitter) revealed a mix of remorse and defiance, hinting at a desire to distribute the stolen funds to Solana (SOL) token holders.
Dunn also opened up about his mental health struggles and the recent loss of his mother, suggesting that emotional distress played a significant role in his actions.
The exploit has prompted pump.fun to work closely with law enforcement to investigate the breach. Initial theories by Igor Igamberdiev, head of research at cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute, pointed to an internal private key leak.
Dunn’s erratic tweets have since confirmed his role, though the specifics of his proposed fund distribution remain unclear.
As the investigation continues, the cryptocurrency community watches closely, awaiting further developments in this high-profile case.

BounceBit's 2024 Roadmap Highlights Post-Mainnet Strategy


On May 20, one week after its mainnet launch, BounceBit, a Bitcoin restaking protocol, unveiled its detailed 2024 roadmap.
The roadmap highlights the company’s plans to enhance the integration of centralized finance (CeFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi), forming a hybrid known as CeDeFi.
BounceBit Aims to Merge the Best of CeFi and DeFi

BounceBit’s 2024 roadmap outlines a series of upgrades and new product offerings. These plans are designed to strengthen its ecosystem and improve user experience. The roadmap intends to optimize its blockchain infrastructure, enhance liquidity, and provide diverse yield-generating options for investors.
The project sees key issues in both sectors. Centralized platforms offer structure and accessibility, but they often conflict with crypto’s core values of transparency and decentralization. Conversely, DeFi provides direct market participation but struggles with smart contract security and scalability challenges.
Read more: CeFi vs. DeFi: Everything You Need To Know
By integrating the best aspects of CeFi and DeFi, BounceBit aims to democratize access to high-yield opportunities traditionally reserved for top asset management firms. The BounceBit Chain, the project’s blockchain infrastructure, ensures secure and efficient settlement and record-keeping. Users can earn staking rewards and participate in yield-generating activities using a dual-token proof-of-stake system.
Liquid Custody Tokens (LCT) play a central role in BounceBit’s ecosystem, bridging CeFi and DeFi. These tokens enable users to earn interest from CeFi while participating in Bitcoin staking and on-chain farming.

“All LCTs are backed 1:1 by equivalent assets in custody, and they stay there until the LCT is redeemed. Custody is effectively an aggregated pool of assets, in a passive state, until they are not,” the BounceBit team wrote in its roadmap.

The integrated ecosystem offers three yield types: CeFi yield from arbitrage and lending, staking rewards, and opportunity yield from engaging in the BounceBit chain ecosystem.

Additionally, BounceBit Chain will see major upgrades to improve performance and usability. These include optimized EVM execution, a shared security client module, a new mempool module for higher transaction throughput, and refined communication between EVM and Cosmos software development kit (SDK).
BounceBit also introduces BounceClub. This club focuses on providing CeDeFi as a service, allowing users to launch their own products using BounceBit’s infrastructure.

4 Key Reasons Why The Bitcoin Bull Run Is Far From Over


																In an analysis shared via X, renowned crypto analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) has provided compelling evidence to support his assertion that the current Bitcoin bull run is far from over. Ted’s insights are based on four critical indicators related to traditional finance and crypto liquidity, each pointing to sustained growth in the near future. Here’s a breakdown of his analysis:
#1 65-Month Liquidity Cycle
Ted highlights the 65-month liquidity cycle, a historical pattern that marks the ebb and flow of liquidity in financial markets. According to his analysis, this cycle bottomed out in October 2023, signaling the beginning of a new expansion phase.

“We are now in the expansion phase, which is expected to peak in 2026,” Ted stated. This projection aligns with the anticipated easing by central banks in response to slowing economic data over the next 18 to 24 months. Historically, increased liquidity has been a precursor to bull markets in various asset classes, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem.

#2 M2 Money Supply
The M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, is another crucial indicator, if not the most important indicator of global liquidity. Ted notes that the rate of expansion in the M2 money supply is at its lowest since the 1990s.
“There is plenty of room to the upside for easing liquidity conditions,” he explained. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies to stimulate economies, increased M2 growth could lead to more capital flowing into risk assets like Bitcoin.

#3 Crypto Liquidity
While liquidity has returned to the crypto markets, particularly with the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ted points out that the velocity of inflows has not yet reached the levels seen at cycle tops. “The velocity of inflow has not yet seen a manic phase consistent with cycle tops,” he noted.

This suggests that while interest and investment in Bitcoin are growing, the market has not yet reached the speculative frenzy that typically precedes a major correction. This phase of measured inflow can provide a more stable foundation for continued price increases.

#4 Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows
The US based spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows, with last week alone witnessing $950 million flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the largest net inflow since March. Ted expects these inflows to increase as Bitcoin’s price rises and traditional finance investors regain confidence in the asset.
“Expect these to only increase as price drifts higher and tradFi once again renew faith in the asset,” he stated. The growing acceptance and investment from institutional investors via ETFs are a strong bullish indicator for Bitcoin’s continued ascent.

Each of these factors points to a sustained and robust bull market for Bitcoin. Ted’s analysis, grounded in traditional financial indicators and crypto-specific data, provides a comprehensive outlook on the current and future state of the Bitcoin market. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies and institutional interest continues to grow, the conditions appear ripe for Bitcoin’s bull run to extend well into the coming years.
At press time, BTC traded at $66,602.

The company achieved total revenue of $419.8 million, marking a 12% year-over-year increase. This was driven by a reacceleration in Creative Subscriptions growth, which saw revenue rise to $304.3 million, up 9% from the previous year.



The Business Solutions segment also showed impressive growth, with revenue reaching $115.5 million, a 20% increase year-over-year.



Total bookings for the quarter amounted to $457.3 million, reflecting a 10% year-over-year growth. The momentum in the Partners business was particularly noteworthy, driven by the strong uptake of Wix Studio. This segment alone contributed $138.4 million in revenue, up 33% year-over-year. The company also reported a GAAP operating income of $9.7 million, marking the second consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profit, and a free cash flow margin of 26%, setting a new record.



WIX Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



Wix’s first-quarter performance notably exceeded market expectations. Analysts had projected an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03 and revenue of $417.9 million. However, Wix reported a non-GAAP net income of $77.3 million, translating to an EPS of $1.38 per basic share and $1.29 per diluted share, significantly surpassing the anticipated figures. The total revenue of $419.8 million also exceeded the expected $417.9 million, underscoring the company’s strong market position and operational efficiency.



The company’s robust performance was underpinned by higher conversion rates and improved monetization across its user base. This was further supported by the substantial traction of its AI product offerings and the continued success of Wix Studio. The high conversion rates of Studio users, resulting in more premium subscriptions than anticipated, highlight the effectiveness of Wix’s product strategy and its ability to meet market demands.





WIX Ups 2024 Full Year Guidance



Looking ahead, Wix has raised its full-year 2024 guidance based on the strong first-quarter performance and positive business trends. The company now expects full-year bookings to be in the range of $1,796 to $1,826 million, representing a 12-14% year-over-year growth. This revised outlook is approximately $13 million higher at the midpoint compared to previous estimates. The increase in bookings is anticipated to be driven by accelerating growth in both the Self Creators and Partners segments, with AI products and Wix Studio playing pivotal roles.



Wix also updated its revenue outlook for 2024, now expecting total revenue to be between $1,738 and $1,761 million, reflecting an 11-13% year-over-year growth. For the second quarter of 2024, the company projects total revenue to be in the range of $431 to $435 million, which translates to an 11-12% year-over-year growth. Additionally, Wix has maintained its non-GAAP total gross margin guidance at 68-69% for the full year and expects non-GAAP operating expenses to be 50-51% of revenue.

Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is on the verge of a significant breakout, according to prominent crypto analyst Jelle. In a recent tweet, Jelle highlighted a potentially bullish setup for Ethereum, noting that ETH was close to breaking out from a falling wedge.The analyst mentioned that after reclaiming the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), ETH only needed a little push to break out from the multi-month continuation pattern, with a target of over $4,000. The falling wedge pattern, a technical analysis tool, is typically seen as a bullish indicator, suggesting that a significant price movement could be imminent.Reclaiming the 100-day EMA is a crucial step for Ethereum, as it often acts as a support level, reinforcing the potential for an upward breakout. If ETH successfully breaks out of the falling wedge, it could target the $4,000 mark, a significant psychological and technical level for the cryptocurrency. This potential move could attract more investors, further driving up the price and trading volume.Bullish signals emerge for ETHAs of the latest data, Ethereum is trading at $3,101, experiencing a slight decline of 0.28% in the past 24 hours. Despite this minor drop, the ETH price has shown a positive trend over the past week, gaining 4.07%. This upward momentum is reflected in the increased trading activity, with the 24-hour trading volume surging by 35.51% to reach $11.17 billion.Moreover, technical indicators further support the bullish outlook for the Ethereum price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.93, which is indicative of bullish sentiment on the market. Notably, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is at −26.25, signaling a buying opportunity for investors.In the end, this analysis reveals that Ethereum is poised for a notable price breakout, with technical indicators and trading volume supporting a bullish scenario. Investors and traders will be closely watching for a decisive move above the current levels, potentially pushing the ETH price toward the $4,000 target.

Dr Wright’s explanations are 'absurd' and 'plainly forged' Judge states in written judgment

The full written judgment in Dr. Craig Wright vs. COPA was released this morning, May 20, including damning indictments of Dr. Wright’s actions during the trial.“Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly. Most of his lies related to the documents he had forged which purported to support his claim. All his lies and forged documents were in support of his biggest lie: his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto”​The judge identified numerous instances where Dr. Wright forged documents to support his claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. According to the judgment, Dr. Wright’s narrative was riddled with inconsistencies and fabrications, severely undermining his credibility.The judgment highlighted that if Dr. Wright’s claims were valid, he would be an extraordinarily unfortunate individual beset by a series of implausible coincidences and conspiracies. However, the court determined that the simpler and more plausible explanation is that Dr. Wright has been dishonest for years, fabricating evidence to support his assertions.The judge pointed out that Dr. Wright’s extensive fabrications and forgeries were exposed during the trial.“These fabrications and forgeries were exposed in the evidence which I received during the Trial. For that reason, this Judgment contains considerable technical and other detail which is required to expose the true scale of his mendacious campaign to prove he was/is Satoshi Nakamoto”.​The detailed judgment outlines the technical and other forms of evidence that revealed the extent of his deceptive campaign to convince the court and the public of his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.Ultimately, the court concluded that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that Dr. Wright was not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper or the person who adopted the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym between 2008 and 2011. The judgment further asserted that Dr. Wright did not create the Bitcoin system or the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.“I reached the conclusion the evidence was overwhelming… Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper”.​The appendix to the main judgment included further, more specific condemnations of Dr. Wright’s actions. Listing each piece of evidence, Judge Mellor commented that “Dr Wright’s explanations are absurd. He plainly forged this email” and that ​​“I am in no doubt that all of Dr Wright’s LATEX documents are recent forgeries created by Dr Wright”.​​Further, Judge Mellor outright rejected claims that Dr. Wright had been hacked, instead stating,“I reject Dr Wright’s allegation of having been hacked. In my judgment, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the BDO Drive was seeded by Dr Wright with all the New Reliance Documents in September 2023 and that he was responsible for all the manipulations identified by Mr Madden”While the judgment document did not specify particular punishments or remunerations for Dr. Wright, it indicated that further relief, including potential injunctive measures sought by the plaintiffs, would be addressed in a subsequent hearing following the judgment’s handdown.Mentioned in this article

A savvy trader turned $2,275 worth of Solana (SOL) tokens into a profit of $2.26 million in just eight hours.The memecoin trader’s wallet, known as ‘sundayfunday.sol,’ made an over 993-fold gain on his 13 SOL investment into newly-launched memecoin 1DOL, according to a May 19 post by Lookonchain:“8 hours ago, He spent 13 $SOL ($2,275) to buy 242M #1DOL, which is currently worth $2.26M!”Memecoins like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) have taken the spotlight since the Bitcoin halving. Despite having no underlying utility, memecoins often reach multibillion-dollar valuations, making millionaires for some investors.The over 900-fold gain is no coincidence as the wallet is also the largest pre-sale participant of the Book of Memes (BOME) token. He bought over $72,000 SOL worth of BOME tokens at presale which was worth over $40 million at peak.Despite taking profits on some of his holdings, the trader remains the largest BOME holder according to Lookonchain:“He sold 530 billion $BOME for 38,305 $SOL ($7.66M) and currently holds 894 billion $BOME ($10.5 million), still the largest individual holder of $BOME.”The 1DOL memecoin launched on May 18 and rose to a peak of $0.018 by the following day, before plunging to its current $0.04 mark. 1DOL is down over 43% during the past 24 hours, showcasing the volatility of memecoin trading, according to CoinMarketCap.1DOL/SOL, all-time chart.

Genesis to return $3B to customers after court approves bankruptcy plan - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Genesis Global gets court approval to repay $3 billion to customers.
Judge Sean Lane overruled an objection from Genesis parent company Digital Currency Group.
DCG argued payments to be in US value of assets as of bankruptcy filing in January 2023.

Genesis Global has secured court approval to return $3 billion in cash and crypto to its creditors, details in a recent court filing show. The payouts will represent about 77% of customers’ claims.
However, the payout doesn’t include Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Genesis Global.
The development comes after US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane approved the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan Genesis Global and its subsidiaries filed in January 2023. Genesis’ bankruptcy followed the collapse of Three Arrows Capital and FTX in 2022.
Judge overrules DCG objection
As noted above, the plan to return billions of dollars worth of crypto assets and cash to Genesis creditors has received a node from Judge Sean Lane. 
On Friday, the judge overruled DCG’s objection to the liquidation plan, paving way for this significant step in the right direction for creditors. 
In their argument, DCG had argued that Genesis should pay customers as per the value of their crypto assets at the time the company filed for bankruptcy.
In dismissing DCG’s objections, Judge Lane noted:
“The record here clearly establishes that there is not sufficient value in the Debtors’ estates to provide DCG a recovery as equity holder after unsecured creditors are paid… Given the size of the creditor claims, DCG is out of the money as an equity holder by billions of dollars, even if the Court valued creditor claims using the method DCG proposes.”
When Genesis filed for Chapter 11, customer claims by the top 50 creditors was over $3.5 billion. The court’s approval of the liquidation plan will see approximately 97% of reimbursements handled in-kind.
This means a customer who deposited BTC will receive payout in BTC and not the equivalent US dollar value.
Genesis to return crypto to customers beginning next month
At current prices, customer claims for Bitcoin or Ethereum are trading at 97-110% for claims amounting to over $10 million. Claims under $1 million are trading at 74-94%. In comparison, the claims traded at 35% at the time the crypto lender filed for bankruptcy.
For stablecoins, its 89-91% for claims of $1-10 million and 73-88% for accounts with under $1 million.
The plan allows for creditors reimbursements to begin early next month, bringing value to Gemini Earn customers and other Genesis creditors. 
Notably, the price of Bitcoin has increased significantly since January 2023, rising from around $21k to currently hover above $66k. BTC reached a new all-time high above $73k in March.

How to buy Bitcoin in Switzerland

Switzerland has emerged as a digital innovation hub due to progressive regulations and a welcoming atmosphere for crypto enterprises. At the core of this innovation lies Zug, dubbed the Crypto Valley, which houses hundreds of firms spearheading fintech and blockchain development. The country’s robust regulatory framework ensures security and privacy for stakeholders involved, earning it a prominent position in the landscape of crypto innovation.The Henley & Partners Crypto Adoption Index report 2023 places Switzerland second, with an impressive score of 46.9%. Switzerland performed well in innovation and technology, regulatory environment and economic factors.This article delves into the process of purchasing Bitcoin (BTC) in Switzerland and explains if Bitcoin is legal in Switzerland, Swiss banks’ attitudes toward cryptocurrency, and how to buy Bitcoin via crypto exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs, P2P platforms and Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) machines.Is Bitcoin legal in Switzerland?Switzerland follows a forward-looking approach when it comes to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Swiss regulators acknowledge Bitcoin as a legal asset or property, with exchanges and digital currency platforms allowed to function within Swiss borders once they obtain the required permissions.Gains made via Bitcoin are liable for income tax for corporations and professional traders or wealth tax for individuals. A robust blockchain ecosystem has been cultivated in Switzerland thanks to the country’s crypto-friendly regulations, especially in the canton of Zug, which is known as Crypto Valley because of the concentration of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related enterprises there. Switzerland has enacted laws governing virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to ensure security and transparency in the crypto industry. VASPs need to comply with the Financial Services Act (FinSA) and the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act to operate in Switzerland. They need to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and conduct extensive customer due diligence. These organizations must also register with the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and follow stringent reporting guidelines.Regulations in Switzerland consider a VASP to be operating professionally if it:Generates a gross revenue exceeding 50,000 Swiss francs per calendar year.Establishes business relationships with more than 20 contractual parties within a calendar year.Exercises unrestricted control over third-party funds totaling more than 5 million francs.Executes transactions with a total volume surpassing 2 million francs annually.How Switzerland’s banking sector is embracing cryptocurrencies and blockchain Let’s take a look at the kind of crypto products rolled out by Swiss banks and how they have been embracing blockchain technology:Types of cryptocurrency products and services offered by banks in SwitzerlandSwiss banks offer various types of cryptocurrency products and services:Trading and brokerage: Certain banks enable their clients to buy and sell cryptocurrencies through partnerships with specialized platforms.Integration of wealth management: Some banks use cryptocurrency in investment portfolios for specific clientele.

All these services will be offered following Switzerland’s advanced crypto legislation.How to buy Bitcoin in SwitzerlandUsers have several options when it comes to buying Bitcoin in Switzerland:Cryptocurrency exchanges Switzerland, known for its robust financial regulatory ecosystem, hosts both global and local crypto exchanges. International exchanges such as Binance, Crypto.com and Kraken enable residents to trade various cryptocurrencies. Native exchanges like Bitcoin Suisse also cater to institutional investors and individual traders. Here is a step-by-step process of how to use a cryptocurrency exchange to buy Bitcoin in Switzerland.Choose a crypto exchangeUsers should do their research and pick a secure cryptocurrency exchange with a track record to prove its credentials. Users should conduct thorough research, read user reviews and consider their trading needs before selecting a platform. Set up an accountOnce the user has chosen an exchange, they must create an account. Swiss regulations require the exchanges to ensure all users have completed identity verification processes, including KYC.Fund your accountAt this stage, users need to fund their exchange account with Swiss francs or any other recognized fiat currencies. Users may use bank transfers, credit/debit cards or other payment options.Place an orderThe user can state how much Bitcoin they wish to acquire. When choosing spot trading, they could place a market or a limit order. A limit order runs only when the price hits a predetermined threshold. A market order executes immediately at the current market price.VerificationBefore confirming the transaction, one should double-check the details of their order, including the price and quantity. After verification, the exchange will process their order and credit their exchange account with the cryptocurrency ordered.Store crypto After buying Bitcoin, one might keep it on the exchange or, for added security, transfer it to a private cryptocurrency wallet. Bitcoin ATMBitcoin ATMs, or BTMs, let customers buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using cash.Similar to conventional ATMs, users can deposit cash, choose their preferred cryptocurrency, and receive coins of the equivalent value in their chosen wallet. Users can also deposit cryptocurrencies and withdraw cash after completing verification.According to Coin ATM Radar, over 130 ATMs are present across Switzerland as of May 2024. Basel, Bern, Genève, Ipsach, Lausanne, Biel/Bienne, Chur and Lugano are home to most of the ATMs, with Zurich being home to almost 40 Bitcoin ATMs.Peer-to-peer platformsThe peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange refers to buying or selling Bitcoin directly with another person on a platform: Choose and register on a P2P platformOpt for a credible platform that facilitates P2P trading. Platforms such as Paxful and Remitano offer escrow services to guarantee security.On the P2P platform, create an account.

Take into account aspects such as transaction restrictions and seller credibility.Open a tradeOne can open a trade with the chosen seller by mentioning the quantity of Bitcoin they wish to purchase and their preferred method of payment. Online wallets, PayPal, bank transfers and cash deposits are a few popular ways to make payments.Discuss termsSpeak to the seller and negotiate the conditions of the trade, including the exchange rate and payment instructions. Users should address any queries or worries they may have before completing the purchase.Finalize the transactionPay the seller via bank transfer or debit/credit card. The money will go to the escrow account. Users need to ensure that Bitcoin has arrived in the wallet before sending confirmation to the exchange.Swiss Federal Railways machinesIn 2016, the SBB introduced a new medium for buying Bitcoin straight from ticket vending machines. With over 1,000 machines spread around 700 rail stations, this program provides access to cash-based Bitcoin transactions.To buy Bitcoin from the railway ticket machines, a user must have a Bitcoin wallet and a Swiss mobile phone number. Anyone can access crypto-enabled SBB machines to buy Bitcoin 24/7. Buyers can also purchase and keep Bitcoin offline using a paper wallet.Though convenient, SBB’s Bitcoin service imposes exorbitant fees, ranging from 6% to 14%, making Bitcoin purchases expensive.How and where to spend Bitcoin in SwitzerlandSpending cryptocurrency is becoming more and more feasible in Switzerland as the adoption is steadily increasing. In Zurich and Geneva, lots of restaurants, shops and luxury boutiques take payments in crypto. Lugano, the largest city in the Italian-speaking region of southern Switzerland, has de-facto adopted BTC as legal tender. Renowned brands such as McDonalds, Rolex and Lamborghini and regular businesses like pharmacies, convenience stores and tobacco shops in the city accept BTC as payment.Across the country, a large number of online merchants and service providers give customers BTC and other crypto payment choices, with no shortage of services facilitating the conversion between fiat and crypto.The country hosts many Bitcoin ATMs, simplifying the process of exchanging Bitcoin for Swiss francs and vice versa. Switzerland’s positive approach toward digital currencies has provided holders with a range of choices regarding how to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.How to store Bitcoin in SwitzerlandStoring crypto assets is important due to risks such as thefts, hacking, scams and cyberattacks. Leaving assets on exchanges could expose them to hacking risks. Though spreading assets across multiple exchanges reduces risk, reliance on centralized exchanges might result in potential hazards. Hot wallets that are connected to the internet are always susceptible to hackers.For heightened security, crypto can be kept offline in cold wallets. Physical devices like USB drives or paper wallets that are disconnected from the internet are termed cold wallets. This isolation gives them better protection against online threats and makes them a preferred choice for long-term storage of cryptocurrency assets.

LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino's Investment Portfolio Revealed! Here are the Projects the CEO Invested in! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bryan Pellegrino, CEO of LayerZero, attracted attention with his diverse investment portfolio, which includes many promising projects in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.
LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino's Investment Portfolio Attracts Interest
Its investments cover a range of innovative projects including Monad, SkyArk Chronicles, Pudgy Penguins, Shogun, Superform, Blockus, Crypto Rogue Games, Integral and Fantasy Top.


The revelation of Pellegrino's investment interests created curiosity and controversy within the crypto community, particularly regarding LayerZero's anti-Sybil plans.
Sybil attacks, where a single entity creates multiple identities to manipulate a network or gain unfair influence, are a significant concern in decentralized ecosystems.





LayerZero's attempt to combat Sybil attacks has led to speculation about whether other projects will adopt similar anti-Sybil strategies or use LayerZero's Sybil address database.

This proactive stance against Sybil attacks is seen as a critical move to increase the security and integrity of blockchain networks.


Community members are closely watching how these projects will address the Sybil issue and whether they will leverage LayerZero's framework or develop their own methods to provide robust defense mechanisms.
As LayerZero continues to implement and improve its anti-Sybil measures, its approach may set a precedent for others in the industry to follow.





The interest in Pellegrino's investments and LayerZero's security strategies underscore ongoing efforts to overcome widespread challenges in the blockchain community and promote a safer, more trustworthy environment for all participants.

Greenlight for Ethereum ETFs? SEC Examines Exchange Proposals


							

SEC reviews Ethereum ETF applications from stock exchanges.



Potential benefits for investors and wider adoption.



Final decision on approval remains uncertain.




The SEC is currently reviewing applications from stock exchanges seeking to list ETFs that directly hold Ethereum (Ether is Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency). If approved, these ETFs would trade on major exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq.







These applications, known as Rule 19b-4 filings, are the mechanism through which exchanges propose new products or rules to the SEC. In this instance, exchanges are requesting the go-ahead to list Ethereum ETFs on their platforms.



The approval process is not a simple one. There’s an additional hurdle: the S-1 filing. This is essentially a detailed prospectus outlining an ETF’s operations, finances, and management structure, required for any new security offered to the public. Both the 19b-4 and S-1 filings must be approved by the SEC before the ETFs can be traded.



The SEC has a designated timeframe (45 days, with a potential extension to 240 days) to make an initial decision on the 19b-4 filings. Exchange listing hinges on this approval. However, even with exchange approval, the S-1 filings could face delays.









The SEC’s cautious approach might be due to the complexities and potential risks associated with cryptocurrency products. Additionally, a lack of communication between issuers and the SEC suggests the regulator may be conducting a more thorough review.



Potential Benefits of Ethereum ETFs



If approved, Ethereum ETFs would make investing in Ethereum more accessible and secure for everyday investors. This could also lead to wider adoption of Ethereum and further integrate cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial landscape. However, the SEC’s final decision remains uncertain.

Weekly Crypto Preview: The Hottest Coins For The Next Days


								This week in the crypto market is marked by critical events and strategic developments that promise to influence trends and investor sentiment significantly. Here is an in-depth analysis of the most anticipated cryptocurrencies and their upcoming milestones.
#1 US Spot Ethereum ETF Deadline Looms
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces pivotal deadlines on May 23 and May 24 regarding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs proposed by VanEck and ArkInvest/21Shares, respectively.
The likelihood of approval this month has significantly declined. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the odds as “slim to none,” pointing to the SEC’s silence as a major indicator. However, last week, Coinbase released a new report, asserting that the approval of a US spot Ethereum ETF is a matter of “when, not if.”
They argue that the rationale used to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs — namely, the high correlation between CME futures and spot exchange rates — should also apply to Ethereum. Thus, they estimate the chances to be much higher, around 30-40%.

The SEC’s decisions on these applications will be crucial, potentially opening doors for broader institutional adoption and new investment products tied to Ethereum.
#2 AI Crypto Coins
This week, two significant events could influence the trajectory of AI related crypto projects. Firstly, NVIDIA’s Q1 2024 earnings report, scheduled for release on May 22, is highly anticipated. NVIDIA’s performance and outlook can significantly impact AI-related crypto projects. Strong earnings and positive guidance could bolster investor confidence in AI-driven crypto projects.
Secondly, on May 24, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASI) will officially launch, marking the merger of Fetch.AI (FET), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN). This merger aims to create the highest-valued decentralized AI crypto project. The consolidation into a unified ASI token is designed to streamline operations, incentivize collaboration, and foster a stronger, more cohesive community.
The ASI token will bundle the resources and technological capabilities of FET, AGIX, and OCEAN, aiming to establish a dominant position in the decentralized AI market. The performance of the ASI token post-launch will be critical, as it will reflect the market’s reception to this ambitious merger.
#3 Fantom Rebrand
Fantom (FTM) is undergoing a transformative rebranding initiative, with a proposal to launch a new token, S. This rebranding effort involves renaming the Fantom network to Sonic and migrating FTM tokens to the new S tokens on a 1:1 basis.
The rebranding includes the launch of the Sonic Network, a new layer-1 blockchain with a native layer-2 bridge to Ethereum. This new network aims to leverage advanced technology to significantly enhance performance compared to the existing Opera network. Fantom Foundation has earmarked hundreds of millions of FTM from its treasury to support ecosystem development for Sonic, including marketing, business development, migration grants, and other adoption initiatives.

Fantom Operations Ltd will continue to support the Opera network, while Sonic Operations Ltd will focus on the Sonic Network. This dual-support system ensures continuity for current users while promoting migration to the new, more efficient Sonic Network.
Users will initially be able to swap their FTM tokens for S tokens at a 1:1 ratio, with the migration process anticipated to be bi-directional initially, allowing for flexibility. Over time, this is expected to transition to a one-way migration.
#4 Solana V1.18
Solana is preparing for a significant update. Scheduled for release on May 27, Solana’s mainnet v1.18 upgrade aims to address the network’s congestion issues, which have been triggered by spam transactions and the surge in memecoin activities.
This update is crucial as it aims to enhance the network’s efficiency and scalability. The congestion earlier this year, primarily caused by bots prioritizing their transactions and a dramatic increase in transactions associated with newly released meme coins, created an extraordinary demand for block space, impeding access for many users.
The Solana community is eagerly anticipating this update. A successful implementation could significantly improve the user experience, mitigate congestion issues, and restore confidence in Solana’s ability to handle high transaction volumes.
This could attract more users and developers to the platform, further strengthening SOL’s price, which rallied 22% over the past seven days.

#5 FLOKI Announcement
FLOKI, a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk’s pet Shiba Inu, has generated considerable buzz with a cryptic announcement. On May 4, FLOKI’s official Twitter account teased a major announcement for May 27, stating, “[…] And with FLOKI set to make a major announcement later this month, the excitement is far from over!”
While details remain undisclosed, the anticipation is poised to spark speculation and increased trading activity. Speculative announcements like this often lead to heightened price volatility and trading volumes. Traders and investors will be keen to see if the announcement delivers on the hype and positively impacts FLOKI’s price.

Vitalik Buterin is concerned about the decentralization of Ethereum

In a recent blog post, Vitalik Buterin expressed his opinions on three key issues regarding the decentralization of Ethereum: MEV, liquid staking, and node hardware requirements. 
Buterin explained that many of the concerns related to the centralization of Ethereum can be addressed through smart protocol designs and updates, some of which are already being implemented.
Let’s see below all the details. 

Decentralization of Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin’s response
As anticipated, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, responded to the criticisms directed at the blockchain in a detailed blog post, analyzing three fundamental issues for the centralization of Ethereum.
MEV (Miner Extractable Value), liquid staking and hardware costs for managing a single node are the three key points.
Buterin has observed that concerns about the design of Ethereum in these three key areas are “widely shared” and added:
“These are concerns I have personally had on many occasions.”
However, according to Buterin, these problems might not be as difficult to overcome as some argue.
In his post, published on May 17th, Buterin first addresses the issue of MEV, which is the financial gain that sophisticated node operators can obtain by reordering transactions within a block.
Buterin distinguishes two approaches to MEV: “minimization” (reducing MEV through the design of intelligent protocols, like CowSwap) and “quarantine” (attempting to reduce or eliminate MEV altogether through in-protocol techniques).
Although the MEV quarantine may seem like an appealing option, Buterin notes that this perspective carries some risks of centralization: 
“If builders have the power to completely exclude transactions from a block, attacks can easily arise-” 
However, Buterin has supported builders working on MEV quarantine through concepts like transaction inclusion lists, which “take away the builder’s ability to completely exclude transactions from a block.” 
“I think that the ideas in this direction – really pushing the quarantine box to be as small as possible – are really interesting, and I am in favor of going in that direction.” 
Buterin: reducing barriers for solo stakers, a crucial step
Vitalik Buterin has addressed the issue of the low number of solo stakers on Ethereum. 
In particular explaining that many prefer to use centralized staking providers like Coinbase or decentralized solutions like Lido and RocketPool. 
This choice is due to the complexity, hardware requirements, and the minimum of 32 ETH needed to run an Ethereum node independently.
While acknowledging the progress made in reducing the costs and complexity of managing a single node, Buterin emphasized that “there is still more that we could do.”
Suggesting the possibility of reducing the time required to withdraw ETH in staking or lowering the minimum requirement of 32 ETH to become a solo staker, as stated: 
“Incorrect answers could lead Ethereum down a path of centralization and ‘recreation of the traditional financial system with additional steps’; correct answers could create a shining example of a successful ecosystem with a wide and diversified set of individual stakers and highly decentralized staking pools.”
High hardware requirements for nodes: the civil debate
Regarding the high hardware requirements for nodes, Buterin admitted that the issue is more complex. 
However, he acknowledged that with the implementation of Verkle Trees and the upcoming EIP-4444, “the hardware requirements of a node could plausibly eventually decrease to less than one hundred gigabytes, and perhaps almost to zero if we completely eliminate the responsibility of storing the history (perhaps only for non-staking nodes).” 
Buterin concluded his post urging the Ethereum ecosystem to confront difficult questions rather than avoid them: 
“… We should have a deep respect for the properties that make Ethereum unique and continue to work to maintain and improve those properties as Ethereum grows.”
In a post on X, Buterin added that he is happy to see a civil debate among community members: 
“I am really proud of the fact that Ethereum does not have a culture that tries to prevent people from expressing their opinions, even when they have very negative feelings towards important things in the protocol or ecosystem. Some wave the ideal of ‘open discourse’ as a flag, others take it seriously.”

Top Analyst Flips Bearish on Pepe (PEPE), Warns Popular Memecoins Will Witness Over 80% Correction - The Daily Hodl


								An analyst who rode the 2023 crypto breakout thinks that memecoin Pepe (PEPE) is headed to much lower levels.
Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 553,800 followers on the social media platform X that PEPE appears to have made a false breakout to new all-time highs before sellers pushed the price below its range high of $0.000009959.










In technical analysis, a false breakout is often seen as a bearish sign, suggesting that sellers are overwhelming demand.
Says DonAlt,
“Fell below the previous highs. For now, that looks like a false breakout. As long as that’s not reclaimed, that’s a bearish chart. If reclaimed, that’d be quite bullish but only then.” 
Source: DonAlt/X
Based on the trader’s chart, the next support level for PEPE appears to be at $0.0000065. At time of writing, PEPE is worth $0.0000090.
As for fellow memecoin dogwifhat (WIF), DonAlt says the altcoin is bearish unless it recovers a key price level.
“Almost back to range low. Looks very bad still. Would look better above $2.77 or below $2.” 
Source: DonAlt/X
At time of writing, WIF is trading at $2.68.
Looking at the broader memecoin market, DonAlt believes that coins in the altcoin sector will witness massive devaluations based on data from previous cycles.
“If I’m right, the popular memes we trade today will trade 80%+ lower. Then you’ll have new memes come up that build new communities that run up. And we’ll have the same discussions in a couple of years…
Why am I saying that? Because we’ve gone through this exact scenario a hundred times in crypto history already. If the meme top isn’t in, it will be eventually. And then you’ll get a 90% nuke on all of them, even the most ‘blue chip’ memes (lol) that exist. It repeats every cycle.”

Do users really care about decentralization? Industry figures clash

Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist, known for his contributions to the concept of Danksharding, sparked a heated debate on the social platform X on May 19 by stating that Ethereum “actually realizes the crypto vision.”“Yes, it looks messy, but that’s because Ethereum is building for the real world. But it’s solving ALL the necessary problems and not a tiny subset.”Feist’s post prompted a response from Mert Mumtaz, the CEO of Solana developer platform Helius Labs. Mert argued that the crypto market understands the “necessary problems” more comprehensively than a single entity can.Source: MertMert suggested that market participants who value decentralization and censorship resistance would gravitate naturally toward Ethereum “if they think it realizes such a vision the best.” However, Feist expressed skepticism regarding the extent to which market participants actually value decentralization."The market cannot tell you whether you are realizing the crypto vision as far as decentralization and censorship resistance are concerned. For example, banks today obviously have good PMF without being decentralized in any way."Related: Ethereum dev’s paid EigenLayer role sparks debate on ‘conflicted incentives’Mert countered by explaining that the market dynamics are not homogenous and, as such, “you can’t know if they’re the correct” set of problems being solved. Feist then reinforced his belief that the market does not “value decentralization that highly,” concluding that he would “never let the market be the ultimate judge.” This concluding statement sparked Mert’s final response and the last word between the two:Source: MertThe discussion follows the controversy surrounding Ethereum Foundation’s Justin Drake taking on a paid adviser role at EigenFoundation. Already a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, Drake’s new adviser role “comes with a significant EIGEN token incentive,” suggesting a risk of “conflicted incentives,” according to one commentator.Magazine: Trader turns $3K into $46M in PEPE, Ethereum gas overhaul, Tornado dev guilty: Hodler’s Digest, May 12-18

Alliance BRICS: China surpasses the US dollar and puts pressure on the West

The BRICS countries, in particular Russia, China, and India, are trading goods in Rubles, Yuan, and Rupees bypassing the US dollar as the preferred currency: the latest significant trade involves Russia’s purchase of weapons worth $4 billion, paid to India in local currency.
The United States’ global sovereignty over trade is now numbered.All the details below.

Russia buys weapons from India paying $4 billion in local currencies: BRICS opposes the US dollar, including China
According to reports from local Eastern media, later confirmed by Watcher.Guru, the Russia-India axis of the BRICS alliance is trading a large amount of military armaments in local currencies, bypassing the US dollar from its role as the preferred currency for international trade.
More specifically, Russia is buying weapons produced by its Indian ally for a value of $4 billion in Rupees.
Mosca has stated that this is a move to support the defense of the country from Ukrainian settlements, and that it will continue to trade with New Delhi also various machinery, car parts and engineering goods.
By doing so, the BRICS confirms its stability and internal autonomy, accelerating the de-dollarization process started since last year.

India today joins the privileged club of arms suppliers of Russia along with Iran and North Korea, further strengthening the “special and privileged strategic partnership” between the two nations.
It is clear how the Soviets want to take advantage of India’s rapidly growing economy and increasingly diversify its Asian partners away from China, being able to definitively abandon dependence on the US dollar:
Both India and Russia have already seen a 25-fold increase in trade to over 50 billion dollars/year since the start of the special military operation in Ukraine, with aggressive plans to reach over 100 billion dollars/year in the next 5 years.
Even de-dollarization efforts are accelerating with trade, not only military but also related to the food, energy, and industrial supply chain) conducted in local currencies according to the rupee-ruble friendship agreement.
The latest $4 billion arms trade is just the tip of the iceberg of a recently strengthened collaboration, which has also seen Russia involved in investing in Indian government treasury bonds.
One year ago, as reported by Prof. Michele Geraci, trade between Russia and India had encountered some difficulties due to the second’s inability to export enough goods to allow an accumulation of Rupees at the Russian Central Bank.
Today things, especially considering the need for an arms race, seem to have definitely changed.

 The next decade will be challenging for the US dollar as many other developing nations are following the BRICS model, following the de-dollarization agenda.
China and Russia join forces in the de-dollarization process: 90% of trades in Rubles or Yuan
The de-dollarization process involves not only the two countries mentioned above but also and above all China, the main technological rival of the United States since 2010, which with its Yuan is trying to put sticks in the wheels of the US dollar.
Recently, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese president Xi Jinping met to discuss the relations between the two BRICS nations and how to promote the mission of the alliance. Both leaders had agreed to enhance global partnership and strategic operation of their respective economies.
The meeting highlighted the intention to strengthen the commercial relationship between China and Russia, announcing that 90% of the exchanges will be conducted in Rubles or Yuan.

The final step of the diplomatic relationship between the two world superpowers strengthens the solidity of the BRICS alliance and pushes other nations to join the group and abandon their dependence on the US dollar.
In August 2023 Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates joined the alliance, expanding a reality born in 2009 from the union of India, China, Russia and Brazil.
China in particular has always been at the forefront in trying to hinder the advancement and dominance of the US dollar.
The latest move involving the Chinese yuan and the Russian ruble is a huge step towards de-dollarization and the promotion of local currency.
It is worth noting how the BRICS is also working on a common currency to be used within the bloc to support internal trade, in addition to the local currencies already in use.

Bitcoin Price Steady, But Network Activity Dwindles


							

New Bitcoin wallets plunge to 6-year low, signaling caution



Miner revenue tumbles as network activity slumps



Bitcoin price holds steady despite declining network activity




New data reveals a sharp decline in the creation of new Bitcoin wallets on the network. The daily average number of new addresses added has reached a six-year low, with only 275,000 created over the past week. This marks a steep drop from the 2018 high of 625,000.



In 2018, anticipation surrounding Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), the halving event, and major ecosystem developments like Ordinals fueled a surge in new wallet creation. That year, the network even surpassed its December 2017 peak in new addresses.



The past month has seen only around 6 million new wallet addresses added – a far cry from the trend over the past year, where every month except May exceeded 10 million.



Echoing this slowdown, miner revenue on the Bitcoin network has also plummeted to historic lows. The average daily miner revenue currently sits below $30 million, compared to an average exceeding a staggering $60 million in previous months. The monthly average miner revenue mirrored this trend, dropping from a peak of $2 billion in March 2024 to below $1 billion in May.









Despite trading well below its all-time high of $73,000, Bitcoin remains afloat. As of press time, it sits at $67,131, with a slight decline of 0.2% in the last day. However, the cryptocurrency has shown some resilience with modest gains of 10% and 4% over the past week and month, respectively. Notably, a significant surge of 36% in trading volume suggests continued investor interest, despite the slowdown in network activity.

BounceBit Roasts Runes and BRC-20 Tokens in Ambitious Roadmap - DailyCoin


        

BounceBit has announced its 2024 roadmap.



The roadmap outlined various ambitious initiatives the project aims to implement this year.



Notably, BounceBit ruled out some emerging trends from its plan.




Binance-backed Bitcoin restaking startup BounceBit announced an ambitious roadmap on Monday, outlining various initiatives it plans to implement this year.



The project explicitly noted that it does not aim to “act as a sidechain to the Bitcoin Network” or jump on “temporary hype” trends like runes and BRC-20 tokens. Instead, BounceBit plans to take an asset-driven approach, primarily focused on the BTC ecosystem.



No Plans for Bitcoin Layer 2



According to a May 20 blog post, BounceBit’s roadmap aims to bring a “fresh perspective” into the industry by integrating the best aspects of centralized finance (CeFi) and the innovative potential of decentralized finance (DeFi).




In the plan, the project has sidelined the possibility of building a Layer 2 chain on the BTC network, noting that such solutions have “no substantial demand” and that emerging trends like Runes and BRC-20 tokens often fail to address long-term needs.



“Our goal is to build infrastructure for Bitcoin as an asset, enhancing its utility without altering its core technology.” BounceBit said. “You might not agree, the market might not agree, and that’s fine, we are venturing this road anyway.”



Instead of developing another network, the project will implement several upgrades to its proof-of-stake layer-1 chain.



BounceBit Chain Upgrades



The project intends to optimize the EVM execution layer of its BounceBit Chain to improve node performance and build a new Mempool module to achieve higher transaction throughput.




Per the blog post, other updates to the network will include refactoring the communication layer between EVM and Cosmos SDK and developing a shared security client (SSC) module to allow other projects to utilize the liquidity of BounceBit BTC restaking chain.



While the roadmap doesn’t mention specific implementation dates, the project also plans to bring “CeDeFi” to BounceBit Portal, giving users access to more asset management venues and an expanded list of products “to cover most use cases.”

Pink Drainer Shuts Down: How Will Fund Withdrawal Affect DeFi? | Cryptopolitan

Pink Drainer, the drainer-as-a-service hacker group, announced it’s shutting down and deleting all data. Over its lifetime, Pink Drainer targeted communities and specific whale wallets. Estimates put the stolen funds between $75M and $85M, depending on the exact pricing approach. The Pink Drainer is a group dedicated to scamming wallet owners, usually through three main points of attack. One is through hacking or spamming high-profile social media accounts, including those of Vitalik Buterin, Crypto Bitboy, and major projects. The other is through Discord and other chats. Some used the drainer-as-a-service on fake sites, urging the user to connect a wallet. More than 21K users lost valuable NFT and fungible tokensFor over a year, Pink Drainer performed heists ranging from prominent to large-scale. The wallet drainer works on Ethereum, Avalanche, BSC, Polygon, Optimism, Gnosis, and Callisto Network, among others. More than 21K users lost valuable NFT and fungible tokens. Source: Dune AnalyticsThe earnings of Pink Drainer come not only from the heists, but from selling the drainer-as-a-service, with 5 ETH for lifetime access. This means that the hacks of Pink Drainer are not organized but are haphazard and depend on random outreach. The users of Pink Drainer’s service are also not shy about their on-chain behavior. Some of the wallets even send funds to Binance for swapping. Most users are semi-anonymous, and still use their social media personas. How Will Pink Drainer Affect Decentralized Finance?One effect of Pink Drainer is that its users may park some of the funds into DeFi protocols. Drainer users also often rely on Uniswap to convert the stolen funds. Pink Drainer is still the top 21 owner of SavingsDAI (sDAI), a token belonging to Spark Protocol. So far, the drainer wallet holds onto the funds, even days after announcing the end of exploits. Spark Protocol is a crypto lending aggregator, currently holding $2.36B in total value locked (TVL). The funds held by Pink Drainer will hardly affect the protocol, which is also supported by other large wallets and exchanges. Pink Drainer Turns Ethical HackerUsers affected by Pink Drainer may be able to receive some respite. The official X handle made a special offer to restitute some funds, with a time limit in the past eight months. Some funds, however, may already be beyond reach. About two weeks ago, Pink Drainer started moving its finds. Some of the stolen ETH is just parked in idle addresses. Other transactions have reached 1 Inch Network Aggregator, and Railgun WETH Helper, a service for private and anonymous DeFi. Railgun is still a relatively small service, reporting $68M in total value locked. What is curious is that its TVL has grown significantly since Pink Drainer started to unload some of the funds. Also read: Compound Finance suffers a breach of its X accountWhen it comes to NFT, returning them is even more difficult. Bored Ape 7531, for instance, is already part of someone else’s collection after one of the last big attacks of Pink Drainer.Drainer Threat is Not GoneThe threat of having a wallet drained is not gone. Pink Drainer itself warned of copycats or new links to connect wallets. Additional drainers are still offered to anyone and deployed via social media scams. The common thread is that all the scams offer valuable giveaways while requiring users to connect their wallets. Also read: Cybercriminal group “Pink Drainer” strikes again: $4.4 million theft in ChainlinkMost big projects’ social media have also warned that they will not contact users directly. However, data reveals that Inferno Drainer is still active and even more dangerous than Pink Drainer, with more than $166M in stolen funds.Inferno Drainer also claimed it would shut down in December 2023, after setting out a story about reaching its goal. Pink Drainer seems to mimic that approach, and it is uncertain if the threat is gone for good, or will return in another iteration. Inferno Drainer also worked by impersonating big crypto brands and spreading a long list of domains promising airdrops or NFT.Cryptopolitan reporting by Hristina Beeva

U.S. Bitcoin ETFs ‘pulling money off-chain’ into TradFi: Analyst - AMBCrypto



Analyst have downplayed the long-term positive impact of the U.S. BTC ETF.
Instead, the analyst viewed the BTC ETFs as benefiting TradFi and a threat to DeFi. 

Bitcoin [BTC] went from around $40K to a new all-time of $73.7K on the back of the approval of U.S. spot BTC ETFs. 
The massive flows from institutions through the ETFs have been long viewed as a bullish catalyst for BTC price action. 
However, Jim Bianco, a macro investment research analyst, downplayed the ETFs’ ‘bullish’ catalyst narrative. 
Instead, Bianco termed the BTC ETFs as ‘pulling the money off-chain’ into TradFi, especially in Q1. 
“My other concern was that these instruments (ETFs) would not lead to on-chain adoption but instead drag money back into the TradFi world. $COIN Q1 earnings offered hints this might be the case. Coinbase revenue surges to $1.64 billion – But retail volume just 50% of 2021 levels”
According to Bianco, the Q1 BTC ETF trend was ‘pulling money off-chain into the Tradfi world’ and could undermine a new DeFi system. 
Bianco’s bearish take on U.S. Bitcoin ETFs
Bianco’s bearish stance on U.S. BTC ETF contradicted Michael Saylor and Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s positions. 
For his part, Michael Saylor viewed U.S. BTC ETFs as a way to move capital from TradFi into digital assets, fueling BTC’s competitiveness. 
Similarly, Hougan, based on the 13F filings, noted that large firms bought $10.7 billion of the U.S. BTC ETFs in Q1. To Hougan, the amount was a ‘down payment,’ and he expected more to come. 
However, Bianco took a contrarian position and cited two other factors for his argument. Notably, investment advisors’ holdings of BTC ETF in Q1 were below average to inspire the bullish catalyst narrative. 
“They (Investment advisors) are very small, between 2.5% and 4% (and 8.81% for $GBTC). A recent Citi report says the AVERAGE ETF is about 35% owned by investment advisors.”
Source: X/Jim Bianco
He also claimed that BTC ETFs aren’t recording massive demand as expected, and the long-term impact of BTC ETFs could have been far-fetched.  
“If anything, it is concerning that the headlong rush into Spot BTC ETFs “only” drove this price back to the old high (of November 2021) and not $100k.”
In the meantime, BTC’s short-term recovery eased near the supply area below $68K. Should bulls clear the hurdle, an extended recovery to the range-high of $71K could be feasible.

Ethereum Spot ETFs On The Horizon? US SEC Set To Announce Decision This Week | Bitcoinist.com


								The much-anticipated Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are set to reach a pivotal junction this week as Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, has revealed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to issue a final decision regarding the exchange-traded funds within the week.
Ethereum Spot ETFs Decision Looms
Since the SEC’s ruling may have a significant impact on the direction of Ethereum investment, Nate Geraci‘s revelation has increased expectations in the cryptocurrency and investment landscape.

Geraci emphasized the 19b-4s (changes to exchange rules) and S-1s (registration statements) as the two main components of the SEC’s review procedure. According to the expert, before the Ethereum spot ETFs can be launched, the regulatory watchdog must accept both filings.
When a national securities exchange, such as the NYSE or Nasdaq, wants to launch new products or change rules, they submit a filing to the SEC called a 19b-4s (Exchange Rule Changes). For ETH spot ETFs, the exchanges must obtain the SEC’s approval on the 19b-4s before listing the products and integrating them into their trading platforms.
Meanwhile, S-1s, or registration statements, are the first registration forms needed for newly sold securities to the public. They give the agency and possible investors comprehensive details on the company’s financial situation, management, and business operations. 
In the case of spot ETH ETFs, this filing will cover the fund’s administration, structure, and strategy for emulating Ethereum performance. Thus for the products to be offered to the general public legally, the S-1s and the 19b-4s need to be approved by the SEC, given the significance of both filings.
While Geraci is confident that the Commission might approve the 19b-4s, he thinks the S-1s might see a slow play from the agency, and without the S-1s clearance, the funds cannot be legally allowed to be sold to investors. 
Given the lack of engagement, this might imply an extended period of evaluation and approval of these documents from the agency. Since then, the SEC’s lack of engagement has negatively impacted the funds, which has raised questions and doubts about its approval.
Approval Or Lawsuit From The SEC
It is worth noting that Nate Geraci is one of the top figures in the crypto industry who is pessimistic about the approval of the ETH spot ETFs from the SEC. Geraci previously hinted at the agency’s eerily silence and lower level of engagement as a potential setback for the fund’s clearance in May.

Although this makes sense logically, Geraci questions whether the SEC took a lesson from the clown show when it came to spot Bitcoin ETFs. As a result, he has highlighted an approval or legal action from the Commission as two potential outcomes for the ETH spot ETFs.
Presently, the odds around the product’s acceptance are down substantially ahead of the May deadline. Data from the prediction market, Polymarket, shows that the approval odds now stand at 11%.

Litecoin (LTC) whales have embarked on a massive accumulation frenzy over the past month. This accumulation has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, particularly due to a net inflow surge on May 10. According to IntoTheBlock, Litecoin whale addresses have accumulated 2,751,633 LTC in the last 30 days alone. The activity peaked on May 10, when whale addresses saw a net inflow of over 900,000 LTC.  This level of accumulation may imply a significant shift in the Litecoin ecosystem, indicating  growing confidence among large holders.The single-day net inflow of over 900,000 LTC on May 10 is particularly noteworthy. This marks the highest daily accumulation of whale addresses since February, indicating a major shift in whale behavior.Whales refer to large holders of a specific cryptocurrency. In the case of Litecoin, the recent accumulation by these large players might signal potential strategic positioning, possibly anticipating future price movements or reacting to market developments.As reported, the Litecoin network has processed over 245 million transactions since its inception, with a notable 39 million of those transactions occurring in 2024 alone. Whales might be positioning themselves to capitalize on Litecoin's upcoming advancements. Positive sentiment around the broader cryptocurrency market can also drive accumulation. As confidence in the market grows, large holders may increase their positions in established cryptocurrencies like Litecoin.However, the reasons behind this sudden surge in accumulation remain speculative.As the crypto community watches with bated breath, questions arise about the impact of the whales' resurgence. Will this lead to a bullish trend for Litecoin, or is it merely strategic positioning for future market development? However, the recent accumulation may indicate that whales are waking up, and the consequences may soon be felt.

Binance Research estimates token unlocks to reach $155 billion by 2030 - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The crypto market has recently witnessed a trend of tokens launching with high fully diluted valuations (FDVs) but low initial circulating supplies.This structure, often driven by venture capital (VC) funding and upbeat market sentiment, can lead to unsustainable price appreciation post-token generation event (TGE) and significant selling pressure once tokens unlock.According to a recently released report from Binance Research, aggregated data from Token Unlocks and CoinMarketCap indicate that approximately $155 billion worth of tokens will unlock between 2024 and 2030.Binance Research suggests that without increased buy-side demand, these unlocks could exert substantial downward pressure on token prices. Tokens launched in 2024 have shown the lowest market capitalization (MC) to FDV ratios in recent years, highlighting the prevalence of low circulating supplies at launch.The MC/FDV ratio for tokens launched in 2024 is just 12.3%, suggesting that a significant value of tokens will be unlocked in the future.The influx of private market capital has significantly shaped crypto market valuations. Since 2017, over $91 billion has been invested in crypto projects, driving up token prices even before public market launches. In Q1 2024, crypto deal-making activity rose by 52.1% QoQ, indicating a strong willingness among investors to fund projects at elevated valuations.Notably, the crypto market capitalization also increased by 61% in the same period, fueling positive investor sentiment and allowing projects to raise substantial capital with less dilution.This trend poses long-term risks associated with inflated valuations, the research report claims. Many new tokens have FDVs comparable to established layer-1 or DeFi tokens, despite lacking similar user traction and market presence. This discrepancy suggests a misalignment in valuations and actual market demand.On this end, Binance Research advised investors to emphasize project fundamentals such as tokenomics, valuation, product viability, and team credentials. By extension, a basic understanding of unlock schedules work, paired with thorough due diligence would be crucial to avoid the pitfalls of high FDV tokens, the paper suggests.
“Tokenomics is undoubtedly one of the most important considerations for investors and project teams. Every design decision comes with its set of benefits and trade-offs. While launching tokens with low initial circulating supply may drive initial price pumps, the steady unlocking and emission of tokens create selling pressure, weighing on long-term performance,” the report states.
Projects, on the other hand, should adopt long-term thinking in tokenomics design, ensuring equitable token distributions and considering the implications of high FDVs and low floats. Strategies such as token burning, milestone-based vesting, and increasing initial circulating supply can help mitigate future selling pressures.The trend of launching tokens with low floats and high FDVs poses significant challenges for sustainable growth. Both investors and project teams need to be mindful of the long-term implications of their decisions, Binance Research said. VC-backed projects should focus on equitable supply distributions and realistic valuations to foster a healthier market environment.

Shiba Inu recently experienced a notable surge in whale-tier transactions, hinting at a possible spike in volatility. However, given the current state of SHIB, these large transactions might not yield the significant impact many are hoping for.Analyzing the provided on-chain data, we see that in the last 24 hours, there have been 82 large SHIB transactions, totaling 1.7 trillion SHIB. This aligns with the lowest activity level in the past week, highlighting a potential lack of consistent buying interest. This trend is further reflected in the transaction volume, which reached $40.48 million, considerably lower than the seven-day high of $223.76 million seen earlier in the week.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewSHIB has been hovering around the 50 EMA, struggling to break through. The Bollinger Bands indicate a narrowing, typically a precursor to a volatility spike, but without substantial volume, this might not materialize into significant price movement. The MACD histogram shows a declining trend, signaling weakening bullish momentum.The whale transactions, while substantial, might represent internal shuffling or consolidation rather than genuine market interest. This is evident from the relatively flat price movement despite high transaction volumes. For SHIB to see a substantial price surge, consistent buying pressure and increased trading volume are necessary, both of which are currently lacking.While the surge in whale transactions might initially seem like a bullish indicator, the underlying data suggests that Shiba Inu is currently in a consolidation phase. Without a significant influx of new buyers or increased trading activity, SHIB might continue to trade sideways. For now, Shiba Inu really needs fresh inflows, instead of the activity of large players who have been there before.

Is Bitcoin the next asset to catch up with the rally? | CryptoSlate

Quick TakeAs economic uncertainty looms, traditional safe-haven assets like gold, silver, and copper are soaring to new heights. Gold recently hit a new all-time high of $2,443 an ounce, up nearly 20% year-to-date. Silver is approaching $32 an ounce, its highest level since October 2012, while copper is trading above $5, an all-time high.Gold, Silver and Copper Price: (Source: TradingView)The surge in precious metals and industrial commodities can be attributed to several factors. Inflation concerns are mounting, with both 5-year and 10-year inflation expectations hovering around 2.3%, higher than central banks’ target of 2%. Inflation expectations have remained above 2% since January 2021.5 and 10 Year Breakeven Inflation Expectations: (Source: TradingView)Safe-haven demand is also driving investors towards these assets, as 11 out of the past 14 rate-hiking cycles have ended in a recession, while interest rates are at their highest level in over 20 years in the US.Furthermore, investment shifts and geopolitical uncertainties, such as ongoing wars and upcoming elections, could be contributing to the rally. A rise in copper prices can signal higher costs of goods and manufacturing or even economic growth.Despite WTI and Brent crude oil prices dropping by over 10% from their April highs, they have still registered a year-to-date increase of over 10%. This divergence may indicate the beginning of an economic slowdown as demand for oil weakens.US and UK Oil: (Source: TradingView)Interestingly, as traditional safe havens shine, Bitcoin, often touted as “digital gold” due to its limited supply, decentralization, and potential hedge against uncertainty, is trading at around $67,000. With the U.S. stock market also at all-time highs, the question arises: Is Bitcoin the next asset to catch up with the rally?

Whale Alert: WIF Price Jumps on Solana After Investor Move


							

Large investor buys new Solana memecoin WIF.



WIF price surges nearly 7% after activity.



SOL token also sees price increase, fueling speculation.




On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain identified significant trading activity surrounding WIF, a recently launched memecoin on the Solana blockchain. In a post, Lookonchain revealed that an unknown large investor has been accumulating substantial amounts  of WIF, potentially impacting the memecoin’s market performance.







Lookonchain provided transaction data highlighting the investor’s creation of a new wallet and the subsequent transfer of 1.83 million USDC to purchase WIF. As of the post’s publication, the investor had spent 606,000 USDC to acquire 227,896 WIF, leaving a remaining balance of 1.22 million USDC.



WIF’s price responded to this activity in the early hours of Monday’s trading session. The Solana-based memecoin opened at $2.53 and climbed nearly 7% within a few hours, reaching $2.69 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView.



The full impact remains unclear, with the investor still holding a significant portion of their USDC. WIF’s price could potentially rise further and attract additional users, leading to a larger buying pool within the memecoin’s ecosystem.









It’s worth noting that Lookonchain’s observation coincides with a price surge in SOL, the native token of WIF’s parent blockchain, Solana. SOL has gained 25% in less than a week, suggesting a potential return of bullish sentiment for the layer-one blockchain protocol.



TradingView data shows that SOL bounced off the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level on the daily chart last Wednesday. Since then, the scalability-focused project has seen an impressive rise, surpassing both the 0.5 and 0.382 Fibonacci levels. These developments have captured the attention of many crypto users, leading to speculation about a possible resumption of the broader crypto market rally.

Crypto gambling - how does the future of secure gambling look?



                    

                    Online gambling is a huge part of the casino world, but there is a small percentage of players who worry about its security — welcome, cryptocurrency casinos. It’s 2024, and although crypto casinos are nothing new, there is a wide range of some of the huge household names now utilizing this form of payment to stay ahead. It used to be that security processes were a major block for many players online, as when you gamble online you are putting your data, funds, and personal information in the hands of the online casino. Luckily, we’re in a new era of technology and the security methods that these brands now use are second to none. 
 If we were to look at the history of online casinos, we would see that traditional platforms struggled to build robust security methods, which left players susceptible to fraud and hackers. However, that fear is one of the past, as all online casinos that are worth playing on have to be regulated and in turn, adopt a fortress-like level of security. It not only puts you as the player in safe hands but offers up a new way of using decentralized funds, that are transparent and completely controlled by you. We’re going to be taking a look at how one of the safest forms of online gambling is evolving, and what measures shape where it’s got to today. Ever worried about online casinos before? Well, you won’t now! 
 Blockchain — what is it?
 
If you were looking for one advancement to thank in this evolving secure digital landscape, then it would most definitely be blockchain. Although to many it sounds unmeasurably confusing, it’s a piece of technology that works wonders in online gambling. Blockchain is a decentralized digital piece of technology that acts as a record sheet for transactions. It is a secure, transparent piece of tech that, in summary, is a digital ledger/database. It stores the transactions in things called blocks, which are then linked by a chain… sounds obvious, right?
 Each and every block that is formed on this digital ledger then contains an individual yet unique cryptographic node that cannot be modified as the chain goes on. Therefore, in summary, as the chain progresses, it becomes inevitably stronger and unable to be hacked or tampered with. It’s also getting more valuable all the time.
 It is the undisputed heavyweight in all security processes and stands as the backbone of anything cryptocurrency-related. 
 But how does it keep your information safe in gambling?
 

Immutability — This means that it is unable to be changed, ever. When a piece of data has been recorded on the ledger (blockchain), it is then unable to be altered. This creates a transparent record in a casino, showing that all bets have been safely placed and will never be tampered with.
Decentralization — Like everything with crypto, when using crypto in a casino, it becomes completely decentralized. This cuts out any third parties such as banks, and therefore reduces potential threats. Although you may think your funds are safe with the central banks, they are far more susceptible to hackers than if they were placed in a virtual crypto wallet — hence why they’re the future of online gambling.
Fairer — Above all else, when you’re gambling online, one of the most important requests is fairness. Blockchain makes sure that all the algorithms in a casino’s interface are fully leveled out, meaning that crypto pokies are guaranteed to be treated equally with all their pay-ins, pay-outs, and hand/slot automation. 

 
The future of privacy and transparency 
 
Online gambling is only growing exponentially because both crypto and blockchain are putting support in place for its players. Crypto gives the player a whole new level of anonymity, while blockchain dishes up transparent records for safeguarding their data. This opposes the older methods of online casinos, as pre-crypto users would use traditional payment methods that resulted in your data being shared, and potentially hacked. Before crypto was utilized by online casinos, players would have to input a lot more personal data — which would put them at risk of identity fraud. Now, the online player uses a virtual wallet that is decentralized and secure from all threats. 
 The role of cryptocurrency is growing and the future of it is only getting more resilient against security worries. As of early 2024, there are 13,217 cryptocurrencies in existence, with new ones appearing all the time — and this is expected to grow by the end of the year. We’re in an era where technological changes are inevitable, and to stay ahead as a business, you need to adopt change. This makes customers in online gambling feel safe, and encourages them to utilize the platforms that prioritize their safety above all else. 
 With every bet you place being recorded on the blockchain and every payout you receive being fully untraceable — secure gambling is not just the future, it’s the now.

                        Cryptonews Podcast host Matt Zahab recently sat down for a chat with Tomer Pascal, the CEO and co-founder of OwnPlay, a Web3 mobile gaming ecosystem and developer of CityVerse Tycoon, a PWA game allowing players to trade, buy, and sell tokenized replicas of real buildings in New York City, USA.Pascal talked about the advantages of Web3 gaming over Web2, deciding to avoid Apple and Google for its game, succeeding in creating a PWA game, and the exciting launches coming very soon.VIDEOWeb3 Advances Gameplay
It was 2022 when Pascal reached out to his old colleague Boaz Levin about creating a startup together. Pascal found that the time was finally right for the Web3 gaming.Their joint endeavor eventually became OwnPlay.“Creating a mobile Web3 game presents a big opportunity,” he said to Levin.Web2 became heavily dependent on paid customer acquisition. But Web3 elements are exciting, he said.They allow people to finally leverage gameplay to provide the players themselves an option “for a potential financial upside from the gameplay itself.”If done correctly, it can add a new level of excitement to the gameplay and continue the Web3 narrative, sad Pascal.Evading Apple and Google
OwnPlay created CityVerse Tycoon to provide its players with a seamless experience, Pascal told Matt.However, the team had a giant conundrum – Apple and Google. “How the hell are we going to bypass this,” they wondered.Apple Store and Google Play are extremely unfriendly to anything crypto-related. Getting approval for a Web3 game with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) would be impossible.These companies are primarily protecting their own interests – primarily, financial interests. These may or may not align with user interests.What they do not align with is the on-chain experience. These two methods are not compatible.Several years ago, nobody would take the suggestion of bypassing these two giants seriously. One of the reasons is that “life in the App Store was still good.”And even now, the team wasn’t happy about it, but times have changed for games, as well as both Apple and Google.The team decided to take “the crazy path” of trying to build the game as a mobile app but without running through the app store.There is a way of doing this, he said, noting that the team wasn’t the first to think about it but “the first one that was crazy enough to actually go do this.”To accomplish this, they utilized the progressive web application (PWA) protocol.“Long story short, we are able to provide an app-like experience without going through the App Store. If you need to take something from this call, that’s the thing.”The Great Experiment
Necessity is the mother of all invention. When it came to running a game as a PWA, the time found that there are no issues with performance and monetization.They were left with a big question: can you actually market the PWA? Can you convince people to install it?They started by running ads on Facebook and Instagram. The early results were good.__The team continued optimizing and building the game while driving traffic. “And then we saw that the conversion rates are on par or better than a mobile native app.”They proceeded with retention and monetization, finding that “numbers were on par.”Now they have more than 100,000 installs of the PWA already. Notably, people are unable to distinguish a PWA from an app, so they’re treating the game as a regular app.Launches Coming Up
Pascal said that the team is gearing up for the public launch of the game’s new version, currently set for May.This version has “all of the Web3 elements baked into the game.”The main elements include the ability to purchase and sell buildings.These buildings are NFTs with different game powers and perceived value by the players.Another element is the introduction of an additional coin in the game. Its utility will be revealed “later on.”Every user gets a non-custodial embedded wallet, while the buildings can be purchased using fiat and crypto. The seller is paid with crypto.Another thing coming up a collection that the team will mint in the upcoming weeks, called the Piggy Club.The NFTs’ main utility is boosting players’ in-game earnings, said Pascal.Users can accrue game value and rewards in the Piggy Bank game.Notably, the Piggy Club collection will be a “small one,” with few units, Pascal remarked.____That’s not all.Tomer Pascal also discussed:
establishing his first startup in 2006, a fantasy sports platform game with a twist;
meeting his current co-founder, Boaz, in 2009 and starting CityVerse Tycoon together in 2022;
creating a game with many games within it;
the decision to build the game as a PWA rather than a traditional mobile app, and how this benefits distribution and monetization for mobile gaming;
the opportunity and unparalleled accessibility that mobile offers for Web3 gaming;
challenges of creating and operating a mobile Web3 game;
the ‘David and Goliath’ struggle between crypto apps and centralized app stores;
constraints in distribution and monetization on mobile — specifically when it comes to rules set forth by app marketplaces.

Web3 Teams Compete To Bring Restaking To $1.2T Bitcoin Ecosystem - The Defiant

Developers are racing to leverage BTC to replicate Ethereum's booming restaking ecosystem. DeFi developers are competing to replicate the explosive growth generated by Ethereum’s restaking sector within the ecosystem.On May 20, BounceBit, a “CeDeFi’ Layer 1 network backed by Binance, the popular centralized exchange, published its roadmap for 2024. In the document, BounceBit said it plans to develop a “shared security client module” allowing third-party projects to utilize the liquidity deposited on the “BounceBit BTC restaking chain.”BounceBit celebrated its mainnet launch on May 13, claiming to have amassed a total value locked (TVL) of more than $1 billion after launching an incentivized early access phase on Jan. 30.The BounceBit chain is secured by users who stake both its native BB token and Bitcoin (BTC). BounceBit’s new roadmap seeks to expand on this with the introduction of restaking by allowing third-party protocols to harness its staking mechanism for security.BounceBit’s roadmap also includes improving BounceBit’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution, bolstering transaction throughput, and upgrading communication between its EVM and the Cosmos software development kit.Restaking boomRestaking was pioneered on Ethereum by EigenLayer. EigenLayer allows Ethereum stakers to earn additional yield by simultaneously pledging their stake to secure third-party actively validated services (AVSs) while also securing the Ethereum network. However, restakers incur additional slashing risks, meaning their stake will be diminished should delegated AVSs misbehave.EigenLayer has surged to become the second-largest DeFi protocol with a more than $15.3 TVL. The protocol’s growth was recently buoyed by the explosive rise of liquid restaking tokens (LRT) protocols, which reduce the technical barriers to participating in restaking and enable additional yield generation by allowing users to remain liquid.Projects tap Babylon as middleware for Bitcoin restakingBounceBit is not the first project aiming to bring restaking onto Bitcoin, with several projects leveraging Babylon, a Cosmos-based Bitcoin staking network, to develop BTC-based restaking products.Babylon is a Cosmos-based network allowing Bitcoin holders to “stake” their BTC to secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks in exchange for yield.On May 16, Mind Network, a restaking-focused Layer 1 network, announced a strategic alliance with Babylon. Per the deal, users will be able to secure Mind-based sub-networks by staking Babylon-based LRTs.On May 2, Bedrock, an LRT protocol, launched uniBTC, a Babylon-based Bitcoin liquid restaking token. UniBTC allows BTC holders to participate in Babylon staking without locking up their assets, meaning holders can remain liquid while securing PoS chains.On April 1, Lorenzo protocol similarly unveiled stBTC, a Babylon-based Bitcoin LRT.

US Enactment With First-Ever Crypto Legislation


                                President Joe Biden To Veto US Congress Standalone Crypto Legislation                                What’s The NewsIn a historic move, the U.S. Congress enacted its first piece of standalone cryptocurrency legislation last week. The contentious Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intended to be overturned by the bill. This law represents a critical turning point in the regulation of cryptocurrencies and suggests future adjustments to the way financial institutions manage digital assets. However, President Joe Biden has warned that he will veto this due to concerns about financial system stability and market volatility.The SAB 121 of U.S. SEC RuleAccording to SAB 121, companies that retain cryptocurrency assets for users must record them on their balance sheets as liabilities and the accompanying assets at fair value. This legislation has drawn criticism for placing banks and other financial institutions under excessive financial strain. This could discourage them from providing custody services for cryptocurrency assets. SAB 121 which House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) described as an example of SEC Chair Gary Gensler's regulatory overreach renders it prohibitively expensive for financial institutions to protect the digital assets of their consumers.Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) of the United States praised the Senate for passing the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal SAB 121, describing it as a win for financial innovation and a scathing critique of the Biden administration's approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. Congress can examine and even repeal regulations produced by federal agencies thanks to the CRA. Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to reverse SAB 121 and last week, the Senate approved the measure. President Joe Biden On Crypto RegulationPresident Joe Biden strongly opposed Congress’s decision to overturn SAB 121. A White House statement claims that restricting the SEC's capacity to uphold an extensive and successful financial regulatory framework for cryptocurrency assets might significantly increase market volatility and financial instability. This position demonstrates the administration's worries about the possible consequences of relaxing crypto restrictions.ConclusionAs per CoinGabbar, With the ongoing debate on cryptocurrency regulation across the United States, it is notable that the U.S. Congress adopted the first stand-alone crypto bill. Critics argue that such a law would pose a threat to financial security and exchange market integrity while advocates consider it as a way to facilitate financial development and limit the power of regulators. The future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States is still a hotly debated and closely monitored topic as the legislative process moves forward. Also Read: Blockchain Gaming Investment Hit $1 Billion In April

Bitcoin Edges Past $67K as Analysts Predict It'll Keep Climbing - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin is starting the week having seen monthly highs over $67,000 over the weekend and early this morning.At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price has retraced slightly to $66,868.04 after having dropped 0.4% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. That means the world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency now has a $1.3 trillion market capitalization and accounts for more than half the $2.5 trillion global crypto market cap.The sunny disposition of Bitcoin price charts has some analysts breathing a sigh of relief."Bitcoin broke the local downtrend, reclaimed the previous cycle highs - and now consolidates around $67,000," wrote pseudonymous crypto trader Jelle on Twitter. "It's time to push back into the seventies, and beyond."At the start of the month, Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes wrote in a blog post that he expected a few weeks of choppy and volatile prices before things improved. And before that, he shared his bearish outlook for the recent BTC halving, writing: "I believe Bitcoin and crypto prices in general will slump around the halving."Last week, in a note to traders, Singapore-based digital asset firm QCP Capital hypothesized that enough time has now elapsed since the Bitcoin halving for BTC to start climbing again."It is now 28 days past the BTC halving and post-halving dip might be done," the firm wrote. The QCP analysts also noted that there's been a growing amount of interest in December call options—"indicating significant bullishness into year-end."At the time of writing, there's $1.6 billion worth of open interest in BTC futures contracts on Deribit, according to Coinglass. The crypto derivatives exchange tends to be the most popular for trading BTC futures contracts. Even so, total open interest for Bitcoin is currently at $20 billion, so sentiment still hasn't crystallized the way it did leading up to the Bitcoin halving when total open interest went north of $30 billion.The seemingly relieved trader sentiment appears to be in line with the most recent BLS Consumer Price Index last week showed signs that inflation in the U.S. had started to ease.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin Eyes New Highs as Analysts Spot Imminent Golden Cross on Lower Timeframes



                    

Bitcoin maintained upward pressure on liquidity on May 17 as analysts noted a potential golden cross on lower timeframes.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price action hovering near its highest levels since mid-April.




Liquidity at $67,000 and above continued to act as a barrier, with around $75 million at stake at the time of writing, according to monitoring resource CoinGlass.



Although still below its all-time highs of 2024 and 2021, Bitcoin sparked enthusiasm among market observers. Popular pseudonymous trader Moustache highlighted two significant trendlines.



“Golden Cross (12h-Chart) of $BTC is imminent,” he informed his followers in one of his recent posts on X (formerly Twitter).



A golden cross happens when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term one, with the last occurrence in October of the previous year — just before Bitcoin saw significant gains.



“The last bullish cross was over six months ago. Bitcoin has risen by over 170% since then,” Moustache noted.



Another trader, Titan of Crypto, suggested that the Ichimoku Cloud indicator might follow a similar trend.

“BTC seems to be repeating the same pattern from early 2024,” a part of an X post on May 16 read, adding that BTC/USD saw an upside of more than 60% the last time Ichimoku requirements were met.

Among these are the short-term holder realized price and the 100-day moving average, the latter rising quickly and now above $62,000.



“BTC is perfectly flipping previous resistance into support,” Titan of Crypto summarized, sharing an Ichimoku chart.



Overall, Bitcoin’s current trajectory and technical indicators suggest a potentially bullish outlook, with significant levels being tested and possibly transformed into new support zones.

XRP Ledger Sees Over 100% Surge in Transaction Activity Amid Decline in Average Costs

                        In today’s top news, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has experienced an increase in transaction activity, with the number of transactions more than doubling from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the end of the first quarter of 2024.According to Ripple’s Q1 2024 XRP Markets Report, the increase in activity came as the average transaction cost witnessed a notable decline.During the first quarter of the year, the XRPL recorded approximately 251.39 million on-chain transactions, marking a remarkable 108% surge compared to the 121.03 million transactions in Q4 2023.Furthermore, the average cost per transaction decreased by 45%, reaching around $0.000856.No Network Congestion Happened in Q1
The report emphasized that the decrease in average transaction costs indicated a reset and demonstrated that no network congestion occurred during the quarter.The development is positive news for users of the XRP Ledger, as lower transaction costs can enhance accessibility and encourage increased activity on the network.In terms of trading volume, the report highlighted the steady distribution among cryptocurrency exchanges.Binance, Bybit, and Upbit accounted for more than 70% of the total traded volume, maintaining their dominance in XRP trading.However, there was a slight shift in trading pairs, with the proportion of volume traded via fiat pairs dropping from 15% in Q4 to 11% in Q1.Currently, a significant portion of XRP trading occurs against Tether (USDT).The report also addressed the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The SEC filed a lawsuit in December 2020, alleging that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering with XRP.Ripple responded to the SEC’s request for $2 billion in remedies on April 22, disagreeing with the demand.The firm argued that the law does not allow the SEC to require disgorgement or interest on disgorgement unless they can prove harm.“In terms of next steps, both parties will wait for the Judge to make a determination on the final remedies – likely in the coming months,” Ripple explained.“Ripple remains confident that the Judge will approach the remedies phase fairly.”In Other XRP News – Ripple Expands in Africa
Ripple has announced plans to introduce XRP Ledger and crypto-native services, including custody solutions, in Africa. The move aligns with Ripple’s vision to leverage blockchain technology for cross-border payments and more.Last year, Ripple announced it obtained a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI). The Central Bank of Ireland initiated the registration process for the VASP license in 2021, focusing on ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism provisions.

                        TON cryptocurrency NOTcoin, the brainchild of co-creator Sasha Plotvinov, launched on major centralized exchanges on 16 May last week to much fanfare – where is the coin price headed next?The price spiked briefly, which saw the token gatecrash into the top 100 crypto with a market capitalization above $1 billion. However, two hours after the start of trading the price had fallen back to $0.0062.Since then, the price has found a floor at around $0.0054 on the Binance exchange, after touching a low of $0.0051.However, the price action is not as bad as it looks at first glance, given that the owners of the $NOT token had acquired their stash through mining a tap-to-earn token by playing the viral clicker game on Telegram.The mined in-game token was used to claim the $NOT coin prior to the start of trading. Five million people claimed Notcoin within the first 36 hours of trading:Originally envisaged as a way of introducing the masses to crypto, $NOT’s game walks the newbie through hooking up a TON-compatible crypto wallet, saving the seed phrase and then getting started with the clicks.VIDEOWith billions of tokens in the bank, so to speak, players took advantage of the opportunity to sell at the list price of $0.009471. Trading volume in the first 24 hours reached $1.18 billion.TON cryptocurrency NOTcoin – from crypto experiment to half a billion dollars market capitalization
$TON currently has a market capitalization of $574 million, ranking it 121st out the the 9,961 tokens listed on Coinmarketcap.All of this is not too shabby for a coin that promised its players ‘probably nothing’ as part of its marketing messaging.Plotvinov’s game wasn’t just about mindless clicking, as hypnotically pleasing as that seemed to be for some dopamine junkies, as they sought prominence on the leaderboard. Rather, the game was primarily envisaged as a way of introducing the masses to how crypto networks worked.For instance, rewards were also earned from taking part in various campaigns, such as installing the TON Space wallet. Telegram premium users also received extra rewards for various tasks and contributions.Such was the popularity of the clicker game, it even boosted sales of mechanical clickers on e-commerce platforms eBay and Alibaba.Enabling participation in the Notcoin phenomenon is its community bot, which leverages Telegram’s tried-and-tested bot ecosystem to deliver a user-friendly experience.Notcoin has amassed 35 million players of its clicker game, providing a huge captive audience for the coin.The Open Network (TON) traces its birth back to the Telegram app, developed by Nikolai and Pavel Durov (Pavel is the CEO of Telegram). In-game mining ended on April 1, with token claiming starting on Tuesday.In addition to selling $NOT, holders can also opt to stake it or simply ‘hodl’ in their self-custody wallet.Since Telegram ran into regulatory issues with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the TON network has been run by the TON Foundation and is no longer officially connected with Telegram for its governance, although is effectively the native token of the platform.After an X poll of community members in January asking whether $NOT should be minted and listed as a token, not surprisingly 69.9% voted yes.Binance, OKX and Bybit are among the top exchanges listing $NOT
Through assiduous cultivation of the support of crypto OG influencers and the enthusiastic backing of the clicker game community, a coordinated successful launch across some of the top crypto trading venues was executed.Among the exchanges involved were, Binance, OKX and Bybit – the first, third and fourth-ranked spot exchanges on Coinmarketcap. On the Bybit launchpool there are still three days left to get free NOTcoin.Because of the regulatory kerfuffle with the SEC, US exchanges have avoided listing TON-based coins.For instance, Coinbase does not list Toncoin or associated tokens. The same goes for Kraken, Gemini, and others.According to Plotvinov, the Telegram app has only about 100 million crypto-savvy users, but it is expected to reach one billion users by the end of the year.Notcoin’s mission is to bridge that gap by extending crypto’s reach through building applications with mass market appeal. Plotvinov’s Open Builders TON developer studio team is now pivoting to launch more games and encourage other developers to build on the TON network.Telegram is a popular home to a growing band of crypto casinosIndicative of its growing popularity, Telegram has become home to a number of lucrative crypto casino platforms, notably TG.Casino, Lucky Block and Mega Dice, which all have Telegram ‘no kyc’ versions of their gambling businesses on the app. Mega Dice is currently in presale and has raised over $ 1 million from contributors.VIDEONotcoin plans to relaunch its clicker game, this time with players able to directly mine $NOT coin instead of an in-game token that has to be exchanged for $NOT in the claiming process, as previously was the case.Still, because all Notcoin has now been minted and deployed, a new play-to-earn model is being worked up.In an encouraging move for whale buyers, in a Telegram post Pavel Durov said he is holding onto the $6.8 million worth of $NOTcoin he was gifted until it grows 100x in value.With endorsements like that, trading volume in $NOT remains elevated. Coinmarketcap ranks it the 40th most traded coin. With the price now finding a floor, buyers of Notcoin are likely to remain plentiful.

Ethereum funds face $23 million in outflows amid ETF uncertainty - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Ethereum (ETH) crypto funds suffered over $23 million in weekly outflows, despite digital asset products witnessing $932 million in inflows for the same period, according to asset management firm CoinShares. The outflows are tied to a growing skepticism over the likelihood of the SEC approving a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US.Bitcoin remained the favored asset, attracting $942 million in inflows, while there was a negligible amount directed towards short Bitcoin positions, indicating a generally positive investor outlook. Altcoins also experienced inflows, with Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano receiving $4.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million, respectively.Crypto funds weekly flows. Image: CoinSharesThe overall trading volume was a mere $10.5 billion for the week, a stark contrast to the $40 billion seen in March. The increase in inflows appears to be a direct reaction to a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released on Wednesday, with the latter three trading days contributing 89% of the week’s total inflows. This pattern suggests that Bitcoin prices are once again closely tied to interest rate expectations.Regionally, the US led the charge with inflows of $1 billion. Grayscale, which had experienced significant outflows amounting to $16.6 billion since its ETF launch in January, saw its first inflows of $18 million in a notable shift.Minor inflows were also recorded in Switzerland and Germany, totaling $27 million and $4.2 million, respectively. On the flip side, Hong Kong and Canada faced outflows of $83 million and $17 million.Blockchain equities have been facing a challenging year, with outflows in 14 of the 20 weeks thus far, resulting in a cumulative outflow of $512 million.

Crypto Crackdown: Venezuela Goes Dark on Mining to Ease Grid Overload


								Venezuelans, once seeking solace in the digital gold rush, now face a harsh reality. The country, grappling with hyperinflation and economic instability, has banned all crypto mining farms connected to the national grid.
This decision, announced by the Venezuelan National Power Ministry, prioritizes the crumbling power grid over the once-booming crypto industry.

From Hope To Headaches: The Rise And Fall Of Crypto Mining In Venezuela
For many Venezuelans, cryptocurrency mining emerged as a beacon of hope. With the country’s currency, the Bolivar, in a state of freefall, digital assets offered a chance to generate income and hedge against inflation.
Venezuela’s incredibly low electricity costs further fueled the allure of crypto mining. Homes and businesses buzzed with the whirring of specialized computers, relentlessly churning out digital coins.
However, this digital El Dorado came at a heavy price. The surge in mining activity placed a massive strain on the nation’s already fragile power grid.
The result? More frequent and prolonged blackouts, plunging entire communities into darkness and disrupting daily life. The government, facing mounting pressure and public frustration, could no longer ignore the energy crisis.

A Fork In The Road: Balancing Power Needs With Livelihoods
Governor Rafael Lacava of Carabobo state emerged as the face of the government’s crackdown. Lacava spearheaded a series of decisive actions, leading to the seizure of over 11,000 ASICs, specialized hardware used for mining, and the shuttering of numerous mining farms. He even enlisted the public, urging citizens to report any suspected illegal mining operations.

Lacava emphasized the critical need to stabilize the power grid. “These measures are essential,” he declared. The recurring blackouts, he said, have crippled the economy and caused immense hardship for Venezuelans. “We need a reliable electricity supply for our homes, hospitals, and businesses,” he pointed out.
The Future Of Crypto In Venezuela: Uncertain And Unpowered
The ban, however, presents a new set of challenges. Many Venezuelans, particularly those in economically depressed regions, had come to rely on crypto mining for their livelihood.
The sudden loss of this income source adds another layer of hardship to their already precarious existence. The government has yet to announce any specific support programs for those impacted by the ban.

The future of cryptocurrency mining in Venezuela remains shrouded in uncertainty. The authorities haven’t clarified whether the ban is permanent.
While the move ensures a more stable power grid in the short term, it raises concerns about the long-term viability of the fledgling crypto industry within the country.

Notorious Crypto Drainer Pink Drainer Retires After Stealing Over $85 Million



                    

In a surprise announcement on Telegram, Pink Drainer, a notorious crypto-wallet draining kit, declared its retirement after successfully facilitating the theft of over $85 million in crypto assets.



“After this message’s publication, we will begin winding down all of our infrastructure. All stored information will be wiped and securely destroyed,” stated the announcement.




The developer behind Pink Drainer, known as Pink, refused to comment further when approached by Cointelegraph, simply saying, “I do not wish to comment. Bye.” 



Following this, Pink deleted the entire Telegram chat history.



CryptoSleuth ZachXBT shared a screenshot of Pink Drainer’s final announcement, revealing that the drainware service had shut down after stealing over $75 million. 




PeckShieldAlert also reported on the shutdown, noting that Pink Drainer addresses had staked up to 18.1 million Dai into Spark, accounting for approximately 1.35% of the total sDAI tokens.



Data from Dune Analytics indicates that since July 2023, over $85 million has been stolen from more than 21,100 victims.



The Pink Drainer Telegram channel has since rebranded to “Bonadifier.”

It now features an image of Bonad, described as a drainer with a mental disability, along with the message, “never forget what he took from you.”



Pink Drainer’s toolkit was responsible for stealing $53 million from over 9,000 “participants” in 2023. 



The security researcher behind Pink Drainer defended the service, stating, “I don’t phish, I just code.”



This announcement continues a trend among high-profile crypto drainers. 



In November 2023, Inferno Drainer ceased operations after stealing $70 million, following Monkey Drainer, which shut down in March 2023 after facilitating the theft of $13 million.



While the closure of drainer services like Pink Drainer provides temporary relief for crypto users, the ongoing presence of other drainers, such as Angel Drainer, indicates that the threat remains. 



In February, Angel Drainer stole over $400,000 from 128 crypto wallets by targeting users with a malicious Safe Vault contract.

Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Rally May Lead to Imminent Correction


Chainlink’s (LINK) price broke out of the consolidation and marked a monthly high of less than a week.
However, this may lead to LINK holders moving to sell their holdings before they lose the chance to secure their gains.
Chainlink Investors May Book Profits

Chainlink’s price is $16.8 after rising nearly 30% this past week. However, this resulted in the altcoin hitting saturation, historically synonymous with corrections.
This is evident in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 indicating overbought conditions and below 30 indicating oversold conditions.
Currently, the RSI is above 70, suggesting LINK is overbought on the 12-hour chart. This happened last in February, after which the rally took a break. The same could be the fate of Chainlink’s price as well.

Plus, it could face additional discomfort from its investors should it move to sell, which is a probable outcome. This is because the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) signals profit-taking.
The MVRV ratio tracks investor gains/losses. Chainlink’s 30-day MVRV of 16% suggests profit, possibly prompting selling. Historically, LINK tends to correct at MVRV levels of 10%- 20%, labeling this a risky zone.

Such is the situation with Chainlink; investors could move to secure their gains, signaling a drawdown.
LINK Price Prediction: Return to $15 Likely

Chainlink’s price, trading at $16.8, breached multiple resistances to push past the resistance at $16.5. Closer to $17.0, the altcoin is noting a major rally. However, this push that brought LINK to a monthly high could also cause a decline.
Should the aforementioned conditions turn out to be true, Chainlink’s price could fall back to $15.0. Once the support at $15.6 is broken, this would happen, possibly extending the decline to $14.4.

However, if the investors do not move to sell and the rally continues to rise, Chainlink’s price could continue to rise. Crossing $17.5 would invalidate the bearish thesis, pushing LINK towards $18.

Flipped Cat (FLICAT) Will Surge 8,300% Before Bitrue, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Flipped Cat (FLICAT) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Flipped Cat (FLICAT), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Flipped Cat presents a similar opportunity.



Flipped Cat has a market cap below $17,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 8,300% in the coming two days ahead of it being listed on giant crypto exchange Bitrue, and Flipped Cat could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap.




Currently, Flipped Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Flipped Cat on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Flipped Cat by entering its contract address – JDCyeohyUFrxX31t4tY8Fe5LzMWkstAMaVHuH8Lq71Z1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like FLICAT.

Which Altcoins Will Binance List? Here is the New Strategy! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, continues its altcoin listings at full speed, it significantly moves the price of the relevant altcoin with its listings.
While investors were looking forward to Binance listing new altcoins, a new statement came from the exchange regarding the altcoin listing policy.


At this point, Binance stated that it is considering listing cryptocurrencies that do not have a high market value but attract the attention of the masses.

“Binance is committed to promoting a healthy and sustainable market environment and always putting our users' interests first.
In recent months, we have observed a trend of tokens with initially low circulating supply being launched at high valuations.

Bitcoin Nears Key $67,500 Resistance: New All-Time Highs Ahead?


Bitcoin’s price action has shown significant improvement recently. Prices rebounded towards the late April resistance zone of $67,500, surpassing early May highs of $64,000. 
According to 10X Research, the Bitcoin breakout could lead to new all-time highs. The research firm’s Bitcoin ETF model supports these predictions.
Why Analysts Are Bullish on Bitcoin Recovery?

The report highlights the importance of the $68,300 “line-in-the-sand.” Surpassing this level could trigger a strong rally. Bitcoin currently trades bullishly, with $67,500 being the next critical breakthrough level. 
Selling pressure remains subdued. However, market structure and fundamentals still pose challenges. The bull market is searching for a significant narrative to ignite investor interest.

Despite these challenges, Bitcoin’s downside appears limited. Inflation data is unlikely to rise significantly, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has ruled out rate hikes. 

This environment is conducive to resuming Bitcoin ETF inflows from long-only investors. Multi-strategy funds may stay on the sidelines due to low funding rates and weak retail trading volumes.
A gradual increase in Bitcoin prices is anticipated, contrasting with the explosive rally seen earlier in the year. A stronger US stock market and support from the US Presidential election cycle could bolster this bullish narrative. 
Bitcoin closed the week at approximately $66,300, up by over 10% since May 13. Most of the price increase occurred on Wednesday, while the rest of the week exhibited relatively stable price action.

Crypto analyst Jelle echoes 10X Research’s bullish forecast. He notes that Bitcoin broke the local downtrend, reclaimed previous cycle highs, and now consolidates around $67,000. 

“It’s time to push back into the seventies, and beyond,” Jelle said.

According to Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital assets company Fineqia, last week’s positive price movement was also driven by increased demand for BTC Spot ETFs. 


“After five weeks of low demand, resulting in about $1 billion in cumulative net outflows, BTC Spot ETFs saw about $950 million in net inflows last week, reflecting a demand level not seen since March,” Greco told BeInCrypto.

Moreover, Santiment data indicates that Bitcoin wallets holding less than 0.1 BTC have reduced their total holdings by 0.46% over the past week.

“Historically, small wallets dumping their coins to larger wallets is an encouraging and bullish sign for BTC,” Santiment wrote.

While it is technically possible for the SEC to approve the 19b-4 applications, they might delay the approval of the S-1 registration statements, especially given the reported lack of participation and engagement from some stakeholders.Also Read: ‘The Dogecoin Explosion Made Something Click In Me:’ Veteran Trader Shares Secrets To Turning Pennies Into Millions With Meme CoinsBitcoin Spot ETFs Witness Substantial InflowsThis anticipated decision on the Ethereum spot ETF comes at a time when Bitcoin spot ETFs are experiencing substantial inflows.

                        SHIB has fallen to $0.00002394 today, with the Shiba Inu price dropping by 2.5% as the crypto market as a whole falls by 0.5% in the past 24 hours.While SHIB is actually up by 1.5% in the past week, it’s down by 6% in a fortnight, following a fall May 6-13 that it so far hasn’t quite recovered from.However, the ever-popular meme token remains up by 4.5% in a week and by 175% in the past year, giving it strong medium- and long-term momentum.This means that now would be an opportune time to buy the dip, with the Shiba Inu price likely to peak again soon.Shiba Inu Price Prediction as SHIB Drops 2.5% in 24 Hours – Time to Buy the Dip?
After a dip overnight, SHIB has actually recovered a little momentum this morning, even if it has stopped rising within the past couple of hours.Its relative strength index (purple) has risen back up to 50, after dropping below 30, a sign that some buyers have already bought the dip.Source: TradingViewAt the same time, SHIB’s 30-day average (orange) looks like it’s just about to drop below the 200-day average (blue), something which could portend further falls in the near term.Yet the recovery of the past couple of hours could help it avoid such a fate, with the coin potentially returning to growth very soon.What’s also interesting is that the token’s support (green) and resistance (red) levels are sliding towards each other, something that usually predicts a big move.This could be in either direction, with SHIB’s relatively low volume – at $300 million today – making the coin more vulnerable to volatility.As the tweet above indicates, whales have been selling SHIB in recent days, undermining any sense that we’re currently in an accumulation phase.However, given that the coin has fallen far enough in the past couple of weeks, it seems like it’s time for it to make a comeback.It could reach $0.000025 in the next few weeks, with its longer-term prospects depending largely on the trajectory of the wider market.For instance, if the Fed does cut rates later in the year, then the market will respond accordingly, with prices rising across the board.This will include the Shiba Inu price, which will also benefit from SHIB’s fundamentals as a token.Such fundamentals stem from Shiba Inu’s recent efforts to boost its utility, including the launch of Shibarium last year and the upcoming launch of a privacy-focused layer-three network.Alternative Meme Tokens for Market-Beating Returns
Traders wanting alternatives to SHIB may do well to check out one of the newer meme tokens impressing investors at the moment, including several presale coins that could surge when they list.A great example of this is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain crypto that has raised more than $15 million in its presale.Source: DogeverseDogeverse has been able to raise so much money so quickly because of its strong tokenomics and fundamentals, with the coin poised to become the first ever multi-chain Doge-themed meme token.As such, it will run on Ethereum and bridge to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche, and Base.Its existence on multiple chains will mean that it potentially gains wider application than it would have otherwise, with the coin aiming to gain traction on multiple apps and platforms.Its tokenomics are also bullish, with the coin having a hard cap of 120 million, meaning that rising demand will make it deflationary.Holders will also be able to stake DOGEVERSE for a passive income, an incentive that could see a big portion of the coin’s supply exiting circulation.VIDEOInvestors can buy some now before the sale ends by heading to the official Dogeverse website, with 1 DOGEVERSE costing $0.00031.This is its final presale price, with coin looking ready to surge once it gets on trading platforms.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Whales Accumulate Over $16,781,000,000 in Bitcoin Since ETF Launch As BTC Enters Institutional Era: IntoTheBlock - The Daily Hodl


								New data from market intelligence firm IntoTheBlock reveals that deep-pocketed crypto investors have accumulated tens of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin since BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in January.
In a new article, IntoTheBlock says that the top crypto asset by market cap’s era of institutional adoption is here as crypto whales have gobbled up nearly $16.8 billion worth of BTC since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot market BTC ETFs earlier this year.










 “For years, the crypto industry has been rallying around the message of ‘institutions are coming.’ Following the launch of the spot BTC ETFs on the New York stock exchange, it is quite evident that institutions have arrived.”
According to the analytics platform, the amount of BTC held by whales is back to the levels before the crypto exchange FTX collapsed. However, IntoTheBlock says that this time around, traditional finance firms have stepped into the role that crypto asset managers held.
 “The amount of Bitcoin held by addresses with over 1,000 BTC (‘whales’) has increased by 250,000 BTC since the launch of the ETFs. 
The aggregate amount of Bitcoin held by whale addresses in aggregate is now back near the levels it was prior to the FTX collapse. However, the type of entities within this category has changed drastically – previous industry giants like Genesis, FTX and 3AC (Three Arrows Capital) got wiped out during the 2022 bear market. 
Now traditional finance entities have stepped in and accumulated sizable amounts of Bitcoin since then. Many anticipated hedge funds would buy Bitcoin ETFs, and this week it was revealed that was indeed the case, with institutions like Millenium Management buying as much as $2 billion.” 
The crypto king is trading for $66,635 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

WIF Price Rise: Investor Optimism or Precursor to a Shift?


							

WIF price rises, but trading volume dips



Whale activity boosts sentiment, but technical indicators mixed



Cautious market outlook due to conflicting signals




The cryptocurrency market experienced activity in the past 24 hours, with Dogwifhat (WIF) surging more than 3.5% to $2.70. The token reached intraday highs of $2.72 and lows of $2.44. However, trading volume for WIF has dropped by 38.26%, reaching $536.5 million. This decline suggests a potential shift in market sentiment in the coming hours.



Investor optimism has been boosted by recent whale activity involving WIF. According to on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, a large investor made significant purchases of the token. This investor opened a new wallet and transferred 1.83 million USDC from Coinbase to facilitate the WIF purchases. They have used approximately 606,000 USDC to acquire 227,896 WIF tokens at an average price of $2.66 each.







Data from Coinglass shows that Open Interest (OI) for WIF derivatives has declined by 3.77%, totaling $327.40 million. This decrease in OI suggests a reduction in the number of open contracts, indicating lower trader participation.



Technical analysis for the past 24 hours reveals that the WIF token price is consolidating. The Alligator indicator’s three lines are intertwined, suggesting a lack of strong directional momentum. This indicates a period of equilibrium where buyers and sellers are balanced, leading to stable price movements.







WIF/USD 24-hour price chart source: TradingView



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 45.78, hovering near the midline of 50. This signifies a neutral market without strong bullish or bearish dominance. This level of RSI suggests a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a clear advantage.









The 4-hour technical analysis presents intriguing movements for the WIF token price, as reflected by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The MACD line is approaching a potential crossover above the signal line, hinting at a possible increase in bullish momentum. This positive divergence suggests that buyers are gradually gaining strength, potentially leading to a near-term price increase.







WIF/USD 4-hour price chart source: TradingView



Furthermore, the Keltner Channels, which measure volatility and price trends, show the price of WIF hovering near the middle of the channel. This suggests a balanced market condition without significant bullish or bearish bias.To conclude, while WIF’s price has increased, the mixed signals from trading volume and technical indicators suggest a cautious market outlook.

Purported Pump.Fun Hacker Claims To Be In Hospital After Arrest and Release - The Defiant

A former Pump.fun employee was arrested and released on bail in relation to a recent hack that stole $1.9M from the platform.A Twitter user has claimed responsibility for the May 16 exploit that stole $1.9 million from Pump.fun, the surging memecoin launchpad.On May 18, JarrettDunn, an X (formerly Twitter) account, tweeted they had spent a night in custody after being arrested by United Kingdom police in connection to last week’s exploit that resulted in roughly $1.9 million worth of SOL being stolen from Pump.fun.Dunn identified themselves as a disgruntled former employee of Pump.fun, arguing that the platform is operating in violation of U.K. law. Dunn also claimed that Pump.fun is planning to distribute an airdrop worth $80 million to early users.“I spent overnight in custody as the pump team alleges I stole 2m of their Ill gotten gains with conspiracy to steal another 80m,” Dunn tweeted. “When I return to the station after my bail I will argue with the crown that Pump is guilty of far more heinous shit. Do you believe they are more guilty of the uk equivalent of running an unregistered securities exchange, or a gambling site with no license, kyc, or aml?”On May 16, a different Twitter user also claiming to be Dunn appeared to claim responsibility for the attack.The bizarre tweets come after Pump.fun published a May 17 post-mortem attributing the attack to a “former employee.” The platform also tweeted that it was cooperating with law enforcement on the day of the hack.The incident follows Pump.fun enjoying meteoric growth since launching in January. On May 10, Pump.fun ranked as top DeFi protocol by weekly revenue with $3.3 million.Pump.fun did not respond to The Defiant’s request to comment at press time.Unhinged accusationsIn his May 18 tweet storm, Dunn also accused Pump.fun of exploiting overseas employees and planning to integrate live-streamed pornography onto the platform.However, despite trying to position himself as a martyr willing to take on his former “horrible bosses,” Dunn’s thread garnered criticism in the comments section.“I’m not a lawyer, and I’m not your lawyer, but I’m going to tell you for free that this isn’t going to work out for you the way you think it is,” said Functi0nZer0, the creator of Wildcat Protocol.“You are not a hero, you are a felon,” added SoldanoCap.On the following day, Dunn claimed he had been taken into hospital after his “mental health was taken into question.”

Dogecoin (DOGE) falls to $0.15: price predictions for the crypto

The crypto Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently dropped to $0.15, what are the future price predictions? The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.1522, marking a decrease of 1.77% in the last 24 hours. 
Let’s see below all the details. 

What factors could influence the price of the crypto Dogecoin (DOGE)?
As anticipated, currently Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at 0.1522 dollars, registering a decrease of 1.77% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of 819 million dollars in the same period. 
Ranked 9th on CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin has a market capitalization of 22 billion dollars and a circulating supply of 144 billion DOGE coins.
But what are now the next potential targets for DOGE as it hovers around the $0.15 level? In the four-hour chart, DOGE has a pivot point at $0.15100, indicating a possible bullish forecast for the price of Dogecoin.
Immediate resistance is located at $0.15950, followed by $0.16980 and $0.18440. On the contrary, immediate support is at $0.14270, with further support levels at $0.13240 and $0.12030. 
The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 53, indicating neutral conditions. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is positioned at $0.15130, suggesting that the market maintains a bullish trend above that level.
Dogecoin has developed a symmetrical triangle pattern, with significant resistance around $0.1545. At the same time, support persists around $0.1513, reinforced by the 50-day EMA.
Analysis of current trend and possible developments
The current market price above the 50 EMA indicates a bullish trend, but Dogecoin must surpass the resistance at $0.1595 to confirm further gains. The RSI, above 50, suggests a buying trend, supporting this outlook.
If Dogecoin maintains its position above the pivot point at $0.15100, it could push prices higher towards the resistances at $0.15950, $0.16980, and $0.18440. 
However, a break below that level could cause a bearish trend, bringing the price to supports at $0.14270, $0.13240 and $0.12030. The market’s reaction at these levels will be crucial for the future direction of Dogecoin.
In conclusion, the technical outlook for Dogecoin remains bullish above the pivot point at $0.15100. The immediate resistance at $0.15950 will be the first hurdle to overcome, followed by $0.16980 and $0.18440. 
However, caution is needed if the price were to drop below the pivot point. The 50-day EMA at $0.15130 provides a solid foundation for the upward trend currently in place.
Billy Markus of Dogecoin speaks out on X in defense of Elon Musk
The founder of Dogecoin, Billy Markus, recently shared a post on X in which he defended Elon Musk regarding the discrepancies discovered by users in the “freedom of speech” social media app.
According to Markus, the boosting and depowering of accounts are becoming a trend on X. However, he does not attribute these actions to Musk, but rather to the fluctuations of the algorithm.
Markus emphasized that if smaller accounts are empowered, this means that larger accounts are disempowered, a basic mathematical concept. 
He also denied that the algorithm depowers people for specific political opinions or conspiracy theories. Musk’s acquisition of X has brought several challenges for users, including issues related to bots and cryptographic scams.
In response, Musk announced a total purge of the system and the introduction of a small fee for new users to combat bot attacks.
Musk criticized traditional bot detection tools, such as CAPTCHA, calling them obsolete, and suggested that he could make changes to the bot algorithm to improve user visibility on X.

Another Chinese money laundering scheme tied to Deltec and Tether


Daren Li and Yicheng Zhang, two Chinese nationals, have been charged with utilizing tether and crypto-friendly bank Deltec to commit money laundering and wire fraud amounting to $73 million, according to an announcement on Friday by the Department of Justice (DoJ).
According to an affidavit, the pair, who were arrested in Los Angeles and Atlanta in April, worked with pig butchering and scam operations to move assets through “money couriers, financial transactions with no legitimate commercial purpose, and shell accounts.”
Specifically, Li and Zhang used a shell company called CMD Export and Import to transfer cash to crypto-friendly Bahamas-based Deltec Bank and Trust. It was then converted to USDT before being sent to Binance.US or Binance and distributed to money mules as necessary.
Li and Zhang gained citizenship of St. Kitts and Nevis (a small Caribbean Island that partially relies on citizenship by investment for its GDP). As verified by previous Protos reporting, crypto billionaire Justin Sun has St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship that he uses to incorporate in Hong Kong.

While it’s stated in the DoJ press release that a wallet involved had received $341 million in virtual assets, it’s unclear if that’s an exchange hot wallet, a mixing service, or a wallet for the scam itself.
While many of the addresses associated with the scam have been seized or otherwise frozen, many remain active and operational. Protos will update this article if anything else is divulged.
