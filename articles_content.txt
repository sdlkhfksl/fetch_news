Absent Since FTX 2022 Downfall, Sam Trabucco Breaks Silence With Letter Of Endorsement | Bitcoinist.com


								In a recent development, Sam Trabucco, a key figure in Sam Bankman-Fried’s inner circle, has resurfaced after his absence from the public eye following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in late 2022. 
According to Bloomberg, Trabucco has come forward to support Ryan Salame, another former FTX executive who awaits sentencing for his involvement in the platform’s downfall.
Sam Trabucco’s First Communication Since FTX Bankruptcy
Trabucco’s endorsement of Salame was expressed in a letter describing Salame as the “funniest, most passionate, most supportive friend” he has ever had. The letter, made public as part of court filings on Wednesday, marks Trabucco’s first communication since the days leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy in November 2022.

Formerly serving as the co-chief executive of Alameda Research, a crypto fund established by Bankman-Fried, Trabucco played a crucial role in venture capital and market-making. However, in August 2022, three months before FTX’s failure, he abruptly stepped away from Alameda and retreated from public life.
Unlike other close associates of Bankman-Fried, such as Caroline Ellison, the other co-chief executive of Alameda, and FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, Trabucco did not participate in Bankman-Fried’s trial or contribute publicly available evidence. 
As Bitcoinist reported, Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison sentence in March, while his former colleagues await their verdicts in the following months. Notably, Trabucco has not faced any public accusations of wrongdoing.
Diverse Group Rallies Behind Former FTX Executive
Trabucco has a long association with Bankman-Fried, having known each other since their early days at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) math camp. According to Bloomberg, he often shared how his poker strategy influenced Alameda’s trading decisions.
Prior to Alameda’s collapse, Trabucco allegedly received approximately $25 million in transfers from the firm. Moreover, Alameda spent $2.5 million to purchase a 52-foot yacht for Trabucco, which he affectionately named “Soak My Deck.” 
Ryan Salame, who formerly oversaw FTX’s digital assets unit in the Bahamas, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges related to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and engaging in campaign finance fraud. 

Several individuals, including a Georgetown finance professor, a martial arts grandmaster, family members, neighbors, former FTX employees, and Bahamian residents, have submitted letters in support of Salame.
As the legal proceedings progress, the emergence of Sam Trabucco and his endorsement of Ryan Salame sheds new light on the ongoing fallout from FTX’s collapse.

The Pulse of the Market - How Fear and Greed Shape Cryptocurrency Trading - The Daily Hodl


								
 
In the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency, market sentiment often swings wildly, driven by speculation and the whims of influential voices.
Unlike traditional financial markets, crypto values can skyrocket or plummet based on the collective mood of traders, making it essential to stay attuned to these emotional undercurrents.
Consider the sway of figures like Elon Musk and Michael Saylor – their tweets and public statements can send ripples through the market, causing dramatic shifts in value almost instantaneously.
For instance, Musk’s tweet about Bitcoin’s environmental impact led to a swift sell-off, underscoring how susceptible crypto prices are to influential opinions.
These events highlight the importance of understanding market sentiment to navigate the crypto landscape effectively.
Given this volatile environment, tools that measure market sentiment are invaluable.
Enter the Fear and Greed Index – a barometer that captures the emotional state of the market.
By interpreting this index, traders can gain insights into the underlying mood driving price movements and feel the pulse of the market for more informed decisions.
Source: Elon Musk/X
The Fear and Greed Index compiles various indicators such as market volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, surveys, Bitcoin dominance and Google Trends data.
It scores sentiment on a scale from zero (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed).
This scale provides a snapshot of market emotions, helping traders identify potential buying or selling opportunities.
When fear and greed dominate
When the market is gripped by fear, indicated by a low score, investors often sell off assets, fearing further losses.
This can lead to undervaluation, presenting potential buying opportunities for traders who recognize the overreaction.
Conversely, when the market is driven by greed, reflected in a high score, investors may become overly optimistic, driving prices up to unsustainable levels.
This often signals a good time to take profits or prepare for a potential correction.
Experienced traders use the Fear and Greed Index as a contrarian indicator. Extreme fear might suggest it’s time to buy, while extreme greed could indicate it’s time to sell.
By aligning trading strategies with these emotional extremes, investors can better navigate the unpredictable waters of cryptocurrency trading.
Current market sentiment
Today, the Fear and Greed Index stands at 70, indicating a strong tilt towards greed. Historically, such high levels of greed have preceded market corrections.
For seasoned traders, this suggests caution. It might be wise to secure profits and reevaluate risk exposure while remaining vigilant for signs of a market shift.
The Fear and Greed Index offers a powerful lens to view market emotions, enabling traders to anticipate and react to shifts more strategically.
By blending sentiment analysis with traditional market indicators, investors can gain a more holistic view of the market, enhancing their ability to make well-informed decisions in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading.
Understanding the interplay of fear and greed not only aids in navigating the present market landscape but also provides a strategic edge, helping traders stay one step ahead in the volatile journey of cryptocurrency investments.

Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian Highlights Democrats, Including Chuck Schumer, Who Crossed Party Line To Support Pro-Crypto Law - Benzinga

A known blockchain advocate, Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of social media platform Reddit Inc. RDDT, highlighted the Democrats who crossed party lines to support a pro-crypto legislation in the Senate Thursday.What Happened: The U.S. Senate joined the House of Representatives in repealing a controversial SEC directive that would prevent highly regulated financial firms from custodying Bitcoin BTC/USD. The legislation was passed by a 2/3rd majority vote.Interestingly, a dozen Democrats defied the party's hardening anti-crypto stance in supporting the resolution.Apart from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D), Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D), Gary Peters (D), Bob Casey (D), Jacky Rosen (D), Jon Tester (D), John Hickenlooper (D), Mark Kelly (D), Cory Booker (D), Ben Ray Luján (D), Ron Wyden (D), and Michael Bennet (D) voted in favor.Ohanian amplified a post from global cryptocurrency advocacy firm Bankless thanking the 12 Democrats, and pledging his support for the cause of cryptocurrencies in the country.Why It Matters: Ohanian has used public forums to extend his support for cryptocurrencies, even comparing the King Crypto with gold. Ohanian also took an early gamble with Ethereum ETH/USD, grabbing 50,000 of them during the asset's presale in 2014.As far as Reddit was concerned, the social media giant allocated a part of its excess cash reserves in Bitcoin and Ether. It also purchased Ether and Polygon MATIC/USD to use them to pay for virtual goods. The company's shares shot up 10% after the market on its new partnership with OpenAI, allowing Reddit users to use ChatGPT. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $65,402.52, following a 0.8% pullback in the last 24 hours. Reddit shares were seen trading 11.05% higher in the after-hours session at $62.61 after closing 5.45% lower at $56.38 in regular trading, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Photo Courtesy: Asatur Yesayants on Shutterstock.comRead Next: Reddit Stock Pops On Partnership With OpenAI: The Details

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) to Skyrocket 14,000% Before KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAMBCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gambling Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gambling Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Gambling Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gambling Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gambling Cat by entering its contract address – B4BQTfBJ6uQYkzaZyQjTmH7k3c9gzXQ3FrPMPDstpYAn – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAMBCAT.

More Losses In DOGE?

Chainlink Fund Tokenization Pilot Successful With Large Banks Participating - Coincu



	

Key Points:




DTCC, in collaboration with Chainlink and major U.S. banks, completed a pilot to bring NAV data onto blockchains.



The Smart NAV project, which involved institutions like JPMorgan and BNY Mellon, used Chainlink’s CCIP to standardize data across blockchains.



The Chainlink fund tokenization underscores the growing interest in asset tokenization, boosting Chainlink’s price by 10% amid positive market trends.




The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, has completed a successful pilot project with blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK) and several major U.S. financial institutions.





Chainlink Fund Tokenization Pilot Accomplished Through Partnership With DTCC



According to a report published by DTCC on Thursday, this initiative aims to accelerate the tokenization of funds.



The project, named Smart NAV, involved cooperation between DTCC, Chainlink, and prominent U.S. banks. It focused on testing a method to bring net asset value (NAV) data onto blockchains. Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) was crucial in facilitating standardized data provision across multiple blockchains, enhancing interoperability. 



Participating institutions included American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street, and U.S. Bank.




The primary goal of Smart NAV was to establish a standardized process for bringing and disseminating NAV data of funds across various blockchains. This standardization is intended to simplify and increase the efficiency of Chainlink fund tokenization. 



The pilot demonstrated that by delivering structured data on-chain and creating standardized roles and processes, foundational data can be embedded into various on-chain use cases, such as tokenized funds and smart contracts holding data for multiple funds.



Chainlink’s CCIP: Facilitating Interoperability in Financial Markets



DTCC’s report highlights that the Chainlink fund tokenization pilot successfully showcased the integration of structured NAV data onto blockchains, ensuring consistency and accuracy. Automated data routing via smart contracts was also established, promoting dynamic data management and preventing fragmentation through Chainlink’s CCIP. 



Clients now have the ability to consume price and rate data in real time through new interfaces, including APIs and smart contracts. These new data consumption methods facilitate instant updates and enable various applications, such as automated portfolio rebalancing.





The Chainlink fund tokenization pilot project takes place in a broader context where the tokenization of real assets (RWA) like bonds, funds, and other traditional investments is gaining interest. Financial giants such as BlackRock, Citi, and HSBC are exploring tokenization for benefits like operational efficiency, faster settlement, and increased transparency. Following this news and broader market optimism, Chainlink’s price surged by 10% in the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin remaining above $65,000.

Controversial SEC Crypto Asset Accounting Rule Strongly Opposed By US Senate - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The U.S. Senate voted 60-38 to overturn the SEC crypto asset accounting rule, easing restrictions on banks holding cryptocurrencies.



The legislation, passed by the House, could be vetoed by President Biden, who argues that it could harm investor protections.



The resolution, backed by both parties, seeks to enable regulated institutions to offer crypto custody services.




The U.S. Senate has passed a bill to overturn the SEC’s Notice 121 (SAB 121), which requires companies to record crypto assets on their balance sheets, making it costly for financial institutions to hold cryptocurrencies.





Senate Votes to Overturn SEC Crypto Asset Accounting Rule



The legislation passed with a 60-38 vote aims to reverse this rule, enabling banks to act as custodians for digital assets like Bitcoin. The House approved the bill last week, and it now awaits President Biden‘s decision.



SEC crypto asset accounting rule forces banks to label crypto assets held for clients as liabilities, which has deterred institutions from participating in crypto custody.



The Congressional resolution, H.J.Res. 109, seeks to eliminate these barriers, facilitating highly regulated firms to offer custody services for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Proponents argue this move is essential for consumer protection and to decentralize the custody of Bitcoin, which is currently concentrated among a few institutions.




Bipartisan Effort Aims to Ease Crypto Custody Restrictions



Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal supporter, sees the bill’s passage as a shift towards a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. She criticized the SEC crypto asset accounting rule as an administrative overreach, not properly sanctioned by the SEC‘s commissioners. Conversely, Senator Elizabeth Warren warned against the bill, citing the unique risks of digital assets, such as their susceptibility to hacking, as evidenced by breaches at exchanges like Binance and FTX.



The White House has indicated a potential veto, arguing that overturning the SEC crypto asset accounting rule would hinder the SEC’s ability to protect investors and the financial system. Despite this, the bill’s bipartisan support in Congress, with some Democrats joining the predominantly Republican effort, underscores the contentious nature of crypto regulation.

Crypto Just Had A Game-Changing Moment, But Will Biden Veto?


								In a potentially game-changing moment for the crypto sector, the US Senate has passed H.J. Res 109, a bill seeking to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121 om Thursday, May 16. The bill was passed with substantial bipartisan support, receiving a 60-38 vote in the Senate and earlier approval from the House.
SAB 121, implemented in 2022, mandated digital asset custodians to list digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, a requirement widely criticized within the crypto community. Critics argue that this regulation unfairly treats customer-owned digital assets as the custodian’s liabilities, thereby necessitating equivalent cash reserves to offset these “liabilities.”
Why Yesterday’s Vote Is A Game-Changer For Crypto
Avichal Garg, Co-Founder and General Partner at Electric Capital, expressed the industry’s frustration, stating, “If a bank custodies $1b of Bitcoin for customers, they have to hold $1b in cash to offset this ‘liability’ on their balance sheet. The assets are not the company’s. They are the customers’.” Garg also suggested that SAB 121 was designed to keep banks out of the crypto markets, which he sees as detrimental to consumer protection.

The Senate’s decision represents a critical juncture not only for crypto regulation but also for political alignments concerning financial technology. Notably, the vote saw 21 Democrats break ranks from their usual stance under the influence of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been a stringent advocate for strict financial and tech regulations. This shift suggests a significant political realignment, potentially indicative of a broader centrist move in the Democratic Party concerning market regulations.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote in favor of repealing SAB 121 carries considerable weight, signaling strong Congressional support for the cryptocurrency sector against the backdrop of President Biden’s veto threat.
Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, described the moment as transformative for the industry: “This is a game-changing moment for crypto. It’s one of the catalysts that will propel crypto to new all-time highs as the market digests the sea change that’s occurred here.”

Further highlighting the political drama, Perianne Boring, Founder and CEO of The Chamber of Digital Commerce, pointed out the potential influence of Senator Schumer in swaying the President’s decision: “If anyone can convince POTUS to sign, it’s Schumer. We have a very real chance of getting this across the finish line.”
Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at Variant Fund, also commented on the implications of the vote, stating, “The Senate just delivered a deafening bipartisan message in favor of common sense and against SEC overreach. It’s impossible to overstate the importance of Majority Leader Schumer voting to repeal SAB 121 over President Biden’s threatened veto.”
What Will President Biden Do?
The resolution now sits on President Biden’s desk, with the President having expressed intentions to veto it, aligning with Senator Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s views that the SEC’s guidelines are crucial for protecting investors in the volatile crypto markets. Eleanor Terrett of FOX Business highlighted the President’s dilemma, noting, “Biden now has 10 days to either veto, sign or do nothing. Doing nothing would mean it goes into law just without the signature.”
The crypto industry remains on edge as it awaits the President’s decision. A veto would maintain the status quo, potentially stifling further institutional participation in the crypto market due to perceived regulatory risks. Conversely, a decision to sign or allow the bill to pass without a signature could significantly liberalize the regulatory environment, encouraging more substantial institutional engagement and possibly catalyzing a new phase of market growth and innovation.
As the deadline approaches, the decision will not only determine the regulatory framework for digital asset custody but also signal the administration’s broader stance towards innovation and regulation in the fintech sector.
At press time, Bitcoin traded at $65,565.

FLOKI's 15 billion token burn - Here's what it means for investors like you - AMBCrypto



Market sentiment around FLOKI remained bullish as its Altrank hit #1
While FLOKI’s price dropped by 5% in the last 24 hours, indicators hinted at a trend reversal 

FLOKI broke above a bullish pattern a few days ago, which hinted at a sustained price rise. The latest datasets indicated that the memecoin was on the right track and was moving towards its targets. Meanwhile, a major proposal got passed, one that could fuel further growth on the charts. 
A lot is happening with FLOKI
World Of Chart, a popular crypto-analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting how FLOKI broke above a bull pattern. According to the same, FLOKI’s price entered a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern in March and successfully broke above it a few days ago. 
The breakout could result in a +100% hike in the memecoin’s price. The tweet also mentioned that FLOKI has been on the right track, with the altcoin appreciating by over 15% since the aforementioned breakout.
In the meantime, the memecoin announced that a major proposal had passed. As per its official X handle, FLOKI DAO has voted in favor of burning 15,246,000,000 FLOKI tokens, with a majority of 99.84% voting in favor of the burn. 
This deflationary characteristic might have a positive impact on FLOKI in the future since token burns affect circulating supply and in turn, they can push an asset’s price up. 
There is one concern
Though both of these aforementioned developments looked optimistic, things on the ground were a bit different. According to CoinMarketCap, the memecoin’s price declined by nearly 5% in just 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, the memecoin was trading at $0.0002121 with a market capitalization of over $2 billion. However, this trend might change soon. 
LunarCrush’s latest tweet revealed that FLOKI’s Altrank hit #1. For starters, Altrank is calculated by combining special and market activity and FLOKI’s metric hinted at a price uptick soon. 
To see whether that’s possible, AMBCrypto analyzed Santiment’s data. As per our analysis, despite the latest price drop, market sentiment around the memecoin remained positive, as is evidenced from its high weighted sentiment. Its MVRV ratio had a value of over 25% too – A bullish signal. 
However, the memecoin’s funding rate increased, which could cause trouble. Generally, prices move the other way than the funding rate.

Apart from the MVRV ratio and weighted sentiment, a few market indicators also looked optimistic. For instance, the Bollinger Bands suggested that FLOKI’s price was above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Additionally, both its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered price hikes, indicating that the bearish market trend might change soon.

                        Binance has teamed up with Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau and the Taipei District Prosecutors Office to solve a significant case involving cryptocurrency-assisted money laundering.The investigation centered around illicit funds amounting to nearly NT$200 million, equivalent to approximately $6 million, the exchange said in a press release shared with CryptoNews.Per the announcement, Binance’s cooperation, leveraging its Financial Crimes Compliance (FCC) Department’s expertise and intelligence sharing, played a key role in bringing the perpetrators to justice.Money Laundering for a Long Period
The criminal operation had been facilitating money laundering for scam groups using virtual assets for an extended period.The perpetrators employed various tactics, including fabricating customer conversation records, remittance proofs, and falsified identity verification data, to create the illusion of legitimate transactions.However, their activities did not go unnoticed, and law enforcement authorities eventually caught up with them.The police traced and monitored several suspicious cryptocurrency transactions and sought relevant information from various parties, including Binance.“Upon receiving the request, Binance responded swiftly and set up a cross-border online meeting with the investigating officers and prosecutors to discuss the collaborative strategy,” the exchange wrote.“Binance’s experienced FCC teams provided insights and recommendations based on crypto flow analyses, thereby helping to narrow down the circle of potential suspects more effectively.”Prosecutor Lo Wei-Yuan from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, who oversaw the case, subsequently filed indictments against nine suspects on charges of aggravated fraud, violation of the Money Laundering Control Act, and breach of organized crime prevention regulations last month.Expressing gratitude for Binance’s cooperation, Prosecutor Lo Wei-Yuan said Binance has “active and ongoing collaboration with Taiwan’s law enforcement agencies.”Damien Ho, a representative of Binance’s Asia-Pacific (APAC) team, said Binance is committed to combatting financial crime and protecting the integrity of the Web3 ecosystem.“We will continue to uphold this goal and deepen our cooperation with global law enforcement agencies.”Binance Eyes Global Expansion
Last week, the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) revealed that Binance has successfully registered with the regulatory body, returning to the country after some regulatory hurdles. Prior to that, the exchange announced that it had obtained a license from Dubai’s regulator, VARA, enabling the platform to cater to retail clients along with qualified and institutional ones.According to Bloomberg, the licensing process involved Binance’s founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, relinquishing voting control of the Dubai unit.Furthermore, earlier this year, Binance unveiled its joint venture crypto exchange Binance Thailand, which comes in collaboration with Gulf Innova, a subsidiary of Gulf Energy Development.Binance Thailand, abbreviated as Binance TH, provides a platform for digital asset exchange services with Thai baht trading pairs.It is worth noting that Binance has faced increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide.Last year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed charges against Binance for allegedly operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange and evading federal laws.Similarly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Binance Holdings LTD and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) for allegedly operating unregistered exchanges, broker exchanges, clearing houses, and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.

Dolce & Gabbana Hit With Lawsuit Over Metaverse Outfit NFTs


                        
                            Dolce & Gabbana Hit With Lawsuit Over Alleged 97% Loss on Metaverse Outfit NFTs

                        A customer sued Dolce & Gabbana USA on Thursday, claiming the NFTs they purchased lost 97% in value due to the company’s bungled delivery.Bloomberg reported Friday that the Italian fashion house sold the NFTs on Ethereum, promising “a slate of digital, physical and experiential benefits.” It reportedly told consumers that buying its DGFamily NFTs would unlock access to various digital rewards, physical products, and exclusive events.The lawsuit further alleges that Dolce & Gabbana failed to deliver the NFTs and promised benefits on time. The digital outfits, which arrived 20 days late, “could be used only in a metaverse platform with barely any users.”Dolce & Gabbana Allegedly Misled NFT Buyers with Unusable Digital Fashion
Even after the delayed arrival, token holders were allegedly left waiting another 11 days before they could use them. According to the complaint, Dolce & Gabbana hadn’t secured approval from the metaverse platform beforehand.“Their standard operating procedure has been to promise products they fail to deliver, before abandoning a project and community they promised to support,” the complaint said.Luke Brown, the plaintiff, claims he lost $5,800 on the NFTs he purchased. Brown said he is suing on behalf of others who bought digital assets from this NFT project. His lawsuit also targets NFT marketplace UNXD, making it a party to the legal action.NFT Market Growth Slows in 2024 
The NFT market has shown signs of growth so far in 2024. Estimates suggest a 41% increase in marketplace value compared to 2023. However, this is a significant slowdown compared to previous years’ explosive growth.Some high-profile sales like CryptoPunk 3100 did fetch $16m in March. But the overall trend points towards a decline in value for many NFTs.

Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Is Falling To New Lows - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Bitcoin supply on exchanges reaches new lows amid bullish market sentiment, signaling a move towards long-term holding.



Data predicts Bitcoin reserves on exchanges may deplete within nine months due to factors like the recent halving and increased US ETF investments.



Concerns arise over the Federal Reserve’s hesitance to cut interest rates, potentially affecting Bitcoin’s short-term price outlook despite optimistic forecasts.




Bitcoin supply on exchanges has hit a new low amidst bullish market sentiments over the past 48 hours, according to data from HIVE Digital Technologies.





Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges Plummets Amidst Bullish Surge



The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $65,300, marking a notable recovery from just above $66,500 earlier this week.



This decline in Bitcoin supply on exchanges is seen as a positive sign by analysts, indicating a shift towards long-term holdings rather than short-term trading. A report by the crypto exchange Bybit predicted that Bitcoin supply on exchanges could be depleted within nine months, attributing this trend to factors such as Bitcoin halving and increased inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly from the United States.



Federal Reserve’s Stance Casts Shadow on Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory



The introduction of US exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin earlier in the year led to a surge in trading volume, but activity has since slowed amidst tightening financial conditions and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve‘s approach to inflation. Despite market excitement surrounding the April 19 Bitcoin halving, which reduced the supply of new coins minted on the network, concerns linger about the Fed’s reluctance to initiate an interest rate cut cycle this year.




Analysts suggest that such cuts may be necessary to drive Bitcoin’s price to forecasted targets, such as $100,000 by 2024. However, with the Fed showing no signs of immediate action, the outlook for Bitcoin’s price trajectory remains uncertain in the short term.

‘Rocket Fuel for Bitcoin’: Analyst Jamie Coutts Says This Catalyst Could Propel BTC to $150,000 This Cycle - The Daily Hodl


								Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts is saying that the performance of the US dollar against other major currencies will impact the price of Bitcoin (BTC).
Coutts tells his 16,300 followers on the social media platform X that the US Dollar Index (DXY), a measure of the US dollar’s value compared to a basket of six dominant global currencies, is currently trading in a range.










According to Coutts, Bitcoin could rally if the DXY falls by around three percent from the current level.
“A break below 101 would be rocket fuel for Bitcoin.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
The DXY is trading at 104.52 at time of writing.
According to the Real Vision analyst, the DXY falling would send Bitcoin surging by approximately 127%.
“Risk assets love dollar weakness. 
The DXY holds the key to the Bitcoin cycle as it prices in market expectations on liquidity in real-time. And liquidity is coming.
Watch the 101/102 level on DXY. If that breaks, then we should see approximately $150,000 BTC this cycle.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
Earlier this month, Coutts opined on a reverse scenario warning that an upward move by the US dollar index would send Bitcoin to levels last recorded in February.
“With money supply actually expanding again, if the DXY turns bullish (i.e. weakens), then you have the macro/liquidity signal for BTC and it will be off to the races. 
However, 106/107 on the DXY remains the bogeyman level, which if broken, would likely see a fall into the low $50,000 range.”
Bitcoin is trading at $66,189 at time of writing.

                        The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the largest settlement system in the world, has partnered with blockchain oracle Chainlink to conclude a pilot program involving several major banking firms in the United States.The primary objective of the program was to enhance the tokenization of traditional finance funds.The pilot program, known as the Smart NAV Pilot, focused on establishing a standardized method for providing net asset value (NAV) data of funds on blockchains.Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) played a key role in achieving this goal.Structured Data Could be Delivered On-Chain
According to the DTCC’s report, the program demonstrated that structured data could be delivered on-chain, paving the way for various on-chain use cases such as tokenized funds and “bulk consumer” smart contracts, which hold data for multiple funds.The successful outcomes of the pilot program have implications for future industry exploration and enablement of numerous downstream use cases.These include brokerage applications, more automated data dissemination, and easier access to historical data for funds.The DTCC’s report noted that the program facilitated better-automated data management, minimal disruption to existing market practices in traditional financial institutions, retrieval of historical data without manual record-keeping, and broader API solutions for price data.Prominent US banking firms actively participated in the pilot program, including American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street, and U.S. Bank.Following the release of the DTCC’s report, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, experienced a 12.5% increase in value.Over the past 12 months, LINK has demonstrated significant growth, gaining more than 130% amid the broader uptick in the cryptocurrency market.Interest in RWA Tokenization on Rise
The DTCC’s report coincides with the growing enthusiasm among major traditional financial institutions for real-world asset tokenization.On March 19, BlackRock, a leading investment management firm, introduced a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL on the Ethereum network. The fund allows investors to acquire tokens representing shares in the fund, which primarily invests in assets such as U.S. Treasury bills.Operating as an ERC-20 token called BUIDL, the fund is often referred to as the “digital liquidity fund” due to its digitized nature on the Ethereum blockchain.As reported,  the TVL for RWA protocols soared to nearly $8 billion by the end of April.Some protocols have played a significant role in driving this growth, particularly in terms of active users.Digital carbon market platforms like Toucan and KlimaDAO, as well as the real estate tokenization protocol Propy, have experienced substantial user growth.Tokenized treasuries have also seen remarkable expansion as yields remain high in an environment of elevated inflation and interest rates in the United States.The RWA.xyz platform reported a record $1.29 billion locked-in tokenized U.S. treasuries and bonds, representing an 80% surge since the beginning of 2024. Back in March, DigiFT, a Singapore-based fintech company, also announced that it has made a foray into the digital asset realm with the launch of its US Treasury bill depository receipt (DR) tokens.

Did FED's Rate Cut Pushed Earlier After Positive Inflation Reports? WSJ Correspondent Clarified - Bitcoin Sistemi


Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Timiraos stated that the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the USA is not important enough to change the expectations regarding the FED's interest rate cut.
This leaves open-ended the possibility of a rate cut later this year. However, the analyst emphasized that two more CPI reports are needed to make a prediction in the form of an interest rate cut.


Despite forecasts, the Fed may not cut interest rates before September. Meanwhile, Americans continue to face significant price pressures, especially gasoline prices. Therefore, the economic landscape remains uncertain and all eyes will be on other upcoming CPI reports and the Fed's response.

New data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that prices rose 3.4 percent in April compared to the previous year. That's slightly lower than the 3.5 percent rate recorded in March, and the change comes after months of warmer-than-expected reports. Prices increased by 0.3 percent compared to the previous month.

Morgan Stanley Bets BIg on Crypto with $270 Million GBTC Stake


							

Financial giant Morgan Stanley’s investment through GBTC positions the bank as a major holder of Bitcoin.



Leading global banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and UBS, have also reported holdings in Bitcoin ETFs.



This growing acceptance suggests that cryptocurrencies are being viewed as a potential asset class by major financial institutions.




In a sign of growing mainstream adoption, financial giant Morgan Stanley revealed a hefty $269.9 million investment in Bitcoin through Grayscale’s GBTC trust, as disclosed in its first-quarter 13F filing. And as per CNBC, This positions the bank as a major holder of GBTC, trailing only Susquehanna International Group’s $1 billion stake.



Morgan Stanley’s move reflects a broader trend among leading global banks. The Royal Bank of Canada, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, and UBS have all disclosed similar investments in Bitcoin ETFs, underscoring institutional warming to the cryptocurrency.



The trend extends beyond traditional banks. Recent filings show significant exposure to Bitcoin ETFs by prominent investment firms. New York-based Pine Ridge Advisers holds a $205.8 million portfolio, including stakes in BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Bitwise’s BITB. Boothbay Fund Management, a hedge fund manager, boasts a diversified $377 million portfolio across the same Bitcoin ETFs.









Alternative asset managers are also joining the fray. Aristeia Capital revealed a $163.4 million position in IBIT, while Graham Capital Management holds a combined $102.6 million across IBIT and FBTC. Crcm LP, another hedge fund manager, reported a $96.6 million stake in IBIT.



While the long-term viability of Bitcoin remains a subject of debate, Morgan Stanley’s sizable investment and the increasing participation of other financial institutions suggest a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a potential asset class. This trend necessitates a close watch, as it could have significant implications for the future of finance.

Bitcoin vs inflation; Can Bitcoin hedge against inflation?


As traditional fiat currencies face the specter of inflation due to various economic factors, alternative assets like Bitcoin (BTC) have gained increasing attention as potential hedges against this phenomenon. But can Bitcoin hedge against inflation? In this article, we’ll delve into the dynamics of inflation, explore how Bitcoin operates in this context, and evaluate its effectiveness as a hedge against inflationary pressures.
What is inflation?
Before we dive into the role of Bitcoin, it’s essential to grasp the concept of inflation. Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, leading to a decrease in purchasing power over time. It’s typically measured as an annual percentage increase in the consumer price index (CPI) or the producer price index (PPI).
Inflation occurs due to various factors, including:




Monetary policy: Central banks control inflation through monetary policy tools such as interest rates and money supply. Increasing the money supply can lead to inflation as more money chases the same amount of goods and services;



Demand-pull inflation: When aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, prices tend to rise. This often occurs during periods of strong economic growth or excessive government spending;



Cost-push inflation: Rising production costs, such as wages or raw materials, can lead to increased prices for goods and services.

About Bitcoin (BTC)
Bitcoin homepage. Source: bitcoin.org
Often touted as digital gold, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a decentralized network using blockchain technology, which ensures transparency, security, and immutability of transactions.
Bitcoin’s proponents argue that its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it immune to inflationary pressures that plague traditional fiat currencies. Unlike government-issued currencies, BTC has a maximum supply cap of 21 million coins, making it inherently deflationary.
Bitcoin price today





As of May 17, 2024, the price of Bitcoin is over $65,621.

Can Bitcoin hedge against inflation?
To assess whether Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against inflation, let’s examine some of its key properties:


Limited supply: With only 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist, Bitcoin’s supply is capped, making it immune to inflation caused by excessive money printing;



Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers, making it resistant to government manipulation or interference, which can contribute to inflation;



Store of value: Proponents argue that Bitcoin’s digital scarcity and growing adoption make it a viable store of value similar to gold, which has a history as a hedge against inflation;



Volatility: Bitcoin’s price has been highly volatile, experiencing significant fluctuations over short periods. While some view this volatility as a barrier to its effectiveness as a hedge, others see it as a potential opportunity for gains during inflationary periods.

Bitcoin vs. traditional assets
To better understand Bitcoin’s potential as an inflation hedge, let’s compare it to traditional assets such as gold and government bonds:

What is the inflation rate of gold vs Bitcoin?

The inflation rate of gold, determined by the annual increase in the above-ground gold supply through mining, typically ranges from 1.5% to 2%. In contrast, Bitcoin’s inflation rate is inherently controlled by its protocol through halving. Approximately every four years, the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is halved, reducing the rate at which new BTCs are introduced into circulation.

Pros and cons of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge





Limited supply: Bitcoin’s capped supply protects it from inflationary pressures;

Decentralization: Its decentralized nature protects against government manipulation;

Potential for high returns: Bitcoin’s volatility can lead to significant gains during inflationary periods.






Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility may deter some investors seeking stability;

Regulatory uncertainty: Regulatory changes or government crackdowns could affect Bitcoin’s value;

Adoption challenges: Despite growing acceptance, Bitcoin still faces hurdles in mainstream adoption and acceptance as a hedge.



The bottom line: Can Bitcoin hedge against inflation?
While Bitcoin possesses several attributes that make it an attractive candidate for hedging against inflation, its effectiveness remains a subject of debate. While its limited supply and decentralized nature provide inherent protections against inflationary pressures, its volatility and regulatory uncertainties pose challenges.
Ultimately, whether Bitcoin can effectively hedge against inflation depends on various factors, including its adoption as a store of value, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions. As such, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives before allocating funds to Bitcoin or any other asset class.

This Crypto, Pumping 12% On New Asset Tokenization Milestone, Is 'An Opportunity Of A Lifetime,' Says Analyst - Benzinga

Popular cryptocurrency trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe raised his bullish bets on Chainlink LINK/USD after the coin outperformed the broader market with double-digit gains. What Happened: Van de Poppe called LINK as the "opportunity of a lifetime" reacting to a notable development in the coin's ecosystem.Chainlink, the parent blockchain of the cryptocurrency, announced the successful completion of of pilot project in partnership with The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation and several of the top U.S. banks to bring capital markets on blockchain rails and boost the asset tokenizing economy.The pilot project tested how to disseminate mutual funds data to any private/public blockchain using Chainlink's interoperability feature.Price Action: Reacting to the development, LINK surged more than 12% in the last 24 hours, trading at $15.68 at the time of publication, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Notably, LINK's large transaction volume jumped 141% in the past 24 hours on this announcement, according to IntoTheBlock. Additionally, balances of long-term holders increased 0.26%, signaling an intent to accumulate the cryptocurrency. Why It Matters: For the curious, tokenization of real-world assets was emerging as the next big thing in blockchain technology, with the industry having $6.68 billion in total locked as of this writing, according to DeFiLlama.Think of it as simply the process of bringing off-chain assets like bonds, real estate, commodities, and much more onto blockchains,  resulting in a variety of options for both traditional and decentralized finance.Chainlink, acting as the bridge between off-chain and on-chain worlds, holds the key for narrative.Read Next: Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian Highlights Democrats, Including Chuck Schumer, Who Crossed Party Line To Support Pro-Crypto Law

Nuklai Partners with Peaq: Smart Data Solutions for DePINs - Coin Edition


							

On-chain smart data platform collaborates with peaq, layer blockchain infrastructure.
Nuklai addresses data availability, its effective use, and fair data monetization.
Secure and seamless flow of reliable data is the lifeblood of the entire IoT sector: CEO of Nuklai.




Nuklai, the world’s first on-chain smart data platform designed to transform data sharing and AI model training, declared a new collaboration with Peaq, a key layer-1 blockchain space for DePIN and Machine RWAs. DePINs connected to Peaq gain access to Nuklai’s smart data infrastructure, curated data sets, as well as tools for equitable data monetization.



The integration comes at a time of high demand, as shown by the exponential growth in IoT devices. The global device count, which reached 15.1 billion in 2023, is projected to increase to 19.08 billion by 2025, producing a massive 73.1 zettabytes of data annually. Yet, a Techreport survey reveals that 97% of companies struggle to extract actionable insights from this wealth of information, indicating a significant gap between data availability and its effective use.



Fair data monetization is another issue the union is designed to address. In April, Nuklai launched a significant collaboration with Farmsent, a global Web3 marketplace for farmers, which became the first use case of a DePIN on peaq to leverage this integration. 



According to Nuklai, farmers play a critical role as major data producers: DePPs collect a treasure trove of farmer data, from the farmer’s input into the food supply chain to weather impact data to product details. However, historically, they have seen their data collected and sold by IoT providers, often without receiving any benefits — an issue that stretches far beyond the agricultural sector.



Nuklai addresses both challenges by creating an on-chain smart data ecosystem, focused on optimizing the processes of sharing, requesting, evaluating, and monetizing data. By upgrading raw data into higher quality smart data and offering a wide array of data tools, Nuklai aims to enhance production efficiency and predictive data analytics across industries. 



Founder and CEO of Nuklai, Matthijs de Vries stated “Secure and seamless flow of reliable data is the lifeblood of the entire IoT sector. This is why I’m excited that Nuklai’s smart data infrastructure now integrates with Peaq’s ecosystem of DePIN innovators. Furthermore, Vries stated that their joint work on Farmsent is shaping up to be a very promising early use case.

$2.1 Billion Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Expire After US CPI Data


Today, $2.1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options will be liquidated. The expiration of these crypto options contracts is particularly interesting, given that it will happen after the US core consumer price index (CPI) data has been released.
How will this impact the prices of these digital assets and the broader crypto market volatility?
How Does the Recent US Inflation Data Affect the Crypto Options Market?

Approximately $1.18 million in 18,183 Bitcoin options contracts will expire. The tranche is very similar to the 18,359 contracts settled last week.
Deribit data indicates that Bitcoin’s put-to-call ratio is 0.62. This figure suggests a prevalence of purchase options (calls) over sales options (puts).
Furthermore, the data shows that Bitcoin’s maximum pain point is $63,000. The maximum pain point is the price at which the asset will cause financial losses to the greatest number of holders.

In addition to Bitcoin options, 321,925 Ethereum contracts will expire today. These expiring contracts have a notional value of over $940 million, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.27 and a pain point of $3,000.

Greeks.live, a tools provider for crypto options traders, shared its perspective on today’s expiring options contracts. It assessed the impact of the release of US inflation data on the crypto options market.

“The options market reacted significantly, with all major term [implied volatilities] IVs pulling up quickly to new highs for the month, with the recent flat market causing major term options IV to drop to new lows at one point this year, thus making them extremely cost effective for buyers, with every recent event driver worth buying options for,” Greeks.live noted.


BeInCrypto reported earlier that the April CPI figure suggests that US inflation grew slower. This news positively affected the crypto market.
Shortly after the data release, Bitcoin’s price jumped from $62,000 to $66,000. Major altcoins like Ethereum and Solana (SOL) also experienced significant gains.

While option expirations can cause sharp price movements, the impact is usually temporary. The market generally stabilizes the next day, offsetting initial fluctuations. Nonetheless, traders should carefully analyze technical indicators and market sentiment before investing in this volatile environment.

Opportunity? Crypto expert predicts ‘one last nuke’ for XRP


As many assets in the cryptocurrency sector near the week’s end on a positive note, XRP seems to be one of them, albeit recording only minor advances often mixed with sudden drops, and one crypto expert believes that the popular token is about to make one last dip before bullish recovery.
Specifically, pseudonymous crypto trading analyst CoinsKid observed that XRP could go through “one last nuke” toward $0.4018 as part of its five-wave price action with bullish divergence before a massive recovery to $0.7478, as he explained in his X post shared on May 16.

At the same time, the crypto market analyst believes that such a price action would offer an opportunity to “go all in at that point,” in other words, to buy XRP at a low price but also referring to his viewpoint as a potential “bear hopium,” suggesting irrational or unwarranted optimism.


XRP price analysis
Meanwhile, XRP was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.52256, which represents an increase of 0.24% in the last 24 hours, as it grew its value by 1% across the previous seven days and a slightly higher 4.03% on its monthly chart, as per data on May 17.

At the same time, it is worth noting that XRP whales are already taking the opportunity to accumulate more of the token at the center of the widely publicized courtroom standoff between blockchain company Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Indeed, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has recently noticed a significant accumulation from addresses with a balance between 1 million and 10 million XRP in the previous 15 days, their total holdings growing by 110 million XRP in a yearly high and bullish divergence.

Donald Trump's Crypto-Friendly Stance Genuine Or Opportunistic?

                        Presidential candidate Donald Trump recently expressed his backing for crypto, indicating that he would cease hostility towards crypto in the US if he were to be re-elected.“If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be.” He also told the audience that if they like crypto, “you better vote for Trump.”Previously, Trump openly criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In July 2019, he described them as “not money” and condemned their volatility and absence of intrinsic value. Additionally, he contended that these assets could facilitate illegal activities such as drug trafficking.Crypto’s Role in Shaping Voter Preferences
According to Coinbase, about 20% of American adults, or over 50m individuals, claim to hold crypto. Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, said that this substantial figure has undoubtedly captured the attention of the candidates.“To embrace crypto and solid crypto regulation is a good election strategy and clever policy more generally,” he said. “Absolutely, a sizable number of people in the crypto community will vote for Trump based on his seemingly positive approach towards the industry.”Meanwhile, Jonathan Thomas, CEO of prime brokerage Blueberry, asserted that Trump’s crypto-friendly stance will influence voters prioritizing crypto as a single-issue matter.“This is an aspect that some people hold dear to their hearts, and will vote for which candidate supports their bias,” he said. His crypto-friendly talk will resonate with crypto enthusiasts, but only if it doesn’t clash with other issues they care about even more, he added.Skepticism Surrounding Donald Trump’s Crypto Advocacy
NFT enthusiast Thorne Melcher labeled Trump’s recent endorsement as “flimsy.” She noted it marks a significant departure from his previous negative remarks.“Given crypto’s potential to facilitate the purchase of trans hormone replacement therapy, abortions, and drugs circumventing politics pushed by conservatives, it only feels like a matter of time before they involve it in their authoritarian crackdowns,” she said.However, she noted that this doesn’t imply that Biden is favorable towards cryptocurrency. Yet, supporting Trump solely for the sake of crypto doesn’t seem to offer substantial benefits, and Trump himself is unlikely to gain much electoral support solely by endorsing it.Trump’s Strategy to Woo Crypto Voters Away from Biden
Once a crypto skeptic, Trump has now become a full-fledged NFT enthusiast. He actively participates in the market, even selling over $1m worth of NFTs, some featuring his mugshot.According to Stephanie Vaughan, co-founder of DeFi firm Veda, it’s evident that many individuals within the crypto community are inclined to support Trump or refrain from supporting Biden.“I think that during the last election, there were probably a lot of crypto-focused voters who voted for Biden. Because, at that time, it wasn’t clear that he would take such a hardline approach against the industry,” she said.“It’s clear now, however, that regulation by enforcement is the stance taken by the Biden Administration. And this is totally unworkable for a very large number of people who work in the industry or who are generally favorable towards it.”She said that Trump acknowledges crypto’s emergence as a significant factor for a considerable portion of voters in the upcoming election. Consequently, he’s making concerted efforts to attract them away from Biden.

JPMorgan Names Key Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Won't Rally Hard


Banking giant JPMorgan does not expect the price of Bitcoin to experience a substantial rally. Any potential upside will be "limited" due to waning demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Moreover, JPMorgan cited the failure of Hong Kong's cryptocurrency ETF to support its rather cautious stance.  According to Bloomberg, the extremely underwhelming performance of crypto ETFs has put a dent in Hong Kong's crypto hub ambitions. The products, which debuted just two weeks ago, are already suffering from outflows. For comparison, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw enormous demand following their launch, with BlacRock's IBIT breaking multiple records.  The estimated mining cost The largest US bank has also estimated that the cost of mining one coin currently stands at $45,000 following the most recent halving event. JPMorgan has noted that a post-halving drop in the hashrate has been delayed by the rather short-lived success of the Runes protocol that pushed Bitcoin fees significantly higher. The top cryptocurrency is currently trading at $66,412 on the Bitstamp exchange.

Bitcoin: the mining farm in China closed by Biden will pass to the Americans

A few days ago, the US president Joe Biden prevented a Chinese company from building a Bitcoin mining farm near a nuclear missile base in Wyoming.
The decision was related to national security concerns linked to the proximity of the plant to an important military installation, as the ownership of the mining farm would have been indirectly linked to China. 
Yesterday, however, it was discovered that this same company, MineOne, had meanwhile sold the land to another Bitcoin mining company, this time American. 

Biden’s initiative: China’s Bitcoin mining farm passes to Americans
The American president opposed the construction of a Bitcoin mining farm within one mile of the Cheyenne military base using the powers of CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States).
Thanks to these powers, he was able to prevent the acquisition of the land by a company linked to China (MineOne). 
It is already the eighth time that Biden uses the powers of CFIUS to prevent acquisitions and activities related to China in the USA, so it was not an initiative against Bitcoin mining.
The problem was only the ties of the acquiring company with China, and obviously the proximity to the Cheyenne military base in Wyoming, where intercontinental ballistic missiles Minuteman III (ICBM) are housed.
This suggests that Biden should not oppose the construction of the mining farm in case the ownership is American.
The turning point
Yesterday it was discovered that actually, a few days before the block imposed by Biden, the land on which the Cheyenne mining farm should be built was purchased by an American mining company, CleanSpark, listed on the Nasdaq with the ticker CLSK. 
In the official announcement, CleanSpark states that it has reached an agreement to acquire 75 MW of Bitcoin mining sites in Wyoming for a total of 18.75 million dollars.
The company claims to have entered into definitive agreements for the acquisition of two sites for Bitcoin mining in Wyoming, with 75 MW of power already available and expandable by another 55 MW.
One of these would be the website owned by MineOne near the Cheyenne military base blocked by Biden. 
The curious thing is that the sale agreement to the American company Cheyenne would have taken place less than a week before the block imposed by Biden.
Although it is only an agreement, with the sale not yet concluded, Biden’s block sounds a bit strange. 
Indeed, one could also imagine that the president knew nothing about this agreement, but perhaps it is more likely that his initiative was actually aimed at forcing MineOne to accept the sale agreement to the American company CleanSpark. 
CleanSpark, on the other hand, has stated that they are not aware of the block, and that they are still willing to proceed with the acquisition. 
CleanSpark
CleanSpark owns and operates eight different data centers in the southern United States, with a total of almost 400 MW. Of these, 50 MW are located in a data center in the state of New York, to which the 75 MW already available in Wyoming will be added, along with another 55 MW on the new site. 
The two new Wyoming facilities will add more than 7 EH/s to CleanSpark’s hashrate, while the company had previously purchased three other Bitcoin mining sites in Mississippi with a total hashrate of 2.4 EH/s. 
Actually, CleanSpark is one of the largest BTC miners in North America. 
The CEO, Zach Bradford, stated: 
“Just three months ago we made the leap and expanded into Mississippi. Today I am pleased to share that we are continuing our journey with our expansion westward into Wyoming. Diversifying our portfolio is an integral part of our strategy and we are well positioned to take advantage of similar acquisitions in the wake of the halving”. 
The price of CLSK shares on the stock market has been trading sideways since mid-February. 
The absolute peak was reached in 2018, and in 2021 it briefly surpassed $42.
During the bear-market of 2022 there was a real crash, which brought the price down to below $2, but between 2023 and 2024 there was a rebound. 
Last year, the price of CLSK shares returned above $10, and this year it has pushed up to over $24 in March. 
Since then it has dropped below $17, which is much higher than the bottom of the bear market, but still significantly lower than the highs of 2021. 
It is worth noting that CleanSpark is valued at around 3.7 billion dollars on the stock exchange, while for example Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), the benchmark for US Bitcoin mining companies, is valued at almost 5.4 billion dollars. The other major competitor, Riot Platform (RIOT), is valued at less than 3 billion.

                        The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) China President recently shared insights on the challenges and solutions for cross-border central bank digital currency (CBDC) interoperability.In an interview with 21st Century Business Herald, Wen Yang addressed the fragmentation in CBDC systems due to varying technological paths and standards among different economies, highlighting the organization’s effort to bridge technical gaps.CBDCs Face Cross-Border Challenges
According to the report, over 130 economies are now exploring CBDCs, with nearly 70% of central banks expecting to issue them within the next decade. However, the rapid development could lead to potential “data silos” where systems are unable to communicate with one another.“Currently, there are significant differences in the technological paths and standards, including protocols, among economies, which presents a ‘fragmentation’ challenge and leads to ‘data silos’,” said Yang.“To date, 11 countries have fully launched their CBDCs, while others are in later stages of development,” said Yang.China’s digital yuan has seen implementation across various applications, while the European Central Bank is in the process of preparing for a digital Euro. In India, commercial banks handle one million digital rupee transactions daily across the country.Sandbox Second Phase to Explore Solutions
Swift launched the second phase of its CBDC sandbox in July 2023, focusing on complex use cases in digital trade, digital assets, and foreign exchange networks for CBDC payments and settlements.“The project lasted six months and involved 38 financial institutions from around the world, including regulators, commercial banks, and market infrastructures, involving applications of seven different CBDCs,” said Yang.Yang also emphasized the importance of interoperability in cross-border CBDC use. The sandbox results reaffirmed SWIFT’s proposal to simplify digital transactions while allowing financial institutions to continue utilizing their existing infrastructures.“Tests on the interaction between digital trade platforms and CBDC networks using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts have proven technically feasible for automating trade payments,” stated Yang.He indicated that Swift plans to expand its CBDC connector solution to test more extensive use cases in a comprehensive environment. This would include enhancing support for on-chain forex settlements and cross-border payments, addressing growing market demands.

NFT Buyer Sues Dolce & Gabbana Over Value Loss


							

Dolce & Gabbana NFT Lawsuit: Buyer Sues Over Value Drop



Fashion Brand Sued: NFT Collection Value Plummets 



Suit claims company mismanagement caused value erosion




A customer in the Southern District of New York has sued luxury fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana USA Inc., alleging the fashion house mismanaged a collection of NFTs, leading to a significant decline in their value.



The lawsuit, filed by Luke Brown, as reported by Bloomberg, centers on the DGFamily NFTs, which were marketed as offering a combination of digital wearables, physical goods, and exclusive experiences. Mr Brown had paid nearly $6,000 for the DGFamily NFTs that lost 97% of their value.Dolce & Gabbana marketed these NFTs as providing a mix of digital, physical, and experiential benefits.



Mr. Brown’s complaint contends that Dolce & Gabbana failed to deliver on these promises. The lawsuit alleges delays in receiving the NFTs and associated benefits, with the digital wearables only usable on a niche metaverse platform that had limited user engagement.









Additionally, the complaint claims Dolce & Gabbana neglected to secure proper approvals from the platform, further delaying access for token holders. The lawsuit argues that this pattern of unfulfilled promises reflects a broader issue with the DGFamily NFT project.



Mr. Brown accuses the company of abandoning the project and its community after failing to deliver on its initial commitments.

                        The Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), France’s local financial commission, has reminded investors in a warning note published Thursday, to refrain from trading crypto platform, ByBit.ByBit, which is one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, scored significant growth in the recent past. The exchange hit 20 million registered users after 5 years of operation in 2023.However, the exchange has been under scrutiny in France for its lack of non-compliance with current regulations. As a result, the French regulator blacklisted the platform in 20 May 2022.“ByBit is not authorized to provide its digital asset services in France,” the notice read.“In this regard, the AMF is urging French retail investors who have invested on this platform to take all necessary measures to avoid being unable to access their assets.”Further, AMF stressed that ByBit did not receive a digital asset service provider (DASP) license in France. The regulator has the right to take legal action to block the platform’s website, it added.“Unregistered platforms providing these services in France are illegal under French law,” AMF reiterated.In a similar tone, the AMF also warned investors against Bitget crypto exchange last month. It reminded users about the platform’s blacklisting in November 2023.Hong Kong Added ByBit Among “Suspicious Crypto Exchanges”
In March, Hong Kong’s markets regulator added ByBit to its list of suspicious cryptocurrency exchanges. It also placed several of the crypto exchange’s products on its suspicious investment products list.The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) noted that investors risk losing their entire investment and that it will not hesitate to take enforcement action.According to a ByBit’s spokesperson, the exchange has been maintaining “a close dialogue with regulators around the world including HK” and is striving to comply with all necessary regulations.“Since different products are listed for various regions to meet local compliance requirements, you can be confident that these products are not available in the HK market,” a source reavealed earlier.

Solana leads as the fastest among large-scale blockchains â CoinGecko - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Research from CoinGecko says that Solana is the fastest among large-scale blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) reaching a record high of 1,504 on April 6, 2023 as the meme coin mania took off. Such a statistic makes Solana roughly 46 times faster than Ethereum, and 5 times faster than Polygon.To determine the fastest blockchains, CoinGecko’s study analyzed the processing speed of the top 30 blockchains based on their total value locked (TVL) ranking on DefiLlama as of May 15, 2024. Processing speed was measured using the actual or realized transactions per second (TPS) metric, calculated as a daily average to ensure a standardized comparison across as many blockchains as possible.CoinGecko claims the highest real TPS values reported in the study may differ from other calculations because these use daily averages. The TPS data was sourced from publicly available information provided by the respective blockchain explorers and Dune Analytics. However, some blockchains, including Hyperliquid, PulseChain, Kava, Cardano, and Rootstock, were excluded from the study due to a lack of sufficient data.FindingsDespite ranking as the fastest blockchain, Solana has still only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS, CoinGecko claims. The surging number of transactions resulted in network congestion, and it remains to be seen how quickly Solana can record higher real TPS after its upcoming upgrades.The second-fastest blockchain is another non-EVM, Sui, which recorded its highest real TPS of 854 in July 2023 as onchain game Sui 8192 gained popularity. Other fast blockchains among the non-EVMs include TON at 175 TPS and Near Protocol at 118 TPS. Altogether, the 8 non-EVM large blockchains have an average peak TPS of 284, making them 3.9 times faster than the 17 largest EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains, which realized an average of just 74 TPS.Among the EVM blockchains, BNB Smart Chain (BSC) achieved 378 in real TPS on December 7, 2023, amid the inscriptions-driven surge in onchain activity. This makes BSC the fastest blockchain among EVMs, despite only ranking third overall and reaching less than half of Sui’s realized processing speed.Similarly, the inscriptions craze allowed Polygon to record 190 in real TPS on November 16, 2023, making it the fastest among the largest Ethereum scaling solutions and 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself.Ethereum and its ten largest scaling solutions registered a total real TPS of 500, placing their combined processing speed ahead of BSC but still slower than Solana and Sui.Almost all of the 25 blockchains experienced their highest real TPS over the last one year, pointing to onchain activity increasing and reaching higher levels in recent months, led by inscriptions and meme coin speculation.

Binance Kazakhstan Earns Security Certifications, Hosts Successful Meetup


							

Binance hosted a meetup in Kazakhstan, attracting over 700 attendees



Binance Kazakhstan had earlier secured ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 certifications from British Standards Institution



The meetup and security certifications highlight Binance Kazakhstan’s efforts to foster a thriving Web3 ecosystem in the region




Binance hosted its first major community meetup of 2024 in Kazakhstan on May 14, attracting over 700 attendees, according to a company announcement. The event, held at the Presidential Center in Astana, offered participants a chance to connect with fellow Web3 enthusiasts and learn about the latest developments in the decentralized web space.







In an earlier announcement, Binance drew the community’s attention to the event schedule. Inviting every member to the grand event, Binance wrote,




 “We are pleased to announce another big event in Kazakhstan – Binance Super Meetup, which will take place on May 14, 2024 in Astana. We invite all our users from Kazakhstan to participate in the Binance Super Meetup, organized by the Binance team.”




According to the announcement, the event was scheduled at the Presidential Center (Grand Ballroom), 1A Alikhan Bokeikhanova Street, Astana, from 15:30 to 20:00, per the local time. The platform provided free entry to the event, and the participants were required to complete pre-registration and present a printed or electronic ticket.



The meetup capped off a period of positive news for Binance Kazakhstan. On May 13, the company announced it had secured the ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 certifications, demonstrating its commitment to robust information security and privacy management practices. The certifications were awarded by the British Standards Institution (BSI) following a rigorous audit.



The British Standards Institution (BSI) awarded Binance Kazakhstan these globally recognized certificates following a meticulous audit. Vishal Sacheendran, Head of Regional Markets at Binance, acknowledged the achievement as a demonstration of the platform’s adherence to high standards of security and privacy, two features that he believes are characteristic of a trustworthy company.

Pump.fun exploiter doxxed himself then took credit with bizarre tweets


Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform that promises you can ‘launch a coin that is instantly tradeable’ was exploited for approximately $2 million worth of Solana by a hacker who seemed to subsequently promise to distribute the exploited funds to other Solana users.
According to pump.fun, “the TVL in the protocol right now is safe” and “if you have ever connected your wallet to http://pump.fun, your wallet is safe.”
An X (formerly Twitter) user with the username STACCoverflow, who has previously posted images suggesting their name is Jarett Reginald S Dunn, appears to have taken credit for the exploit in a series of unusual posts.

In this series of tweets, he claims that the exploited funds will end up being distributed to people who hold other tokens.
Various users on X have claimed to receive distributions but it’s not clear what criteria are being used to distribute the tokens.
The exploit took advantage of flash loans to quickly overwhelm certain bonding curves on the platform.

A review of the pump.fun website doesn’t appear to include security audits for the contracts that were exploited or the contracts that were deployed to replace them.

Notcoin in focus as KangaMoon excites with bonus sale - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Notcon (NOT) token’s price fell sharply after its debut on exchanges.
KangaMoon (KANG) is offering a bonus presale stage ahead of first CEX listing.

Analysts say the lackluster spot Bitcoin ETFs market means Bitcoin prices could see limited upside action in coming weeks and months. 
What does this mean for newly-launched Notcoin and could KangaMoon offer a better investment opportunity?
Notcoin dumps after airdrop
Notcoin (NOT) is the native token of a tap-to-earn game project that aims to onboard millions of users to Web3.
The project went viral amid its debut on Telegram, and saw massive hype ahead of its trading debut this week. Much of this was down to listing announcements from top crypto exchanges Binance, OKX and Bybit among others.
Indeed, Notcoin traded at a Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) of $1 billion as the token made its debut across exchanges. However, NOT price has tanked 67% since and currently trades around $0.006753.
Binance’s cancelling of support for the NOT/BTC pair also added to the downside pressure. 
Notcoin is however likely to record a decent bounce if the broader gaming ecosystem picks up new traction following a dismal 2024. Bitcoin‘s performance could also add to the dynamics.
KangaMoon emerging as top meme-inspired cryptocurrency
The meme coin space has seen some big moves for Solana, BNB Chain and Ethereum meme tokens. 
While a few meme coins exhibit massive growth potential, most others are largely weak copycats that derive momentum from nothing but hype.
Utility sets KangaMoon apart from most of these other meme coins. 
As a project, KangaMoon integrates GameFi and Play-To-Earn (P2E). There’s also a SocialFi element that means users can earn more as they interact, share and connect.
The native in-game currency and network reward token when the P2E game launches will be KANG. Presale participants can earn KANG right away by joining in challenges and contests – a factor that already sees KangaMoon boast a growing community of users.
Is KangaMoon a better opportunity?
KangaMoon (KANG) is one of the tokens expected to dominate the meme coin market. The project’s presale has so far raised more than $6.7 million.
KangaMoon’s smart contract has been audited by both Solid Proof and InterFi, a fact that adds to the confidence crypto enthusiasts and investors are showing in this project.
After rallying through the presale stages, KangaMoon is now offering those who might have missed out another chance with a bonus sale round. The current KANG price in this phase is $0.025.
As the limited bonus round quickly sells out, this might be a great time to join the community. 
KangaMoon’s rigorous audits and team transparency are also positive factors, as is news that KANG is poised for its CEX listing debut on BitMart.
Compared to other meme coins, KangaMoon’s community-driven P2E game focus and utility stand out. The project’s total supply of 1 billion KANG also means it has the potential to explode higher amid market demand.
Investors however need to take into account other market dynamics and conditions.
You can learn more about KangaMoon here.

Shiba Inu's Lead Developer Shytoshi Kusama Lauds Team Behind ShibaSwap's Integration With Shibarium Network: 'So Much More In Store' - Benzinga

Shytoshi Kusama, the mysterious lead developer of the Shiba Inu SHIB/USD project, lauded the work of the team instrumental in bringing the ecosystem's decentralized exchange ShibaSwap to the layer-2 network, Shibarium. What Happened: In a post on social platform X, the pseudonymous personality, also believed to be the co-founder of Shiba Inu, wrote that he is proud of the efforts put in by the team in linking the two of the ecosystem's biggest platforms. Kusama had a special word of appreciation for Kaal Dhairya, a key developer in the Shiba Inu ecosystem."So proud of the improvements and innovations @kaaldhairya and the team have made while bringing ShibaSwap to Shibarium."In what could be a signal of more such developments in the ecosystem, Kusama added, "So much more in store as we march forward. Stay tuned #SHIBARMY!"Kaal Dhairya responded to Kusama's celebratory post and assured the SHIB community that new enhancements and updates would be shipped regularly going forward. "It's not a race it's a marathon," the developer remarked.Why It Matters: ShibaSwap, which launched in July 2021, has been operating as a DEX on the Ethereum ETH/USD blockchain, providing services such as staking, liquidity pools, and yield farming.With the latest development, the DEX went multichain, allowing users to swap tokens across both chains, thereby managing liquidity in a much better way. Shibaswap’s launch also provided a solid use case for Shibarium–a planned endeavor by Shiba Inu to rise above its memecoin image and add more value to the tokens associated with the ecosystem.Price Action: At the time of writing, SHIB was exchanging hands at $0.00002489, down 2.91% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian Highlights Democrats, Including Chuck Schumer, Who Crossed Party Line To Support Pro-Crypto LawImage via CryptoFX on Shutterstock

Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs Continued for the Fourth Day in a Row! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reported a significant net inflow of $257.34 million on Thursday, marking the fourth day of positive inflows. This ongoing trend highlights growing investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin ETFs.
US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Inflows for the Fourth Day in a Row, Totaling $257 Million
Leading the inflows was BlackRock's IBIT, which injected $94 million into the fund, making it the largest recipient of new capital among its peers.


According to SoSoValue data, IBIT had experienced minimal to no flows in the previous three weeks, and this increase was particularly notable. Fidelity's FBTC fund attracted $67 million in investments, while Ark Invest and 21Shares' Bitcoin ETF reported net inflows of $62 million.
Grayscale's GBTC, which has mostly seen large outflows since its conversion in January, recorded daily net inflows of $4.64 million on Thursday.






Valkyrie's Bitcoin ETF also saw significant activity, with $18.5 million in inflows. Other funds from Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Invesco and Galaxy Digital reported single-digit inflows.
The consecutive net inflows into 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US come in the middle of Wall Street's first quarter 13F reporting season.


Major financial players announced their stakes in these funds and the results exceeded many expectations. BlackRock's IBIT fund, in particular, reported a record 414 holders in its first 13F season.
“Even having 20 owners as a newborn is a big deal, it's pretty rare,” Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented on Thursday.

This is Ripple's Most Important Exec, According to the Company's CTO


																TL;DR

Ripple CTO David Schwartz considers this co-founder the most important person in the company’s history for his early commitment, among other reasons.
Attorney John E Deaton believes CEO Brad Garlinghouse has played a crucial role in the firm’s legal successes and should be labeled “CEO of the decade” if the firm goes public.


Who is Ripple’s Most Valuable Member?
David Schwartz – chief technology officer at Ripple – recently allowed X users to shoot him with all sorts of questions. One person asked him who was the most important person in Ripple’s history as he could only point one from five choices: Jed McCaleb (CTO of the firm until 2013), Schwartz himself, Chris Larsen (Executive Chairman), Brad Garlinghouse (CEO), or others.
The current chief technology officer picked Larsen because of his commitment to the idea when that “was hard to do.” He also admitted that the Executive Chairman “really believed” in Ripple’s potential “well before” him.
Chris Larsen is one of the co-founders of Ripple Labs – the fintech company behind Ripple and the XRP Ledger. He served as the firm’s CEO until 2016, when he brought on Brad Garlinghouse to take the helm. 
Larsen took a blow in December 2020 when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a legal action against Ripple, Garlinghouse, and himself. The regulator accused them of raising over $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. 




However, the watchdog dropped charges against the executives in October 2023. This represented Ripple’s third partial court victory, which, according to some, positioned the agency as the underdog in the lawsuit.
The legal spat recently entered its trial phase, with both parties presenting necessary documents and abiding by the magistrates’ rules. Earlier this month, the American lawyer Jeremy Hogan claimed that the briefs stage had been completed, and now the entities must wait for the judge’s ruling.
Garlinghouse’s Contribution to Ripple’s Advancement
According to John E Deaton (a well-known US attorney who stands behind thousands of XRP investors in the case against the SEC), Brad Garlinghouse should be put on the pedestal. He thinks the CEO has played the biggest role in Ripple’s achievements in the legal field. 
Deaton went further, suggesting that Garlinghouse must be included in “the shortlist for CEO of the decade” if the company files for an initial public offering (IPO) in the next few years.

Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL) to Explode 13,000% as BitMart Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Baby Doge on Sol (DOGESOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because DOGESOL has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on BitMart.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Baby Doge on Sol can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Baby Doge on Sol could become the next viral memecoin.



Baby Doge on Sol launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Baby Doge on Sol on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the BitMart listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Baby Doge on Sol by entering its contract address – G5GEMyeea1HqS2KnpazPiMuTy3sqS1UdQegsbNLGpF7U – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGESOL.

Crypto theft in Solana's Pump.fun, crypto king arrested, and more... - AMBCrypto



Solana’s Pump.fun and Stacks-based ALEX suffered attacks worth millions 
United States’ DOJ also arrested two brothers linked to a $25M Ethereum exploit

Crypto-regulations and exploits have dominated market headlines this week. From Solana’s Pump.fun to Bitcoin’s L2 ecosystem, the exploits have siphoned millions of dollars. 
Solana’s memecoin launcher Pump.fun suffered an exploit on Thursday, leading to about $2 million in losses. This, according to the Head of Research at Wintermute – Igor Igamberdiev.
Surprisingly, the attack came just hours after the platform hit record-high revenues and surpassed Solana, its L1 blockchain security. 
According to Pump.fun, the platform was compromised by a former employee who claimed responsibility for the attack. Announcing the resumption of normal operations, the memecoin launcher soon revealed, 
“The pump.fun contracts are safe. They have always been safe. A former employee used their privileged position at the company to misappropriate ~12.3K SOL (~$1.9m)” 
More crypto hacks and arrests
Solana’s ecosystem wasn’t the only one to suffer an exploit yesterday. Another attack was recorded on Bitcoin’s ecosystem project ALEX — An automated liquidity exchange based on Stacks [STX], a BTC L2 scaling solution. 
Interestingly, the attack also involved a compromised private key, draining the protocol of several assets, including 13.7 million STX. 
The project recovered some funds and proposed asking Stacks to burn the accounts linked to the stolen STX funds. However, Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali declined the request, citing, 
“The ALEX private key compromise is unfortunate. There is no clarity contract issue or exploit, though.”
It remains to be seen how the rest of the lost funds at Pump.fun and ALEX will be recovered. 
In the meantime, some long-running crypto-crimes saw major charges and arrests. For instance, the U.S DoJ arrested two brothers for an alleged attack on the Ethereum network. Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno have been accused of stealing $25 million using sophisticated MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) bots. This episode marks the first DOJ lawsuit against MEV. 
Also, Canadian authorities recently arrested the controversial ‘Canadian crypto-king,’ Aiden Pleterski. Pleterski was allegedly running a crypto investment scam as recently as February, despite being petitioned for bankruptcy over a year ago over similar schemes that saw investors lose over $40 million. According to a report, Pleterski was arrested and charged with money laundering. However, he has now been released after bail.

Cryptocurrency Market Comeback? Stablecoins' Market Caps Show 25% Surge

The bounce we have witnessed this week on the cryptocurrency market has been validated by the growth of stablecoins' market capitalization. The growth of stable assets is a crucial indicator reflecting inflows into the industry and can be used as a gauge of external investors' sentiment.With crypto prices back on the rise, a good sign that this upward trend may continue would be if stablecoin market caps resume the growth they saw from mid-October to mid-April. During that period, the combined market caps of USDT, USDC, DAI, BUSD, USDP and TUSD soared by 25%. This increase supported rising trading volumes and indicated investors' willingness to keep their funds in cryptocurrencies instead of liquidating them. However, over the past four weeks, this growth in fiat-pegged crypto has flatlined. The combined market cap of the top six stablecoins has remained relatively stable, showing neither significant growth nor decline. This stagnation could be a crucial indicator of market sentiment moving forward.Pay attention to which direction these market caps go from here, as they will likely help foreshadow whether Bitcoin pushes toward a new all-time high or dips below $60,000 again. If stablecoin market caps start to rise again, they would suggest renewed confidence among investors and an influx of capital onto the crypto market.On the contrary, if these market caps begin to shrink, it could indicate that investors are pulling out of crypto and converting their holdings back into fiat, which is a negative sign for the market that will most likely lead to a substantial price correction and return below values we saw recently.

DTCC Successfully Creates Pilot to Send Data on Chainlink


The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has successfully completed the Smart NAV pilot, a collaborative effort involving ten market participants.
The pilot used Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability platform to deliver data on-chain and integrate it into various blockchain applications.

DTCC Develops a Pilot Using Chainlink 
The Smart NAV pilot marks a significant step forward in the digital transformation of financial services. By utilizing Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network, DTCC ensured secure and efficient transmission of NAV data. This data is a critical metric for mutual funds.
The system could disseminate and automate the data in real time while integrating access to historical data. Meanwhile, DTCC provides that data and acts as the “solution governor” in the chain where the data is under security.
Upon obtaining the data, the system transforms it from “legacy” file-based formats to a modern structure and includes it in a blockchain transaction. Chainlink’s CCIP then routes the delivery and takes responsibility for transmitting the message to relevant blockchain networks.
Likewise, the data will only be available for customer consumption through the pilot’s new computing methods. The DTCC explains that expanding capabilities start at a data dissemination point, where it transforms data to send to public or private blockchains.

DTCC’s initiative aligns with the broader trend of adopting blockchain technology to modernize financial infrastructures. The ability to seamlessly deliver data on-chain opens up numerous possibilities for tokenized assets, smart contracts, and other blockchain applications. This pilot serves as a proof of concept that trusted data can be effectively integrated into blockchain networks, setting a precedent for future innovations in the industry.

Bitcoin bridge XLink resurrection underway post $10M hack

XLink, an established Bitcoin blockchain bridge, is prepping a comeback after it shut down on May 15 after suffering a $10 million hack.XLink was the victim of a security breach involving its Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) endpoints. The XLink team first disclosed the breach in the early hours of May 15, which is now coming to a close on May 17 as the team prepares to resume normal operations.Source: XLink.btcThe attacker exploited compromised private keys via a phishing scheme, which allowed them to control the BSC and Ethereum endpoints and withdraw around $4.3 million without authorization. However, according to XLink, a white hat hacker soon recovered the stolen assets.Cointelegraph reached out to XLink for comment but didn't received a response by publication. “No endpoints other than BSC and Ethereum were affected by this exploit,” the company’s official statement said.Source: XLink.btcDespite the recovery on the BSC, approximately $5 million in mostly LunarCrush tokens remain locked on the Ethereum blockchain. However, the LunarCrush team is working closely with XLink to secure these funds — the majority of the $5 million has been “recovered or secured.”Another $5 million worth of funds are locked on Ethereum, mainly LunarCrush tokens. The @LunarCrush team, in close coordination with the XLink team, has implemented measures to secure those tokens.According to XLink, residual crypto funds worth around $500,000 are still locked on Ethereum, but a majority of the funds have been either recovered or secured.Related: $20M exploit cripples Sonne Finance, hacker in no mood for negotiationIn response to the initial incident, the XLink team reacted quickly, temporarily suspending all operations on the bridge to conduct a thorough investigation. The investigation was carried out collaboratively with the team’s security partners — including Ancilia — and their Binance team liaisons.Source: XLink.btcXLink has insisted that all users who interacted with the compromised contracts should revoke any approved spending limits. The team issued detailed instructions, and links were provided for ETH and BSC users to mitigate further risk to funds:“As we prepare to reopen XLink, it is urgent that Ethereum and BSC users check that their wallets have revoked access to the old compromised endpoint contracts. This step will assist in completely severing any connections with the compromised contract and mitigating any associated risks.”Users failing to do so remain at risk of losing their funds to the attacker.Another exploit recently hit pump.fun — a Solana memecoin creation tool — after it was claimed that a former employee took the firm for almost $2 million through a “bonding curve” attack. According to pump.fun, on May 16, the ex-employee took actions to compromise the protocol’s internal systems. The smart contracts have since been announced as “safe,” and victims of the incident will have “100% of [their] liquidity” restored. Magazine: UK cannabis millionaire’s legal ‘deals on wheels’ via crypto

Hong Kong's Spot Crypto ETFs Struggle as US Gains Ground


After roughly two weeks of trading, Hong Kong’s debut of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has failed to excite as expected.
Data shows a significant decrease in the total assets of six newly launched Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong. This drop highlights the challenges Hong Kong faces in the competitive crypto market.
Challenges Facing Hong Kong’s Ambitions as a Crypto Hub

According to SoSo Value data, the total net assets of Hong Kong’s spot Bitcoin ETFs fell from $247.72 million on April 30 to $231.05 million on May 16. The total net assets for Ethereum ETFs also dropped from $45.03 million to $40.29 million during the same period.
BeInCrypto reported earlier that China Asset Management, Bosera HashKey, and Harvest International each listed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong on April 30. These ETFs initially drew huge optimism due to their availability in foreign currencies, including US dollars and Renminbi (RMB).

Furthermore, these products are also accessible to international investors who meet local compliance standards. Therefore, many see these ETFs as diversification for Hong Kong’s stock market offerings.
These products also provide new investment opportunities for both professional and retail investors. However, mainland Chinese investors remain restricted from accessing Hong Kong’s spot crypto ETFs.
Despite its relatively modest performance, Hong Kong’s ETFs have attracted international partnerships. Earlier this month, MetaComp, a Singapore-based fintech companies, collaborated with Bosera and Harvest Global Investment to promote these ETFs globally.
At the same time, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs have been showing better performance. SoSo Value data shows a total net inflow of $257.34 million for US spot Bitcoin ETFs as of May 16. This marks the fourth consecutive day of positive flows.

Additionally, recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that institutional investors like Millennium Management and Susquehanna hold significant positions in US spot Bitcoin ETFs.
The disparity in performance highlights the vast difference in market sizes between Hong Kong and the US. A Hang Seng Investment Management report pointed out that as of August 2023, the combined ETF assets under management (AUM) in several Asia-Pacific markets, including Hong Kong, represented about 10% of the total ETF AUM in the US.

This figure suggests that while Asia-Pacific markets need to catch up to the US in scale and investor participation. However, analysts at Hang Seng Investment Management have suggested considerable potential for further expansion in the ETF market across the seven Asia Pacific markets.

“The fact that the ETF’s share as a percentage of market capitalization in the seven Asia Pacific markets is relatively low suggests that there is still ample room for further expansion. It also highlights the significant growth potential of the region as index investing continues to mature,” they wrote.

This situation might challenge Hong Kong’s attempts to position itself as a global crypto hub. Compared to the performance of its US counterparts, the lukewarm reception of its crypto ETFs highlights the need for strategic adjustments. Enhanced accessibility for broader international engagement might be crucial in revitalizing Hong Kong’s crypto ETF market and achieving its global aspirations.

Why Is The Crypto Market Up Today?


The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) is nearing the crucial resistance of $2.4 trillion, while Bitcoin is holding above $65,500. While the market has cooled down from the recent rally, it still exhibits bullish signs. Making the most of this is Chainlink, which has registered a 21% rise in the last few days.
In the news today:-

The US Senate overturned the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin No.121 (SAB 121) following a 60-38 vote reflecting bipartisan support against SEC’s crypto policies.
Solana meme coin Pump.fun drained of $2 million after an insider attack executed by disrupting token listings by manipulating bonding curves.

The Total Market Cap Stays Strong

Following the recent rally, the total market cap is cooling down but keeping above the reclaimed support of $2.3 trillion. However, the target for the crypto market remains at $2.4 trillion, a barrier that has not been breached for nearly a month.
In the past, this level has proven to be crucial support, and a flip of it would enable TOTAL to bounce back and observe further growth.

On the other hand, a fall through $2.3 trillion would bring TOTAL back to around the $2.2 trillion mark.
Bitcoin Price Shows Resilience

Bitcoin’s price shot up to $66,000 this week in accordance with the broader market cues. Following a minor correction, BTC is currently trading at $65,500 and will likely continue to stay above the crucial psychological support of $65,000.
This will keep the optimism among the investors alive regarding potential growth in the next few trading sessions.
Read More: Bitcoin Halving History: Everything You Need To Know
Bitcoin Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
Should Bitcoin price witness selling or profit-taking, the crypto asset could note a drawdown towards $63,000 and lower.

Chainlink Takes the Lead
Chainlink’s price noted an uptick, making LINK the best-performing asset in the past 24 hours. However, the altcoin rally has been going on for the past few days. Capitalizing on the broader market bullish cues, LINK observed a 21% rise in the last three days, bringing Chainlink to $15.
Currently, the altcoin is above the resistance of $15.6, trading at $15.7, inching closer to $16.

Read More: Chainlink (LINK) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030

If LINK holds above this support it could note further gains, however, a slip below the support of $15.6 could result in a drop to $14.4. This would erase over half of the growth observed in the last day.

Binance Helps Taiwan to Resolve $6.2M Crypto Fraud Case - DailyCoin


        

Binance has collaborated with a government to solve a crypto money laundering case.



The development follows a similar collaboration in India on May 1.



Binance said it will continue collaborating with law enforcement to promote a safe crypto industry.




The world’s largest crypto exchange by trade volume, Binance, has helped Taiwanese authorities resolve a criminal case involving illegal operators who allegedly facilitated scam groups’ laundering of millions through crypto.



The development comes after the crypto exchange collaborated with Indian authorities on May 1 to assist in seizing crypto assets worth about $10 million, linked to a case involving fraudulent online gaming app E-Nugget.



Resolving $6.2M Crypto Money Laundering Case



According to an announcement on May 17, Binance leveraged the expertise of its Financial Crimes Compliance (FCC) department to gather intelligence and provide “crucial insight” that helped Taiwanese authorities “detect potential suspects more effectively.”




“Upon request, Binance cooperated promptly, establishing a cross-border online meeting with the investigating officers and prosecutors, where Binance's seasoned FCC teams furnished valuable recommendations based on cryptocurrency flow analyses,” the announcement read.



The investigation’s findings unraveled an intricate web of illegal service providers who allowed fraud groups to launder money through crypto on their platforms. The groups allegedly used fake remittance proofs, customer conversation records, and falsified identity verification data “to appear legitimate.”



Following the revelation, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office indicted nine suspects and charged them with three counts, including aggravated fraud, violation of organized crime prevention regulations, and violation of the Money Laundering Control Act.



Commenting on the matter, Prosecutor Lo Wei-Yuan lauded Binance’s “active and ongoing collaboration” with Taiwanese authorities, underscoring the exchange’s commitment to counter financial crimes and foster a safe crypto industry.

Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe sells all his Bitcoin; Here’s why


Not long after declaring his ‘opportunity cost’ strategy, which involves selling all of his Bitcoin (BTC) possessions, renowned cryptocurrency expert Michaël van de Poppe followed up on his announcement, stating he has, indeed, sold all of his Bitcoin and explaining his reasoning.
As it happens, van de Poppe said his recent actions did not mean he lost his faith in the maiden crypto asset, nor that he expected it to be topped out for this cycle, nor that he had “become a complete believer in Gold,” according to a long X post explanation on May 16.
Ultimate goal: more Bitcoin
Quite the opposite – the professional crypto trader said he did this because he is “aiming to get more Bitcoin back later in the year,” considering “it’s a bull cycle,” and reiterating his earlier doubts regarding the traditional four-year cycle of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset.



“In the past week, we’ve seen that pension funds, insurance companies, and the biggest hedge funds of the U.S. have been allocating funds towards the Spot Bitcoin ETF. CME Group has announced a futures ETF to be launched, and sooner than later, we’ll be getting option based trading through which Bitcoin becomes a mature asset in the world.”

Therefore, he believes this would gradually reduce the simplicity of the four-year cycle and the impact of the halvings, “as institutions do care more about risk appetite in their portfolio combined with macroeconomic events,” and they will derisk amid liquidity drying up and the dollar strengthening.
Due to these factors, van de Poppe argues “this cycle is, relatively, the final easy cycle to make a lot of money through altcoins” in several ways, but he is choosing the riskiest one – trading “altcoins within the Web 3.0 ecosystem to get more Bitcoin,” where wrong timing could mean losing his BTC.
Why now?
As for his timing, he explained the world is becoming “about getting as much Bitcoin and Gold as you can. Hard assets. Salable assets, because [quantitative easing (QE)] will start sooner than later and inflation is killing your purchasing power, living standard and pleasure in life,” hence “Bitcoin is the outcome.”
Furthermore, “if you’re looking at previous cycles, you would suggest that the rotation from Bitcoin to the altcoins (around the halving) happens prior to the halving. This time it’s entirely different as the markets continued to show strength.”
On top of that, van de Poppe opined that the downward pressure on altcoins has been “unreasonably hard” and that “the upside can’t be denied,” as well as that “DePIN and RWA are going to be massive, more and more traditional companies are transitioning towards the Web 3.0 ecosystem,” which is why:

“It’s time to allocate yourself into this if you want to make a large return.”

Pros and cons
As he pointed out, this strategy could give him a “return of 300-900% in the coming 6-12 months in Bitcoin value,” or even “another 300-600% (…) if Bitcoin stabilizes through that period, (…) through which you could say that 900-4500% is the ballpark of a potential return for the coming 12-24 months in this super cycle.”
On the other hand, van de Poppe stressed that the downside of his bet could be “relatively huge,” as he is currently “down around 20% already in a matter of 1-2 weeks on the overall investment,” and that he could lose 50-80%, but that he was fine with that, “as I’ll find ways of continuing my life to generating income anyway.”
Bitcoin price analysis
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at the price of $66,110, which suggests a modest advance of 0.26% in the last 24 hours, a more significant gain of 4.80% across the previous seven days, and an accumulated advance of 4.37% on its monthly chart, as per data on May 17.

All things considered, Michaël van de Poppe’s strategy might make sense, but he is an experienced trader with full awareness of all the risks and downsides, so doing one’s own research is critical before attempting to emulate his practices, particularly as trends in this sector can change suddenly.

Chainlink (LINK) Shoots Up 19% Post DTCC Partnership Reveal | Coinspeaker



The surge in LINK price can be attributed to the announcement of the partnership between DTCC and the decentralized Oracle network. 

Chainlink (LINK) shot up by almost 19% in the past 24 hours following the announcement of its partnership with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a financial market infrastructure company based in the United States.
According to the data from CoinMarketCap, the price of LINK, the fifteenth largest crypto asset by market capitalization, has gone up by 19.24% as of 4:49  a.m. ET on Friday. The trading volume of the digital asset shot up by 224.15%, and its market capitalization stood at $9.72 billion.




LINK skyrocketed from $13.57 to $16.58, outperforming all the cryptocurrencies ranking below it, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB).
The surge in LINK price can be attributed to the announcement of the partnership between DTCC and the decentralized Oracle network.
Chainlink and DTCC Partnership
As per a report from DTCC, the team of Chainlink and the world’s largest settlement system completed a pilot program that also involved some of the leading banking institutions in the United States and aimed to increase traditional finance fund tokenization.
The pilot program, known as the Smart NAV Pilot program, was initiated to standardize net asset value (NAV) data spread across various blockchain networks while utilizing Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).
The pilot program revealed that by delivering structured data on-chain and establishing standardized roles and processes, foundational data can be integrated into a variety of on-chain applications. The report stated that these applications include tokenized funds and ‘bulk consumer’ smart contracts, which manage data for multiple funds, while adding:
“This capability can support future industry exploration and can power numerous downstream use cases as well, such as brokerage portfolio applications. Additional benefits include real-time, more automated data dissemination and built-in access to historical data.”
Further, the DTCC pointed out that these capabilities might support numerous downstream applications, such as brokerage services, automated data dissemination, and improved access to historical data for funds.
The crypto community on social media platform X was buzzing with excitement with the new post from “DeFiMinty” stating that the Smart NAV pilot program could be a huge deal for Chainlink. While sharing future projections, the X user with more than 50,000 followers stated that large industries could begin tokenizing real-world assets and cross-chain protocols like CCIP could be used in chain abstraction.
In an extended report, the DTCC stated that it “invited asset managers, service providers, and distributors to a series of collaborative workshops to discuss the pilot and evaluate benefits”.
Notably, the prominent banking institutions that participated in the pilot program include American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust d/b/a American Trust Custody, State Street, and US Bank.

Hong Kong Crypto Hub Ambitions Stalled by Weak ETF Demand


							

Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs see muted investor interest, assets drop $25 million.



Trading volume lags far behind US counterparts, raising hub ambitions doubts.



Analysts cite US lead & China’s crypto stance as reasons for investor caution.




Hong Kong’s initial foray into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has met with muted investor interest, according to a recent Bloomberg report. The total assets under management for the six ETFs launched in late April have fallen by roughly $25 million, down from an initial value of $293 million.



These figures fall short of the rosy predictions made by some Hong Kong asset managers. Prior to the launch, ChinaAMC executive Zhu Haokang anticipated that Hong Kong’s ETFs would surpass those in the U.S. in terms of initial listing size.



However, the reality proved significantly different. The total trading volume of Hong Kong’s ETFs on their first day was only 87.58 million Hong Kong dollars (roughly $12 million), a far cry from the $4.6 billion seen for US Bitcoin ETFs on their launch day. Analysts attribute this disparity to Hong Kong’s smaller financial sector and limited pool of investors compared to the U.S.









The lackluster performance of the ETFs raises questions about Hong Kong’s ambition to become a major crypto hub. Le Shi, Head of Trading at Market Making and Algorithmic trading firm Auros, believes Hong Kong’s approach has been “lukewarm.”




 “Firstly, they got beaten to the punch by the US. Secondly, there’s ongoing uncertainty about China’s intentions with regards to crypto, which is causing potential investors to tread carefully, or avoid the jurisdiction altogether.” 




He cites two key factors: the headstart enjoyed by the U.S. market, and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding China’s stance on cryptocurrencies, which is leading some investors to take a cautious approach.The latest data from Farside Investors confirms the trend of outflows, with the total now reaching $29.9 million. Bitcoin ETFs alone saw an outflow of $13.2 million as on May 16th.

One of the Most Popular Cryptocurrency Analysts Just Announced He's Selling All His Bitcoins - Here's Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


Famous cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe announced that he sold all his Bitcoins in a surprising move. Despite this, he maintains that he has not lost faith in BTC and does not believe it has reached its peak for this cycle.
Van de Poppe explained that the decision to sell all his Bitcoins was a strategic decision and he aims to obtain more Bitcoins later in the year. He noted that we are in a bull cycle and that the simplicity of the four-year cycle will diminish over time as Bitcoin matures as an asset.


Last week, pension funds, insurance companies and the largest hedge funds in the US reported allocating funds to the Spot Bitcoin ETF. CME Group also announced the upcoming launch of a futures ETF. According to the analyst, these developments show that Bitcoin is becoming a mature asset in the world.

Van de Poppe claims that this cycle is the last relatively easy one to make a lot of money through altcoins. He outlines four ways to generate high returns during a bull cycle for Bitcoin:






Selling Bitcoin at high levels and buying it back at low levels. According to the analyst, this strategy involves a lot of risk as timing can be difficult.
Using leverage to go long/short Bitcoin and get more Bitcoin by trading futures on the real asset.
Accumulate more Bitcoin by selling and earning income through labor outside (or within) the crypto ecosystem. According to the analyst, this is the easiest way to get more Bitcoin.
Trading altcoins within the Web 3.0 ecosystem to get more Bitcoin. According to the analyst, this is the riskiest way because timing the markets wrongly or investing at the wrong time can easily lead to losses.

Van de Poppe, a 31-year-old entrepreneur who has been on the market since 2017, announced that he chose the last option. He believes that in order to get a big return, one has to take risks against all odds and sensitivity. He admits there are times when things go bad, but he says he's willing to take risks.
Van de Poppe believes the world will focus on gaining as much Bitcoin and Gold as possible

We asked ChatGPT-4o to make a $1,000 crypto portfolio


The wider crypto market has been on a general uptrend since late 2024, with many cryptocurrencies hitting new all-time highs (ATH) or, at the very least, hitting prices not seen in years at one point or another.
So far, March has proven to be the cycle’s most exciting month given it featured a major meme coin rally and Bitcoin (BTC) at a new record high, while April – offering the BTC halving on the one hand, but also a correction and stagnation on the other – has arguably taken the second spot for crypto traders.
Given that, by mid-May, it appears as though the correction phase is over – most evidently seen by both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) making a significant breakout attempt – Finbold decided to consult the most advanced model of OpenAI’s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) platform – ChatGPT-4o – to help design a strong portfolio for the future.

ChatGPT’s selects the $1,000 portfolio’s biggest holdings
Upon analyzing the recent crypto market happenings and being informed of its task to help allocate $1,000, ChatGPT set about designing what turned out to be an 8-cryptocurrency portfolio,
ChatGPT crypto portfolio summary. Source: Finbold
The biggest portion of the investment – $250 – went into Bitcoin, which the AI considers the ‘most established and widely recognized cryptocurrency’ and the ‘cornerstone of any crypto portfolio.’ ChatGPT particularly noted Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.
It is noteworthy, however, that though the AI used common arguments, certain aspects of Bitcoin’s reputation have arguably come into question given its performance following adverse geopolitical and financial events, as well as given the fact that its most recent rally started after positive inflation data came out for the first time in months.
The AI portfolio’s second biggest holding – at $200 allocated – turned out to be Ethereum, which ChatGPT described as ‘the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).’
The large language model (LLM) also explained that ETH’s smart contract capabilities and continuous upgrades are likely to only solidify its already dominant position.
ChatGPT’s third pick – at $150 – proved to be Solana (SOL) due to its ‘high transaction speeds and low fees’ and the fact that ‘it has a growing ecosystem and has seen significant adoption.’
ChatGPT explains the three biggest holdings. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT
ChatGPT designs the $100 club within the portfolio
The AI invested $100 into Binance Coin (BNB) given it is ‘integral to the Binance ecosystem’ and offers ‘utility in trading fee discounts and participating in token sales on Binance Launchpad.’ ChatGPT also explained that BNB’s strong liquidity in the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange ensures strong growth potential.
Cardano (ADA) also received a $100 investment and the AI explains it favors it due to ‘its strong emphasis on research-driven development and peer-reviewed protocols,’ as well as the ‘focus on scalability and sustainability.’
Polkadot (DOT) was the last cryptocurrency to receive a $100 investment from ChatGPT, with the AI justifying its decision by highlighting DOT’s interoperability and efforts to ‘enable different blockchains to transfer messages and value in a trust-free fashion.’
ChatGPT explains the intermediate holdings. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT
ChatGPT finalizes the portfolio
Finally, ChatGPT split the final $100 of the investment between Chainlink (LINK) and Avalanche (AVAX).
ChatGPT explains the final allocation. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT
According to the AI, Chainlink deserved its spot in the portfolio with ‘its critical role in the DeFi ecosystem and broad adoption’ given it functions as an oracle network.
Avalanche was described as highly competitive with a particular focus given to AVAX’s scalability and interoperability.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin (BTC) held steady above the $66,000 mark, reaching an intra-day high of $66,500. The Bitcoin price prediction now indicates strong bullish momentum, driven by increasing institutional interest. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has attracted significant investment, while CME Group’s planned entry into Bitcoin spot trading is expected to boost market liquidity and demand.
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) Shows Strong Institutional Interest

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen impressive performance since its inception. The trust has attracted significant attention, with 414 individual or institutional investors reported in the first few months. This level of interest is notable, as it’s uncommon for a new investment to have even 20 owners initially.
 Since its launch in January, IBIT has grown from zero to managing $16.65 billion in assets, making it the most popular Bitcoin investment for regular investors. Major firms such as Millennium Management, Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, and Aristeia Capital have invested in IBIT.
https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1791079436953022885
The rapid growth of IBIT to $16.65 billion in assets under management indicates strong institutional interest, which is positively impacting Bitcoin’s price.

Significant Attention: 414 investors in the first few months.
Rapid Growth: IBIT now manages $16.65 billion in assets.
Institutional Interest: Major firms like Millennium Management and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors are investors.

CME Group’s Entry into Bitcoin Spot Trading

CME Group, a major Chicago-based futures exchange, plans to enter Bitcoin spot trading due to growing demand, as reported by the Financial Times. The exact launch date is still uncertain, as the plan is being finalized. CME has a significant history in the crypto market, having introduced Bitcoin futures in December 2017 and micro-Bitcoin futures in May 2021 for smaller contracts.
Currently, CME leads in Bitcoin futures open interest with $9 billion and launched Bitcoin options in early 2020. However, it trails Deribit in options value. The demand for spot trading has surged, following the introduction of several spot ETFs earlier this year, with spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting $303 million in inflows on Wednesday.
Consequently, CME Group’s move into Bitcoin spot trading could positively impact Bitcoin’s price by increasing liquidity and institutional participation.

CME’s Entry: Plans to enter Bitcoin spot trading.
Market Leader: Leading in Bitcoin futures open interest with $9 billion.
Increased Demand: Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $303 million in inflows recently.

Institutional Investments in Bitcoin ETFs and Their Impact on Price

Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan is optimistic about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due to rising institutional investments, which have exceeded initial expectations. Recent data indicates over 900 professional firms now invest in Bitcoin ETFs, holding a combined $3.5 billion. This surge marks a significant development in the cryptocurrency market, showcasing growing institutional interest in Bitcoin.
Despite this growth, professional investors currently hold only 7–10% of total Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM), indicating substantial potential for further expansion. Hougan noted that institutions typically follow a progressive investment trajectory, suggesting significant future allocations that could drive Bitcoin ETF growth and market participation.

Institutional Surge: Over 900 firms invest $3.5 billion in Bitcoin ETFs.
Growth Potential: Professional investors hold just 7–10% of Bitcoin ETF assets.
Future Allocations: Expected to further boost Bitcoin ETF growth and market activity.

Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin price prediction indicates a potential retracement after surpassing the $66,600 mark. Bitcoin has completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at around $64,750, which now serves as significant support and today’s pivot point. As long as Bitcoin stays above this level, a bullish rebound is likely.In this context, the immediate resistance is at the $66,600 level. Should Bitcoin break above this, the next resistance levels to watch are $67,820 and $69,000.Bitcoin Price PredictionOn the downside, if Bitcoin falls below the $64,750 support, it could drop further to $63,300. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour chart provides additional support around $63,150, enhancing the likelihood of a bullish bounce. However, if selling pressure increases and Bitcoin crosses below the 50-day EMA, further support levels are expected at $61,500 and $61,200.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved out of the overbought zone and is currently around 62, indicating continued bullish momentum.
Current Trend: Monitor the $64,750 and $63,300 levels closely, as they are critical for buyers. The likelihood of a bullish trend remains strong above these levels.

Farmsent to enhance smart farming with Nuklai AI tools as peaq raises $35M amid token launch

Nuklai, an on-chain smart data platform, and peaq, a layer-1 blockchain for decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), have announced an integration aimed at enhancing AI and data monetization tools for DePINs, starting with the global Web3 marketplace for farmers, Farmsent.The news comes as peaq completed a token launch on Coinlist, raising $35 million from over 14,500 wallets in one of the largest campaigns the platform has seen in two years, which was oversubscribed by $15 million.The integration between Nuklai and peaq seeks to expand the array of AI and data tools available to DePINs on peaq. By leveraging Nuklai’s specialized smart data infrastructure, DePINs can enhance their solutions through quality datasets and industry insights while also benefiting from fair data monetization opportunities. Per Nuklai, the collaboration will harness data from over 400,000 devices, vehicles, machines, and robots within the peaq ecosystem, which bridges blockchain technology with real-world industries and economies.This partnership comes at a time when the number of IoT devices is projected to grow significantly, generating vast amounts of data. Nuklai aims to address this by consolidating the fragmented data landscape into an on-chain smart data ecosystem that emphasizes sharing, requesting, evaluating, and monetizing data. The platform’s transformation of raw data into high-quality smart data is intended to enhance its utility for AI models, benefiting enterprise clients by improving production efficiency and predictive analytics.Jochem Herber, Head of Ecosystem at Nuklai, stated that Nuklai will equip DePIN projects with the necessary tools to start monetizing or leveraging their data, positioning Nuklai as the primary AI layer for DePINs due to peaq’s established presence in this segment.A significant aspect of this integration is collaborating with Farmsent and consumer-facing businesses that use peaq IDs. Farmsent has over 160,000 farmers signed up for its middleman-free DePIN and marketplace ecosystem, which enhances data sharing and collaboration within the global food supply chain.Farmsent leverages blockchain technology to optimize the food supply chain. It streamlines the trading process and ensures food security by reducing intermediaries, lowering prices, and increasing transparency. With its decentralized product passports (DePPs), Farmsent records and verifies the journey of agricultural products, providing a transparent and tamper-proof record that empowers small farmers and builds consumer trust.The partnership with Nuklai is expected to enhance Farmsent’s capabilities by incorporating advanced AI tools to process and analyze agricultural data collected through sensors, human input, and third-party sources. Nuklai’s AI engine transforms this data into actionable insights, fostering a shareable data economy. This integration benefits Farmsent by providing valuable insights and contributes to a more data-driven agricultural future.According to Matthijs de Vries, Founder and CEO of Nuklai, the secure and seamless flow of reliable data is crucial for the IoT sector. Integrating peaq’s ecosystem of DePIN innovators is seen as a promising use case for Nuklai’s smart data infrastructure, which will help optimize processes and open new business opportunities.Till Wendler, co-founder of peaq, emphasized the synergy between AI and the Economy of Things, highlighting that Nuklai’s AI and data infrastructure layers add significant value to the ecosystem and unlock more tools for builders. The partnership is expected to provide mutual benefits, as the data collected by IoT devices and machines will be invaluable to Nuklai’s ecosystem of data users.As Farmsent continues to develop its blockchain-powered traceability system, the collaboration with Nuklai and peaq is set to further its mission of empowering small farmers, enhancing transparency, and optimizing the food supply chain. By integrating advanced AI and data monetization tools, Farmsent aims to revolutionize the agricultural sector and contribute to global food security.Latest Alpha Market Report

Crypto Trader Says Bitcoin Is out of the Post-Halving ‘Danger Zone’ - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A cryptocurrency analyst and trader believes Bitcoin (BTC) is no longer at risk of a further market correction.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 76,900 YouTube subscribers that based on historic precedence Bitcoin has left the phase, or “danger zone,” when there is a likelihood of a dip below its range low after the halving event when miners’ rewards are cut in half.










“Essentially speaking, the danger zone, the post-halving danger zone, which is a three-week window where Bitcoin can produce downside volatility below its current reaccumulation range low, that danger zone is over. And that terror that occurs whenever we see downside volatility below the reaccumulation range low, that is also over. That terror is over. And the correction bottom is probably in.”
Source: Rekt/YouTube
Based on past cycles, the analyst believes Bitcoin is now in a reaccumulation phase when the digital asset tends to trade sideways.
“The reaccumulation phase that lies ahead is not over… this is a real accumulation phase right now. We’re probably going to be meandering between the range low and the range high, the $60,000 and $70,000 regions, just meandering here for the next coming weeks. As we’ve seen, this can be at least 150 days.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $65,364 at time of writing, down more than 1% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin ETFs Record Third Day Of Inflows, Price Tops $66,000


								In another remarkable day for cryptocurrency investments, US-based spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) witnessed a substantial influx of capital, totaling $257.3 million on Thursday. This significant inflow marks the third consecutive day of large-scale investments into these funds, signaling a robust and returning interest among institutional and retail investors alike in Bitcoin.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reported a positive inflow of $4.6 million, continuing its upward trend for the second day. BlackRock, a major player in the investment arena, also saw a noteworthy resurgence in inflows, capturing $93.7 million after a stagnant three days. This development indicates a renewed confidence in Bitcoin from a variety of investor bases.
Other ETF providers also saw impressive inflows: Fidelity reported $67.1 million, Bitwise took in $1.4 million, ARK Invest added $62 million, Invesco received $6.2 million, Franklin saw $3.8 million and Valkyrie gained $18.5 million.

This sustained inflow trend across multiple providers underlines a collective bullish sentiment in the market. Renowned crypto analyst WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) highlighted the significance of these movements.
“Yesterday’s ETF flows by FarsideUK was entirely positive again for $257.3 million. […]. After the price going back to $66.500 on Wednesday, we had some consolidation and it’s now [above $66,000]. No other major news was announced, the fact that the price didn’t move with these inflows tells me that there is another party unloading in this range.”


Old Bitcoin ETF Debate Reignites
Amidst the inflow of excitement, a seasoned debate concerning the transparency and potential for market manipulation within the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem resurfaced yesterday. Tyler Durden, a pseudonymous crypto commentator, expressed concerns about the off-chain recording of Bitcoin transactions by large institutions like BlackRock.

“Blackrock can take as much Bitcoin as they want from Coinbase and the transaction is recorded off chain. I’d like to see all of the ETF’s wallets. […] This means they can borrow Bitcoin from Coinbase to short and are not required to show any proof they hold 1:1. There’s also a 2-30 day settlement. All settlements are done in cash. The writings on the wall, unless someone can find the ETFs wallets on-chain.”
Responding to these concerns, Dave Weisberger, chairman of CoinRoutes, defended the practices imposed by regulatory guidelines: “OF COURSE they had to do it that way because of the ‘cash creation/redemption’ the SEC forced. The Authorized Participants can’t ‘touch’ spot Bitcoin so MUST engage in off-chain transactions. As I said repeatedly, ‘in kind’ would have been more efficient & transparent, but this fear mongering is nonsense.”
Weisberger emphasized that the ETFs are required by their charter to hold full backing in spot Bitcoin for all settled shares, ensuring adherence to regulatory standards.
Moreover, James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF expert, also weighed in, supporting Weisberger’s perspective and hinting at the ongoing learning curve in the ETF industry regarding cryptocurrency transactions. “The gang learns about cash creation,” Seyffart said, “What a throwback to early December 2023. I pretty much agree with Dave here.”
At press time, BTC traded at $66,109.

French Regulator Reminds Public That Bybit Is On the "blacklist"


The French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) told cryptocurrency users and retail investors to be cautious with Bybit, asking the French to exercise “maximum vigilance” over the exchange.
The French regulator noted that Bybit has been on the blacklist since May 20, 2022, and is not authorized to offer cryptocurrency services in France.
France Remembers That Bybit Is On the Blacklist

The AMF recalled that providing digital asset custody services is subject to mandatory prior registration. It helps to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing and also imposes specific measures to protect retail investors.
However, according to the monetary and financial code, the AMF reserved the right to take legal action to block Bybit’s operation and website in France. The regulator invited users to “stay alert” if the exchange stops providing services in the country.
The announcement generated mixed opinions on X. Some appreciated the recommendations, while others questioned the AMF for “wanting to tell people where to invest their money.”

“Ok, so we’re going to have to go to even riskier platforms to guarantee our freedom to invest our hard-earned money as we wish, great protection. Create a secure and attractive platform that will be better for protecting us,” claimed a user on X.

France is not the only country where Bybit is unauthorized. Last year, the exchange exited Canada after increased due diligence orders from the Canadian Securities Administrators. In the United Kingdom, Bybit departed due to strict marketing rules enforced in October.

France: Bybit is not complying with the country's crypto regulation

Bybit, a well-known crypto exchange supported by the BitDAO ecosystem, was reported yesterday by the financial regulatory authority of France for non-compliance with registration requirements within the country.
The Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) had already included the exchange in its blacklist, but now it could request the platform to be blocked in France before a judge.
Let’s see everything in detail below.

Crypto and regulation in France: AMF warns investors about Bybit’s illegal activities
Tensions continue in Europe between the crypto world and various local regulations: Yesterday the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), the financial regulatory body of France, warned investors about the illegal presence of the exchange Bybit in the country.
The cryptocurrency exchange platform, despite having its operational headquarters in Dubai, provides its services to French users even though it is not registered as a digital asset service provider (PSAN).
The AMF had already included Bybit in the blacklist of unauthorized financial operators in May 2022, but now reports that the site may be closed upon formal request to a judge.
These are the words of the French regulator in a press release:
“Unregistered platforms that provide these services in France are illegal under French law. Bybit is not registered as a provider of digital asset services.”

We are not talking about testimonies related to possible defaults of the company or fraudulent activities, such as those carried out by FTX until its fateful collapse in November 2022, but simply of the omission of some registration obligations.
France does not actually prohibit the implementation of services related to the provision of digital asset custody services on behalf of third parties, or the purchase, sale, and exchange of cryptocurrencies, but requires prior approval from the PSAN.
According to the regulatory body, this type of registration allows to preserve public order through the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing, to verify the integrity and competence of leaders, and to impose specific measures to protect savers.
Recently the AMF has added more crypto platforms to its blacklist, such as 24cryptoforestrading.net and cryptoneyx.io, but at the same time has approved the registration for Gemini, Coinbase and Circle.
We remind you that Bybit, unlike other crypto exchanges such as Binace, Coinbase, Gemini Gate, BitPanda and Young Platform, is not even registered in the virtual operators register at OAM, and therefore would operate without authorization even in Italian territory.
Same situation for Bybit in Hong Kong, where the special administrative region has issued a notice similar to the one released by the French financial regulatory authority.
In 2023, the exchange founded by investor Ben Zhou was forced to leave the markets of Canada and the United Kingdom due to financial obligations and lack of regulatory control.
However, it is worth noting how Bybit is trying to expand its presence worldwide, where regulations appear less restrictive: recently it has indeed launched a trading service in the Netherlands and in Kazakhstan.
The reputation of Bybit in the cryptocurrency exchange sector
Despite not being registered with regulatory bodies in several countries around the world, Bybit remains a pillar in the cryptocurrency exchange sector.
Currently according to the data from Coinmarketcap, the platform in the last 24 hours records a spot trading volume of 3.7 billion and a derivatives volume of 16.9 billion dollars. On February 24, 2024, it set its record for trading volumes, processing orders for over 71 billion dollars.
With these numbers, Bybit undoubtedly ranks in the TOP 5 of the best cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, also being able to rely on a solid and efficient infrastructure, supported by none other than the multibillion-dollar autonomous organization BitDAO.
The CoinGlass analysis service ranks Bybit 3rd in the ranking of brokers with the most open interest on BTC and 2nd for open interest on ETH.
Overall, it has about 12 billion open positions in derivative markets.

The user interface is simple and intuitive, and the platform offers very interesting advanced features such as launchpad, OTC trading, copy trading, debit card, etc.
Bybit is present in 160 different countries and has a user base of almost 30 million with 1219 cryptocurrencies listed on its platform.
According to Dune Analytics, in April 2023 Bybit’s total reserves amounted to approximately 1.6 billion dollars, with 950 million in stablecoins, 350 million in ETH, and around 300 million in BIT and other tokens. In October 2021, these data reached a historical peak at 2.2 billion dollars.

Pink Drainer Shuts Down after Stealing Millions in Crypto | Coinspeaker



For cybercriminals, the loss of such a prolific tool is poised to disrupt their activities, at least, for now.

The notorious wallet drainer tool known as Pink Drainer has made a surprise announcement. This follows after several involvement in the theft of millions of dollars in crypto assets. According to a report by on-chain investigator ZachXBT, the developers of the cybercrime service shared their intent to wind down in a Telegram message.
They claimed that the decision to close down was simply because they had reached their goal and it was time for them to retire. They also added that the announcement will be the last message from them as there will be no future comebacks. Part of the statement reads:




“After this message’s publication, we will begin winding down all of our infrastructure. All stored information will be wiped and securely deleted.”
Pink Drainer Exits Leaving a Theft Trail of $85 Million
Pink Drainer has been a go-to vendor for cybercriminals in recent times. It offered a software tool designed to exploit technical vulnerabilities through social engineering tactics and phishing links.
With its tool, bad actors could carry out malicious schemes such as creating convincing phishing sites to deceive users into transactions that ultimately drained their wallets of crypto assets and NFTs.
Pink Drainer was also a part of a larger network of phishing-as-a-service platforms. Like its other counterparts including Monkey Drainer and Inferno Drainer, its developers also earned revenue from fees after taking an agreed percentage of whatever amount of asset is stolen.
Although the announcement has an undertone of sober reflections, it is worth noting that Pink Drainer has been linked to crypto theft worth nothing less than $85 million in the past year alone. According to ScamSniffer data, the use of Pink Drainer negatively impacted over 21,000 victims in the past year.
One of the most notable scams of the infamous wallet drainer happened in March 2024. The scam focused on creditors of bankrupt crypto firms through email phishing, leading to thefts of at least $5 million.
That March incident did not only show the tool’s ability to exploit high-profile vulnerabilities. It also highlighted the level of financial damage that the tool can inflict on any victim.
Implications for Cybersecurity and Future Threats
The shutdown of Pink Drainer is certainly a big win in an ongoing fight against cybercrime. For cybercriminals, the loss of such a prolific tool is poised to disrupt their activities, at least, for now. However, it must be noted that the threat remains, even as alternative phishing-as-a-service platforms continue to exist.

Turkey proposes aligning crypto legislation with international standards

The Turkish ruling party submitted a draft crypto bill to the parliament on May 16. The bill focuses on licensing and registration for crypto service providers and aligns with international standards. According to a Reuters report, the draft bill aims to update existing laws to comprehensively govern the cryptocurrency market. The bill’s key focus areas include consumer protection, platform transparency and compliance with financial regulations.The proposed legislation intends to regulate cryptocurrency trading platforms and other service providers in the sector, requiring them to obtain licenses from Turkey’s Capital Markets Board (CMB). Related: Turkey tops the world in stablecoin buying share vs. GDPThe draft law aims to govern crypto asset service providers, crypto asset platform operations, crypto asset storage, and crypto asset buying, selling and transfer transactions by Turkish residents. The legislation also addresses the classification of cryptocurrencies and projects, ensuring compliance with existing financial regulations. Some of the key takeaways from the bill are:Crypto service providers must be licensed and regulated by the Capital Markets Board.Enhanced CMB oversight to protect consumer assets and ensure effective dispute resolution.Mandatory revenue collection from crypto service providers by CMB and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey.Ban on foreign crypto brokers to foster a locally regulated ecosystem.This move seeks to align Turkey with international standards and address Financial Action Task Force (FATF) concerns, enhancing the security and reliability of the national crypto market.The draft law proposes to include the FATF-issued travel guidelines. The FATF Travel Rule requires cryptocurrency companies and financial institutions involved in digital asset sales — collectively known as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) — to obtain and share “accurate originator information and beneficiary information” with counterparty VASPs or other financial institutions before or during transactions.Turkey was demoted to the “gray list” by the FATF in October 2021 due to its failure to implement Anti-Money Laundering measures in its banking, real estate and other industries. The FATF requires countries on the gray list to actively cooperate in rectifying any shortcomings and subject them to heightened scrutiny.Magazine: CZ gets jail sentence, Gensler viewed Ether as security, and FBI targets mixers: Hodler’s Digest, April 28 – May 4

Assassin’s Creed Shadows Preview: Everything You Need to Know - Decrypt

“You’re still a frog in a well who knows nothing of the sea,” is one of the coolest lines we’ve heard in a reveal trailer this year.The next installment in the massive video game franchise Assassin’s Creed has just been announced, taking place in ancient Japan. It’ll see players control two contrasting characters with different fighting styles as their narratives clash.With the game releasing before the end of the year, fans of the series (including us) surely want to know everything about it. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Here's everything we know so far about Assassin's Creed Shadows.(FYI: While Ubisoft is doing loads of stuff in the crypto gaming space, including Assassin's Creed NFTs tied to physical figurines, Assassin's Creed Shadows appears to be a traditional "Web2" game with no blockchain elements.)What is Assassin's Creed Shadows?Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the 14th installment in the Assassin's Creed series and the most recent since 2023’s Assassin's Creed Mirage—unless you include the VR title Assassin's Creed Nexus.Set in 16th century Japan, players will take control of two distinct characters which will adopt different gameplay styles—one being combat focused, the other stealth focused. When is Assassin's Creed Shadows coming out?Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac on November 15, 2024 at a price of $70 for the standard edition.Two special editions will also be available: the Gold and Ultimate Edition.The Gold Edition will allow you to play the game three days early, and comes with the season pass for $110. Meanwhile, the Ultimate Edition at $130 will come with additional character packs, skill points, and other in-game items.Alternatively, you can get the game on day one with subscription service Ubisoft+ at $18 a month.Who are the heroes in Assassin's Creed Shadows?Assassin’s Creed Shadows allows players to take control of a Japanese shinobi, Naoe, and a historical samurai, Yasuke. With early leaks showing that the main character of the new Assassin’s Creed game was going to be Black, some keyboard warriors weren't happy—calling Ubisoft woke. Yasuke, however, is a black man who actually existed in Japan during the 16th century. He's also featured in previous games from other companies.It is believed that Yasuke came from Mozambique, Ethiopia or Nigeria after being enslaved or trafficked as a child. He was later freed and traveled to Japan from India, where he was employed as a warrior by missionaries in the region. He is often referred to as the first black samurai, but some contest that he was ever given this title.As for Naoe, she is a fictional 17-year-old Japanese shinobi and is the daughter of one of the most iconic shinobi, Fujibayashi Nagato. She is described by Ubisoft as “intense, compassionate, and determined,” while Yasuke is a thoughtful, level-headed person.When and where is Assassin's Creed Shadows set?Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes place in 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era. This was an age of political unification that saw all of Japan’s provinces brought under one central government. This was not a peaceful process. Naoe lives in the province of Iga, the home of shinobi, or as many know them: ninjas. In the late 1,500s, the clan led by Oda Nobunaga attacked Iga twice—and in the second assault, Iga was defeated.Oda Nobunaga is one of the three great unifiers of Japan, an extremely powerful and controversial figure. Yasuke, who was fluent in Japanese, impressed Oda who then asked Yasuke to stay with him. In the trailer, Naoe sees Yasuke in the flames of Iga.The campaign will follow some historical reports of the story of Yasuke, but with some holes in our knowledge of the figure. Ubisoft has also added some “What if?” moments to the tale.“Given the time period of our game, unification is a really big deal,” Ubisoft Assistant Director of Cinematic Design Akim Milne said in a YouTube video.What will the gameplay be like?We currently do not have any gameplay footage of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. That said, the two characters are said to have distinct playstyles. Naoe as a shinobi will have a focus on stealth, while Yasuke as a samurai will be combat focused. While both share some abilities, there will be clear advantages when you stick to what your character knows.Other than that, we’ll have to wait to see a gameplay trailer to really understand how this game will play—though we imagine the broad strokes of the gameplay and world design will be familiar to what series fans already know and expect. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on all next-gen platforms on November 15.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

This Project, which Updated on the Blockchain Network, Experienced a Significant Rise! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

FTM, the native token of the Fantom blockchain, has emerged as one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, with a significant increase in value of 13% in the past week and 25 percent in the last 1 month.
Fantom Experienced a 13% Weekly Gain
FTM's price climbed to around $0.84 on positive market sentiment surrounding the release of Fantom's Sonic upgrade and a significant increase in the protocol's total value locked (TVL).


The Fantom Foundation is actively implementing its latest upgrade, codenamed Sonic, which promises to improve the capabilities of the blockchain. As of now, 25 out of 60 nodes have successfully completed the upgrade.
Once two-thirds of the nodes have implemented the new software, the chain will be fully upgraded. According to on-chain data, Sonic aims to significantly increase transaction speeds to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) with a precision of 1.1 seconds, compared to the previous average transaction speed of just over 2.5 TPS.





Investors are also responding positively to the recent increase in Fantom's TVL. Data from DeFiLlama shows that TVL on the Fantom network reached $203 million on May 16, up from $111 million just two days earlier.

This increase reflects a broader increase in TVL across various decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, yield aggregators, and other decentralized applications (dapps) on the Fantom chain.


Several dapps supporting the Phantom blockchain have experienced 10% to 20% growth in TVL over the past week, further adding to the overall value and appeal of the network.
This increase underscores the growing adoption and usage of the Fantom ecosystem, supported by its technological advances and advanced infrastructure.

Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) Explodes 700% Before Consolidating, As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS), a Solana memecoin that was launched yesterday, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Diamond Paws presents a similar opportunity.



DIAPAWS rallied over 700% in the first few hours after its launch, before consolidating as some early buyers cashed out their profits.



However, most investors are still holding their tokens, as they are waiting for DIAPAWS to be listed on MEXC later this week, as this listing will cause the coin’s price to skyrocket.




Its current price presents a great opportunity for new investors to buy the dip before the next rally.



DIAPAWS has a market cap below $9,,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of around $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-3,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally another 12,000% in the coming two days, and Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, DIAPAWS can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Diamond Paws (DIAPAWS) on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for DIAPAWS by entering its contract address – HCEn3J1sKqMqPxrQDE33rGhJvyXh4r3YgyzD2wiAm3ga – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DIAPAWS.

pStake Finance Launches Bitcoin Liquid Staking Solution to Boost Bitcoin-Native DeFi Ecosystem



                    

pStake Finance, supported by Binance Labs, recently introduced its liquid staking solution for Bitcoin, marking a significant advancement in Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi). 



This new solution, developed on Babylon’s Bitcoin staking protocol, is designed to simplify the Bitcoin staking process while providing additional opportunities for Bitcoin holders to generate yields.




Mikhil Pandey, co-founder and chief strategy officer of pSTAKE Finance, emphasized the company’s commitment to enhancing Bitcoin’s functionality as a yield-generating asset. 



He stated, “Having fundamental faith and belief in Bitcoin, yields, and constantly identifying and solving crucial problems in this industry are some of the reasons behind moving in Bitcoin’s direction. 



The opportunity to make Bitcoin a yield-generating asset, something that hasn’t existed inherently, is very exciting. Yield-generating Bitcoin is powerful for all ecosystems and not just Bitcoin L2s.”



This initiative is part of the broader Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) movement, which seeks to integrate DeFi capabilities with the first blockchain network.

The growing interest in Bitcoin-native DeFi solutions has been bolstered by the 2024 halving event, which coincided with the launch of Bitcoin Runes, a new protocol for issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network.



In the run-up to the halving, Binance Labs, the independent venture capital arm of Binance, has pivoted its focus towards BTCFi, marking its commitment with an investment in the Bitcoin-native restaking protocol BounceBit on April 11.




The launch of pSTAKE’s liquid staking solution represents the company’s inaugural venture into Bitcoin-native DeFi after three years of developing its protocol on the Cosmos network. pSTAKE is part of a growing number of protocols aimed at transforming Bitcoin into a yield-generating asset.



In a similar vein, Hermetica announced in early May the launch of the first-ever Bitcoin-backed synthetic U.S. dollar with yield capabilities, USDh, set to debut in June and offer up to 25% yields.




Pandey sees the BTCFi sector as an area ripe with promising products that enhance Bitcoin’s capital efficiency. 



He believes, however, that the sector still requires further development to reach the maturity seen in Ethereum’s DeFi space. “Ethereum’s tech had to go through a lot of evolution before the actual DeFi Summer in 2020. 



The Bitcoin DeFi landscape will likely follow a similar journey of development and progress before we see a full-fledged BTCfi Summer,” he explained.



Pandey also highlighted the significant financial potential in making Bitcoin a more versatile asset, noting the current minimal DeFi penetration in the Bitcoin market: “With less than 1% of the Bitcoin market cap in DeFi today, we could see huge growth as we develop more secure and reliable ways to generate yield on Bitcoin.”

DTCC Leverages Chainlink for Smart NAV Pilot - The Defiant

The pilot program explored the feasibility of delivering mutual fund price and rate data using Chainlink’s CCIP.The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has released a report on its Smart NAV pilot, which evaluated the feasibility of distributing mutual fund Net Asset Value (NAV) data on blockchain networks.Smart NAV aimed to create a digital extension to DTCC’s Mutual Fund Profile Service (MFPS I), the industry standard for disseminating price and rate data. The DTCC is an integral part of the U.S. financial system, providing clearing and settlement services since 1973.Smart NAV MechanismThe pilot, a collaborative effort between DTCC, oracle provider Chainlink, and ten major financial institutions, including JP Morgan and Franklin Templeton, aimed to determine whether NAV data — a critical component in fund valuation and transaction decision-making — could be standardized and automatically processed within a blockchain environment.Chainlink’s LINK token soared nearly 20% after the report was released.LINK PriceWith the increasing integration of blockchain in the financial sector, the Smart NAV pilot is a significant step in DTCC's exploration of the technology. Its success could be pivotal in managing tokenized assets and simplifying processes for a wide array of financial contracts that rely on mutual fund data.The study comes as real-world assets (RWA) continue to gain traction across crypto, with the tokenized Treasuries sector exceeding $1.3 billion in assets as of May 16.

Ethereum's Strong Position and Potential Growth: Coinbase Institutional Report | Cryptoglobe


                                
Coinbase Institutional is a division of Coinbase that caters to the needs of institutional investors, such as hedge funds, family offices, endowments, and other large-scale financial entities. It provides secure custody services through Coinbase Custody, offering segregated cold storage with robust security measures and insurance coverage. The division also offers advanced trading services via Coinbase Prime, which includes OTC trading and algorithmic trading solutions. 



Additionally, Coinbase Institutional delivers comprehensive research and analytics to help clients make informed investment decisions.

Emphasizing regulatory compliance, Coinbase Institutional adheres to strict standards to ensure a trustworthy and reliable service for its clients, aiming to provide a comprehensive and secure platform for institutional engagement in the digital asset market.



On 15 May 2024, David Han, a Research Analyst at Coinbase Institutional, published an insightful report titled “Monthly Outlook: Expectations on Ethereum.”



Han asserts that although Ethereum has underperformed so far this year, its long-term positioning remains robust. He believes that Ethereum has the potential to surprise investors with an upward trend later in the cycle. According to Han, Ethereum benefits from strong persistent demand drivers and possesses unique advantages in its scaling roadmap.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Han highlights that Ethereum’s historical trading patterns demonstrate its dual narrative as both a “store-of-value” and a “technology-token.” This combination, he suggests, contributes to Ethereum’s resilience and appeal in the cryptocurrency market. Han also points out that Ethereum does not face significant supply-side pressures such as token unlocks or miner sell-offs. Instead, the growth in staking and Layer 2 (L2) solutions has created substantial and growing sinks for ETH liquidity, which he views as a positive indicator.



Furthermore, Han emphasizes Ethereum’s central role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. He believes that Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi is unlikely to be challenged due to the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and ongoing innovations in Layer 2 technologies. These developments ensure that Ethereum remains at the heart of DeFi, providing a strong foundation for future growth.



One of the critical points in Han’s report is the potential impact of spot US ETH ETFs. Han argues that the market may be underestimating the timing and likelihood of these ETFs being approved. He suggests that if approved by the U.S. SEC, these ETFs could significantly boost Ethereum’s market position, leading to positive price movements.

XRP Price: Community Hopes for Post-Lawsuit Surge


							

XRP price holds steady despite SEC lawsuit, down 0.3% in 24 hours



XRP community eyes lawsuit resolution, some predict price increase



XRP trading volume dips 10%, but market cap remains in top 7




The price of XRP token remained relatively stable on Friday, May 17, 2024, despite the lack of significant developments in the ongoing lawsuit with SEC. As of press time, XRP’s price is set at $0.5168, with a 24-hour decline of 0.30%.



The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, centers on whether XRP is a security. Investors are hopeful for a swift solution. While the parties have submitted the omnibus letter motions, the court ruled that Ripple, the SEC, and third parties must file opposing briefs by Monday (May 20). 



There are anticipations that XRP will surge to new all-time highs following the lawsuit’s final judgment. Analysts like King XRP forecasted the token’s major surge to $18.57 after the final judgment.



The broader XRP community is also looking ahead to potential future events, including the possibility of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and increased adoption by financial institutions. These developments could further drive up the price, according to some analysts.



While there are no significant developments in the Ripple lawsuit today, the XRP token remains relatively stable. With negligible daily and weekly dips, XRP has seen a slight surge of 3.82% over the past month.









Despite the lack of daily or weekly price fluctuations, XRP’s trading volume has seen a notable decline of nearly 10% in the past 24 hours, currently sitting at $1.09 billion. This suggests a decrease in overall market activity. However, XRP maintains its position among the top seven cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, currently valued at approximately $28.5 billion.A recent uptick in XRP’s price of 2.5% coincided with Ripple’s CFO, Jonathan Bilich’s, public support for the company’s motion to seal its omnibus letter motions in the lawsuit. This price increase was accompanied by a surge in trading volume, indicating increased market activity around this news.

Reddit (RDDT) Stock Surges After Partnership with OpenAI Announced - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Reddit (NYSE: RDDT), the popular social news aggregation and discussion platform, has announced partnerships with two major players in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry this year: Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) in February and, more recently, OpenAI.



These agreements aim to enhance Reddit’s platform with AI-powered features and diversify its income sources beyond traditional advertising. The massive social media site will, in turn, help OpenAI and Google train their artificial intelligence models using the site’s data.



OpenAI Inks Partnership with Reddit 



In the latest development, Reddit has partnered with AI start-up OpenAI, granting the company access to Reddit’s vast content library for training its AI models.



Reddit will introduce AI-powered features on its platform, leveraging OpenAI’s cutting-edge technologies as part of the deal. The partnership follows OpenAI’s similar agreements with other publishers, such as the Associated Press and the Financial Times.





Reddit Made a Similar Deal with Google in February



Prior to the OpenAI deal, Reddit announced a partnership with Google in February, allowing the tech giant to access Reddit data to train its AI models. Both the OpenAI and Google partnerships have raised legal and copyright concerns as the EU and US examine whether using content to train AI tools constitutes copyright infringement or falls under fair use exceptions.After the OpenAI partnership announcement, Reddit, Inc. (RDDT) stock has experienced significant movement in the premarket trading session today at the time of writing. The stock closed at $56.38 on Thursday, down 5.45% from the previous close. However, pre-market trading showed a promising increase to $64.00, up 13.52%.



Reddit’s market cap currently stands at $9.219 billion, with revenue (TTM) of $883.25 million. Despite a significant net loss of $605.02 million and a negative profit margin of -68.50%, the company holds total cash of $1.67 billion and a low total debt/equity ratio of 1.37%. Analyst price targets for Reddit stock range from a low of $45.00 to a high of $65.00.







Will other sites like Reddit continue the trend of inking deals with companies to provide data for training large language models? Let us know in the comments below.

Top Crypto Trader Dumps Entire Bitcoin Portfolio To Buy Altcoins, But Should You Be Taking This 'Huge' Risk - Benzinga

Prominent cryptocurrency trader Michael van de Poppe stunned the market after he revealed dumping all of his Bitcoin BTC/USD holdings in favor of altcoins.What Happened: Known for sharing valuable inputs regarding cryptocurrency portfolios and picking the assets to invest, Van De Poppe disclosed in an X post, "I've sold all my Bitcoin."The big decision was not motivated by the King Crypto's weak price action over the last month, rather Van De Poppe remarked, "I didn't lose my faith in Bitcoin, I'm not expecting Bitcoin to be topped out for this cycle. I've not become a complete believer in Gold.Michael van de Poppe did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comment.The analyst stated that he was taking the stance opposite to most traders in the market who have been rotating capital from altcoins to Bitcoin, betting on the latter's continued rise. He emphasized that the ongoing cycle would be the last one to make money through altcoins, which he believed were due for an upside. As a result, he opted to acquire altcoins that were currently undervalued, so that when their prices jumps, he could use them to buy more Bitcoins.However, the analyst added a caveat that downside risk was ‘huge' as he was already down 20% on the overall portfolio when he posted this on X. Why It Matters: Bitcoin's dominance vis à vis the rest of the market has increased this year, rising from 50% at the beginning to 54.18% at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCapBitcoin has largely benefitted from the launch of spot ETFs this year, while other assets like Ethereum ETH/USD have underperformed in comparison.Another noted cryptocurrency analyst Kevin also noted substantial capital rotation from altcoins to Bitcoin in the current cycle. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $66,333.56, up 0.05% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Michael Saylor Says Wall Street And Congress Want Bitcoin – But What About Joe BidenImage Via Shutterstock

Bitcoin (BTC) Whales Almost Disappear From Network, Here's Reason Why

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



As the most recent data provided by Santiment suggests, Bitcoin whales are currently distancing themselves from the market, with their activity plummeting towards 2024's lows. Unfortunately, it could be an indicator of an upcoming surge of selling pressure if BTC stays relatively neutral.While Bitcoin's 100+ BTC whale wallets continue to hold a high level of coins, totaling 11.79 million BTC, whale activity has dropped to its lowest level of 2024. There are currently 15,907 wallets holding at least 100 coins. Whenever the metric rises, we see a surge of renewed demand among whales, which should directly affect the performance of Bitcoin. Interestingly, the drop in whale activity could also be seen as a positive sign for the market. With fewer whales actively trading, the market might experience less volatility. When whales make large transactions, they can significantly impact the market, causing sudden price swings. Reduced activity among these large holders can lead to a more stable and predictable market environment, but this is not why people trade and hold cryptocurrencies.Additionally, less whale activity might indicate that these large holders are content with their current positions and are not looking to liquidate their holdings. This could suggest long-term bullish sentiment, as whales often have a better understanding of market dynamics and trends. Their decision to hold rather than sell might reflect their confidence in Bitcoin's future price growth.While the recent decline in Bitcoin whale activity to the lowest level of 2024 might initially seem concerning, it also offers some positive implications. Reduced market volatility and the potential for long-term holding among whales can provide a more stable environment for smaller investors.

Canaan Inc. Beats Revenue Expectations in Q1, Holds 1,057 BTC - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Canaan Inc. (NASDAQ: CAN) reported its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2024, ending March 31. The company announced revenues of $35.1 million, exceeding its previous guidance of $33 million by 6%. Mining revenue saw a significant sequential increase of 182.1%, reaching $10.5 million. The company also achieved a milestone by surpassing 1,000 Bitcoins (BTC) held, ending the quarter with 1,057 Bitcoins. Net loss for the quarter was $39.4 million, narrowed by 71.7% sequentially and 53.3% year-over-year.



Canaan’s CEO, Mr. Nangeng Zhang, attributed the strong performance to strategic foresight and resilience, especially as the company navigated through the last full quarter before the Bitcoin halving. Despite the traditionally slow first quarter, Canaan delivered 3.4 million Thash/s of computing power sold, driving their mining revenue to impressive heights.



Introducing new A1566 mining machines and continued demand for the A14 series post-halving were also highlighted as key factors in their success. Zhang emphasized the company’s relentless sales efforts and the optimization of mining operations as central to their robust topline performance.



Canaan Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



When comparing the current quarter’s performance against expectations, Canaan outperformed significantly. The company had set a revenue guidance of $33 million but achieved $35.1 million, a 6% increase over their forecast. This strong revenue performance is particularly noteworthy given the expected earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter was -$0.2, while the actual EPS came in narrower, reflecting a net loss of $39.4 million. This narrowing of losses by 71.7% sequentially and 53.3% year-over-year indicates substantial progress in the company’s financial health.



The market had anticipated challenges for Canaan in the first quarter, given the traditional slow season and the imminent Bitcoin halving. However, the company exceeded these expectations, showcasing its ability to adapt and thrive under less-than-ideal conditions. The sequential growth in mining revenue by 182.1% and the increase in Bitcoins held to a record high further underscore Canaan’s robust operational capabilities and strategic execution.





Canaan Provides Optimistic Guidance for Upcoming Quarter



Looking ahead, Canaan provided guidance that reflects cautious optimism. The company expects continued growth in mining revenue and computing power sales, driven by the new A1566 mining machines and sustained demand for the A14 series. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. and Hong Kong markets, a record-high Bitcoin price, and the seamless completion of the fourth Bitcoin halving are positive industry developments that could bolster Canaan’s performance in the coming quarters.



The bullish cycle for Bitcoin, spurred by recent industry milestones, is expected to attract more investment and interest, providing Canaan opportunities to enhance its market position and financial results further.

1 Billion USDT Minted by Tether Treasury: Market Awaits Impact


Through its treasury, Tether, the issuer of USDT, has minted a significant amount of its stablecoin. On-chain data reveals that Tether Treasury minted 1 billion USDT on May 16, at 16:50 UTC.
Given Tether’s leading market position, many think this large USDT issuance could impact crypto market movements.
Tether’s Recent USDT Minting and Its Market Implications

Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, clarified the context of this substantial minting. He indicated that 1 billion USDT was added to the inventory on Tron Network, specifying that this was an authorized transaction not yet issued.

“Meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps,” he added.

The last time Tether minted USDT was on April 16, when the market experienced a liquidity drain. According to a report from the on-chain analytical platform Lookonchain, Tether Treasury has minted 31 billion USDT in the past year. It minted those amounts on the TRON and Ethereum blockchains.
Interestingly, Tether minted these USDT when Bitcoin’s (BTC) price corrected to the $64,600 range. Since the end of 2022, each increase in the USDT supply has commonly had a positive effect on the development of the Bitcoin price.

Data from CryptoQuant reveals a high correlation between USDT supply and Bitcoin price movement, leading to an increase in volume and a dynamic environment for the Bitcoin price. Therefore, this sparks speculation among the crypto community that the new funds might be used to push Bitcoin’s price. Moreover, Lookonchain’s report indicated that the minted USDT last year pushed Bitcoin to reach above the $70,000 range.


“These minted USDT drove the price of BTC from $27,000 to $73,000,” it wrote.

Despite this speculation, Bitcoin’s price has stabilized between $64,000 and $66,000 in the last 24 hours. Last week, BTC fluctuated between $60,000 and $62,000 until the release of US inflation data. BeInCrypto reported a jump in Bitcoin’s price from $62,000 to $66,000 after April’s inflation data release suggests inflation might be slowing.

Bitcoin Price to New ATH Is Inevitable as US Congress Supports Banks’ Crypto Adoption | Coinspeaker



New Bitcoin addresses have been shrinking in the recent past, an indication more users are opting to tap on spot BTC ETFs for easier liquidity and enhanced security.

Bitcoin (BTC) price continued with the recent bullish outlook on Friday during the early London session. The flagship coin traded around $66,410 at the time of this writing, thus suggesting the bulls are ready to pump to a new all-time high soon. Moreover, Bitcoin price has consistently closed above the 50 daily Moving Average in the past three days, after being trapped in a crypto correction mode for the past two months.
Bitcoin Whales Anticipate New High Soon
According to on-chain data from market intelligence platform Santiment, there are currently 15,907 Bitcoin wallets holding at least 100 coins. Remarkably, Bitcoin whales hold a whopping 11.79 million coins, amid declining balances on centralized exchanges.




As Coinspeaker explained, the trading volume of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs has surged in the recent past with notable cash inflows. Furthermore, Grayscale’s GBTC has significantly reduced its daily Bitcoin sell-offs. According to first-quarter earnings reports, 937 financial institutions purchased Bitcoins through the recently approved spot BTC ETFs.
On Thursday, the United States Senate unanimously approved the CRA that overturned SAB 121, which mandated banks from holding clients’ crypto assets. Interestingly both sides of the political spectrum came together on the issue, thus indicating heightened interest and demand for digital assets in the United States.
“The Senate passing a CRA overturning SAB 121 is a win for financial innovation and a clear rebuke of the way the Biden admin and Gary Gensler have persecuted crypto. It also marks the 1st time Congress has passed standalone crypto legislation. We are just getting started,” US Senator from Wyoming, Cynthia Lummis, noted.
According to US House majority whip, Tom Emmer, President Joe Biden is under immense spotlight if he will approve or veto the CRA ahead of the upcoming elections. The US Congress has shown its disapproval of Gary Gensler’s decision to crack down on crypto projects, while other countries are adopting the web3 industry.


Midterm BTC Price Targets
Bitcoin price is well bolstered from a technical and fundamental point of view to rally further in the coming months. Less than a month since the fourth Bitcoin halving event and the underlying value has been retesting 2021’s all-time high, thus suggesting a super cycle at hand.


According to a popular crypto analyst alias Captain Faibik, Bitcoin price has been forming a bullish pennant flag pattern. As a result, the crypto analyst believes Bitcoin price will reach $86K soon, which also coincides with the 2.618 daily Fibonacci Extension.
However, the crypto analyst highlighted that Bitcoin price must consistently close above $68K in the coming weeks to validate the bullish uptrend.

We asked ChatGPT-4o what’s the best cryptocurrency for the gaming industry


The gaming industry reached $184 billion in revenue last year, and forecasts expect it to reach $200 billion by 2024. Finbold then asked ChatGPT-4o which cryptocurrency would best meet the demand for game-related payments, with the potential to embrace this market.
Notably, ChatGPT-4o is OpenAi‘s most recent update and advanced model for an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot. It has proven more accurate, faster, and cheaper than other models in the industry—becoming a favorite for efficient insights.
From a similar perspective, we asked the AI as follows:



“Which cryptocurrency is best for the gaming industry to adopt and implement for in-game and off-game payments and transactions, considering each cryptocurrency’s attributes (e.g., fees, time to finality or settlement, ease of use, ease of implementation, open-source, etc)? I want the objectively best tool for peer-to-peer digital money, not necessarily the most popular one, with the higher scores for these attributes. Justify your answer.”

ChatGPT-4o: Nano (XNO) is the best cryptocurrency for the gaming industry
As a result, ChatGPT-4o named Nano (XNO) the best cryptocurrency for the gaming industry to adopt and implement for in-game and off-game payments, considering the objective criteria.
In particular, the AI mentions Nano’s zero fees as ideal for micro-transactions, preventing players and developers from accumulating significant costs. Moreover, ChatGPT-4o judges Nano’s nearly instantaneous transaction finality as crucial for a seamless gaming experience, avoiding gameplay disruptions.
The block-lattice structure stands out among other blockchain competitors, being “relatively simple and efficient,” reducing integration complexity to gaming platforms. Additionally, Nano benefits from community-driven innovation and code transparency as open-source software, resulting in robust and secure applications.

Popular cryptocurrency alternatives for the gaming industry
However, XNO is still a low-cap cryptocurrency with around $150 million in market cap. On one side, this relatively small capitalization could offer an investment opportunity in case Nano embraces even a small share of the gaming industry’s financial volume, converted in demand and, thus, price appreciation.
Conversely, it also means that the so-far lack of market validation could become a competitive disadvantage against more popular cryptocurrencies. Finbold then asked ChatGPT-4o artificial intelligence for the three most popular alternatives, and the AI traced a comparison.
As a result, it mentioned Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and BNB Chain (BNB) as the most popular cryptocurrencies for gaming. Nevertheless, the final verdict was that XNO is still “the best cryptocurrency for the gaming industry to adopt.”

Current Nano adoption and gaming industry revenue
Interestingly, XNO has recently trended on Santiment‘s social feed due to a gaming platform adding Nano as an in-game payment. The SanBase Pro‘s AI summary highlighted Nano’s instant and fee-free transactions as “particularly appealing for the gaming industry.”

Wodo, the aforementioned gaming platform, demonstrated these attributes in a video, with a player collecting XNO in-game.

VIDEO

Conclusion and market analysis
In summary, the $184 billion gaming industry—as reported by Newzoo—could benefit from adopting Nano for payments, according to ChatGPT-4o AI’s objective analysis.
Therefore, even a small share of this market could drastically increase the market demand for the fully diluted $150 million XNO, potentially affecting its price and rewarding the coin’s early adopters and ecosystem.

As of this writing, XNO trades at $1.20 in the spot market, up 2% in the last seven days.

Sell Alert: Bitcoin faces imminent correction


After months of enthusiasm about a potential rally to unprecedented highs toward $100,000 or – according to some prominent investors – toward $300,000, building up in the wake of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approval, a new record value near $73,000, and the halving event in April, Bitcoin (BTC) price movement turned relatively stagnant and even threatened a collapse in early May.
By the middle of the month – and particularly after the latest CPI report came out lower than was feared – the world’s premier cryptocurrency again took off, gaining nearly 5% in a week and surging from a low near $60,000 to a press time price of $66,357.

While many traders are hopeful the rally signals an end to the crypto market’s stagnant phase and a full return to the bull cycle, technical analysis (TA) analysis reveals that it may not be just smooth sailing ahead.


TD Sequential warns of imminent BTC correction
Shortly after the most recent Bitcoin rally gained steam, Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto analyst, shared in X that the world’s premier cryptocurrency may be facing an imminent correction.
TD Sequential, a common technical analysis tool designed to detect the timing of a trend reversal of confirmation by analyzing an asset’s earlier performance over a set time frame, issued a strong sell signal on Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart, per the expert.

Martinez also added that the correction is likely to unfold over between one and four candlesticks.
Bitcoin price chart
Though technical analysis may indicate a price drop, Bitcoin has, in the recent past, experienced a significant surge. 
Indeed, after undergoing a period of consolidation and heightened volatility paired with mostly sideways trading, the coin has reentered the rally that has seen it rise 54.46% since the start of 2024.

Though BTC is yet to reclaim the highs reached in March, the most recent surge has enabled the cryptocurrency to erase the losses of early May, and Bitcoin is – having risen 5.73% in the 30-day chart – very close to its highs from April 22.

sUSD Lost Its Stability to $1, This Altcoin Price Reacted! - Bitcoin Sistemi


A new one has been added to the depeg (stablecoin losing its peg to $1) events, which have been increasing in number recently in the cryptocurrency market.
Synthetix's decentralized stablecoin sUSD lost its peg to the dollar and fell below $1, The Block reported.


This decline was due to increased selling on decentralized exchanges, with sUSD falling below the stable price of $1 to as low as $0.92.
sUSD price later recovered to $0.96.





Chaos Labs, risk manager for the Aave lending protocol, stated that the depeg on sUSD was triggered by a withdrawal from the sBTC/wBTC liquidity pool by a major liquidity provider on the Curve decentralized exchange.
As the user continued to sell sUSD, it caused the price to drop to as low as $0.92.


The depeg experienced in sUSD was also reflected in the price of Synthetix (SNX). At this point, the SNX price, which has fallen in recent hours, continues to trade at $ 2.67.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Outlines Reason Behind Senate Seat Campaign - Here's What It Is | Bitcoinist.com


								Pro-XRP attorney and well-known cryptocurrency supporter John E. Deaton has disclosed the primary motivation for his Senate run in the United States, highlighting the critical need for improved protections for citizens and retail investors. Deaton, who rose to fame for his outspoken criticism of regulatory overreach and steadfast support of XRP, feels that the legislative framework now in place under US Senator Elizabeth Warren is insufficient to protect common investors in the quickly developing digital asset market.
Pro-XRP Lawyer Blasts Elizabeth Warren
According to John E. Deaton, US Senator Elizabeth Warren has failed to deliver a safe environment for working families, retail investors, and consumers during her tenure. Warren’s failure to protect these people in the same manner that she does for the disgraced Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chairman Martin Gruenberg is the major reason why the pro-XRP lawyer is running for the US Senate seat.

In a scathing report published on May 7, it was found the FDIC, under the management of Gruenberg, committed pervasive sexual harassment, bullying, and discrimination. 
The report read:
As detailed in the report, the independent review found that, for far too many employees and for far too long, the FDIC has failed to provide a workplace safe from sexual harassment, discrimination, and other interpersonal misconduct. It further found that management’s responses to allegations of misconduct, as well as the culture and conditions that gave rise to them, have been insufficient and ineffective.
The independent investigation included specific examples of managers sending their staff members pictures of themselves naked or taking them to brothels while on business vacations.
About 10% of the workforce reported these incidents or other instances of personal wrongdoing at the firm, including Gruenberg’s own actions. Despite the embarrassing report, Gruenberg, who has been working with the firm since 2005, is still unwilling to step down as the company’s head. 
Warren has allegedly been supporting the FDIC chair, as Deaton noted that following Greunberg’s nomination by US President Joe Biden, Warren expressed her approval of the decision, basically advocating Gruenberg as a champion for customers.
During the vote which was between Martin Gruenberg and Adrienne Harris, Warren voted in favor of Gruenberg. She said that Harris is too moderate on cryptocurrency and that Gruenberg is a radical, calling Harris a savvy centrist.
Also, it is noteworthy that since the allegations, Warren has reportedly been spearheading an effort to keep Gruenberg safe behind closed doors. Her efforts allegedly aided the FDIC Chair in preparing for this week’s congressional hearings, where he was expected to face intense questioning about the claims.
Political Agenda Over Transparency
So far, the pro-XRP attorney has slammed Warren, claiming that the US Senator lacks proper leadership qualities. “Leadership is about accepting that sometimes you get it wrong and sometimes, you support the wrong person,” he stated.

By supporting Gruenberg, Deaton believes that Warren once again prioritized her political goal over acting honorably and morally by safeguarding these workers. 
In addition, rather than owning up to her error and calling Gruenberg’s registration, she is aiding him. As a result, Deaton highlights the Senator’s action as another instance of her selective outrage and hypocrisy.

Market watch: Bitcoin, Ethereum traders on the spot with $2.13B options expiry - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin maintained a balanced Put/Call Ratio ahead of the deadline
ETH traders face potential losses as its price was close to the maximum pain point

According to data from Deribit, the market-leading derivatives exchange, Bitcoin [BTC] options with a notional value of $1.18 billion will expire on 17 May.
Also, Ethereum [ETH] contracts, valued at $950 million, would expire on the same day. At press time, the Put/Call Ratio for Bitcoin was 0.61 while the maximum pain point was $62,500.
Source: Deribit
Where do both BTC and ETH stand?
In trading options, a put means that a trader has placed a position to place a contract up for sale. In this case, the expectation is that the price of the asset decreases so the position can make gains.
On the other hand, a call implies a purchase, indicating that the bet is for a price hike. If the reading of the Put/Call Ratio is 0.70 and above, it means that traders are buying more puts than calls.
Conversely, a reading of 0.50 and below implies a bullish sentiment in the market. For Bitcoin, the ratio revealed that the number of put and call positions was close, indicating a balance between bearish and bullish positions.
For ETH, the Put/Call Ratio was 0.21 – A sign that most of the bets were bullish. ETH had a maximum pain point of $3,000. If the cryptocurrency trades at this level or below by the end of the day, a lot of traders might face huge financial losses.
Source: Deribit
It would be the same for Bitcoin if the price hits $62,500 or drops below it. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was $66,443, indicating that it might be difficult for the crypto to cause a lot of pain.
However, at the same time, ETH was valued at $3,018. The closeness of this to the maximum pain point leaves ETH traders at a big risk of losing.
ETH’s weakness has not deterred future bets
In addition, Greeks.live, an options trading repository, commented on the matter. The handle agreed with AMBCrypto’s analysis for Bitcoin via X. For Ethereum, it noted,
“Btc is more balanced between long and short, while the ETH price is weak leading to continued weakening of the market confidence, and selling calls have become the absolute main deal.”
However, data from Deribit revealed that traders expect ETH to recover from its struggles going forward. Based on AMBCrypto’s observations, there has been an increase in bets targeting $3,600 between the last week of May and June.
One of the reasons for this prediction could be the looming SEC decision on the numerous Ethereum ETF applications. A nod on this front could drive ETH’s price higher, and traders might gain from the same.

Realistic or not, here’s ETH’s market cap in BTC terms

 
On the other hand, delay or rejection could force the price of the altcoin further lower. Should this be the case, traders might have to deal with huge financial losses.

Major lending protocol hit by $20M hack; Bitcoin DeFi tool loses $4.3M


In a series of alarming incidents, two prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, Sonne Finance, and ALEX Lab, have been targeted by sophisticated hacks, resulting in a combined loss of $24.3 million in cryptocurrencies.
Sonne Finance halted operations after a $20 million exploit, while ALEX Lab lost $4.3 million due to a suspected private key compromise. Both platforms are now in a race to recover their stolen assets and prevent future breaches.
Sonne Finance: $20 million heist
Lending protocol Sonne Finance was forced to pause operations after suffering a hack that drained $20 million worth of cryptocurrencies from the market. 


The attack, which targeted Sonne Finance’s USD Coin (USDC) and Wrapped Ether (WETH) contracts, was detected on May 14 by Web3 security firm Cyvers.

Sonne Finance announced the suspension of all markets on the Optimism (OP) blockchain to mitigate further damage. Partnering with Cyvers, the protocol is actively investigating the breach and exploring options to recover the stolen funds, including negotiating a bug bounty with the hacker. ‘
However, blockchain investigator PeckShield reported that the hacker has already moved a substantial portion of the loot ($7.8 million) to a new wallet address.

The hacker then swapped 59 Wrapped BTC (WBTC) for roughly 1,185 Ether (ETH) and 183,000 Dai (DAI), indicating an intent to use a privacy protocol like Tornado Cash to obscure the transaction trail.
Details of the exploit
According to the incident analysis by Certik ,the attack exploited a known bug in Sonne’s Compound v2 forks via a donation attack, manipulating the platform’s exchange rates by donating large amounts of cryptocurrency. 
This manipulation tricked the system into overestimating its collateral, allowing the hacker to siphon off millions. Blockexplorer data showed the attacker transferred millions of VELO, ETH , USDC following the manipulation, later converting these to $8 million in Bitcoin and Ether.
The SONNE token has since plummeted by 60%, drastically reducing its market cap to $20 million, even though developers managed to prevent an additional $6.5 million from being siphoned off once the attack was identified.
ALEX Lab: $4.3 million compromise
Simultaneously, ALEX Lab, a Bitcoin DeFi tool, was drained of over $4.3 million in various tokens due to a suspected private key compromise. Security researchers from CertiK revealed that the attackers likely obtained a private key controlling ALEX’s XLink bridge, a service facilitating token transfers between different blockchains.

The breach resulted in the loss of over $300,000 worth of Bitcoin, $3.3 million in stablecoins, and $75,000 in Sugar Kingdom (SKO) tokens. 
ALEX developers confirmed the hack and claimed they knew the attacker’s identity, offering a 10% bounty for the return of 90% of the stolen funds. Major exchanges have since frozen funds associated with the hacker to prevent further misuse.
The recent hacks on Sonne Finance and ALEX Lab highlight the persistent security challenges facing DeFi platforms. 
As these platforms work to recover stolen assets and enhance their security frameworks, the incidents serve as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.

$FLOKI Price Is Up 471% So Far in 2024: Does This Year’s Rally Have Staying Power? | Cryptoglobe


                                
Floki ($FLOKI) began as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency based on Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, rapidly transforming into a comprehensive ecosystem supported by a passionate community. It blends meme culture with real-world utility, distinguishing itself in the crypto space. Central to Floki’s ecosystem is Valhalla, an NFT gaming metaverse that offers battles, asset trading, and collection opportunities, allowing users to earn rewards. FlokiFi extends into decentralized finance (DeFi), providing tools for staking and asset locking, with plans to expand its DeFi offerings. Additionally, Floki University educates users on crypto and blockchain technology.



FlokiPlaces enhances the ecosystem by serving as a marketplace for NFTs and merchandise, emphasizing the project’s utility beyond its meme coin origins. Floki’s dedication to philanthropy and partnerships highlights its mission to position the FLOKI token as a positive force in the cryptocurrency world alongside its strategic development.



The FLOKI token operates on both the Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain (BNB) blockchains, providing a multi-chain presence that offers users versatility in accessing various decentralized applications and services across these platforms.



FLOKI is currently trading at $0.0002092, down 1.6% in the past 24-hour period. It recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $288 million, with a market capitalization of $2.02 billion, securing 59th position in the market. Although the FLOKI token reached an all-time high of $0.0003365 on November 4, 2021, it has since dropped by 37.8%. However, this year, the FLOKI price has increased by over 471%.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In March, the Floki team unveiled an ambitious roadmap for 2024, aiming to establish FLOKI as the world’s most recognized and utilized cryptocurrency. Leveraging its meme appeal, robust community, aggressive marketing strategies, and practical utility, Floki is positioning itself for significant developments in the crypto space.



Key Developments and Phases:



Phase 1 Initiatives: Floki is expanding its presence on Venus, a leading lending protocol on the BNB chain, by seeking integration into the Venus Core Pool. This move is expected to provide Floki holders with deeper liquidity and broader borrowing options using their tokens as collateral. Additionally, Floki is integrating Venus markets into its user interface, simplifying access to liquidity. The introduction of Floki Debit Cards and the launch of the initial version of the University of Floki are also on the horizon. The University will offer free asynchronous courses on crypto topics, empowering users with knowledge about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.



Phase 2 Expansions: The launch of a cross-chain trading bot will facilitate buying and selling across major blockchains, enhancing the utility and deflationary nature of the $FLOKI token.

Customer Sues Dolce & Gabbana Over Delayed NFT Delivery and 97% Drop in Value - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Luke Brown, a disgruntled customer, has filed a class-action lawsuit against Dolce & Gabbana USA Inc. and NFT marketplace UNXD in the US District Court, Southern District of New York. The case, numbered 24-cv-03807, alleges that the defendants failed to deliver promised products and abandoned the project, resulting in significant financial losses for Brown and other affected customers.



Disgruntled Customer Sues Fashion Firm Over Botched NFT Delivery



Brown claims to have spent $6,000 on DGFamily NFTs, which he alleges have lost 97% of their value, approximately $5,800, due to the defendants’ actions. The complaint states that the NFTs and associated benefits were delivered late. The promised digital outfits were delayed by 20 days, and usability was delayed an additional 11 days due to a lack of platform approval. As a result, the NFTs’ value dropped significantly. The law firm representing Brown has issued a statement alleging a pattern of promising and failing to deliver products, followed by abandoning the project and community.





What are DGFamily NFTs?



DGFamily NFTs were announced in February 2022 and released during the first Metaverse Fashion Week in March 2022, hosted by Decentraland in partnership with UNXD. The collection showcased 20 bespoke metaverse wearables designed to celebrate creativity and innovation in the metaverse. These NFTs were available exclusively to DGFamily Box holders and aimed to embody the unique DGDNA 3.0, transcending reality and the metaverse.



Holders of DGFamily NFTs were promised benefits such as access to exclusive drops, invitations to physical and digital events, collaboration opportunities, and more. However, the alleged delays and abandonment of the project have left many customers, like Brown, feeling misled and seeking legal recourse.



The impact of this case extends beyond Brown, as it has been filed as a class-action lawsuit on behalf of other affected customers. The outcome of this legal battle could set a precedent for the responsibilities and obligations of firms that dipped into NFTs and the metaverse.

‘It’s Over for Memecoins’: Trader Who Nailed 2022 Crypto Bottom Turns Bearish on dogwifhat and Pepe - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								A trader known for making accurate crypto calls is suddenly turning bearish on memecoins.
Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 550,400 followers on the social media platform X that memecoin projects could suddenly collapse.










“I’m personally convinced it’s over for memes, rest of the market might get out of this ok but I’m expecting memes to giga rug (gigantic rug pull). Good luck if your portfolio is in the 10th iteration of a dog or a cat.” 
Zeroing in on specific memecoins, the analyst warns that Pepe (PEPE) could plummet to a range low if it fails to hold as support the $0.00000998 level on the daily chart.
“PEPE: decent breakout, technically bullish as long as it holds. If it fails and breaks back in the range, I’ll be shorting it targeting range lows. Prefer WIF but might spread my bets.”
Source: DonAlt/X
Pepe is trading for $0.00001004 at time of writing, down 4.5% in the last 24 hours.
The analyst also says memecoin dogwifhat (WIF) could plummet to around the range low of $2.23 if it fails to flip into support the range high of $3.15.
“WIF: actively looking to short the range high. Target somewhere below the range low. Wrong if the range is broken properly.”
Source: DonAlt/X
WIF is trading for $2.83, down 7.6% in the last 24 hours.
The analyst also lists several of his reasons for being bearish on memecoins.
“Reasons for why I’m bearish memes: 

There are infinite memes already.
Every day there are thousands more.
Bunch of people bought into the GME-meme rotation narrative (which is beyond retarded in my opinion).
Charts don’t look so good across the board.
Sentiment is heavily skewed bull.”

JPMorgan Raises Bitcoin Mining Cost Estimate to $45,000


							

JPMorgan raises Bitcoin production cost to $45,000.



Slower hashrate decline after halving event impacts cost.



Long-term cost expected to trend closer to $42,000.




JPMorgan analysts have revised their estimate for the cost of producing one bitcoin to $45,000, citing recent changes in the Bitcoin mining hashrate. This update comes after the quadrennial halving event, which reduced the block reward for miners by 50%. Previously, the bank’s analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, projected a production cost of $42,000. However, they now acknowledge that ongoing adjustments in hashrate and mining efficiency have necessitated a revision.







JPMorgan initially anticipated a significant decline in hashrate following the halving. This decrease was expected as miners with less efficient equipment would become unprofitable and exit the network. However, the actual decline in hashrate has been more gradual than anticipated. Consequently, the current hashrate and power consumption levels suggest a higher central estimate for the production cost, currently set at $45,000.  Despite this upward revision, the analysts maintain their medium-term price target of $42,000 for production costs.



Mr. Panigirtzoglou emphasized the dynamic nature of production costs, which are influenced by both hashrate and mining equipment efficiency.  The current $45,000 estimate is subject to change as the network adjusts to the post-halving environment. The team expects the production cost to trend closer to the $42,000 mark once the hashrate stabilizes and mining efficiency improves.



The recent launch of the Bitcoin Runes protocol provided a temporary boost to transaction fees, offering miners some relief after the halving. However, this increase proved short-lived, with user activity and Runes-related fees dropping significantly in recent weeks. This highlights the ongoing challenge for Bitcoin miners in securing stable revenue streams, particularly in the post-halving environment.



A decline in power consumption exceeding the hashrate decrease suggests an exodus of less efficient miners.  The analysts view this  as a natural feedback loop tied to Bitcoin prices. When the price falls, unprofitable miners are forced to leave the network, leading to a reduction in overall computing power for mining. This, in turn, contributes to a lower cost of bitcoin production. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $65,634.85, with a slight decline of 0.15% over the past 24 hours.









The revised production cost estimate by JPMorgan underscores the intricate relationship between Bitcoin mining and market dynamics. While the short-term cost may be slightly higher than previously anticipated, analysts believe long-term efficiency improvements will eventually bring it closer to their initial projection. The success of Bitcoin as a digital asset hinges on the ability of its mining ecosystem to adapt and evolve alongside market fluctuations.

                        The XRP price has gained by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, rising to $0.5209 on a day when the crypto market as a whole has risen by the same percentage.XRP is now up by 1% in a week and by 3.5% in the last 30 days, with the major alt also sitting on a modest 16% increase in the past year.This pales in comparison to the returns posted by other major tokens in the past 12 months (e.g. BTC, ETH, SOL), yet it also raises the possibility that XRP could compensate by enjoying some above-average gains later in the year.And with Ripple’s MD for the Middle East and Africa revealing in a talk that the firm plans to expand deeper into the region, the XRP price could see sustained rallies in the coming months.XRP Price Prediction as Ripple Expands in Africa – Will Custody Services Boost XRP Above $0.52?
XRP’s chart is looking promising today, with the coin looking ready to post some more gains today after dipping a little overnight.What’s interesting is that the coin is about to test its resistance level (red), which stands at around $0.525.Source: TradingViewIf it can decisively break through this ceiling, then it may extend its gains into the weekend.Other indicators suggests that this is quite possible, with XRP’s relative strength index (purple) rising towards 70 once again after sinking to 50 in the very early hours of the morning.Similarly, the alt’s 30-day moving average (orange) is also rising again, having crossed over the 200-day average (blue) late on Wednesday evening.The coin’s 24-hour trading volume has also risen in recent days, with its move close to $1 billion suggesting an elevated interest in the token.There are various reasons to be bullish about the XRP price, with the first being the general direction of the wider market, which after a lull in mid-spring looks ready to grow again.Yet there are also fundamentals factors at play, with Ripple announcing this week its plans to launch custody services in the MENA region and deepen its presence in the region overall.Such news comes in addition to the imminent end of the long-running Ripple-SEC case, which is now in the final settlement phase.It’s possible that Ripple will face a settlement fine as high as $2 billion, yet the upshot of such a penalty is that it will draw a line in the sand and enable the firm to continue growing.And in the long run, this points to a rising XRP price, which could reach $1 by the close of 2024.High-Potential Meme Tokens Could Bring Bigger Gains
The only real issue with XRP is that, because it’s a coin that rests more on fundamentals than hype, it may take a while to enjoy some properly big returns.However, traders looking for quicker and bigger gains may do well to investigate some of the newer meme tokens that are currently doing the rounds.One of the most promising is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain crypto that has raised more than $15 million in its presale.Source: DogeverseDogeverse’s sale is in its final phase and will be ending soon, with investors having rushed to buy its tokens on the back of some exciting fundamentals and tokenomics.As the first ever multi-chain Doge-themed meme token, Dogeverse will run on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.What this means is that DOGEVERSE will attract more use and demand than it would have as a single-chain coin, which in turn could see its price rise higher than it might otherwise.What’s particularly bullish about its tokenomics is that it has a hard cap of 120 million, so in theory it could become deflationary over time.Added to this is its staking mechanism, which could see a big proportion of its total supply exit circulation.VIDEOSuch features help account for why its presale has already done so well, with latecomers able to get involved by going to the official Dogeverse website.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Fantom Blockchain Soars with Sonic Upgrade and TVL Surge | Coinspeaker



The recent strong performance being demonstrated by FTM token is an indicator that Fantom’s strategic initiatives may be beginning to bear fruit.

The Fantom blockchain’s native token FTM has emerged as one of the top-performing non-meme cryptocurrencies over the past week. However, the surge in its value may not be unconnected to the introduction of Fantom’s latest upgrade, dubbed Sonic.
Over the past seven days, FTM saw its value appreciate by over 9.20% to hit 80.3 cents. In comparison with most other tokens, FTM clearly had one of the best weeks in retrospect, signaling that there may be more than meets the eye about FTM’s recent success.




FTM Token Sees Remarkable Gains amid Network Enhancements
The Fantom Foundation has been actively promoting its Sonic upgrade. As of publication, 25 out of 60 nodes have already completed the transition. However, the full upgrade will only be realized after at least 40 nodes adopt the new software.
The Sonic upgrade is aimed at enhancing the network’s capabilities. A major selling point of the upgrade is that it is set to boost transaction speeds to an impressive 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) with a 1.1-second finality. This marks a major improvement over the current rate of just over 2.5 TPS that on-chain data suggests.
Interestingly, technological advancements brought by Sonic are not the only factors contributing to the performance of FTM. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has also shown remarkable growth. As data from DeFiLlama shows, Fantom’s TVL surged by nearly 83% in just two days. That is, it went from $111 million on May 14 to $203 million on May 16.
It might be worth noting that the TVL jump is an indication that there is a broader trend of increasing TVLs across various decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, yield aggregators, and other decentralized applications (dApps) that operate within the Fantom network. Many of these dApps that support the Fantom blockchain saw between 10% to 20% rises in their TVLs.  That is, within the last week.
Overall, the recent strong performance being displayed by FTM token does not exactly come as a surprise. It is merely an indicator that Fantom’s strategic initiatives may be beginning to bear fruit. With the successful implementation of the Sonic upgrade, Fantom is poised to deliver even greater value and utility to its users.

Crypto Influencers Exposed: Following Their Advice Could Cost You Big - Research


								Retail investors flocking to the digital currency market are finding themselves bombarded with advice from social media crypto influencers. These self-proclaimed gurus promise insights and recommendations, but a new study suggests their pronouncements may be more flash than substance.
Crypto Influencers: The Impact Of Tweets
The research, conducted by a team at leading universities, analyzed the impact of tweets from over 180 crypto influencers on follower behavior and token prices.
The results paint a concerning picture. While tweets were found to trigger short-term price increases, averaging nearly 2% within the first two days, these gains quickly evaporated. In fact, the study found a cumulative return drop of nearly 7% within a month of influencer endorsements.

The researchers observed a distinct pattern. According to Dr. Kenneth Merkley, co-author of the study, influencer tweets could create a temporary price surge, but this was often followed by a significant decline, suggesting the buying frenzy wasn’t based on long-term fundamentals.
The findings resonate with real-world examples. A recent report, for example, shows the ill-fated CryptoZoo project, spearheaded by YouTuber Logan Paul, which attracted millions in investments before facing accusations of being a “rug pull” – a scheme where developers abandon a project after taking investor money.
Crypto Influencer Recommendations Often Lead To Losses: Study
Recommendations from crypto influencers often result in losses, according to scientists from three universities. Chinese journalist Colin Wu reported that, on average, positions opened based on signals from crypto influencers on X (formerly Twitter) showed a decline of 2.20% after 10 days and 6.50% after 30 days.
This data comes from researchers at Indiana University, Harvard Business School, and Texas A&M University, who analyzed 36,000 tweets from prominent crypto influencers. The study covered recommendations for 1,600 different assets.


Celebrity Hype And The SEC Steps In
The rise of influencer marketing in the crypto space hasn’t gone unnoticed by regulators. The report highlights the European Commission’s recent complaint regarding potentially misleading crypto promotions on social media.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66.359. Chart: TradingView
Investors Beware
Additionally, the new European Markets Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations could hold influencers accountable for market manipulation through their endorsements.
In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already cracked down on celebrities promoting unregistered cryptocurrencies. The research mentions high-profile cases like Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather Jr. facing legal action for failing to disclose payments for promoting the EthereumMax token, which subsequently crashed in value.

The study underscores the crucial role of responsible investing in the volatile crypto market. Social media influencers can be entertaining, but they shouldn’t be the primary source of investment advice.

What happens if Biden vetoes Senate bid to cancel SEC's crypto rule? - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Yesterday, the US Senate voted in favor of H.J.Res. 109, a bill aiming to repeal Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development is seen as potentially beneficial for the crypto industry’s future growth. However, the bill now faces a veto threat from President Biden.What happens if President Biden vetoes the bill?The good thing is that the bill could still become law without the President’s signature.Should Biden choose not to sign H.J.Res. 109, it will be returned to Congress along with his reasons for disapproval. Congress then has the option to override the veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate.If they succeed, the bill becomes law despite the President’s disapproval.On the other hand, if Congress fails to secure a two-thirds majority, the veto will stand, and the bill will not become law.If President Biden wants to veto the bill, he might also want to consider whether it’s worth it, and it all comes down to the US presidential election.Voter polarization on crypto regulation could potentially influence political polarization, but as of now, crypto does not significantly impact voting behavior. According to a Pew Research report in April last year, the issue doesn’t resonate deeply with most voters, with only 17% of American adults having used crypto.In short, crypto appears to be unpopular now, but it’s noteworthy that voters often base their decisions heavily on economic conditions, which, however, are not favorable for Biden.According to The Economist, persistent inflation and economic challenges under Biden’s administration could sway public opinion against him. How Biden has managed foreign policy issues could also impact his re-election prospects. Any perceived failures or unpopular decisions in these areas could lead to a loss of support.With key topics possibly not working in his favor, Biden may want to steer clear of seeking support from the US crypto community and now is the opportunity as his major rival, Donald Trump, has already taken action.Trump has recently expressed support for the crypto industry, promising to end hostility toward it if elected. While skeptics might view Trump’s shift as a strategic move to garner support, his previous engagement with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) lends some credibility to his promises.

U.S Senate votes to repeal SEC's crypto custody policy - SAB 121 - but... - AMBCrypto



United States’ Senate voted to scrap the SEC’s SAB 121 crypto custody policy 
Crypto backers supported the move, but whether the U.S president will veto it remains to be seen

In a surprise bipartisan move on Thursday, the U.S Senate voted to repeal SEC’s controversial SAB 121 policy. The SAB 121, an acronym for Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, is a policy by the SEC that critics viewed as a deterrence to investment banks from large-scale crypto custody services. 
Interestingly, Democrats joined their Republican counterparts and successfully voted for the resolution to repeal the policy with 60-38 votes. 
Here, it is worth noting that the White House had previously warned against such a move, claiming that it could constrain the SEC’s ability to protect crypto investors. The statement also said that President Joe Biden would use his veto if the need arose. 
Community reactions to SAB 121 resolution
The president’s veto threat will be the next test as the resolution will now head to his desk. Commenting on Biden’s threat, the Blockchain Association, quipped, 
“The threat of a presidential veto denies the fact that there is a growing awareness among the voting public, particularly young people, that crypto is something our elected officials should care about.”
The Association also highlighted how dire such a move could be, adding that about 48% of American voters don’t trust candidates that interfere with cryptos. 
United States’ SEC published the controversial SAB 121 guidance two years ago (March 2020). It instructed entities safeguarding crypto assets on behalf of others to include the assets in their balance sheets. 
This was contrary to traditional stocks held by the same custody entities, meaning that crypto assets would be treated differently. Apart from the need for high capital reserves to cushion against a risky balance sheet, the uncertainty from SAB 121 tipped Nasdaq and BNY Mellon to back out of crypto custody. 
Industry players have long voiced potential risks associated with Coinbase’s dominance in the crypto-custody sector. Notably, Coinbase is the custodian for 8 out of the 11 US spot BTC ETF issuers. Hence, some believe repealing SAB 121 could help mitigate the risks associated with a single-point of failure. 
Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley had this to say when the repeal went through, 
“U.S lawmakers want to foster sensible development of crypto in the U.S. Not some lawmakers. The majority. 2024 is the beginning of the mainstream era.”

In this episode, Evan Zinaman, founder and principal at Trailbreak, delves into the first-of-its-kind case of the Bueno brothers, who face Department of Justice charges for exploiting Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in a cryptocurrency scheme. Accused of manipulating transaction ordering to create an arbitrage opportunity, the brothers are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud as well as wire fraud itself.
Zinaman explores the broader implications of MEV exploitation, addresses critics who say that the MEV exploiters just got a taste of their own medicine, and the need for block building participants to consider their legal and compliance responsibilities.
Show highlights:

What the charges against the Bueno brothers are about
How block building works on Ethereum and how the relay was manipulated by the Bueno brothers
The different types of MEV and which ones are acceptable
Why these charges could be seen as a “vanilla fraud,” according to Evan
Whether the benefits of MEV outweigh the cons of it
The lack of terms of service in the MEV space
How the regulators’ attention to the space has changed over time

Vitalik Buterin impressed by OpenAI's GPT 4


                                Vitalik Reveals: GPT-4 Passes Turing Test                                Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has always been a supporter of new technologies, whether it's creating a big Blockchain network like Ethereum or updating it with new features over time. Not only that, Buterin doesn't shy away from praising his own firm along with others that are innovating in the technology sector. In line with this, Ethereum's founder shared information about OpenAI's GPT-4, stating that it has successfully passed the Turing Test. The Turing Test is a benchmark for AI systems, determining how human-like a conversational model is.Referring to recent preprint research from the University of California, San Diego, Buterin wrote that finally, a production model has passed the Turing Test. Along with this, Ethereum's founder praised OpenAI's GPT-4, saying, This is incredible, this system is capable of fooling more than half of the people. This technology talks like humans and is capable of fooling anyone.Research on GPT-4 at the University of CaliforniaA recent study published by the University of California San Diego revealed that people are unable to distinguish between GPT-4 and humans in a Turing test. The research involved 500 human test subjects who participated in a blind test, where they interacted with both human and AI models. The aim was to determine whether the subjects could accurately identify which interactions involved humans and which involved the AI model.According to the research findings, in 56% of cases, humans mistakenly identified GPT-4 as a human. This suggests that in the majority of instances, the AI model successfully convinced humans that it was one of them. This highlights the gradual advancement of AI technology towards emulating human intelligence.The research indicates that AI, such as GPT-4, is becoming increasingly proficient at mimicking human behavior. It demonstrates that AI is progressing towards being able to engage in human-like communication and reasoning, potentially surpassing human capabilities in certain tasks over time.Growing Interest and Investment in Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence (AI) is gaining traction as people see its potential for the future. This has led many big tech companies, like Google and Microsoft, as well as individuals like Elon Musk, to get involved in AI. Vitalik Buterin, known for co-founding Ethereum, recently praised OpenAI's GPT-4 chatbot. It's possible he's considering working with OpenAI or starting his own AI projects, but nothing official has been announced yet. Currently, various companies are exploring AI opportunities and developing their own chatbot models. Elon Musk, for instance, has introduced his AI chatbot Grok to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT.Also Read:- SEBI Explores Regulatory Options for Cryptocurrency

Shiba Inu Skyrockets 1,590% in Key Metric as Whales Dive in to Save SHIB Price

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a 1,590% surge in large holder inflows, thanks to significant activity from whales, which are individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of SHIB.According to IntoTheBlock data, Large Holders Inflow, which tracks the funds going into addresses belonging to whales or large holders, is up 1,590%, owing to a significant surge in the last 24 hours. Notably, large holder inflows increased from 728.17 billion SHIB on May 15 to 3.97 trillion SHIB on May 16. Spike in Large Holders Inflows often suggests two things. The first is that considerable buying activity may be taking place. Many whale addresses typically buy on centralized exchanges and subsequently shift their purchases into cold storage.Second, spikes in large holder inflows can indicate price bottoms because whale addresses prefer to buy in bulk after significant corrections. Both scenarios might be likely as Shiba Inu's price battles key resistance.At the time of writing, SHIB was down 2.5% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002472. The last three days have been a battle for the SHIB price, with bulls persistently attempting to surpass the daily SMA 50 at $0.00002524.Shiba Inu bulls' attempts to break through this crucial resistance on May 15 were unsuccessful, with the SHIB price closing lower. Bulls are still making another try, with SHIB's price reaching intraday highs of $0.00002509.While bulls are in a bid to push the SHIB price higher, they are also making frantic moves to save the 56.65 trillion SHIB level where the cryptocurrency currently trades.According to IntoTheBlock data, 56.65 trillion SHIB are being held by 54,280 addresses in the range of $0.000023 to $0.000026 at an average price of $0.000025.That said, eyes are peeled on Shiba Inu's next price direction in the context of the 56.55 trillion SHIB range and a break above the tough MA 50 barrier. Whether the 1,590% surge in whale inflows will impact the SHIB price remains to be seen.

Michaël van de Poppe on His Crypto Investment Strategy | Cryptoglobe


                                
Michaël van de Poppe is a well-known cryptocurrency analyst and trader. He is based at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and is widely recognized for his insights into the crypto markets. Van de Poppe frequently shares his analyses and predictions on various social media platforms, particularly X. His expertise covers a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various altcoins. Van de Poppe is also noted for his work in educating the crypto community through articles, videos, and market updates.



On May 16, Van de Poppe revealed through a detailed explanation on social media that he had sold all his Bitcoin holdings. Van de Poppe clarified that his decision was not due to a loss of faith in Bitcoin or a belief that Bitcoin had peaked for this cycle. Instead, he strategically aimed to reallocate his assets for potentially greater returns later in the year.



Van de Poppe highlighted the influx of major institutional investors into the Bitcoin market, with pension funds, insurance companies, and large hedge funds purchasing Bitcoin through the newly approved Spot Bitcoin ETF. Additionally, he mentioned, the CME Group’s announcement of a futures ETF and the prospect of option-based trading further established Bitcoin as a mature asset.



Despite the increasing institutional involvement, Van de Poppe noted that the simplicity of Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is diminishing. He explained that the impact of the Bitcoin halving on market dynamics is likely to decrease over time as institutions focus more on managing risk in their portfolios, influenced by macroeconomic factors and liquidity conditions.



Van de Poppe detailed his strategy, emphasizing the different methods to maximize returns in a Bitcoin bull cycle. He outlined four main approaches: selling Bitcoin at highs to buy back at lower prices, using leverage for trading futures, accumulating Bitcoin through earnings, and trading altcoins to increase Bitcoin holdings. Van de Poppe chose the latter, acknowledging its high risk but also its potential for significant returns.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

He justified his decision to move from Bitcoin to altcoins by highlighting the current market conditions and potential for altcoins to yield higher returns. Van de Poppe pointed out that the rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins typically occurs around the halving cycle. However, this cycle has shown continued strength in Bitcoin, prompting him to anticipate an eventual rotation that could benefit altcoins significantly.



Van de Poppe also discussed the potential impact of a spot Ethereum ETF approval despite the current regulatory challenges. He believes that the market may be underestimating the likelihood and timing of such an approval, which could lead to a significant market turnaround if the outcome is better than expected.



In his analysis, the popular analyst mentioned several key developments that could influence the crypto market, including the FIT21 bill, which aims to provide a regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S., and the XRP lawsuit, which could set a precedent for other altcoins. He believes that the regulatory clarity and potential positive outcomes from these events could catalyze a substantial recovery in altcoin prices.



While Van de Poppe acknowledged the risks associated with his strategy, including a potential loss of 50-80%, he expressed confidence in the possibility of achieving returns ranging from 300-900% in Bitcoin value within the next 6-12 months. He also anticipated further gains if Bitcoin stabilizes, projecting an overall potential return of 900-4500% over the next 12-24 months in this super cycle.



Ultimately, Van de Poppe’s decision to sell his Bitcoin and invest in altcoins is driven by his belief in the transformative potential of the Web 3.0 ecosystem and the ongoing tokenization of assets. He remains optimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies and is prepared to take calculated risks for potentially substantial rewards.

World's largest clearinghouse DTCC is experimenting with blockchain technology - Crypto Valley Journal

The "Smart NAV" pilot project by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), in collaboration with Oracle's Chainlink project and leading U.S. banks, tested the representation of market data on the blockchain.DTCC operates the largest securities settlement system in the world. To support the tokenization of traditional assets, the clearing house launched the Smart NAV pilot. Using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), DTCC was able to provide net asset values (NAVs) of tokenized funds on multiple blockchains through a standardized process. Participants in the pilot include US financial giants BNY Mellon, Franklin Templeton, JP Morgan, State Street, Invesco and others.
Key Infrastructure for TokenizationThe term tokenization refers to the representation of traditional assets also known as real-world assets (RWAs) on a blockchain network. For example, since March 2024, BlackRock is offering a money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Benefits include increased transparency for traditional financial products, broader accessibility and cross-border settlement.An accurate representation of the net asset value (NAV) is critical to such efforts. This ultimately underpins the market price for new subscriptions to a product. With Smart NAV, DTCC aims to distribute this data directly on the blockchain. Chainlink's CCIP enables the application to be used across different networks, allowing the data to be queried and processed more efficiently.Diagram of the Smart NAV Project/ Source: DTCCPotential expansion of the experimentAccording to DTCC, the pilot demonstrated how many different use cases could benefit from having key market data represented directly on the blockchain. Specifically, the clearing house mentioned tokenized funds, smart contracts for large banks, and brokerage portfolio applications. Other benefits include automated real-time data distribution and integrated access to historical data.Based on the blockchain experiment, DTCC sees an opportunity to expand the scope of applications. This would involve exploring how the technical capabilities used in the pilot could support a broader range of use cases and across a larger number of blockchains. Smart NAV could be expanded in the following areas:Using a similar distribution model with expanded data sets (e.g., key reference data)Automating workflows across blockchains triggered by the distributed dataset (e.g., portfolio rebalancing triggered by NAV)Extend the smart contract governance capabilities used in Smart NAV to enable data collection directly from participants (as opposed to a centralized submission point).

Former Goldman Sachs Executive Raoul Pal Answers Key Question: 'When Do I Sell My Crypto?' - Benzinga

In his latest video podcast, Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal discusses when traders should sell their crypto. He suggests not nailing market tops and adopting a time-based approach.What Happened: While addressing the query "When do I sell my crypto?", Pal stresses the importance of understanding one’s goals and investment time horizon, noting that crypto is inherently cyclical. Pal states, "Crypto is very cyclical based on this ‘everything code’ thesis." This thesis ties these cycles to global financial patterns, Bitcoin halvings and U.S. presidential elections.Drawing on his own experiences, Pal shares his journey from buying Bitcoin at $200 in 2013 to navigating the extreme highs and lows over the years. "Every time I've seen anybody try to time the market, including myself, it's been suboptimal," he admits. "I would have made five times as much money by not doing anything," he reflects, highlighting the challenge of market timing.Pal advises against trying to precisely nail the market tops, suggesting instead a time-based approach. "Use time, not price," he recommends, proposing that investors take profits towards the end of the year when crypto typically performs well.Also Read: Why This Crypto Market Is ‘A Bear Trap’ And Which Coins This Trader Is BackingWhy It Matters: Pal underscores the importance of having cash ready to buy during market downturns. "Every time you buy those lows, you're going to 10, 20, 50x depending on what you're buying," he emphasizes, stressing the value of long-term compounding.He notes, "This time around, I didn’t do anything except buy when I thought we were close to the bottom." This strategy, he explains, allowed him to capitalize on significant market rebounds.Lastly, the Macro Guru touches on the emotional aspect of investing, recognizing the difficulty in reinvesting post-downturn due to fear of losses. "The hard thing is actually putting the same amount back in again," he says, acknowledging the psychological hurdles investors face. He underscores the importance of sticking with the secular trend and not being swayed by short-term volatility.Pal has previously predicted cryptocurrency markets to enter a “Banana zone,” with the total market cap rising to $10 trillion until the end of the decade. He has also predicted that Bitcoin BTC/USD will go as high as $1 million.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin’s Rally Splits Trader Opinions: ‘Daily Says We’re Going Higher’ But One Indicator Presents A ‘Sell Signal On The 4H Chart’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Hong Kong pilots first-ever digital yuan payment system for cross-border transactions

The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) have taken significant steps to expand the Digital Yuan (e-CNY)’s reach beyond mainland China.On May 17, the HKMA announced a pilot scheme enabling the use of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) for cross-boundary payments.According to the authorities, this e-CNY scheme will provide safer, more convenient, and innovative cross-border retail payments between Hong Kong and Mainland residents.Cross-border transactionsThis initiative also allows Hong Kong residents to set up personal e-CNY wallets with their mobile numbers, but they cannot perform peer-to-peer transactions among themselves.Under this scheme, Hong Kong residents can fund their digital yuan wallets through 17 retail banks via the Faster Payment System (FPS). The statement added:“The interoperability between the FPS and the e-CNY system operated by the Digital Currency Institute (DCI) of the PBoC also marks the first linkage of a faster payment system with a central bank digital currency system in the world.”Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, stated that the e-CNY application and wallet would gradually gain more functionality as more retail merchants adopt the system. He said:“By expanding the e-CNY pilot in Hong Kong and leveraging the 24×7 operating hours and real-time transfer advantages of the FPS, users may now top up their e-CNY wallets anytime, anywhere without having to open a Mainland bank account, thereby facilitating merchant payments in the Mainland by Hong Kong residents.”Moreover, HKMA said it plans to upgrade the e-CNY wallets to higher tiers through real-name verification and will support corporate use cases for cross-border trade settlements in the future.This initiative continues China’s efforts to popularize its CBDC program. The country already uses the currency to pay some of its workers monthly salaries.Latest Alpha Market Report

Pump.fun Favorites Michi and Mini Recover After Exploit-But These Tokens Are Still Stuck - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA purported former Pump.fun employee drained an estimated $2 million worth of Solana from the protocol yesterday. This resulted in wallet provider Phantom blocking the site, a number of tokens getting stuck in bonding curve contracts, and trading being paused.Less than 24 hours later, it appears Pump.fun’s largest tokens have quickly recovered while the tokens affected by the attack are still stuck in limbo.Pump.fun is a protocol that allows users to create a Solana meme coin in minutes for only 0.02 SOL ($3). This has resulted in the daily record for new Solana-based tokens minted being broken with a slew of meme coins being created.Fortunately for meme enthusiasts, the Pump.fun team addressed the issue within seven hours of the attack. “Solana shit coins are back, and greater than ever,” the team posted on Twitter.Not long after the protocol was hacked, its highest market cap tokens dipped. Michi, Pump.fun’s largest token, fell 6% while SelfieDogCoin, the third largest token on the platform, plummeted 23%, and Mini, the next largest, dropped 22%—all in a matter of hours.Now the protocol says it has resolved the exploit and trading has resumed, these tokens have recovered. Michi has climbed 28% since its mid-hack low, SelfieDogCoin has jumped 20%, and Mini has skyrocketed 55%. While in the short-term the hack negatively affected Pump.fun’s biggest tokens, it appears that now the protocol has recovered it’s just brought more attention to tokens on the platform.However, these tokens had already become tradable on the Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium. This is done by reaching a market cap above $69,000 and completes a bonding curve (which adjusts an asset's price relative to its supply). Once it reaches this milestone, the liquidity is moved to Solana trading platform Raydium—meaning that investors can begin trading it outside of Pump.fun.Some on-chain sleuths deduced that with the aid of a private key—one only an employee of Pump.fun would have access to—the Pump.fun attacker appeared to target accounts completing this process, diverting funds earmarked for Raydium into unrelated wallet addresses. This resulted in tokens that hit 100% during the time of the attack being stuck in limbo. Unfortunately, this has still not been resolved.Tokens like Sim Wit Dicc, an NSFW token about the Sims game, Pre Wif, another dog coin, and Rnld Sweginatur, an Arnold Schwarzenegger meme, are all currently stuck. But the tokens are so small, there isn’t much of a community behind them to be outraged about it. That said, there are victims and Pump.fun intends to make these users whole.“The Pump.fun team will seed the LPs for each affected coin with an equal or greater amount of SOL liquidity that the coin had at 15:21 UTC within the next 24 hours,” the official account wrote on Twitter. “Please bear with us as we aim to resume the trading of these coins in a safe and structured manner.In the wake of the exploit, there has been a peculiar outpouring of love for the attacker. That’s because some people have been vocal in saying that Pump.fun is bad for Solana and the wider crypto community. In typical degen fashion, tokens dedicated to the attacker have started to appear. And ironically, the two of the largest hacker tribute tokens that Decrypt found went to zero almost immediately.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Chinese Police Bust $1.9 Billion Underground Banking Racket Involving Tether



                    

Chinese police have uncovered a $1.9 billion underground banking racket involving the popular stablecoin Tether in Chengdu. 



The operation utilized Tether to exchange foreign currencies and led to the arrest of 193 suspects across 26 provinces, according to a police report.




The report highlighted that these underground USDT operations began in January 2021. 



They were primarily used to smuggle medicine, cosmetics, and investment assets overseas. 



The authorities dismantled two such operations in Fujian and Hunan, freezing 149 million yuan (approximately $20 million) linked to these activities.




Despite China’s comprehensive prohibition on crypto-related activities, traders in the country continue to circumvent the ban, using crypto assets in alternative ways. 



A report by Kyros Ventures indicates that Chinese traders are among the largest stablecoin holders globally. 



According to the report, 33.3% of Chinese investors hold multiple stablecoins, placing them second only to Vietnam’s 58.6%.



The Chinese government has banned cryptocurrency use, cryptocurrency exchanges, and Bitcoin mining operations. 




However, the local population has consistently found ways to evade these restrictions over the years.

At the time of the Bitcoin mining ban, China was the largest contributor to the Bitcoin network hash rate. 



Remarkably, within a year of the ban, China’s mining hash rate contribution rose to second place despite the prohibition. 



Similarly, after the country banned centralized exchanges, Chinese traders shifted to decentralized exchanges.



In response to the ban, the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols by Chinese traders significantly increased. 



Some traders also used virtual private networks (VPNs) to defy the restrictions and continue their crypto activities.



The persistence of Chinese traders in using cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like Tether highlights the challenges faced by authorities in enforcing the ban. 



Despite stringent measures, the adaptability and ingenuity of the local population have allowed them to continue participating in the global crypto market.

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) to Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAMBCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gambling Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gambling Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Gambling Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gambling Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gambling Cat by entering its contract address – B4BQTfBJ6uQYkzaZyQjTmH7k3c9gzXQ3FrPMPDstpYAn – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAMBCAT.

Here's How Much Justin Bieber Has Lost On His ApeCoin Investment - Benzinga

Known for his music, Justin Bieber has become one of the wealthiest people in the world. He has used this wealth in a variety of ways, ranging from philanthropic efforts to venture capital investments. However, a less-discussed way in which the singer has used his fortune is with cryptocurrency. Bieber began investing in cryptocurrency and NFTs in 2021, and the investments have lost quite a bit of value since they were acquired. Let's take a look:Bieber first began purchasing NFTs in 2021, towards the tail end of the NFT hype wave that stormed the crypto community. In early 2022, Bieber purchased Bored Ape #3001 for 500 ETH, or around $1.3 million at the time. Don't Miss:Additionally, around the same time, Bieber bought Mutant Ape #922. For this NFT, he paid 28.8 ETH, or just over $70,000. These NFTs allowed Bieber to access the ApeCoin airdrop. ApeCoin is a governance token that powers the ApeCoin DAO. However, most investors simply see it as a proxy for investing in the Bored Ape NFT projects without having to shell out tens of thousands. The airdrop occurred in March 2022, and gave out 15% of the total supply to holders of Bored Apes. Specifically, owners of a Bored Ape got 10,000 tokens and owners of a Mutant Ape got 2,000 tokens.At the time, the airdrop was extremely profitable and delivered huge amounts of value to holders of the NFTs. One month after the airdrop, the price of the token hit a high of $27.60. This means that Bored Ape holders would have received $276,000 from the airdrop, and Mutant Ape holders would have received $55,200.Trending: How much Bitcoin did Michael Saylor says you need to become a millionaire? The number may shock you.Bieber held both of the NFTs, so at one point, his position was worth over $331,000. While this is a long way from the nearly $1.4 million he shelled out to purchase the NFTs, it is a huge amount to essentially receive for free, as Bieber did not directly pay for any of the ApeCoins. However, Bieber likely regrets not selling the position when it was worth over $331,000. Since hitting those highs, the price of ApeCoin has continually fallen, likely from Bored Ape holders selling their tokens to realize their profits. ApeCoin has been trading between $1 and $2 for nearly a year, and Bieber's position is worth just $14,000.This marks an unrealized loss of nearly 96%, since the position was worth as much as $331,000, and is currently worth $14,000.Bieber has also seen huge losses on the NFTs themselves, which have resulted in a loss of nearly 97%. Read Next:

Solana Developer Admits to Stealing $300,000 in User Funds, Cites Gambling Addiction as Cause



                    

Hoak, a developer for the Solana-based Cypher Protocol, has publicly admitted to stealing nearly $300,000 in user funds and subsequently gambling them away. 



His confession was made through a post on X on May 14, where he stated, “To address the elephant in the room, the allegations are true, I took the funds and gambled them away. 




“I didn’t run away with it, nor did anyone else.”



This admission followed a previous revelation by another core contributor, Cobra, who highlighted the missing funds in a post a day earlier.



Cobra detailed the theft in his post, explaining how Hoak systematically withdrew funds over several months from the cypher redemption contract, converting them into different cryptocurrencies and transferring them to Binance. 




The transactions involved multiple steps and intermediary wallets, and totaled $317,000 in Solana, Tether (USDT), and USD Coin. On-chain data traced these movements back to Hoak’s associated addresses.



At the time of the thefts, Hoak’s wallet contained significant amounts of digital assets, which were mostly transferred to Binance within a few days in April. 



These actions have further damaged the reputation of the Cypher Protocol, which had already suffered a major hack in August 2023, resulting in the loss of over $1 million in digital assets.

Hoak, addressing the motivations behind his actions, attributed the thefts to a severe gambling addiction and other psychological issues. 



He expressed, “I am also in no way, shape, or form attempting to victimize myself, but this is the culmination of what snowballed into a crippling gambling addiction and probably multiple other psychological factors that went by unchecked for too long.”



The case of Hoak raises concerns about the prevalence of gambling behavior within the cryptocurrency industry, often criticized for its casino-like environment. 



Gary Gensler, Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, has likened the crypto ecosystem to “casinos in the Wild West,” calling stablecoins the “poker chips” of the space. 



Moreover, a 2023 YouGov survey found a significant correlation between harmful gambling and cryptocurrency ownership, suggesting that those who gamble at risky levels are also more likely to engage in crypto trading, potentially exacerbating their financial vulnerability.

Changpeng Zhao Yet to Serve Prison Time Despite 4-Month Sentence | Coinspeaker



If due process is not followed by the Probation or Pretrial Services Office, Zhao’s legal team can contend for a reduction in the sentencing duration on due process grounds. 

Crypto exchange Binance’s co-founder and former chief executive Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ in the crypto industry, has yet to see the inside of a prison cell despite his four-month sentencing announced on April 30. As per a report from Protos, a combination of factors, including the formalities in the justice system, the Fifth Amendment, and the efforts of world-class lawyers, resulted in Zhao not being inside the walls of the prison.
United States District Judge Richard A. Jones sentenced CZ at Seatac, an administrative security federal detention center and prison in Western Washington with a total of 931 inmates. The judgment signed by Judge Jones stated that Zhao “shall surrender for service of sentence as notified by the Probation or Pretrial Services Office.”




CZ pleaded guilty in 2023 to money laundering violations, and Binance paid a hefty $4.3 billion fine to settle with the Department of Justice (DoJ).
Interestingly, as of now, these offices have not yet notified the ex-Binance head and crypto billionaire of the date he must report to the California prison.
Reasons for Changpeng Zhao Not Being in Prison Now
As per US laws, a criminal’s sentence begins once they are either received in custody awaiting transportation to, or voluntarily surrender to, the official detention facility. However, a delay can occur in three cases:

The judge may order the defendant to surrender to the US Marshals, who will be responsible for notifying the criminal of his prison date.
The judge may authorize the Probation or Pretrial Services Office to notify the defendant of their prison entry date.
The judge might allow the defendant to voluntarily report to prison—a case applicable to criminals with short sentences or who possess low flight risk.

Zhao was granted the second option. As he was not sentenced to a multi-year term, US Marshals did not immediately take him into custody. Instead, he awaits notification from the Probation or Pretrial Services Office.
Additionally, the Probation or Pretrial Services Office has to complete an analysis of the criminal before notifying them of the prison date. The analysis includes checking the resources of the facility, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the offender’s history and characteristics, among other things.
As a result, Zhao is still not inside prison walls because the Probation or Pretrial Services Office hasn’t completed its analysis. The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process for every criminal who may or may not reside in the United States.
Moreover, Protos also reported that Zhao’s defense team, comprising seven lawyers and additional support staff from three prestigious law firms, Latham & Watkins, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, and Davis Wright Tremaine, played a significant role in delaying the commencement of his prison term.
If due process is not followed by the Probation or Pretrial Services Office, Zhao’s legal team can contend for a reduction in the sentencing duration on due process grounds.

The attempt by Dogecoin (DOGE) bulls to push the price of the coin beyond the $0.153 mark suffered an intense rejection overnight. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is currently trading for $0.1526, down by 1.17% in 24 hours. The price slump derailed its efforts as it ambitiously jumped from a low of $0.1491 to its current level.DOGE Price Chart via TradingViewDogecoin is always pushing for a breakout. While it has no definitive internal catalyst that can drive its growth, it has managed to propel its growth from general market sentiment. This was, however, not enough to push interest in the past few hours. The meme coin’s trading volume suffered a massive slump, down by 38% to $1,160,682,932.This level of retail volume is not commensurate with the general interest in the Dogecoin community. As reported earlier by U.Today, Dogecoin proponents are strongly anticipating the addition of DOGE to X Payments. The expectation is that when it is live, there will be more demand for Dogecoin, hence driving more value to DOGE in the long term.The price action of Dogecoin, as depicted in the DOGE 4H Chart, pegs the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 53, a little above average. From here, a little pressure mounted by DOGE whales to revert the bearish outlook in daily volume can serve as a major catalyst to boost prices.With vocal voices within the Dogecoin ecosystem exerting their influence in the market as a whole, it remains to be seen where the next catalyst for growth will spring up from.In the year-to-date (YTD) period, Dogecoin has outperformed the general market, up by 68% overall. Should it sustain this pace, it might end Q2 on a positive note, irrespective of the current bearish trend. In all, the coin’s immediate price target is set at $0.16 to match its four-week high.

SEC Suffers Embarrassing Blow To Anti-Crypto Bill, Ripple CLO Celebrates The Victory | Bitcoinist.com


								The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has experienced another embarrassing setback, as an anti-crypto bill proposed by the regulator has been completely shut down by the United States Senate. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, has openly celebrated this outcome, marking it a noteworthy victory for the cryptocurrency industry. 
SEC’s Anti Crypto Bill Falters
 On March 31, 2022, the US SEC proposed a Staff Accounting Bulletin No.121 (SAB121), requiring financial institutions responsible for the crypto assets of clients to record or register these digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. This bill, viewed as a threat to the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency industry and US regulatory custodial services, was labeled by Alderoty as an “unauthorized overreach” by the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler. 

In an almost unanimous decision with Bipartisan support, the Senate and the House of Representatives voted vehemently against the controversial SAB-121 proposal. 
Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of crypto exchange, Coinbase, disclosed in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the Senate voted for repeal, achieving a supermajority with approximately 60 yes votes and an added rebuke for the SEC’s “overreach and disdain for the federal administrative law.”  
Furthermore, Alderoty commemorated the Senate’s rebuff of the SEC’s anti-crypto bill, emphasizing that Gensler’s attempt to control the cryptocurrency industry was getting out of hand. He also stated that the regulator’s ongoing efforts to govern an industry beyond its purview would not be tolerated anymore, highlighting that technological innovation should not be a partisan issue.
MicroStrategy’s Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Michael Saylor also commented on the SEC’s revoked bill in an X post, celebrating the Senate’s bipartisan decision.
“Wall Street wants Bitcoin, the House of Representatives wants Bitcoin, and now the Senate wants Bitcoin,” Saylor stated. 
Currently, the failure of the SEC’s proposed bill represents a significant blow to the regulator’s aggressive stance on cryptocurrency regulation. This comes on the heels of the agency’s legal battle with Ripple and a series of enforcement actions and lawsuits against cryptocurrency companies such as UniSwap, Coinbase, Binance, MetaMask and more. 
Moreover, the nullified bill highlights the growing influence of the crypto industry in both technological and political circles, securing recognition among lawmakers and traditional banking institutions in the US. 
Pro-Ripple Lawyer Calls SEC Actions “Regulatory Insanity”
In another X post, John E. Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer and supporter, has described the SEC’s aggressive enforcement actions on the crypto industry as “regulatory insanity.” He disclosed that the US SEC was being used as a weapon by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a crypto antagonist to support her political agendas. 

As the spokesperson for the SEC’s SAB-121 bill, Warren had expressed support for the anti-crypto proposal, arguing that by approving the rule, investors would have better protection against risks associated with cryptocurrency volatility. 
Deaton has disclosed that the SEC’s attempt to “protect investors” was laughable given that the regulator has caused more financial distress to the investors it claims to protect. He has also stated that Warren was placing her agendas above investor protection.

Bitcoin To $100,000: Infamous Head And Shoulders Pattern Appears To Signal The Start Of Another Rally


																Crypto analyst Crypto Jebb recently highlighted an inverse heads and shoulders pattern that had formed on the Bitcoin chart. This bullish pattern indicates another rally may be on the horizon for the flagship crypto, which could send its price to $100,000. 
How Could Bitcoin Could Rise To $100,000
Crypto Jebb revealed in a video on his YouTube channel that the inverse heads-and-shoulders pattern he had been predicting for a while had finally formed on the charts. He predicts this pattern could lead to a price breakout, sending Bitcoin’s price to $70,000. The analyst also noted that the price target of the bullish pattern is at $75,000, which indicates that Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high (ATH) on its next leg up. 

	Related Reading



Crypto Jebb mentioned that there is a “great degree of likelihood” that Bitcoin would experience a major rally, which would send it to $100,000 should it break its current ATH of $73,800. The crypto analyst believes that Bitcoin’s rise to that price level is very likely, considering that it has seen a “pretty large corrective movement” since hitting a new ATH over two months ago. 
The crypto analyst warned that there is a scenario where Bitcoin could also end up trading sideways between $60,000 and $64,000, which would signal a period of consolidation. He noted that Bitcoin could even drop lower during this period. However, Bitcoin’s outlook is generally bullish based on the technical indicators that crypto Jebb highlighted. 
The analyst highlighted the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), which he noted is turning “very bullish” on the daily chart and shows that the bulls are regaining control. He also claimed that Bitcoin is witnessing a ‘green red green’ formation on the daily chart, indicating that the crypto token is “doing very well.”
BTC Is In “Very Bullish Territory
Crypto Jebb mentioned that Bitcoin is currently in very bullish territory, especially since Altcoins are also rallying. He claims this indicates a “great degree of confidence” in the market at the moment. The crypto analyst also noted that the stock market just broke an all-time high, which he stated is big news for Bitcoin.

	Related Reading



He explained that this is big news for Bitcoin because the flagship crypto follows the stock market and moves significantly whenever the stock market experiences a breakout. As such, with the stock market breaking its ATH, he expects Bitcoin to do so soon enough. 
Crypto Jebb further explained that the rationale behind Bitcoin following the stock market is that investors are more confident in investing in risk-on assets when they see that the risk-off (the stock market) is doing so well. 
Crypto Jebb predicts that Bitcoin will become a risk-off asset in the next ten to twenty years. When that happens, he predicts that hundreds of billions of dollars in investment will be made in the flagship crypto.

Solana 'beats' Bitcoin on this front, but is bad news around the corner? - AMBCrypto



Solana’s network activity remained high in May 
SOL’s price action was bullish, but sentiment around it turned bearish 

Solana [SOL] has been in the limelight lately owing to its achievements in the NFT ecosystem. However, that’s not all, with recent datasets revealing that the blockchain has excelled in yet another domain after it flipped Bitcoin [BTC]. 
Solana’s high network activity 
SolanaFloor, a popular X handle, recently tweeted that the blockchain managed to overtake Bitcoin in terms of revenue generated in the last 24 hours. To be precise, SOL generated $1.65 million in revenue, while BTC generated ‘just’ $1.5 million. 
The reason behind this performance could be Solana’s robust network activity. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Artemis’ data revealed that SOL’s network activity remained high in May. Not only did its daily active addresses climb sharply, but SOL’s daily transactions also spiked on 10 May. Here, it’s worth noting that the same fell soon after. 
Source: Artemis
The hike in network activity helped the blockchain generate more revenue. We found that SOL’s fees have risen sharply since the beginning of May, allowing its revenue to also grow. 
Everything in the DeFi space also looked pretty optimistic as its TVL hiked. Additionally, SOL dominated BTC heavily in terms of network activity. 
Both SOL’s daily transactions and addresses remained considerably higher than those of BTC. In fact, SOL’s fees remained higher than BTC’s, as the latter’s number witnessed a major drop on 7 May. 
Source: Artemis
Apart from this, SOL has been performing well in the NFT ecosystem as well. AMBCrypto had reported previously that there has been a slight hike in Solana NFT volumes over the last seven days, primarily driven by top collections. 
SOL remains bullish 
In the meantime, Solana bulls stood strong in the market as its weekly chart remained green. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL has appreciated by over 5% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $163.26 with a market capitalization of over $73.27 billion. 
Thanks to the price uptick, Solana’s social volume hiked over the last few days. However, it was surprising to see a drop in SOL’s weighted sentiment.

AMBCrypto then checked SOL’s daily chart to see whether this uptrend would continue. As per our analysis, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick and seemed to be heading further away from neutral 50 – Sign of a sustained uptrend. 
However, the token’s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands – A sign of prospective selling pressure.

Oklahoma passes bill protecting ‘fundamental bitcoin rights’ - Blockworks


Oklahoma passed a bill earlier this week that protects state residents’ right to self-custody digital assets. 
The bill will go into effect on November 1, 2024. 
OKHB3594 was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt. It was sponsored by four Republicans — State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard.
Under the bill, Oklahoma bans restricting or outlawing the use “or the self-custody of digital assets using a self-hosted wallet or a hardware wallet,” a page for the bill said. 
Oklahomans can also mine crypto both at home and industrially, though they have to comply with local noise ordinances.

“Anyone engaged in home digital asset mining, or digital asset mining business, staking, or staking as a service shall not be required to obtain a money transmitter license,” the bill said.
Additionally, “discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses are outlawed as well.”
Residents can use crypto to pay for goods and services and are protected from paying additional taxes.
“Digital assets used as a method of payment may not be subject to any additional tax, withholding, assessment or charge by the state or local government that is based solely on the use of the digital asset as the method of payment,” the bill continued.
Satoshi Act Fund CEO Dennis Porter called the bill “groundbreaking” and said it was designed to protect “fundamental bitcoin rights.”

“The idea that ‘We the People’ cannot hold our own assets is antithetical to American values. Without the ability to manage our wealth, we lose control of our destiny and the chance to create better futures for our families. This law ensures that everyone can secure not only their [bitcoin] but all their assets,” he wrote in a post on X.

GameStop Tanks 26% After Company Files to Sell 45 Million Shares - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsVideo game store turned meme stock GameStop has filed to sell up to 45 million of its GME shares. This move will see the total number of shares increase by as much as 15%. This comes the same day that GameStop filed its preliminary Q1 results which revealed that net sales have decreased 30% compared to last year. That said, the company’s net loss is expected to be up to $23.5 million less than last year, although this could still leave GameStop with a net loss of up to $37 million.If GameStop is able to sell 45 million shares at the current market price of $227, the company could bring in up to $990 million—although shifting such a high volume of shares is likely to move the price of the stock. Pre-market trading saw shares drop by as much as 20% overnight. And things didn’t improve after the opening bell. At the time of writing, GME is trading for about $21 and stretching the losses to 24% compared to Thursday’s closing price.The company acknowledged recent price fluctuations, but stopped short of name-dropping Roaring Kitty, the r/WallStreetBets Reddit community, or its status as a “meme stock.”"Our common stock has experienced extreme volatility in price and trading volume.” GameStop said in the prospectus supplement. “We did not experience any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume.”GameStop has become somewhat of a cult meme stock after the 2021 short squeeze which saw the stock reach its all time high of $81. Meme influencer Roaring Kitty played a central role in this saga which was later turned into a documentary and feature film. Earlier this week, Roaring Kitty appeared to return to Twitter after three years of silence which has seen more volatility for the stock—prompting exchanges to halt trading at least six times.The prospectus listed a number of factors which have influenced the price of GME, as a nod to its past this list includes “short squeezes,” as well as “message boards and social and other media.”Several firms opened short positions against GameStop in the run up to the 2021 short squeeze. That included Melvin Capital, which lost nearly $3 billion after it was forced to close its positions.GameStop highlights short sellers are continuing to trade its stock which it says puts “pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price.” Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Market expert sets DOGE price to ‘$0.49 and beyond’ soon


Despite many assets in the cryptocurrency industry starting to move in a more positive direction, Dogecoin (DOGE) seems to still be waiting for an upwards trigger, but one crypto expert believes that traders of the popular doge meme token might not wait for much longer.
As it happens, popular pseudonymous crypto market analyst CoinsKid has shared his view that Dogecoin could “run to $0.49 and beyond” in the near future, as “invalidation is losing the bottom of the potential C wave in May at $0.11929,” as he explained in an X post on May 17.

DOGE price prediction
Indeed, the current DOGE chart pattern emerged just a couple of days after the crypto trading expert observed the “textbook inverse head & shoulders on the daily for DOGE,” the structure also known as a reverse head and shoulders, which hints at an upward price trend, or a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal.

Meanwhile, another pseudonymous crypto analyst, World Of Charts, is less bullish, albeit nonetheless predicting that Dogecoin could increase its price very soon, setting the target to between $0.27 and $0.30, days after expert known as Behdark suggested a “long-term bullish rally.”

DOGE price analysis
For now, Dogecoin is changing hands at $0.15266, suggesting a decline of 0.58% in the last 24 hours, an advance of 2.37% across the previous seven days, and an accumulated gain of 0.27% on the monthly chart, according to the most recent price data retrieved on May 17.

All things considered, the beloved doge meme token, favored by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, could, indeed, surge toward the highly optimistic price target at $0.49, especially after recently considering the fact that it has recently broken out from a resistance trend line.
However, things in the crypto market can sometimes change rapidly, so doing one’s own research and carefully weighing all the risks instead of blindly relying on other people’s recommendations and opinions is essential when investing in any of its assets.

Ethereum's Potential Upside Surprises: Coinbase Report


Coinbase projects that Ethereum (ETH) might outshine other cryptocurrencies shortly.
The company’s recent report suggests that the second-largest cryptocurrency has the potential to surprise its holders positively.
Key Factors Supporting Ethereum’s Potential

This year, Ethereum has lagged behind the broader crypto market. Despite this underperformance, Coinbase remains optimistic about its long-term prospects. The report highlights ETH’s 29% year-to-date rise, positioning it well due to a lack of significant supply-side pressures like token unlocks or miner sell-offs.
Coinbase analyst David Han highlights that ETH benefits from substantial and growing liquidity sinks. Staking, where investors lock up tokens to support the network and earn rewards, has been a major factor. Additionally, Layer 2 solutions, which scale the Ethereum by processing transactions off the main blockchain, have grown considerably.

The expert also notes the increasing institutional interest. As more financial institutions explore blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum, the backbone of most DeFi applications, benefits significantly. The platform’s versatility and infrastructure make it a preferred choice for developers and investors alike.
The Impact of Potential Spot ETFs Launch
The potential launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US could significantly impact the asset’s market position, boost liquidity and potentially driving up its price. Although the SEC recently hinted at a possible denial, the mere prospect has already stirred market excitement.  

Scott Johnsson from Davis Polk and Wardwell highlighted the SEC’s call for public input on classifying BlackRock’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF as a commodity-based trust. Johnsson suggested that denying the ETFs could be strategic, as they might be misfiled as commodity-based trust shares. 

“We think the market may be underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval, which leaves room for surprises to the upside,” Han said.

No matter how the US ETF story ends, Coinbase’s report suggests that Ethereum will outperform in the coming months. Strong demand drivers and technological innovations help ETH remain a key asset to watch.

Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has released the findings of its Smart NAV pilot, which explored extending its Mutual Fund Profile Service to leverage distributed ledger technology for data dissemination and consumption. The news led to Chainlink (LINK) surging 30% over the past 48 hours, trading at $16.71 from a low of $12.8 on May 15, as the DTCC concluded that,“an opportunity for on-chain price and rate data that can serve as a key enabler to the exploration of new initiatives.”The Smart NAV pilot aimed to utilize DTCC’s digital asset capabilities and Chainlink’s technology for cross-chain interoperability and blockchain abstraction. This initiative was part of DTCC’s broader efforts to support the financial industry’s exploration of digital assets in financial services.DTCC is a post-trade financial services company providing clearing, settlement, and information services for various securities, including equities, corporate and municipal bonds, government and mortgage-backed securities, money market instruments, and over-the-counter derivativesThe pilot targeted the increased industry interest in mutual fund tokenization and the need for on-chain price and rate data. By adopting a chain-agnostic approach, DTCC sought to enable the distribution of Net Asset Value (NAV) data across multiple blockchains, facilitating new use cases.The Smart NAV pilot involved extending DTCC’s Mutual Fund Profile Service I (MFPS I), the industry standard for transmitting NAV data. Ten market participants and Chainlink collaborated, focusing on the feasibility and value of delivering a DLT-based solution for price and rate dissemination. This initiative aimed to embed foundational data into various on-chain use cases, such as tokenized funds and bulk consumer smart contracts, supporting future industry exploration.The pilot demonstrated that structured data delivery on-chain and established roles and processes can enhance numerous downstream use cases. These include brokerage portfolio applications and other business workflows, benefiting from real-time, automated data dissemination and historical data access.Smart NAV’s core capability revolves around making trusted, verifiable data available on any blockchain network to support its use in business processes. DTCC acted as the data provider and governor of the on-chain solution, while Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enabled interoperability. The pilot’s success suggests the potential for broader applications beyond the dissemination of price and rate data across more blockchains.Chainlink Market DataAt the time of press 2:09 pm UTC on May. 17, 2024, Chainlink is ranked #15 by market cap and the price is up 20.34% over the past 24 hours.

Coinbase Research Report Predicts Upside Surprise in Ethereum (ETH) | Coinspeaker



Coinbase said that the market is underestimating the odds and timings of a potential spot Ethereum ETF approval, thereby leaving sufficient space for upside surprises. 

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has delivered a lackluster performance in comparison to Bitcoin and other altcoins in the market. However, the latest report from Coinbase shows that Ethereum’s long-term positioning remains strong and it could surprise investors on the upside very soon.
The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value has increased by 29% year-to-date, trailing behind its larger counterpart, Bitcoin (BTC), which has surged by 50%. But the Coinbase report mentions that “Ether may have the potential to surprise to the upside in the coming months”.




It also added that as of now, the altcoin doesn’t have any major sources of supply-side overhang such as pressure created by miner selling or token unlocks. Coinbase analyst David Han wrote:
“To the contrary, both staking and layer 2 growth have proven to be meaningful and growing sinks of ETH Liquidity. ETH’s position as the center of decentralized finance (DeFi) is also unlikely to be displaced in our view due to the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its layer 2 innovations.”
The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is the core processing system of the Ethereum blockchain. It enables developers to create smart contracts and allows nodes to interact with them. Layer 2s are independent blockchains built on top of layer 1s (the base layer), designed to alleviate scaling and data bottlenecks.
Don’t Discard Spot Ethereum ETFs
Furthermore, Coinbase notes that the potential for spot Ethereum ETFs can’t be understated. The crypto exchange believes that the market is underestimating the odds and timings of a potential approval, thereby leaving sufficient space for upside surprises.
The first deadline for the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF stands next week on May 23. However, several market analysts have stated that the chances of such an approval seem to be very slim at this point. Some of the top market analysts also believe that the US spot Ethereum ETFs won’t come until the end of 2025.
“Even if the first deadline of May 23, 2024, encounters a rejection, we think there is a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision. In the interim, we believe the structural demand drivers for ETH as well as the technological innovations within its ecosystem will enable it to continue straddling across multiple narratives,” the Coinbase report reads.

Crypto Investors Turn Greedy as Bitcoin Surges Past $66K


																The crypto market is rife with greed again following bitcoin’s (BTC) latest rally to a three-week high of over $66,000.
Data from Alternative.me shows the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently as high as 74, indicating a period of greed among digital asset investors.
Crypto Investors Are Greedy
The surge in crypto market sentiment to greed follows a period of neutrality among market participants. CryptoPotato reported earlier this month that the fear and greed index stood at 54 for the first time since January, representing neutral sentiment among investors, while BTC traded around in a range between $57,000 and $60,000.
At the time, BTC and the broader crypto market experienced heightened volatility and a massive wipeout in total market capitalization. On one occasion, BTC fell below its crucial support levels, crashing 11% within 36 hours.
The plunge drained the crypto market of more than $200 billion, leaving a trail of ruins among altcoins and meme coins. Notably, digital asset investment funds were affected, with some networks seeing consecutive weeks of outflows.




However, the tide has changed this week, with the bulls taking over the reins on Monday. After hovering around $61,000 during the weekend, BTC surged to $63,000 on Monday and then persisted to $64,000 on Wednesday. At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency was changing hands at $66,200, up 5% in the past seven days.
Bitcoin’s upward trajectory has extended to the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, with inflows surging to a multi-week high. On Wednesday, flows into the ETFs hit $303 million, a figure last seen on May 3. Yesterday, the funds also saw inflows totaling $257 million. The two consecutive days of substantial inflows contrast the flows seen in the last two weeks, which are mostly less than $100 million.
What Happens Next?
For the uninitiated, the Fear and Greed Index determines investor sentiment by analyzing several factors, including market momentum, volatility, bitcoin’s dominance, trends, and social media. On a scale of 0 to 100, 0 indicates extreme fear, 50 signals neutrality, and 100 means extreme greed.
With the index at a point of greed, a further market rally could push it to the extreme greed zone. Unfortunately, this would give room for a correction, which is typical in crypto markets.
Regardless, the surge in liquidity entering the market could push BTC out of its current price range to a higher level.

Ripple Co-founder Larsen Praised for Visionary Leadership


							

Schwartz credits Larsen’s visionary belief in Ripple’s potential



Larsen’s leadership launched real-world Ripple applications



Larsen’s vision and persuasion attracted top talent to Ripple




David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple, recently acknowledged the critical role played by co-founder Chris Larsen in the company’s history. In a public statement, Schwartz lauded Larsen’s early belief in Ripple’s potential and his unwavering commitment during the company’s formative stages.







Larsen, who co-founded Ripple in 2012 alongside Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto, is credited with recognizing the potential of blockchain technology for cross-border payments even before Schwartz himself. This foresight, coupled with his strategic vision, laid the groundwork for Ripple’s evolution into a prominent player within the fintech and blockchain industries.









Beyond conceptualizing Ripple’s potential, Larsen is recognized for his ability to translate those ideas into tangible business applications. His leadership in launching real-world use cases positioned Ripple as a leader in revolutionizing cross-border payments and financial infrastructure.



Schwartz also emphasized Larsen’s persuasive leadership style, which was instrumental in garnering support from key stakeholders. Larsen’s ability to effectively communicate Ripple’s vision is credited with attracting top talent and fostering a culture of innovation within the company. Brad Garlinghouse, who succeeded Larsen as CEO in 2016, has stated that Larsen’s influence played a significant role in his decision to join Ripple.







Larsen’s influence on Ripple serves as a testament to the power of visionary leadership and unwavering commitment in shaping the future of financial technology.

Ethereum (ETH) Report from Coinbase: "Ethereum May Be Preparing for a Significant Move!" Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Coinbase's research report, Ethereum (ETH), although it has underperformed in the cryptocurrency market this year, may experience a significant rise in the coming months.
The report highlights several factors that could contribute to a positive outlook for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.


So far this year, Ethereum is up 29%, lagging behind Bitcoin's (BTC) impressive 50% rise.
However, Coinbase's analysis suggests that Ethereum's long-term position remains solid and could outperform in the near future.





“Ethereum may have the potential to surprise upwards in the coming months,” the report said, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency does not face significant supply-side pressures such as token unlocks or miner sales.
These factors, which often undermine price stability, are notably absent for Ethereum.


Coinbase analyst David Han noted that the growth of staking and layer 2 solutions has significantly absorbed ETH liquidity.

“ETH's position as the center of decentralized finance (DeFi) is also unlikely to be displaced in our view by widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and layer 2 innovations,” Han added.





The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is an integral part of the Ethereum blockchain and enables developers to create and interact with smart contracts.
Building on top of the base layer, Layer 2 solutions help alleviate scaling and data bottlenecks, improving the overall efficiency of the network.
Additionally, the potential approval of spot US Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could play a pivotal role in boosting Ethereum's market performance.

Coinbase suggests that the market may be underestimating the likelihood and timing of such approvals, providing further upside potential.

Synthetix's sUSD Stablecoin Loses Its Dollar Peg amid Heavy Sell-Off



The depeg situation of Synthetix’s sUSD has once again highlighted the vulnerabilities within DeFi systems and the impacts of liquidity shifts.

Synthetix’s decentralized stablecoin sUSD has seen an unexpected turn of events after it slipped below its intended $1 peg. The stablecoin, issued through the Synthetix DeFi protocol, fell to as low as $0.92 on Thursday before making a partial recovery to $0.96.
sUSD Depeg Caused by Liquidity Issues
The incident was initially identified by Chaos Labs, a risk manager for the Aave lending protocol. According to their analysis, the depeg was triggered when a major liquidity provider withdrew from the sBTC/wBTC liquidity pool on the Curve decentralized exchange. This provider redeemed sUSD via Synthetix’s spot synth redemption and subsequently sold it on Curve, causing a sudden drop in sUSD’s value.




Synthetix, a platform enabling the creation of synthetic assets or Synths, mints sUSD as a loan overcollateralized with various crypto assets to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. However, the recent activity has exposed weaknesses in this mechanism.
The implementation of SIP-2059 at the end of April was responsible for deprecating non-sUSD spot synths on the Ethereum mainnet. As that ended atomic exchanges for other synths like sETH and sBTC, users were forced to convert the synths into sUSD, increasing the selling pressure on the stablecoin.
Meanwhile, this is not the first time a stablecoin will be experiencing a depeg that stems from liquidity issues. Last October, real estate-backed stablecoin USDR fell to $0.53 per coin, albeit in a similar manner. At the time, the team explained that a redemption rush drained liquid assets such as DAI from its treasury. Company statement about the USDR depeg reads in part:
“Combined with the lack of DAI for redemptions, panic selling ensued, causing a depeg.”
Stablecoins Not ‘Stable’
For stablecoins to retain the meaning of their names, they are intended to always be worth $1 on the open market. However, under certain market conditions, they sometimes lose their peg.
Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), one of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, briefly fell to $0.885 per coin on March 11, 2023. That was around the period that several banks in the US went bankrupt. Although USDC regained its peg three days later, Terra’s UST was not so lucky. UST lost its peg in May 2022 and never recovered. It is valued at $0.02219 per coin as of publication.
The depeg situation of Synthetix’s sUSD has once again highlighted the vulnerabilities within DeFi systems and the impacts of liquidity shifts. However, in the meantime, Chaos Labs has recommended that the Aave community should temporarily freeze sUSD reserves on Aave V3 on the Optimism network. This freeze, they claim, would help to mitigate further market impact.

2 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week


Positive sentiment grows in the cryptocurrency market after weeks of bearish and neutral dominating sentiments. However, some cryptocurrencies are trending mostly due to negative sentiments, and investors should avoid trading them next week.
It is worth noting that the crowd’s sentiment is volatile and does not necessarily reflect the intrinsic fundamentals of the trending projects. Still, social indicators and public perception can potentially impact a cryptocurrency’s short-term price action.
Avoiding trading particular cryptocurrencies trending for the wrong reasons can help investors keep a solid risk management strategy.


In this context, Finbold retrieved data from Santiment’s trending cryptocurrencies on May 17, looking for insights. Notcoin (NOT) and Toncoin (TON) lead today’s top 10 trends, with a dominating negative sentiment.
Trending Coins, May 17, 2024. Source: Santiment / Finbold
Avoid trading Notcoin (NOT) and Toncoin (TON)
Notably, Santiment‘s social index signals a bearish momentum for Notcoin as users report withdrawal issues to Binance and TON wallet. The platform’s AI summary reports as follows:

“The crypto project Notcoin seems to be facing some negative sentiment in the social media platforms. Users are expressing frustration over not receiving their Notcoin, experiencing significant drops in their balances, and encountering issues with exchanges.”
– Santiment’s Bearish summary on “notcoin”

Conversely, NOT has had bullish mentions of successful cashout, trading opportunities, and crypto exchange listings.
Trending Coins, indicators May 17, 2024. Source: Santiment / Finbold
Notcoin was born as a reward token for a Telegram game designed to onboard users on The Open Network (TON). The first negative experience has also affected the market’s overall perception of Toncoin,  the blockchain’s native token.

“The main reasons to be bearish on the TON project include concerns about the functionality and reliability of the TON wallet, with users reporting issues with deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.”
– Santiment’s Bearish summary on “ton”

TON price analysis
On the other hand, Toncoin had a remarkable performance in 2024, up 184% year-to-date, currently at $6.67. The Open Network has successfully attracted investors and developers for its ecosystem, presenting solid long-term fundamentals.
Moreover, technical indicators suggest the token could hold its current prices or surge further despite the dominating sentiment. TON trades above its 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA), and the relative strength index (RSI) suggests a strong momentum.

Therefore, the “avoid trading” warning is also valid for short-sellers trying to profit from TON’s current issues, as the digital asset could still perform despite recent events.

From BTC to HPC: Miners signal evolving focus after the halving - Blockworks


Bitcoin miners have spoken after the halving. 
Many have said they are looking to wade deeper into the high-performance computing (HPC) space in a world of lower BTC rewards.  
HPC proved an oft-heard acronym out of the mouths of industry executives in recent weeks as the segment’s companies reported first-quarter results — and more importantly, detailed future growth strategies. 
Sure, miners continue looking to improve efficiency and reduce costs via upgrading hardware and mining algorithms, noted BlocksBridge Consulting founder Nishant Sharma. 
But the per-block rewards drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC on April 19 has kept companies focused on building out their ex-mining revenue streams.
“A trend that started before [the] halving and appears to be gaining traction among bitcoin miners is repurposing bitcoin mining infrastructure for HPC and other [AI] applications,” Sharma told Blockworks.
This is not exactly a new trend. Hive Digital Technologies was among the first to get serious about this pivot by tweaking its company name in July 2023. It noted at the time that its 38,000 Nvidia GPUs — or graphics processing units — have the capability to do AI workload.
It remains early days, as Hive realized $900,000 of HPC-related revenue in the fourth quarter.  The company has not reported revenue marks for the first three months of 2024. 
But others have. 

Bit Digital, Iris Energy and Hut 8 are among the miners that have started reporting the revenue earned from the HPC business line.
“I believe more companies will start doing so after their AI/HPC ventures become operational,” Sharma said. 
Bitcoin mining giant Hut 8 reported $3.3 million in revenue under its “high-performance computing, colocation and cloud” umbrella — roughly 6% of the revenue it generated during the quarter. 
CEO Asher Genoot called the company’s HPC business “sub-scale” in March, noting its infrastructure would need more investment to handle AI machines.
Read more: Bitcoin miner Hut 8 doubles down on diversification, discipline around halving
But the company earlier this quarter launched a new AI vertical under a “GPU-as-a-service model,” he noted on Hut 8’s Wednesday earnings call. It purchased 1,000 Nvidia GPUs and secured a deal with an unnamed AI cloud platform. 
Genoot said he expects revenue generated from the new vertical to start in the year’s second half, with a forecasted annual rate of roughly $20 million.
“Today, we believe bitcoin mining generates the highest return on investment into large scale stranded load interconnection assets,” the Hut 8 CEO added on the call. “However, we also see a massive opportunity in the broader energy infrastructure sector as demand grows across new use cases like AI.”
Read more: The Bitcoin halving is over — greener mining is coming
A bit further along on the HPC revenue journey was Bit Digital, which saw about $8 million in revenue — 27% of its total first-quarter revenue — come from HPC.
That business started generating revenue in January. Bit Digital disclosed the new unit — focused on supporting generative AI workstreams — in October, noting it had bought 132 integrated HPC platforms and 1,056 GPUs for $35 million. 
Meanwhile, Iris Energy is also still building out its AI cloud services business. 
The Australia-based miner generated $600,000 in revenue from that segment during the first quarter after commissioning 248 Nvidia GPUs to customer Poolside AI. 
It bought 568 additional Nvidia H100 GPUs for $22 million in February. Those were expected to be delivered this quarter.   
Other HPC-centric aspirations
Though others — such as Core Scientific, Stronghold Digital Mining and Terawulf — don’t yet have a dedicated HPC revenue line listed, that doesn’t mean they aren’t committed. Or at least mulling what it could do for their business. 
Core Scientific’s “significant advantage” over industry peers is its exclusive control over its in-demand high-power data center infrastructure, CEO Adam Sullivan said during an earnings call last week.
That HPC segment is “the next major growth opportunity for our business,” he added.
Core Scientific said in March that it would lease up to 16 megawatts (MW) of capacity in its Austin data center to cloud provider CoreWeave, with possible revenue from the deal exceeding $100 million. More than 500 MW of the miner’s total 1.2 gigawatts of contracted power can be utilized for alternative compute workloads, executives noted.
Read more: Rival miners Marathon, Core Scientific each think they have an edge over peers
Stronghold Digital Mining opened up the possibility of selling its assets, or the company outright, on its May 2 earnings call. 
CEO Greg Beard wanted listeners to know that its 130 MW of energized data center capacity could expand to more than 400 MW — with a possible focus on supporting AI and machine learning.
Meanwhile, Maryland-based mining company Terawulf is finalizing the design for the HPC section at its Lake Mariner Facility in New York. It has committed a 2 MW power block capable of deploying thousands of GPUs. 
Joe Flynn, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, estimated in a May 14 research note that Terawulf could generate up to $1.5 million of yearly revenue, per megawatt, from HPC co-location services. 
He added: “We continue to prefer miners that own and operate their own infrastructure, and believe there is optionality for [Terawulf] to pursue AI/HPC opportunities that would lead to a re-rating of the stock from long-term and more predictable free cash flows.”

SOL Founder Reflects on Solana's Original Vision: Details

In a recent tweet, Solana labs cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko revisited the original vision behind the Solana blockchain, revealing a perspective that diverges from the common throughput-centric narrative. According to the Solana founder, who goes by the name "toly" on X, Solana was not primarily designed for maximum throughput; instead, its core purpose is to synchronize state across the globe as swiftly as the laws of physics permit. Solana is an integrated, open-source blockchain that aims to synchronize global information at the speed of light. It prioritizes latency and throughput, sacrificing some verifiability. It intends to accomplish this with features such as its novel timestamp mechanism called proof of history (PoH), block propagation protocol Turbine and parallel transaction processing.The SOL founder's comments come in the wake of the most recent CoinGecko report, which found Solana to be the fastest among large blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) hitting a record high of 1,504 on April 6 this year amid the meme coin mania.Solana was found to be 46 times faster than Ethereum and more than five times faster than Polygon, which has the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.While Solana has been lauded for its high throughput capabilities, the SOL founder emphasizes that this was not the primary objective. The focus was not merely creating a "faster" blockchain but building a system that could achieve global state synchronization with unparalleled efficiency.According to CoinGecko, despite being the fastest blockchain, Solana has only reached 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS. At the same time, the increased volume of transactions caused network congestion, and it remains to be seen how quickly Solana can achieve greater real TPS with its planned enhancements. SOL, the native coin of the Solana blockchain, is the fifth largest cryptocurrency, valued at $74.74 billion and trading at $166.54 at the moment.

Spot Ethereum ETF Odds Are 'Underestimated', Says Coinbase


								Coinbase Research has issued a detailed report, written by David Han, emphasizing that the likelihood and timing of a US spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval are significantly underestimated by the market. The potential approval of such an ETF is poised to bring profound changes to Ethereum’s market dynamics.
The Case For A Spot ETH ETF Approval
The report delves into the critical importance of a spot ETH ETF, drawing parallels with the successful approval of spot BTC ETFs in the US. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided regulatory clarity and attracted significant capital inflows, reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as a macro asset. Similarly, a spot ETF would open Ethereum to the same capital pools that currently favor Bitcoin, fundamentally altering investment patterns within the crypto ecosystem.
Han underscores the core argument for a spot ETH ETF: the high correlation between CME ETH futures and spot prices. This correlation was a key factor in the approval of spot BTC ETFs.
“The correlation between the CME futures product and the spot exchange rates is sufficiently high such that CME’s surveillance can be reasonably expected to detect misconduct in the spot market,” Han states. This reasoning is expected to be equally applicable to Ethereum, given that the CME ETH futures launched just a month before the correlation study period used for BTC ETF approvals.

Despite the significant market potential, the report highlights the differences to Bitcoin and recognizes the regulatory uncertainties, particularly around Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. The complexities of staking—such as slashing conditions, validator differences, and unstaking liquidity risks—introduce additional layers of consideration for regulators. “The complexities of staking present unique challenges, but these should not impact the status of unstaked ETH,” Han notes.
Market sentiment, as reflected in trading platforms like Polymarket, currently prices the odds of a spot ETH ETF approval by May 31, 2024, at 16%. However, Coinbase’s analysis suggests these odds are significantly higher, closer to 30-40%. This divergence indicates that the market may not fully appreciate the potential regulatory and market shifts in favor of Ethereum.
Han also points out that even if the initial deadline of May 23, 2024, encounters a rejection, there remains a high likelihood that litigation could reverse such a decision. “Crypto is becoming an election issue, and the SEC may not be willing to expend the political capital necessary to support a denial,” Han argues, suggesting that political dynamics could also play a role in the regulatory process.
The approval of a spot ETH ETF would not only align Ethereum with Bitcoin in terms of regulatory clarity and access to institutional capital but also disrupt traditional capital flow patterns within the crypto market. Historically, capital has rotated from Bitcoin to Ethereum and then to higher-beta altcoins. A spot ETH ETF would potentially streamline this flow, directly channeling institutional investments into Ethereum.

This approval would also mitigate one of the largest overhangs for ETH, especially in a challenging regulatory environment. “The potential approval of a spot ETH ETF removes a significant barrier, opening up ETH to new capital inflows and regulatory clarity,” Han emphasizes.
Ethereum’s Long-Term Positioning
Beyond the immediate implications of a spot ETF, Coinbase’s report delves into Ethereum’s strong long-term positioning. Despite facing competition from other layer-1 networks like Solana, Ethereum’s advantages—such as the maturity of its developer ecosystem, the proliferation of its EVM platform, and its role as DeFi collateral—remain unparalleled, according to Han.
The growth of Ethereum layer-2 solutions and the reduced ETH burn post-EIP-1559 are highlighted as factors enhancing its value proposition. Additionally, Ethereum’s historical trading patterns reveal its dual role as both a store-of-value and a technology-token, adding to its unique market positioning.
In conclusion, Coinbase’s analysis presents a compelling case for the near-term approval of a spot ETH ETF in the US. The report suggests that market participants may be underestimating the odds and timing of such approval, leaving room for potential upside surprises.
“We think the market may be underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval, which leaves room for surprises to the upside,” Han remarks. Moreover, he predicts that ETH may “have the potential to surprise to the upside in the coming months. ETH does not appear to have major sources of supply-side overhangs such as token unlocks or miner sell pressure.”
At press time, the ETH price stood at $3,028.

Analyst Utilizes Supply And Demand Principles To Determine Bitcoin Price


																For analysts and investors alike, comprehending the variables that influence price action in the complex world of cryptocurrency markets is essential. Ali Martinez, a well-known cryptocurrency expert, has recently provided insights into the fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin by applying the basic economic theory of supply and demand. 
Understanding Bitcoin Prices Through Supply And Demand
It is worth noting that any asset’s price movement, including cryptocurrencies, is determined by the fundamental rules of supply and demand. An asset’s price tends to decrease when supply outpaces demand, while prices typically increase when supply cannot keep up with demand.

Thus, Ali Martinez has deduced the crypto asset’s price and holders’ behaviour by applying the method and other on-chain metrics. Martinez’s analysis demonstrates how fluctuations in the market’s buying interest and the availability of Bitcoin are key factors influencing its price trajectory.
According to Martinez, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap witnessed a significant increase mid-way through March when BTC hit a new all-time high of $73,000. This indicated that the majority of BTC’s long-term holders were likely yielding gains at the time.
As a result, several investors sold their holdings, which led to a sharp rise in realized profits. Following realized profits in March, long-term holders felt safe adding over 70,000 BTC to their investments at these prices.
BTC Realized Cap spike in mid-March | Ali Martinez on X
Meanwhile, when the market’s growing supply of Bitcoin exceeded demand, the coin saw a substantial correction from the $73,000 level to the $57,000 level. 
Given that short-term holders are more likely to sell their holdings due to price volatility, this decline took Bitcoin below its realized price for short-term holders, inciting fear in the market. However, despite investors’ concerns, the short-term holder’s Realized Price at the $65,500 level acted as an accumulation point.
On the basis of this principle, Martinez believes the likelihood of Bitcoin continuing its upward trajectory will only increase when demand for the cryptocurrency starts to exceed the supply of BTC accessible in the market.
Using BTC On Exchanges To Support The Principles
Martinez has underscored that the available BTC on crypto exchanges can be used to confirm these supply and demand laws. He further noted that over 30,000 BTC have been moved to private wallets for long-term storage in May, indicating confidence among holders in the potential worth of Bitcoin.

Observing Bitcoin’s price using the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, Martinez cited a retracement above the +0.5σ pricing band at $64,600. Such an upswing has historically caused BTC to test the pricing range of 1.0σ, which is backed by increasing demand. Meanwhile, this price range at the moment is roughly lingering at $77,000.
Presently, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $66,275, indicating an over 5% increase in the past week. Although prices are up, its trading volume has declined by 24%, while its market cap is up by 0.23%.

The Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan detained without bail in Nigeria

Nigeria: a court has rejected the bail request of Tigran Gambaryan from Binance. As a result, Nigeria has taken Binance and its executives to court, accusing them of tax evasion and money laundering.
Let’s see all the details below. 

Nigeria: bail denied to Tigran Gambaryan of Binance
As anticipated, the bail request for the detained Binance executive, Tigran Gambaryan, has been rejected by a court in Nigeria. 
The spokesperson for the executive’s family stated that this happened because there is a risk that he may escape if released on bail. 
Last Friday, hearings were held for the bail of Binance’s Chief Compliance Officer, Tigran Gambaryan, accused of money laundering and tax evasion. 
The court has ruled that Binance can be served with the accusation of tax evasion through Gambaryan.
Gambaryan’s lawyers have challenged the request, arguing that they need a review of the amended charge in order to properly advise their client. The court has agreed to postpone the matter until May 22 for the official charge.
Gambaryan has been detained in Nigeria since February, when he arrived with a colleague. His detention occurred one month after the arrest of Binance executives in the country, all accused of money laundering and tax evasion.
He was later transferred to Kuje prison, where there are also members of the terrorist group Boko Haram.
The money laundering trial, conducted by the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), began on Friday, with the first prosecution witness called by the Nigerian SEC. 
Gambaryan’s lawyers requested a break to obtain certified documents to use in the cross-examination of the witness, and the court postponed the next hearing to May 23rd.
A spokesperson for Binance expressed deep disappointment over Gambaryan’s detention, emphasizing that he has no decision-making powers in the company and that the accusations are groundless. 
He requests his release during the discussions between Binance and Nigerian government officials. Binance CEO, Richard Teng, also appealed to the Nigerian government to release Gambaryan.
Binance CEO’s appeal for the release of Gambaryan
As mentioned, Binance CEO, Richard Teng, urged the Nigerian government to release Tigran Gambaryan, head of the Financial Crime Compliance team at the cryptocurrency exchange.
Teng highlighted the serious impact of this detention on the global business community, emphasizing the need to address this issue urgently.
The context of the economic crisis affecting Nigeria, with its currency in decline and inflation at the highest levels in decades, adds an additional layer of complexity to the situation. 
The confrontation between Binance and the Nigerian authorities regarding licensing requirements has been ongoing since 2022 without satisfactory responses from the competent institutions.
The arrest of Gambaryan and Binance’s regional director for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla, after an official meeting, has raised questions about the transparency and legality of the actions taken by the authorities. 
The fact that Anjarwalla managed to escape custody has raised further questions about the management of the whole affair.
Currently held on charges of money laundering in Kuje prison, Gambaryan has faced delays in legal proceedings, highlighting the complexity and challenges of the Nigerian legal system.
The appeal filed by Gambaryan and Anjarwalla against the Nigerian authorities for alleged violation of their human rights adds a further element of tension to an already complex and delicate situation.

Unshaken by Financial Setbacks, Maximillian White Blends Cannabis, Blockchain, and NFTs for Success



                    

Financial failure does not faze medical marijuana millionaire and entrepreneur Maximillian White.



Europe’s wealthiest legal cannabis tycoon has faced significant misfortune, both in his own career and his father’s. 




Notably, he lost $29 million in the Cypriot banking collapse of 2012. Instead of conserving his remaining funds, he purchased a Rolls Royce to drive around publicly.



“I’m a proud man. I didn’t want people to think I was lost,” he says. “I may also be a poser.” In reality, he is a hard worker unafraid of failure.



White now embraces blockchain technology and NFTs as part of his business. 




He compares it to a Manhattan cocktail, where the combination of ingredients makes it great. “For me, it’s the combination of cannabis, blockchain, and crypto – you can’t go wrong.”



White began his career in music production, including working with Drake on the hit “One Dance.” He built and sold the music streaming service Beatport, earning millions.



His ventures extended to Portugal, where he created Blanco Beach, a beach club frequented by celebrities like Rio Ferdinand and performers like Tyga and Rick Ross. Although it has since closed, it showcased his diverse interests.



White, who has ADHD, says it gives him eclectic tastes in music, from classical to hip hop. 




He knew he was destined to be a business builder since primary school, dressing up as an entrepreneur for a school event.

His work ethic is rooted in his early life as a chorister at Durham Cathedral, where he sang daily without breaks, even on Christmas.



White made his fortune selling medicinal marijuana worldwide and establishing Europe’s largest plantation in Portugal. 



He expanded into real estate in Dubai, Majorca, and Eastern Europe, driven by the loss of his family home during childhood. His brother’s tragic death in 2022 further marked his resilience.



Legal marijuana is gaining acceptance globally, with medical use legal in over 50 countries and recreational use in nine. Despite past plans for a cannabis cryptocurrency called MEDI falling through, White remains innovative.



Collaborating with digital marketer Ricardo Capone, White integrates NFTs with his cannabis products to ensure traceability via blockchain.



Initially skeptical about NFTs as art, White was excited by their potential for smart contracts. 



“Smart contracts made me delve further into the space,” he says, highlighting their business applications.



His latest project, Dr Green, uses NFTs as “unique business passes.” Holders access the Dr Green DApp to build a cannabis-selling community. 



The NFTs act like licenses, tradeable and increasing in value with customer base growth.



Despite his blockchain enthusiasm, White remains cautious about cryptocurrency valuation against the dollar, questioning its decentralization.



“Our NFTs are acting like a digital key or real-world asset, where you can plug into the systems of a company that is already up and running.”

                        As major cryptocurrencies look to end the week on a strong footing, with Bitcoin (BTC) looking to push above a key short-term resistance zone, traders are parsing through their options in the altcoin market that might be the best crypto to buy now.Bitcoin nudged up 1.5% on Friday and was last trading close to weekly highs just above $66,000.CPI data released earlier this week gave the cryptocurrency market a major boost as Fed rate cut hopes rose.Bitcoin is also experiencing headwinds due to spot Bitcoin ETF demand and the Bitcoin adoption narrative.US spot Bitcoin ETFs have enjoyed net inflows every day this week, totaling over $750 million so far.$550 million of these flows came in the past two days, as per Farside Investors.Meanwhile, 13F filings this week by US asset managers have shown that over 500 institutions acquired Bitcoin ETFs last quarter.These include a range of multi-national banks, like Morgan Stanley, and even a state pension fund.Bitcoin is lagging behind a surge in the US stock market, with the S&P 500 hitting fresh record highs above 5,300 this week.Bitcoin, by contrast, is 10% down from its March record highs near $74,000.But if Bitcoin can break above late-April highs at $67,000, a pushback above $70,000 is possible.Bitcoin could easily 2x as interest rates fall and institutional adoption continues, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewThe prospect of a near-term test of its all-time highs means that Bitcoin might be the best crypto to buy now for many investors.Indeed, over the next year or so, Bitcoin could easily 2x as interest rates fall and institutional adoption continues.The lower issuance rate to miners will also be a major long-term tailwind after the latest halving.That said, many crypto investors will be hunting for gains that are bigger than 2x.Smaller and lesser-known altcoins are riskier than Bitcoin but much more likely to yield 5-10x gains.Here are some strong-performing altcoins that might be the best crypto to buy now on Friday.Best Crypto to Buy NowArweave (AR)Decentralized data storage and hosting service network Arweave (AR) just hit its highest levels since January 2022.As per CoinMarketCap, Arweave gained 10% in the past 24 hours and was last in the $48s.The cryptocurrency has already rebounded 125% from its April lows.If it can continue its momentum and push back to its 2021 highs, further 2x gains are potentially in store.Currently, Arweave has a modest market cap of around $3.2 billion.As its promising protocol gains further adoption, this market cap could expand 5 or even 10x beyond its current level.That’s why Arweave potentially ranks as the best crypto to buy now.Hedera (HBAR)Another strong-performing altcoin on Friday is Hedera (HBAR). The cryptocurrency is up 6.5% in today and trades at an upper $ 0.11.HBAR powers the decentralized, open-source, proof-of-stake Hedera public ledger.It appears to have formed an ascending triangle, a break above which could open the door to a near-term pushback to April highs.The prospect of quick 50% gains means that HBAR is potentially the best crypto to buy today.

While all of the above coins offer a potential 5-10x upside in this bull market, some traders are hunting for more.Meme coins are one way to generate big gains. But, owing to their lack of clear utility, they are very risky.A better way to make 50-100x gains might be to invest in web3 startups via presales.Upcoming projects often offer their tokens at a steep discount to early investors as they raise funds for development.Presales have their own risks – a project might fail to meet expectations, for example.That’s why it’s crucial that traders don’t rush their investments. Rather, they should take the time to assess and project properly and do their own research.Here are some of Cryptonews’ favorite presales for 2024 that could be a good starting point.21 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In Now

Bitcoin Mirroring Exact Scenario That Preceded Run to Record High, Says Kevin Svenson - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Kevin Svenson is saying that Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing bullish signals in a similar manner to what happened earlier this year.
Svenson tells his 78,100 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is breaking out of a reversal bottom pattern.










“We are breaking out of a reversal bottom pattern. So this is really bullish, I would say… Bitcoin is also above the Relative Strength Index (RSI) downtrend line on the daily chart. And this is just a signal for continuation to the upside…”
The RSI is an oscillator used to identify oversold or overbought conditions.
According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s price action is currently mirroring what was witnessed just before the flagship crypto asset surged to around $73,737 in mid-March.
“It’s no different than this zone in early 2024 when we had a sideways consolidation, downward sloping resistance on the RSI and we broke out leading us to new all-time highs.
Bitcoin is once again playing out the exact same scenario, likely leading us to new all-time highs.”
Svenson says that Bitcoin is in the fourth stage of a parabolic curve pattern which could theoretically peak at $90,000. In technical analysis, a parabolic curve pattern consists of four stages or bases where the price trades in a range at each of the stages, before continuing upwards.
“This is the textbook target of $90,000; this is not the cycle peak target. I think that in this bull cycle, considering that the halving just happened, we could go higher than $90,000. But we may have to cool down before that. 
So that could mean that Bitcoin runs up to our parabolic trend target of $90,000 before seeing a breakdown of that trend with a sideways consolidation. And then a further push up creating a larger more expansive parabolic trend.”

Crypto Influencer Touts CTF's Growth Potential on XRP Ledger


							

CTF poised for potential growth with a limited total supply of 100 million tokens.



CTF price volatile despite limited supply (down 0.23% in 24 hours)



CTF bridge aims to improve interoperability in DeFi space




JackTheRippler, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, recently drew attention to CryptoTradingFund (CTF), a token within the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. JackTheRippler expressed optimism about CTF’s potential for growth, citing its limited total supply of 100 million tokens as a factor that could influence its value.







A hypothetical scenario presented by JackTheRippler suggests that if the total market capitalization of CTF reached $10 billion, the token price could rise from its current level of $1.77 to $374.25. However, it is important to note that such projections are speculative and do not account for various market factors.



Current trading data for CTF paints a mixed picture. While the token has exhibited some resilience in a volatile market environment, with the current price a t$1.77,  it has experienced a slight decline of 0.23% in the past 24 hours. The 24-hour trading volume of $27,195.30 also suggests relatively low liquidity.



The recent price surge could be attributed to an unidentified market event or positive news related to CTF. The subsequent consolidation phase suggests that investors are evaluating this development. Trading activity appears to have fluctuated throughout these price movements.









The upward spike in price signals a noteworthy market event or positive news catalyst. This surge is followed by a consolidation phase, indicating market participants are digesting the recent developments. Throughout these fluctuations, varying levels of trading activity are observed.



Looking ahead, CryptoTradingFund’s upcoming bridging mechanism, scheduled for launch on June 5th, aims to improve interoperability between blockchain networks. This development has the potential to facilitate smoother asset transfers and unlock new possibilities within the DeFi space.

What Is GameStop and the GME Phenomenon? How the Meme Stock Craze Unfolded - Decrypt

In January 2021, video game retailer GameStop (GME) became the center of an unprecedented stock market phenomenon, as GME stock prices skyrocketed due to a massive short squeeze sparked by retail traders on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets forum.Here's what you need to know about GameStop and the GME saga.What is GameStop?GameStop is an American video game, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer. Founded in 1984 as Babbage's in Dallas, Texas, GameStop grew to become a major player in the retail gaming market. It has thousands of physical stores around the world, where gamers can buy, sell, and trade video games and consoles.However, in recent years, GameStop faced significant challenges due to the digitalization of gaming and increasing competition from online retailers. Exacerbated by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, this led to declining sales and store closures, making GME a target for short sellers who bet against the company's stock.r/WallStreetBets and the GME phenomenonIn late 2020 and early 2021, GameStop became the focal point of a massive coordinated buying effort initiated by retail investors on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets—including Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty.These investors aimed to trigger a short squeeze—a situation where short sellers are forced to buy shares to cover their positions, driving the stock price up further.By January 2021, the movement had gained significant momentum. GameStop's stock price, which was around $17 at the beginning of the year, soared to an all-time high of $483 on January 28, 2021, fueled by a combination of retail investor enthusiasm, social media influence, and the financial strain on hedge funds that had heavily shorted the stock.The aftermathThe GME surge led to enormous gains for some retail investors, while also causing substantial losses for certain hedge funds. It prompted a wave of trading restrictions on platforms like Robinhood, sparking debates about market fairness and regulatory oversight.The meme stock mania became something of a pop culture moment, too, making household names out of traders like Roaring Kitty. There was even a 2023 feature film, “Dumb Money,” based on their exploits.The GME phenomenon had several lasting impacts. Many new participants were drawn into the stock market by the meme stock phenomenon—especially younger investors using mobile apps such as Robinhood. Regulators and lawmakers increased their scrutiny of meme stocks and short selling practices. And GameStop itself leveraged its newfound attention and influx of capital to shift its focus towards e-commerce and digital ventures such as NFTs—with mixed results.The future of GameStopFollowing the r/WallStreetBets short squeeze, GameStop embarked on a bid to expand into NFT collectibles via a marketplace for digital assets and an Ethereum wallet. The strategy foundered as the broader NFT market lost momentum, with CEO Matt Furlong saying in December 2021 that it would put less focus on NFT and crypto-related efforts, amid layoffs in the crypto team.Furlong was ousted as CEO in June 2023, with Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen assuming the role of executive chairman. Under Cohen’s leadership, the company has embarked on a strategic pivot. The goal is to turn GameStop into a technology-driven company, focusing on e-commerce and leveraging its existing customer base.In May 2024, interest in GameStop as a “meme stock” was briefly revived when r/WallStreetBets figurehead Roaring Kitty seemingly returned from a lengthy absence on social media.Although the financial influencer didn’t directly reference GameStop, his apparent return was enough to spark a rally in stocks and crypto assets affiliated with his past exploits—including GameStop.The second wave of meme stock mania was short-lived, however—though some lucky traders made bank trading GME options.Editor's noteThis article was written with the assistance of AI.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software, will release its fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings report after the market closes on Wednesday, May 22, 2024. Analysts and investors alike are eagerly awaiting the results. The company has consistently outperformed expectations in recent quarters, largely driven by the surging demand for AI-related products and services.



Nvidia Expected to Bring in $24.65 Billion in Revenue for Q1 FY25



Wall Street analysts project Nvidia’s revenue to reach a staggering $24.65 billion for Q1 FY2025, a significant increase from $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year. The company’s net income is expected to soar to $12.87 billion, up from $2.04 billion a year ago, while earnings per share (EPS) are anticipated to be $5.17, a sharp increase from $0.82 in the year-ago period.



Nvidia has a track record of beating earnings expectations, having done so consistently in the past four quarters. The company’s data center segment has shown rapid growth, reaching a record high of $18.4 billion in Q4 FY2024, driven by the increasing demand for AI-capable chips and infrastructure.





Key Highlights and Investor Focus



Investors will be closely watching the performance of the data center segment, which is projected to achieve $21 billion in sales for Q1 FY2025. Updates on the highly anticipated Blackwell platform, Nvidia’s next-generation AI computing architecture, are also expected during the earnings call.



Market participants will be keen to gain insights into future performance expectations, particularly regarding the continued demand for AI-capable chips and overall market conditions. They will also focus on any revisions in earnings estimates and their potential impact on Nvidia’s stock price.

Empire Newsletter: Crypto’s day in Congress - Blockworks


What’s in a vote?
Meet the US Senate’s new Democratic crypto caucus — sort of.
Yesterday saw Congress’ upper chamber side with the House on a measure aimed at scuttling crypto accounting guidance created by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As Blockworks’ Casey Wagner reported Wednesday, the vote resulted from a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign involving Republicans and industry advocates.
In the end, a dozen Democrats crossed the aisle for the 60-38 vote. When the House voted last week to undo Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, 21 Democrats joined Republicans. 
What to make of this group, and the relatively swift speed at which this effort took shape? 
Some of the group have been public about their crypto positions for some time. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, of course, co-authored legislation with Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming. Others, including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have expressed support for the US crypto industry in the past. 
On the other hand, some yes-voting members have taken positions less popular with the industry; Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Mark Kelly of Arizona and John Hickenlooper of Colorado have all scored “very anti-crypto scores” from Stand With Crypto’s political rankings.

One has to wonder how much the Biden White House’s veto threat factored into the Democrats’ decision to “vote their conscience” — that is, not align behind a particular yea-or-nay group strategy. 
Remember, several of the votes in question were cast by senators up for reelection this fall: Gillibrand, Casey and Tester. For these members, at least, the vote provides a way to create some daylight between them and an unpopular incumbent. 
The glass-half-empty interpretation: Biden’s stated plan to veto the bill made it a somewhat “safer” bill to vote on, given the preordained outcome. 
Of course, it’s always possible that Biden will reverse course and side with a decidedly bipartisan movement in Congress, but given that it’s an election year, such a move would be a surprising one.
I think there’s more going on here than political machinations, however. Despite the memes to the contrary, there’s always been Democrat support for crypto issues, albeit not at the fervor expressed by Republicans. 
It’s possible, quibbles aside, that the popularity of crypto has broken through and created a moment when Congress actually, against the odds, saw fit to move forward with crypto legislation. Sure, it took the form of an opposition measure, and yeah, it amounts to a won’t survive-a-veto messaging bill when Congress is essentially done working for the year. But they did it by a wider-than-expected margin, and that means something.
The upcoming election is about much more than crypto. But this week’s vote may mean that the next session of Congress could see real movement on crypto issues. 
And who knows — there’s still a few more months to go. Maybe Lummis’ and Gillibrand’s bill will get the attention and debate it has long deserved.

The US bitcoin ETF segment saw positive inflows, including GBTC, notching a total flow of $257 million per Farside data.
BTC and ETH are up to $66,300 and $3,000, respectively. 
Roughly $55 million of shorts were liquidated in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data.
Pepe and WIF are down around 3% to start Thursday, as memestocks and memecoins continue to lose momentum, according to CoinGecko.
GameStop closed down 30% on Thursday and is looking weak ahead of the opening bell Friday. 

The cutest of pumps
There are some things crypto just does better.
Want to transfer value almost instantly to the other side of the globe, for a fraction of the cost of boring-ass fintech unicorns like Wise and Revolut? Use Tether on a network like Tron or Polygon: frictionless, fast and easy.
How about raising funds for a new venture? Like a goat farm. All good — you can easily source liquidity and donations from around the world on social media and buy tons of goats, no questions asked.
It turns out crypto also does wanton pointless pumping much better than the stock market.
The normie crowd has come back around to meme stocks, about three years after the original /r/wallstreetbets craze. GameStop has pumped up to about 550% and dumped by nearly half over the past few weeks, all because that Roaring Kitty guy tweeted some silly cryptic on Twitter.
What goes up mostly comes down and stays down when it comes to meme stocks
Other popular memestocks from the COVID era of free helicopter money (stimulus packages) haven’t yet had the same treatment, for better or worse.
Whether AMC, Virgin Galactic and Kodak Eastman get their second moment is anyone’s guess. Still, GameStop’s recent 550% is cute compared to what happens around these parts. So is its peak-2021 pump of more than 5,400% (54x).
In the past five years — the same period as memecoin mania #1 and #2 — DOGE, FLOKI, WIF, BONK and SHIB have all, at their most, multiplied in price hundreds of times. SHIB however takes the cake, exploding by 80,000x (8 million percent).
Bitcoin, ether and Coinbase stock for scale (wink, wink)
Sure, there are some caveats: Many memecoins start trading from near zero, so any real market movement sends prices practically off the chart. Hard to compare that with already-listed stocks within the same timeframe. And stock market circuit breakers do tend to put a damper on things.
But don’t let that get in the way of a good time. 
DOGE, for instance, was launched in 2013 and it still went parabolic in 2021, far more than GameStop, Nikola or Hertz ever did.
In fact, if SHIB was included in the chart below, it would turn the entire meme stocks sector into a tiny, little, insignificant bubble. 
Sounds about right.

The Works

Hong Kong’s bitcoin and ether ETFs saw outflows earlier this week, shaking confidence in their debut.
Following yesterday’s exploit, Pump.fun said the attacker was a “former employee.” 
The Senate passed the resolution to overturn SAB 121, though President Biden has said he plans to veto it.
A Dolce & Gabbana customer is suing the fashion firm after it delivered NFT outfits late, Bloomberg wrote.
Biden’s order to stop a Chinese-tied mining operation came days after CleanSpark bought the sites, CoinDesk reports.

The Morning Riff
Former Alameda CEO Sam Trabucco has been notably absent from the aftermath of FTX’s downfall, though his name tends to pop up when discussing the collapse itself. 
Caroline Ellison, his co-CEO prior to his departure, took the stand at Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial though Trabucco didn’t appear once. He also hasn’t been publicly accused of any wrongdoing.
But yesterday, Trabucco broke his silence in a letter to the court ahead of ex-FTX executive Ryan Salame’s sentencing hearing. 
Trabucco’s letter is over three pages long and is….interesting, to say the least. Not only do we learn a lot about Salame’s home life (he hung 80 photographs of his new partner in his home after dating for a month) but we also get some insight into Trabucco’s time at Alameda. 
Simply put: Trabucco seemed unhappy with the hours and work at Alameda, calling Salame his “lifeline” through the “hardest period of my life.”
Obviously, we can’t know what happened behind closed doors and there are still many questions that remain unanswered about Trabucco’s role and the millions of dollars he walked away with. 
But he’s made one thing clear: He’s a loyal friend.

Antminer L9 Coming Soon: Will Change Litecoin and Dogecoin Mining? | Cryptopolitan

Antminer L9 is coming, with a more powerful and energy-efficient way for Scrypt mining. This hashing algorithm is key for securing the Litecoin network, while also producing Dogecoin. Scrypt miners will face a price tag above $16K, but a chance for higher profitability in mining LTC and DOGE. Bitmain is still the main source of mining rigs, and its new models drove the arms race among miners. Proof-of-work blockchains are still a thing, and new rigs offer more energy efficiency with improved performance, to offset environmental concerns. Antminer L9 to Be Released by the End of MayThe new Antminer Scrypt rig was pre-announced to arrive in May, but there is no set date. The new miner is not yet listed on the Bitmain site. Some vendors, however, have already listed the model for presale, with a price tag starting at $14,700. The new hashing power is not expected to affect Scrypt networks for months, as the first shipments are scheduled for June. Also read: Litecoin Price Prediction 2024-2030: Will LTC Price Hold $100?The Antminer L9 will produce up to 17.6 GH/s, competing with the overall growing mining presence for Litecoin.In the past three years, Litecoin’s mining has gradually grown, and activity is up by 500%. The hashrate is now 1.16 PH/s, breaking to a new range. But this level of mining is negligible compared to Bitcoin’s network. Also read: How is Litecoin a Winner? LTC Leads As Most Widely-Used Coin for Payments and Simple TransactionsHowever, for Litecoin miners, the relatively low competition allows for additional block creation and higher rewards. Litecoin is still between two halving cycles and its block reward is still 6.25 coins per block, with additional Dogecoin (DOGE) issued in every new block created. Is the New Litecoin Miner Profitable?The big question when investing in a mining rig is whether it would pay for itself through rewards and fees. The new Antminer L9 can be profitable, given cheap electricity and peak performance. However, the earnings are potentially around $1,000 per year, depending on different electricity prices. Litecoin and SCRYPT mining is differently profitable and depends on just the creation of new LTC. Other Scrypt-based assets may have different profitabilities. Are Scrypt-Based Tokens Still Relevant?Most Scrypt mining assets are relatively older, created soon after the launch of Bitcoin. Litecoin and Dogecoin are still the most significant and prominent ones. Other mined assets include Syscoin (SYS), MonaCoin (MONA) and ReddCoin (RDD), which survive mostly due to being tied to their online communities. Most Scrypt-based coins have trading volumes close to zero, and some are practically frozen and useless. Any new Scrypt-based hashing power would thus go to LTC and DOGE production, hardly affecting other networks. Mining Links to Web3, NFT ItemsThe old model of mining included the creation of coins, which were then held or sold to cover costs. In some cases, however, miners found other ways to retain value. The newly minted coins are used as collaterals to support the value of NFT or other types of tokens. Thus, not all LTC and DOGE would be sold. Some miners offer a share of their rig’s performance, usually in exchange for fees or for buying a specific NFT. Snekkies, one of the NFT projects on Cardano, is tied to a Scrypt miner, who also holds LTC and DOGE collaterals. LTC is a relatively stable asset, trading at $83.08. DOGE recovered above $0.15, and has also kept within a predictable range. Together, the assets have a loyal community of long-term holders, and are suitable as collaterals for riskier Web3 features. Litecoin Mining Still Hinges on Large PoolsLitecoin mining is impossible to do solo. Just like Bitcoin’s network, Litecoin mining is dominated by four of the largest pools. Most LTC is produced by Bitmain’s own Antpool, as well as ViaBTC, F2Pool and the Binance.com pool. It may be possible that the Antminer L9 would first be available and tested by Antpool, solidifying its leading position. Antpool controls 28.9% of all known hashrate, and discovers on average 16 of every 100 Litecoin blocks. Cryptopolitan reporting by Hristina Beeva.

Is onboarding too hard? Crypto adoption still faces major obstacles

Web3 has been the subject of speculation for many years now, and predictions about what will spur mass adoption are frequent, as are possible obstacles slowing the onboarding process. Some, like Web3 gaming execs, have speculated crypto market hype, and several highly anticipated blockchain games could be the key to mass onboarding. According to a Feb. 22 survey report from key management network Web3Auth, which had 3,378 responses from Web3 users, developers and decision-makers worldwide, respondents think there are still several issues that need ironing out before mass adoption can become a reality. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Robert Hoogendoorn, the head of content at blockchain analytics platform DappRadar, said he thinks two obstacles in particular need to be overcome: a “simplified interface and user experience” and an increase in general consumer knowledge about cybersecurity.“One of these has been improved heavily in the past few years, while the other could use some work. Did you know 60% of American consumers use the same password across multiple accounts?” he said. “That’s the same audience you want to onboard into Web3, and who will act surprised that MegaPepeBitcoinToken turned out to be a rug pull? That’s just one of the major challenges ahead of us.”At the same time, Hoogendoorn says it’s not uncommon for “technological advancement” to come with onboarding challenges. He thinks the Web3 industry has made “significant progress” in this area, though. “Onboarding in Web3 is a challenge. Insiders praise the technology, but for the end-user, it’s all about the experience,” he said. “Only now we’re reaching a point where Web3-powered financial services or video games reach a level of sophistication that could potentially onboard millions,” Hoogendoorn added.Respondents in the Web3Auth survey claim the top hurdle holding people back from adopting Web3 is concerns about security and risks to people’s assets. According to Hoogendoorn, the wider crypto industry has been “labeled a wild west for a decade, and that’s not something that goes well with the general public.” He thinks this perception of poor cybersecurity is an obstacle holding back users from Web3. Related: Web3 can benefit from adopting Web2 optimization: NBX BerlinCases such as the mainstream coverage of the FTX collapse and the subsequent Sam Bankman-Fried trial, where he was sentenced to 25 years in jail for fraud, have done little to help with this perception. Other high-profile crypto company collapses, such as the $10 billion Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital in 2022, have also contributed to the negativity that might be holding back mainstream users from onboarding into Web3. Rug pulls and hacks are also a thorn in the side of Web3. Over $200 million worth of crypto has been lost to hacks and rug pulls in 32 individual incidents so far in 2024, according to a Feb. 29 research report by blockchain security firm Immunefi.Education and positive PR may be the answerHoogendoorn believes the negative perception of Web3 will need to change to incite mass adoption of the tech, and that will likely require “lots of positive PR” from within the industry. A change is also required for the general public, with better education about best security practices. “In general, people are notoriously bad at managing their account names and passwords, as most of them don’t use 2FA and a big number uses the same password all the time,” Hoogendoorn said. “People value safety but don’t act responsibly. In Web2, this can cause issues, but in Web3, this can result in your money being stolen instantly. And when this happens, it — again — rubs off negatively on our industry.”Speaking to Cointelegraph, the BNB Chain Core Development Team said “multiple hurdles could act as blockers” when onboarding people into Web3. The most prominent are a lack of education and accessibility to unfamiliar user experiences or a lack of incentive mechanisms. Related: Web3 domains are an unassuming force in crypto mass adoption — Unstoppable Domains COO“Mass adoption of Web3 will likely be facilitated by several key factors, including user-friendliness, secure and reliable infrastructure and education,” they said. According to the team, Web3 can be difficult to navigate for those new to the space, so it’s important to “offer fun and engaging ways” to get involved, such as meme campaigns that offer incentives and rewards.Overall, the BNB Chain Core Development Team says robust infrastructure, user experience and performance are all critical for onboarding more Web3 users.“The path to mass adoption of Web3 will likely be gradual and multifaceted, involving innovative technology, user-friendly interfaces, and education,” they said.“The priority should remain on improving the usability of existing technology rather than relying solely on breakthroughs to aid the transition from Web2 to Web3.” Complex tech and uncertain regulations slow Web3 adoptionPavel Salas, the chief growth officer at the Gear Foundation — the organization behind the Gear Protocol — said onboarding into Web3 is complex and hard to understand for non-technical users. He told Cointelegraph Web3 applications are not always user-friendly, which poses a considerable barrier to adoption and can keep new users away. “Take playing an on-chain game as an example. Initially, users need to download a wallet and acquire the necessary tokens — these could be specific to the game or a general protocol token like Ethereum or Solana,” he said. “After setup, they face the ongoing requirement of paying for gas with each transaction.”Sami Start, co-founder and CEO of developer integration toolkit Transak, told Cointelegraph that onboarding from fiat to crypto is at a critical bottleneck. He says, “Less than 10% of global internet users own cryptocurrency, reflecting significant entry barriers.” According to a market sizing report from cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com, the global number of crypto users increased by 34% in 2023, growing from 432 million to 580 million people. Online data platform Statista estimates that as of April 2024, there were 5.44 billion internet users worldwide. Start says regulatory complexities and the varied integration with existing financial systems make the transition into Web3 daunting for new users as well. In May 2023, the European Council adopted the first comprehensive legal framework for the crypto industry.However, other countries and jurisdictions have been slower to create a framework for crypto, with some outright banning its use. Start also thinks because the Web3 space is fragmented with many blockchains and protocols, this can confuse users and limit the potential network effects that drive adoption.“As an industry, it’s imperative to streamline these processes, ensuring that converting fiat to crypto is as simple as any traditional online payment,” he said. “By addressing these challenges, we can make the blockchain’s transformative potential accessible to a broader audience and significantly increase adoption rates.”Speaking to Cointelegraph, Ken Timsit, managing director at Web3 startup accelerator Cronos Labs, said that for most crypto users, onboarding takes place on a custodial crypto exchange platform first. He says, “This step works very well nowadays because the top exchanges are regulated and implement KYC [Know Your Customer] controls.” Related: Aussie corporate regulator to build ‘outcome-based’ crypto policiesKYC is a set of steps crypto exchanges take during onboarding to verify customer identity and perform due diligence to understand financial activities and risks.Timsit says, “We would all like to onboard more mainstream users,” but he thinks an issue that needs to be addressed is how the tech is being developed; specifically, it needs to be geared toward mainstream users, not those experienced in crypto. “Many of the recent success stories, such as liquid restaking, modular scaling protocols and memecoins, have been driven by an experienced user base,” he said. “As a result, projects are currently incentivized to build primarily for OGs, whales and degens. At the same time, some mainstream users are still turned off by the lack of regulatory clarity.”

Bank of America Blames Customers, Ignores Law, Denies Fraud Claims Without Any Explanation or Proof Whatsoever: New Class-Action Allegations - The Daily Hodl


								A Bank of America customer just launched a class-action lawsuit accusing the lender of illegally refusing to reimburse legitimate victims of fraud.
Plaintiff Kimberley Dennie says she lost her BofA debit card in February and soon watched several unauthorized transactions hit her account.










Dennie says she promptly reported the card as lost or stolen and submitted a claim, which included a police report detailing what happened, to recover $3,000 that had disappeared from the account.
According to the lawsuit, Bank of America quickly rejected the claim and accused Dennie of authorizing the transactions without offering any evidence, as required by law.
“Despite Plaintiff’s request for an explanation and further review, and submitting a police report for the stolen card and fraudulent transactions, Bank of America mechanically rejected Plaintiff’s claim without performing a reasonable investigation and instead, issued form denial notices devoid of any factual findings or documentation from its alleged investigation…
It was Bank of America’s burden to prove that these disputed transactions were authorized – not Plaintiff’s – and its failure to do so is unlawful and unfair to Plaintiff and thousands of other consumers who have to bear the consequences of stolen funds in unlimited sums.”
The lawsuit accuses the banking giant of routinely and brazenly rejecting customers’ legitimate claims while sending out vague, boilerplate letters of denial.
“Bank of America fails to comply with its statutory obligations by failing to provide written explanations of its denials. 
Instead, Bank of America routinely denies claims without any explanation whatsoever, stating only its conclusion that a claim has been denied. Bank of America’s boilerplate denial letters flip the burden of proof onto consumers to disprove the supposed reasonableness of the Bank’s investigation. But [the Electronic Funds Transfer Act] puts the burden of proof on financial institutions to show that disputed charges were authorized.”
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in North Carolina, with the plaintiff seeking “actual damages, punitive damages, and an injunction on behalf of the general public to prevent the Bank from continuing to engage in its illegal and/or unfair practices.”

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsSo much for the GameStop meme stock revival—and the related meme coin surge, too.With GameStop’s recent share price gains all but evaporated, an unofficial GameStop tribute coin on Solana is similarly down after shooting to a new all-time high price this week. The GME token has dropped to a price of $0.0067, per data from CoinGecko, falling 69% from that new peak set on Wednesday.GME on Solana, which has no official affiliation with the video game retailer, had been trading flat for weeks after launching in January and seeing a brief surge of momentum in early February. Trading volume over the last 24 hours is down to about $65 million—about one-third of this week’s peak, matching the price dip.Even so, the GME token is still up a massive 1,080% over the past week.

Trump Crypto Boom: Ex-President's Portfolio Soars 4,000% Amid Re-Election Frenzy


								Former US President Donald Trump has found himself at the epicenter of a cryptocurrency-fueled windfall.
Data from market intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence reveals that Trump’s cryptocurrency portfolio has surged by a staggering 4,000% – a gain largely driven by the meteoric rise of the “Save America” meme coin, affectionately dubbed “TRUMP.”

According to the report, Trump’s affiliated crypto wallet has been the recipient of multiple airdrops of the TRUMP token, the latest of which occurred just 30 minutes prior to the analysis.
These generous airdrops have propelled the wallet’s value from a modest $7.4 million to a staggering $9 million in a single day, with the TRUMP meme coin alone accounting for a remarkable $1.30 million of that increase.
Source: Arkham Intelligence
From Humble Beginnings To Crypto Dominance
Trump’s crypto journey has been nothing short of remarkable. As of January 1st, his wallet held a mere $142,500 worth of TRUMP tokens and $778,000 in Ethereum (ETH).
However, in the months since, his crypto empire has expanded exponentially, with the wallet now boasting nearly 580,000 TRUMP tokens valued at $5.8 million, and his ETH holdings growing to $1.30 million.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView
The marketing director for the TRUMP meme coin, Steven Steele, expressed that this is a clear indicator of the support from Trump’s fan base and the broader crypto community.
It’s evident that he has fully embraced cryptocurrency, and this has undoubtedly contributed to the surge in popularity of the TRUMP token.

Trump Token: Political Influence Meets Crypto Speculation
Trump’s crypto windfall is not merely a financial anomaly; it’s a testament to the interplay between political influence and the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market.
The former president’s pro-crypto stance, which includes a pledge to allow Americans to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions if re-elected, has galvanized his supporters and the broader crypto community alike.

The report notes that this unprecedented growth in Trump’s crypto holdings underscores the powerful influence that high-profile figures can wield over the cryptocurrency market.
As the 2024 election approaches, Trump’s crypto strategy and the support from his base could set a precedent for other political figures to leverage digital assets in their campaigns.
The TRUMP token’s increase in value highlights the unpredictable and speculative character of the crypto ecosystem, particularly when it comes to politically sensitive or meme-based assets.

MATIC price's breakout odds depend on THESE key metrics - AMBCrypto



Historical data using the MVRV ratio indicated a possible 31% hike for MATIC in the mid-term
Old tokens have refrained from moving – A sign that another correction might be unlikely

A crucial MATIC on-chain metric has shown signs that the token could be ready to reverse its losses of the last few months. At press time, MATIC was valued at $0.69 on the charts following a depreciation of 26.38% over the last  90 days.
The metric that flashed the aforementioned sign was the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio determines if an asset is undervalued or overvalued, depending on investor profitability in the market.
At press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio for MATIC had a reading of -0.97%. Historically, the price of MATIC bounces when the metric is between -8% and -16%.
After the lows, come the highs
This, because many holders are holding at a price lower than the historical cost basis. Thus, instead of realizing losses, market participants may take advantage of the decline and accumulate. Most times, this results in a higher value.
On 14 May, the MVRV ratio was -8.22%. However, the price of MATIC rose from that zone, pushing the metric to a much higher level.

In February, when a similar thing happened, MATIC’s price went on to hit $1.20. In this market, history does not exactly repeat itself. However, trends tend to be similar.
Therefore, if the ratio breaks into the positive zone, it is likely that MATIC’s next target might be $1, considering that it is a key area of interest.
Whether MATIC would be able to hold on to the price depends on the holders. If some decide to book profits at the projected price, MATIC might retrace on the charts.
However, sustained demand at that level could trigger a further uptrend, one that could send the price to $1.30. However, this conclusion might sound too hasty without checking other indicators.
MATIC diamond hands are not quitting
Another metric AMBCrypto analyzed was dormant circulation. If the dormant circulation spikes, it means that tokens that have moved in a long while are being transacted. In this case, the token might face selling pressure.
However, a low reading of the metric seemed to indiate that long-term investors are sticking to HODLing, instead of liquidating. That was the case with MATIC.
If sustained, the price of MATIC might not fall. Instead, it will consolidate for some time before a breakout eventually comes to pass.

In the meantime, the ratio of on-chain volume in profit to loss fell to 0.42. Readings like this imply that most transactions involving the token ended up in red, rather than in green.

From all indications, this on-chain volume in profit might begin to improve if MATIC validates the prediction above. However, should a change from the bullish bias appear, transactions in loss might continue to dominate.

BREAKING: Coinbase Announces New Altcoin Listing - Bitcoin Sistemi


In the statement made by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, it was reported that the Drift Protocol (DRIFT) altocoin will be listed on the exchange with the experimental label.
In the official statement made by Coinbase, it was stated that the DRIFT token will be supported on the Solana network.


The experimental label is used by the exchange to identify high-volatility and high-risk assets.
DRIFT had recently entered the listing roadmap of the exchange. However, DRIFT is a newly launched altcoin and was distributed to users via airdrop yesterday afternoon.





A total of 120 million DRIFT tokens were distributed to users during the airdrop event, which corresponds to 12% of the total supply.
Interestingly, the developers followed a different way to distribute the airdrop in question. In order to avoid network congestion and also prevent early sales, they announced that they will give an extra bonus of 20% of their airdrop to users who do not request the first airdrop for 6 hours.

SEC Never Loses? Veteran Labels Ripple Case Mixed Verdict


In a notable development, the SEC has appointed a new director of the Chicago Regional Office, the commission’s second-largest regional office. Amid the backdrop of this appointment, the ongoing discourse around cryptocurrency regulation has been reignited.Crypto enthusiasts quickly questioned the new director's stance on crypto, hinting at the pervasive uncertainty within the industry about regulatory attitudes.However, Marc Fagel, a former SEC worker and specialist in security law enforcement, clarified that personal stances on crypto are irrelevant in such regulatory roles. According to Fagel, the primary focus for individuals in these positions is the enforcement of federal securities laws, not personal opinions on cryptocurrencies.Fagel’s remarks come at a time when the SEC's approach to cryptocurrency enforcement remains a contentious issue. Critics argue that the federal securities laws are outdated and frequently misapplied to cryptocurrency protocols and foundations. Fagel countered this criticism by emphasizing the SEC's track record in crypto enforcement actions, noting that the SEC has yet to lose a case on the merits. He acknowledged that the Ripple case was a mixed result but underscored that the courts have generally upheld the SEC's positions.SEC v. RippleThe Ripple case, presided over by Judge Analisa Torres, has been particularly significant. In her ruling on July 13, 2023, Torres determined that while the XRP token itself is not a security, the manner in which it was sold could constitute the sale of a security.Specifically, institutional sales of XRP were deemed unregistered offers and sales of investment contracts, while programmatic sales and other XRP transactions by Ripple were not.Currently, the Ripple case has moved to the remedies phase, with the SEC demanding a $1.9 billion fine, a figure the company contests, suggesting the penalty should not exceed $10 million.

Pump.fun Identifies Ex-Employee in $1.9M Breach - The Defiant

Pump.fun has redeployed the contracts, and trading is now live with 0% fees for the next seven days.Memecoin launchpad Pump.fun said that a former employee was responsible for an exploit that took place on Thursday.This exploit led to the theft of 12,300 SOL, valued at $1.9 million at the time of the hack.In a post-mortem report posted on X (formerly Twitter), Pump.fun revealed that the former employee "illegitimately took access of the withdraw authority" and used flash loans on a Solana-based lending protocol to borrow SOL.Flash loans are uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within the same blockchain block, allowing the exploiter to quickly acquire a large amount of SOL without requiring upfront capital.The ExploitThe rogue employee exploited the borrowed SOL to purchase “as many coins” as possible on Pump.fun until the prices of these coins hit 100% on their respective bonding curves.In the Pump.fun ecosystem, bonding curves set the price of a coin based on its current supply, causing the price to increase as more coins are bought. Once these coins reached the maximum price point on the bonding curves, the exploiter gained access to the liquidity locked in these curves, which is the pooled funds supporting the trading and stability of those coins.By 17:00 UTC, all trading on Pump.fun was halted to prevent further damage. The platform stated that, "out of a total of $45m of liquidity in the bonding curve contracts, only ~$1.9m was affected."To compensate affected users, Pump.fun noted that the team "will seed the LPs for each affected coin with an equal or greater amount of SOL liquidity that the coin had at 15:21 UTC" within the next 24 hours.Pump.fun has since redeployed the contracts, and trading is live now with 0% trading fees for the next seven days.Since its launch in January, Pump.fun has seen its revenue surge to $22 million, data from DeFiLlama shows. On May 10, Pump.fun became the second-largest revenue generating platform in DeFi, surpassed only by the Ethereum Network.What is Pump.fun?Pump.fun is a memecoin launchpad platform designed to simplify the process of launching a token on Solana or Blast, making it accessible even to those with no coding experience.The platform allows users to create their own tokens within minutes, streamlining the initial launch phase by trading the new token along a bonding curve.According to Pump.fun, this approach helps "prevent rugs by making sure that all created tokens are safe," ensuring that each coin is a fair launch with "no presale and no team allocation."While that may be true, the system unfortunately did not prevent a flashloan attack.

Pepe Price Prediction as PEPE Drops 12% From Recent Peak – Time to Buy the Dip? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Pepe (PEPE) price has been pulling lower since hitting fresh record highs earlier this week. Traders are wondering whether now might be the time to buy the recent dip, as PEPE has dropped 12% from its peak.Pepe spiked up to new record highs above $0.000011 earlier this week following GameStop icon Roaring Kitty’s abrupt return.The legendary retail investor was a leading figure in the 2021 meme stock rally.And his return to X for the first time since 2021 on Monday injected momentum into meme stocks and meme coins.But the Pepe price has since dropped back to just over $0.00010.Chart analysis suggests that it might be too soon to buy into PEPE’s latest pullback. Here’s why.Pepe Price Prediction – Time to Buy the Dip?
Despite the latest pullback, the Pepe bulls are still in control of the market.The meme coin continues to trade well above its major short-term moving averages, which have acted as support.Pepe also broke out of an ascending triangle structure earlier this week.Traders looking to go long might want to wait for the Pepe price to retest the upper bounds of this ascending triangle before placing their bets.Indeed, $0.00000920 will likely offer very strong support for the price.The Pepe price could rebound strongly from this key support level. Source: TradingViewPepe’s market cap of just under $4.3 billion suggests that there is plenty of room left for the meme coin to run higher in this bull market as it grows in popularity.Pepe bulls will hope the meme coin can one day rival Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).These top meme coins have respective $21.9 billion and $14.6 billion.Dogecoin’s official Twitter has 3.9 million followers, and Shiba Inu has 3.8 million.By contrast, Pepe has 650,000 followers, so it still lags by some distance in terms of popularity.Crypto Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Pepe has a lot of upside potential, but few would expect it to 10x or more.Investors looking to make bigger profits in the 20-50x region should consider the often-overlooked investment strategy of presale investing.Upstart Web3 projects often sell their tokens at a discount to early investors.If presale investors can find high-potential projects, they can book huge profits.One presale project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is the new GambleFi ICO Mega Dice Casino.Mega Dice is a crypto casino that recently launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.The casino already has over 10,000 active monthly players and over $50 million wagered monthly, which ensures that demand for DICE will be strong.Indeed, strong demand is already evident in the success of the presale, which recently exceeded $1 million.At $0.075 per token, DICE has a $30 million market cap. That’s relatively low, considering the real-world adoption Mega Dice’s platform is already garnering.Mega Dice is already a market leader in GambleFi. As the sector grows, its coin could one day be worth over billions of dollars. DICE could easily be a 50-100x coin.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and This Trump-Themed Memecoin Have Outpaced Bitcoin This Week - Benzinga

So far, 2024 has undeniably been the year for memecoins. Countless new tokens have been released, and a handful of them have touted gains to the magnitude of thousands of percent. Additionally, the hype does not seem to be dying down. The tokens continue to go up and, in this case, some are outpacing the broader cryptocurrency market. Don't Miss:Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and MAGA Coin (TRUMP) have all performed better than bitcoin this past week. These memecoins do very little to add actual value to investors and instead focus on leaning into their memes. Surprisingly, this has resulted in enormous amounts of attention and buying activity.Shiba Inu is one of the older memecoins still afloat in 2024. Started in August 2020, the token quickly soared as it received attention from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. This week, the price is up more than 7%, bringing its market cap to over $14 billion. Started on the ethereum blockchain a little over a year ago, PEPE is a memecoin based on the infamous Pepe meme from the early 2000s, which features a crudely drawn frog. The token has climbed the crypto charts, and currently sits in the top 25 tokens by market cap, boasting a total of more than $4 billion. This week, PEPE's price is up by more than 17%.Trending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets — has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?A somewhat lesser known, but equally as interesting memecoin is MAGA Coin (TRUMP). This token, created in August 2023, combines the community and low-utility aspects of memecoins with the avid supporters of former President Donald Trump. The token has performed extremely well in 2024 and is up nearly 70% this week. Bitcoin also moved up this week on the heels of soft inflation data on Tuesday and comments from Trump himself about wanting to help the adoption of crypto. The CPI report came in better than expected, with inflation showing a 0.3% month-on-month increase in April, below the 0.4% expected. Additionally, Trump spoke at an NFT event, saying, If you like crypto in any form, and it comes in a lot of different forms, you better vote for Trump." Combined, these events helped propel bitcoin from $60,000 to over $66,000 this week. Overall, bitcoin is up just over 6% this week. This means that each of the memecoins noted above has outperformed bitcoin, which has also performed exceptionally well. For comparison, the S&P 500 is up around 2% this week, and the Nasdaq 100 is up just over 2.5%. Read Next:

Hong Kong Tests China's Digital Yuan (e-CNY) for Residents


							

Hong Kong pilots China’s digital yuan (e-CNY) for residents



Residents have a 50,000 yuan annual limit



China aims to expand e-CNY’s role in global transactions




Hong Kong launched a pilot program allowing residents to use China’s CBDC, the e-CNY, for the first time outside mainland China. This initiative marks a significant step in China’s efforts to internationalize the e-CNY and potentially increase the yuan’s role in global transactions, according to Bloomberg reports.



Residents within designated pilot areas can now create e-CNY wallets using their local mobile phones through participating banks like Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The program also allows users to top up their wallets via Hong Kong’s Faster Payment System (FPS), facilitating cross-border payments within the Greater Bay Area and other pilot regions in mainland China.



Speaking on the development, Eddie Yue, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, noted that Hong Kong citizens can load their wallets via the local FPS payment system, enhancing cross-border transactions with mainland China. 




“We will continue to work closely with the People’s Bank of China to gradually expand the application of e-CNY, enrich the range of functionalities” and promote the acceptance of the digital yuan by more retail merchants in both Hong Kong and China,” Yue asserted.




While adoption remains limited due to existing digital payment options and security concerns, the e-CNY user base has grown to 260 million since its initial pilot in 2020. This growth aligns with China’s broader ambition to internationalize the yuan, as evidenced by the increasing use of yuan-denominated payments reported by Swift in recent years.



Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, clarified that tourists can also utilize e-CNY for transactions within Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong residents are subject to a spending limit of 50,000 yuan annually.









This program aligns with Hong Kong’s aspirations to become a hub for virtual assets. Recent initiatives include the launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the introduction of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges.



According to the Bloomberg report, China began using e-CNY for international trade settlements in 2023, facilitating transactions in commodities, crude oil, and minerals. This development highlights the expanding scope of the e-CNY’s applications.

Bitcoin and U.S. Stocks Show Increasing Correlation: Bloomberg Report | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to Bloomberg, the 90-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index, a tech-heavy benchmark, reached 0.46 this week—the highest since late August. A coefficient of 1 indicates that assets move in perfect sync, while -1 suggests they move in opposite directions. Per the article, when the Fed began raising rates in early 2022, the correlation peaked at over 0.8, the highest since Bitcoin gained mainstream recognition.



Joshua Lim, co-founder of Arbelos Markets, told Bloomberg that investors are increasingly viewing crypto as a growth asset, valuing its technological capabilities and function as a value transfer mechanism. This perspective aligns Bitcoin more closely with growth-oriented assets like tech equities.



Bitcoin has been variously described as digital gold, an inflation hedge, and a store of value. However, its price volatility has challenged these narratives. The U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January directly introduced the cryptocurrency to a broader investor base.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Toby Winterflood, Chief Product Officer at CCData, said to Bloomberg that since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 has risen, which challenges its reputation as a store of value. He attributes Bitcoin’s recent highs to the maturation of these ETFs, which have rapidly grown to become some of the fastest in history. Bitcoin surged following the launch of these ETFs on January 11, reaching nearly $74,000 in March before stabilizing as demand cooled. On Friday, Bitcoin rose by about 2.3% to around $67,064, marking a nearly 10% increase this week. Year-to-date, Bitcoin has jumped approximately 60%, compared to an 11.73% rise in the S&P 500 and a 12.19% increase in the Nasdaq-100.

Lim pointed out that traditional investors started paying more attention to Bitcoin due to catalysts like US ETFs, its record high in March, and the halving event in April. Now, apparently, with these catalysts behind, the focus has shifted to the broader macroeconomic picture.



On May 15, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced yesterday that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose by 0.3 percent in April on a seasonally adjusted basis, following a 0.4 percent increase in March. Over the past 12 months, the all-items index has climbed 3.4 per cent before seasonal adjustment. Despite this progress, Bloomberg says, several Fed officials have suggested maintaining higher borrowing costs to ensure inflation continues to decline, indicating they are not in a hurry to cut rates.

‘Soak my Deck’ captain Sam Trabucco sails in for Ryan Salame


No one seems to know the whereabouts of Sam Trabucco, the once-CEO of Alameda Research who purchased a multi-million dollar yacht named ‘Soak My Deck’ after Alameda embezzled customer funds from FTX. Nevertheless, he’s broken cover this week to pen a lengthy character reference for his criminal colleague, Ryan Salame.
For over a year, Trabucco has been completely silent amid a global manhunt. However, he thought his assessment of Salame’s character would be so helpful to a judge prior to signing a final punishment against Salame that he decided to reappear. 
In his letter, Trabucco qualified his analysis multiple times. He admitted, “Ryan is my best friend. He has also committed crimes.” Elsewhere, Trabucco states the obvious: “Ryan deserves to face the consequences of his actions — he intimately understands that.”

Sam Trabucco’s character reference letter for a criminal
Of course, Trabucco never admits to any wrongdoing himself in his three-page letter. He, unlike almost all other executives at Alameda and FTX, hasn’t pleaded guilty to any crimes. Incredibly, neither has any law enforcement agency in the US publicly announced any criminal charge against him.




For some reason, Trabucco thought a judge would find his rambling letter useful.
Ryan Salame: Lead of political election fraud at FTX
Salame, in addition to apparently being Trabucco’s best friend (who knew!), pled guilty to participating in three criminal conspiracies: making unlawful political contributions to US politicians, defrauding the US Federal Election Commission, and operation of an unlicensed money transmitter. He is asking for leniency and an 18-month prison sentence but will likely receive more. 
Salame had millions in liquid assets, a tavern, two Massachusetts properties, and a Porsche before he agreed to surrender substantially all his assets to authorities.
Trabucco studied mathematics and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he worked with Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and imprisoned CEO of FTX. The two originally met at a 2010 math camp at Mount Holyoke College. A few weeks ago, a judge in New York sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn.
Before working at FTX and its sister trading arm Alameda Research, Trabucco worked at a quantitative trading firm like several other FTX executives. Unlike Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, who worked at Jane Street, Trabucco worked at Susquehanna. Trabucco received at least $25 million in compensation while working for Bankman-Fried.

This case highlights how the regulation of cryptocurrency is now a jointly undertaken exercise by exchanges and regulatory bodies to fight financial crimes.Binance and Taiwan Halt Crypto Laundering RingThe immense violation, worth almost NT$200 million, has served as evidence that the schemers have been employing cryptocurrencies to wash illegally acquired money. The perpetrators used complex manipulations, such as generating fictitious remittance proofs, identification data, and chat communications records, to circumvent the regulators.The Prosecutors Office of Taipei District claimed that nine people were charged with such crimes as money laundering, aggravated fraud, and organized crime under the Money Laundering Control Act, penal provisions for aggravated fraud, and other regulations under the According to the Prosecutors Office in Taipei.Also, Lo Wei-yuan, a prosecutor at Taipei District Prosecutors, headed the indictment.

                        A presale for Solana’s all-American hillbilly $SEAL token has attracted over $1.4 million in just three weeks as it leads a new wave of Solana meme coins that has caught the attention of investors worldwide.Sealana’s predecessors, meme coins coins like DogWifHat ($WIF), Bonk ($BONK), Book of Meme ($BOME) and Popcat ($POPCAT), all rose to become top ten meme coins by market capitalization within a year of launch.Another recent viral Solana meme coin ICO – Slothana ($SLOTH) the 420-friendly sloth – raised an eye-watering $15 million in a recent one-month presale.Now it looks like $SEAL is set to be Solana’s next sensation as whales push the presale toward $1.5 million in funding.Who is Solana’s New $SEAL?
Sealana began life as a reference to South Park’s Gamer Guy, a meme legend known for his unhealthy screen time.Gamer Guy first appeared in South Park’s World of Warcraft episode and has since become a symbol of excessive screen use, from keyboard warriors to lazy individuals.There are rumors that the team behind it came out with this year’s viral $SLERF meme coin.Slerf’s launch was plagued with catastrophe when the project accidentally burned $10 million of tokens allocated to early investors. After seeing Slothana take the sloth concept and go on to out-raise them, the team came back with Sealana.Sealana is one of the projects making a reputation for Solana as the best Layer 1 blockchain for launching high-volume meme coins.Solana currently hosts a digital economy storing over $4.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) across various apps and financial services, with 1.16 million active users transacting daily and over 2,500 monthly active developers.There are also some potentially market-moving events that could add billions to Solana across all its projects.Solana’s 2024 Could Get Bullish.
If analysts are right, then $SEAL and other Solana meme coins could attract some feverish speculation in the coming year when the economic effects of a Bitcoin software update known as “the halving” kicks in.That’s because the halving slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125, effectively halving the rate at which miners sell new BTC onto the open market.Now, with Bitcoin setting new all-time highs this year after the US approval of spot Bitcoin investment products back in January, observers say crypto will become much more valuable, thanks to the bottlenecked new supply colliding with increased demand.The past three halvings added significant value to the market well within a year of the update.More market-wide bull runs could prompt further meme coin gold rushes later this year.This time, Solana tokens will be leading the rallies, ahead of their ERC-20 counterparts.The potential US approval of Ethereum ETFs on Thursday next week could also be a boon for Solana meme coins like $SEAL.Builders on Solana often boast their network is the number one “Ethereum-killer” and so its tokens often react bullishly to positive Ethereum news.In any case, Sealana will be flapping his fins in happiness.Follow the latest developments on his X account.Buy Solana’s laziest $SEAL on the official website here.

'Roaring Kitty Is the Villain': GameStop Trader's Tweets Are Getting Sad - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIt appears that Roaring Kitty has been let down by his favorite video game store.GameStop, the company which the trader (aka Keith Gill) made his name discussing online, has filed to sell up to 45 million shares—which could increase the total number of shares by as much as 15%. The price of GME immediately tanked by 26%, and now is trading at a price less than 20% above last Friday’s close.As you might expect, the plunge appears to be stressing out Twitter’s favorite meme stock trader. Following the news, Roaring Kitty—who helped spur 2021’s GME share price spike—took to Twitter to post a meme of Ben Affleck smoking outside of a GameStop store, in visible distress. All week, the trader has continued to post film and TV clips, presented without comment—but there’s been a noticeable vibe shift.He started with a GIF of a teary-eyed James MacAvoy from the film “Split,” perhaps an accurate representation when he saw his GME gains disappear once trading opened. This was quickly followed by a “Succession” TV show clip edited to say, “Roaring Kitty is the villain.”The meme influencer has been painted as a villain by many mainstream financial figures, with some even accusing him of market manipulation. In GameStop’s filing, which outlined its intent to sell more shares, the company acknowledged recent price fluctuations and named social media as one of the factors—but stopped short of personally identifying the trader.Has Roaring Kitty been scorned by his one-time love? Not so fast. The trader soon posted a clip from “The Steve Wilkos Show,” from an episode where a woman is staying with an abusive partner—who Roaring Kitty portrays as himself. The woman wants to stay with the man, and Roaring Kitty apparently wants his followers to do much the same with GME.Roaring Kitty is on his knees, begging his followers to stick with him despite the recent bad news. To finish, the Twitter user posted a meme which suggests that behind all of these memes, he’s hurting. Tears are streaming down his face. The GameStop bull is clearly distraught, and this week’s gains are nearly erased. Is this the end of the meme stock revival?Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Market Analyst Reveals Why Investors Will Regret Selling XRP At $10 | Bitcoinist.com


								XRP is one of the cryptocurrencies that has persevered in the market and managed to retain a strong following despite performing poorly in the last few years. The legal battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is the major culprit behind this poor performance, has yet to end. However, this has not deterred the bullish sentiment among investors, who still believe that the altcoin’s price is destined for double digits.
Market Expert Says Selling XRP At $10 Is A Bad Idea
Although the XRP price is still trending at around $0.5 right now, the expectations that the altcoin will see a monumental surge are still high. One of those who believes that this will happen is James Jay, an XRP community member and the host of the Crypto4Life YouTube channel.

In a recent video, Jay revealed his expectations for the XRP price, saying that he expected it to eventually cross $10. However, the prediction was not the most interesting thing that came out of the video but rather the advice the host gave to investors.
Jay explains that he understands that the XRP price going to $10 from here would be life-changing for a lot of people. But he still encourages them not to sell at that price. According to the analyst, XRP investors will end up regretting selling their tokens at that price because he expects it to go much higher.
The analyst points to a Valhill Capital estimate for the future value of XRP tokens, which came in an extremely wide range of $9.81 and $513,000. However, Jay is undeterred by this wide margin and explains that even if the estimates end up being only 1% right, it would still put the price in the ballpark of even $100.
To put this in perspective, a $100 price target from here is a 20,000% increase or a 200x increase. This would mean that the XRP market cap would be in the trillions, a feat which has only be achieved by Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, so far.

Nevertheless, Jay encourages investors to look beyond the quick gains and have “a solid plan” so they can make the most returns on their investments. “You should have strategic levels of where you’re cashing out and I wouldn’t go all out at a certain dollar,” the YouTuber stated.
Jay is not the only one that sees the XRP price crossing $10 and even rising to triple-digits. Crypto analyst and community member JackTheRippler has said that he expects the altcoin’s price to cross $100 once the Ripple vs. SEC case is over. Another analyst BarriC also revealed that they expect the altcoin to reach $100 in less than 10 years.

Notcoin's [NOT] 'rocky' launch - How a $1 billion start ended with a major sell-off - AMBCrypto



At press time, NOT had a market cap of just over $681 million 
Meanwhile, buying pressure on TON hiked on the charts

The wait is now over as the much-talked-about Telegram-based crypto Notcoin [NOT] finally arrived on 16 May. The launch wasn’t perfect, as the newcomer soon recorded a major drop in its price. However, it still managed to cling close to the top-100 list of cryptos. Meanwhile, Toncoin [TON] remained bearish on its charts
All about Notcoin’s launch
AMBCrypto previously reported that NOT was getting airdropped on 16 May, with several crypto-exchanges like Binance announcing that they would list the token. During the launch, the newly listed token had an initial price of $0.01, which translated into a $1 billion market capitalization. 
However, things didn’t go as planned as the altcoin soon noted a major correction hours after its launch. According to CoinMarketCap, NOT’s price has dropped by over 53% since its launch. At the time of writing, NOT was trading at $0.006631 with a market cap of over $681 million, making it the 108th largest crypto in the market. 
Now, such price declines after airdrops aren’t something new as similar incidents have happened before. The primary reason why this happens is because of sell-offs by investors immediately after launch since they choose to earn profits, rather than hold. 
The good news, however, is that Notcoin’s trading volume has remained high since launch. To be precise, NOT’s volume stood at $1.4 billion, earning it the 8th spot on the list of cryptos with the highest 24-hour trading volumes. 
While all this happened, Binance shared a major update for its audience. According to the same, the exchange has decided to remove the NOT/BTC trading pair, which was originally set to be listed on 16 May. This move was made in order to “provide a better trading experience,” Binance said. 
TON bears aren’t letting go 
AMBCrypto had previously reported how Toncoin, the blockchain on which Notcoin is minted, has been benefiting from the hype around NOT. However, the trend changed soon after as the token’s price dropped by over 3% in the last seven days. At press time, it was trading at $6.63 with a market cap of over $23 billion. 
Our analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that investors used this opportunity to accumulate TON while its price was low. This was the case as TON’s supply on exchanges dropped sharply while its supply outside of exchanges rose. Its exchange outflows also increased, reflecting high buying pressure.

Read Toncoin’s [TON] Price Prediction 2024-25 

To see whether the hike in buying pressure would translate into a price uptick, AMBCrypto then analyzed TON’s daily chart. 
The token’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a decline, hinting at a sustained price drop. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands revealed that TON’s price was still above its 20-day simple moving average (SMA). Hence, TON’s price might first drop to its 20-day SMA support, before gaining bullish momentum.

Expert Sets Timeline For When Ethereum Price Will Begin Rally To $10,000


																A crypto analyst has made a daring prediction for Ethereum (ETH), setting the timeline for when the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency would embark on a significant rally to new all-time highs above $10,000. 
Here’s When Ethereum Will Reach $10,000
A crypto analyst identified as ‘Yoddha,’ on X (formerly Twitter) has announced the timeline for Ethereum’s ascent above $10,000. According to Yoddha, Ethereum is expected to rally massively after a period of accumulation and decline, continuously rising above $10,000 by the end of the year. 

	Related Reading



The analyst’s ambitious predictions are based on historical trends exhibited by Ethereum from 2016 to 2024. He shared a chart depicting Ethereum’s price action over these years, highlighting periods of accumulation, interim peaks and volatility. 
Yoddha disclosed that from 2019 to 2021, Ethereum witnessed a period of accumulation marked by multiple price fluctuations, including long declines and short rallies. Following this, Ethereum surged significantly, reaching a peak of $4,867 towards the end of 2021. This price range aligns with the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of $4,878, achieved during the previous bull market cycle in 2021. 
Based on these historical trends, Yoddha identified a similar accumulation phase in Ethereum’s price movements during this current market cycle. The analyst noted that from 2022 to early 2024, Ethereum experienced an accumulation and slightly bearish phase. 
Prior to reaching a record high of $4,088 on March 12, 2024, Ethereum had experienced a bearish trend in 2022 and 2023. The cryptocurrency also faced declines on several occasions in 2024, especially around April and May. 
Yoddha has indicated that Ethereum has successfully concluded this accumulation and bearish period and is on track to witness a massive rally towards $15,346, extending into the end of 2024. 
Analyst Says ETH Could Start Altcoins Season
In another X post, Yoddha indicated that Ethereum could start the upcoming altcoins season. The crypto analyst has consistently emphasized the impending launch of the highly anticipated altcoins season in 2024. 
He revealed that altcoins will begin to gain more attraction once the hype surrounding meme coins diminishes. Additionally, Yoddha revealed that 2024 could issue the biggest altcoins season, encompassing healthy pullbacks and new all-time highs.

Presently, the price of Ethereum is trading at $3,024, reflecting a 1.58% decline over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. A surge above $10,000 will require the cryptocurrency to jump by more than $7,000, fueled by a notable uptick in investor demand and interest in the cryptocurrency as well as the potential introduction of an Ethereum Spot ETF in 2024. 
Crypto analyst, Ali Martinez has revealed that currently, Ethereum’s TD Sequential is presenting a “buy signal” on ETH’s daily price chart. He predicts that Ethereum could witness a rebound of one to four candlesticks from its recent price drop.

Bitcoin Sends Bullish Signals on Short Intervals: Will it Break Resistance? | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin is aggressively testing the upper liquidity limits as market watchers spot an upcoming “golden cross” on the horizon. The latest data points reveal Bitcoin near its peak levels since the middle of April, maintaining sustained pressure.Analyzing the Golden Cross PotentialThe concept of the golden cross, where a shorter-term moving average crosses over a longer-term one, signals potential upticks in price movements.Moustache, a noted figure in the crypto trading community, anticipates this technical event on the 12-hour Bitcoin chart.“Golden Cross of $BTC is imminent,” he shared on Twitter, indicating the market might see significant activity similar to the last occurrence in October, which preceded a major price rally. Back then, BTC surged over 170% following the golden cross.You Might Be Interested In: BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION 2024-2030: WILL BTC PRICE SURPASS $100K POST-HALVING?Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price resistance around $67,000 holds strong, with approximately $75 million worth capping the potential rise, according to CoinGlass data.Despite not reaching the highs of 2024 or 2021, the anticipation in the market is palpable, influenced heavily by these technical formations.Ichimoku Cloud Confirms Support ChangeThe trading pattern seems reminiscent of earlier in the year, as suggested by another trader, Titan of Crypto.“BTC seems to be repeating the same pattern from early 2024,” he observed, noting over 60% gains when similar conditions were met previously.The Ichimoku Cloud, a complex indicator used to gauge momentum and future areas of support and resistance, now suggests $60,000 as a new support level.This change from resistance to support aligns with various bullish indicators converging around this pivotal price point.The short-term holder realized price and the swiftly ascending 100-day moving average, now above $62,000, further bolster this support level.“BTC is perfectly flipping previous resistance into support,” summarized Titan of Crypto, presenting an optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency.There is a Surging Interest in Bitcoin ETFsMarket dynamics are also influenced by institutional behaviors, particularly observed in Bitcoin ETF activities.Recent data from Santiment highlight a surge in volumes among Bitcoin’s institutional investment products, with daily spot volumes exceeding $5 billion.Read Also: EL SALVADOR MINES 474 BITCOIN USING GEOTHERMAL VOLCANIC ENERGYThis week, the volume managed by the seven largest U.S. spot ETFs reached a high of $5.65 billion, the most robust since late March.Moreover, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which had seen significant outflows in the past, is now witnessing renewed interest, with recent investments totaling up to $31.6 million over two days.“Gone are the days of whales only accumulating onchain,” commented Santiment, suggesting a broadening of investor base and activity.In a compelling show of confidence, 937 U.S. firms reported exposure to Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter of the year, dwarfing the interest seen in gold ETFs during their initial launch period, which only attracted 95 firms. This confirms the growing institutional trust and investment in BTC as a viable financial asset.As Bitcoin continues to send bullish signals across these short intervals, the market remains watchful. Will it manage to break through the existing resistance levels? The data and trends suggest a bullish outlook, but as always, the crypto market retains its unpredictable nature.

Arbitrum DAO Launches M&A Pilot to Boost DeFi Expansion


Arbitrum DAO has entered on a pioneering mergers and acquisitions (M&A) pilot program. This move leverages its $3 billion treasury for growth and innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi). 
The initiative, which received overwhelming approval from DAO members, highlights Arbitrum’s commitment to exploring new avenues to enhance its ecosystem.
Strategic M&A Initiative Begins

Bernard Schmid, a founding partner at Areta, is leading the eight-week pilot program. Areta provides investment banking services to crypto companies. 

“In addition to conducting an in-depth strategy study on the value upside of M&A, the pilot phase should serve as a facilitated platform for in-depth discussions based on data rather than opinions,” he emphasized.

The M&A pilot will form a dedicated unit with a budget of $100 million to $250 million. This unit will identify and acquire potential targets over two years. Participants will explore the fundamentals of DAO/DeFi M&A, discuss target areas, assess risks, and develop a conceptual framework.

Assessing Arbitrum’s Financial Strength
Arbitrum, Ethereum’s largest Layer 2, possesses the second-largest Treasury among DeFi projects. financial strength positions it uniquely to explore rare M&A opportunities in the crypto space. GlobalData shows only seven M&A deals occurred in the crypto sector during Q4 2023, compared to 1,069 in the broader technology sector. 
Status of M&A in Crypto. Source: Arbitrum DAO
Schmid’s vision includes acquiring technological talent and investing in complementary infrastructure to accelerate Arbitrum’s strategic goals.

“This is a largely untapped opportunity in crypto, only explored by a few different projects in the space; therefore, delving deeper into M&A would enable Arbitrum to get a jump-start on its competitors,” he stated. 


However, some members of the Arbitrum community have expressed cautious optimism. Krzysztof Urbański, a delegate from L2BEAT, expressed uncertainty about whether there are sufficient M&A opportunities for the DAO to achieve the scale outlined in the original proposal.
Historically, crypto M&A has seen both successes and failures. Polygon’s acquisition of Mir and Hermez advanced its technology, showing the benefits of strategic acquisitions. Klaytn and Finschia, two large L1 blockchains in Asia, recently merged in February 2024. With a combined market cap of ~$887M and over 410,000 Web3 members, this merger positioned them as Asia’s leading blockchain by integrating infrastructure, burning 23.6% of tokens, and establishing large-scale Web3 governance. Conversely, Fei Protocol’s merger with Rari Capital was controversial, highlighting the risks.

The Arbitrum M&A pilot aims to mitigate these risks through comprehensive exploration and structured planning. It could set a precedent for M&A in the crypto sector, attracting interest from other DAOs and traditional financial institutions.

                        LUNC has declined by 1% in the past 24 hours, with the Terra Luna Classic price dropping $0.000108 as the wider crypto market gains by a very slight 0.5% today.The altcoin is now up by 1% in a week and by 6.5% in a month, while it sits on a fairly unspectacular 16% gain in a year.While the latter percentage is underwhelming relative to bigger tokens, the coin’s moves today come as Binance burns just over 1 billion LUNC, bringing the exchange’s burn total to 59 billion.This brings the total burn to 113.3 billion LUNC, and with the Terra Luna Classic community still working on increasing the burn count and enhancing the coin’s utility, we could see more price gains soon.Terra Luna Classic Price Prediction as Binance Burns 59 Billion Tokens – $10 LUNC Incoming?
LUNC’s price has stabilized a little in the past hour, leaving its indicators in a position that would suggest incoming gains.For example, its relative strength index (purple) has risen to 60 after dipping below 50 earlier this morning, creating the possibility of gains over the weekend as it rises towards 70.Source: TradingViewMeanwhile, its 30-day average (orange) has resumed rising further above the 200-day (blue), regaining momentum after a lull over the past couple of days.While LUNC is doing well relative to its recent history, it should be remembered that its volume is basically minuscule in relation to the volumes of major tokens.At $21 million, its 75% down from where it was during the first week of May, and a whopping 97.5% down from its levels in early March.This indicates a distinct lack of interest in LUNC from the wider crypto market, which seems to remain skeptical as to the coin’s long-term viability.Despite such negativity, Terra Luna Classic continues to take modest steps towards making itself more attractive as an asset, with Binance burning over 1 billion LUNC yesterday.The exchange has now burned 59 billion in total, with the total LUNC burn count reaching 113 billion overall.However, this amounts to only 1.66% of the overall LUNC supply, which perhaps explains why recent burns haven’t had much of an impact on the coin’s price.Even so, they raise the prospect of LUNC making steady progress over the coming months, with the Terra Luna Classic community continuing to debate and (occasionally) accept proposals for improving the coin’s viability.As such, the Terra Luna Classic price could reach $0.00015 in the next few weeks, and $0.0003 by Q4 2024.Small-Cap Meme Tokens Show More Potential
Because LUNC remains a kind of semi-dormant token, many traders may prefer to look to alternatives with more potential in the near term.Such potential could come from new meme coins, with several such tokens holding their presales at the moment and accumulating lots of momentum.This includes WienerAI (WAI), a new Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has now raised $2 million in its presale.What’s interesting about WienerAI is that it’s more than a mere meme token, with the coin native to an AI-based trading bot that can answer trade-related questions and offer investment advice.The bot will help investors identify coins with strong potential, while also helping traders time buys and sells.On top of this, it will also including an atomic swap feature, so that users can quickly trade any coin recommended by the bot.There’s also a very helpful function related to avoiding front-running bots, so that traders can stay ahead of the market and avoid losing uot.So given that WAI is the native utility token of the WienerAI bot, it will grow in parallel with the growth of the latter.It will have a max supply 69 billion tokens, while holders will also be able to stake the coin for a passive income.VIDEO Investors can participate in its sale at the official WienerAI website, where 1 WAI is selling for $0.000708.Given the coin’s fundamentals, it will likely supersede this low price once it lists on exchanges in the next few weeks.Buy WAI Today

                        Fantom ($FTM) has outperformed all other Layer 1 tokens this week and risen 10% amidst a flurry of recent activity on the network, with FTM trading at $0.80 at the time of writing.cCrypto’s two biggest coins, also Layer 1 coins, couldn’t keep the pace over the seven days.Bitcoin ($BTC) grew 5% over the week to trade at $66,234 while Ethereum (ETH remains virtually unchanged at around $3,020.The main reason investors are piling into Fantom right now is anticipation for the network’s new Sonic upgrade. Sonic will boost the network’s throughput from current levels of between 1.5 to 2.5 transactions per second to 2,000 tps.Fantom says the network will be upgraded once the new software hits two thirds of the validator nodes. As of today, 25 of 60 nodes have upgraded to Sonic.On Fantom’s chart for the last three months, we can see a marked decline since mid-March, in line with Bitcoin’s fall from a recent all-time high set that time.For the last month, FTM has been caught in a narrow price range of between $0.60 and $0.80 so today’s price could be the first sign of a breakout.It’s supported by a stable Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 54.With the weekend coming up, it’s important to see how the price plays out over the weekend for some insight into how the week will unfold.Diversify Fantom and Layer 1 Holdings With Meme Coin Trading Bot Companion WienerAI
Investing in a Layer 1 token is essentially betting on a network and all the projects sitting on it.Investors who recognize the technical capabilities of Fantom or Ethereum are more confident in these blockchains as robust platforms for DeFi applications, compared to those who invest without such knowledge.Both Fantom and Ethereum are made to scale and are constantly optimizing.However, Layer 1 tokens can have more subdued rallies, since they’re a bet on whole ecosystems rather than single projects.That’s why it’s always good to diversify Fantom and other Layer 1 token holdings with tokens underpinning some of the specific applications built on a blockchain.On the surface, WienerAI looks like a meme coin, but it’s a bit more than that.It’s a doggy leap into blockchain’s great potential once AI comes on-chain.The presale is only a month old, and it has already taken a tidy $2 million in investments.Touted as a “Revolutionary AI Trading partner”, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.Blockchain security platform Coinsult audited WienerAI’s smart contract.Around 20% of $WAI’s supply is for staking.WienerAI’s website offers buyers the ability to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 485% APY.Stay on top of WienerAI news over on X and Telegram.Join the presale now over on the WienerAI website.

Ethereum ETF Approval Coming Sooner Rather Than Later, Says Coinbase - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) could hit the market sooner than expected, says Coinbase, despite growing industry observer pessimism.In a note this week, America’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange said that “while there is uncertainty around a timely approval given the SEC’s apparent silence with issuers,” it’s only a matter of time before such a product hits the market. There’s a long list of top asset managers—including VanEck, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton—who have filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to release an Ethereum ETF. Such a product would give investors exposure to ETH, the second biggest digital coin by market cap, via shares that trade on a stock exchange.But Wall Street’s biggest regulator has been slow to give a response to applicants, and has pushed back decision deadlines, echoing its earlier approach to spot Bitcoin ETF approvals before finally pulling the trigger in January.This is usually normal in the ETF application process, but the SEC’s reluctance to talk about the investment vehicles has led analysts from the likes of Bloomberg and CoinShares to say that such crypto funds would not get the green light by the May deadline.“As crypto begins to take form as an election issue, it’s also less certain in our view that the SEC would be willing to front the political capital necessary to support a denial,” wrote David Han, institutional research analyst at Coinbase.“Even if the first deadline on May 23, 2024 encounters a rejection,” he added, “we think there is a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision.”Last year, crypto fund manager Grayscale won an appeal against the SEC to convert its Bitcoin fund into a spot ETF in a high-profile case.The SEC then reluctantly said yes to 11 Bitcoin ETFs on January 10. The investment products have since been massively successful, taking in billions of dollars of inflows. Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Australian BitConnect promoter pleads guilty years after wife disappears


John Bigatton has pleaded guilty in Australia to a criminal charge of providing financial advice without the appropriate license for his role in promoting the failed Ponzi scheme BitConnect. 
BitConnect was a Ponzi scheme masquerading as a lending platform that offered people unsustainable yields on its token, BCC. Users were able to lend the token to the platform with the promise the funds were being deployed profitably. However, the rewards were inauthentic and the scheme eventually collapsed leaving investors without access to their funds. 
Bigatton actively promoted this scheme from his social media as well as hosting ‘seminars’ around Australia, serving as national promoter for Australia for BitConnect.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) was aided in its investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 
The FBI was also involved in the investigation into BitConnect founder Satish Kumbhani, who was indicted in the Southern District of California.

Earlier reporting from Sunday Night paints Bigatton as a consummate hustler who had previously tried selling vitamins, running a gym, trading foreign currencies — anything that promised a big return.
Eventually, he saw the promised returns of BitConnect and joined up, encouraging a variety of other Australians to join the scheme.  
Bigatton’s wife, Madeline, also disappeared as the Ponzi scheme collapsed, with some of her family worrying that she was murdered. 
Bigatton faces sentencing on July 5 of this year.

Coinbase Gets Upgrade: Analyst Highlights Larger Audience, New Spot ETFs, Less Focus On Meme Coins - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

BofA Securities analyst Mark McLaughlin upgraded Coinbase Global, Inc COIN to Neutral from Underperform, raising the price forecast to $217 from $110.According to the analyst, the upgrade was driven by retail reengagement of crypto and operating leverage following prior expense cuts. Risks, however, included ongoing regulatory overhang and near-term dependence on transaction revenue for profitability.Per the analyst, the current macro environment has been a positive for cryptocurrency market cap appreciation and trading volumes.The present market situation is more robust given the larger audience of investors, including institutional, new spot ETFs, and more maturation of brokerage services.The market also gained from a greater focus on a concentrated set of mature coins (top 10 coins make up 83% of market cap vs. 73% in November 2021) with less focus on meme coins.Coinbase’s expense discipline and ability to benefit from operating leverage following significant expense cuts in 2022 will help it maintain profitability in the future, the analyst wrote.Over the 2022-2023 “crypto winter,” Coinbase significantly reduced its cost base to more appropriate levels, aiming to reach profitability amidst a precipitous decline in transaction volumes and revenue.In addition, increased diversification of revenue sources less correlated with overall volumes should dampen earnings volatility.The analyst did warn about regulatory overhang surrounding U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit and timeline. While the analyst does not see any major update for the rest of the year but expects a trial in 2025 that will add more clarity on future regulation.COIN Price Action: Coinbase shares are trading higher by 5.31% to $209.74 at last check Friday.Photo Rafapress on Shutterstock

Robinhood Sees Surge in Trading as Bull Market Returns, Analyst Upgrades Stock - Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) - Benzinga

Robinhood Markets Inc HOOD shares are trading higher after B&A Securities analyst Craig Siegenthaler upgraded the stock from Underperform to Buy and raised its price target from $14 to $24.Siegenthaler noted the current entry point as very different from 2021 when he first initiated on HOOD with an Underperform. Now, interest rates are elevated, and the BofA economists forecast Fed rate cuts to start in December. Also Read: Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev Dishes On Hot Retirement Offerings: ‘Economics Of The Offer Are Irresistible To Pass Up’The analyst said economic growth is surprising to the upside, and stock and crypto markets are back in bull market territory. Robust retail engagement will benefit HOOD on multiple fronts, including accelerating near-term organic growth, higher trading activity driving rising payment for order flow, and margin loan balances, which are the most profitable asset on HOOD’s balance sheet, he noted. First, HOOD was increasing, and he thought its growth would decelerate, but now he is looking for an acceleration. Second, the macroeconomic backdrop is more favorable, as he expected several years of improved retail engagement versus 2021 when he expected a significant decline. Third, HOOD is now profitable after cutting expenses much quicker than anyone expected, and these valuation metrics provide tangible support to the HOOD stock. In 2021, the HOOD stock was trading at 20x—50x revenues, and this valuation declined significantly to under 5x, which is why he noted that the entry point is more attractive. HOOD reported a record 40% adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, aiming for the 50% level over time as they reach economies of scale, Siegenthaler said. The analyst became more positive on HOOD’s ability to stay profitable going forward as they have now launched most of the standard products needed to compete with more developed peers and have reached the critical mass to withstand volatility in the market without having to rely on outsourced funding which has dried up considerably from when they went public in 2021.The analyst is positive on HOOD’s free cash flow conversation, which compares favorably to other brokers that either operate a capital-intensive bank or are using their balance sheet to fund growth via transition assistance.Price Action: HOOD shares traded higher by 10.1% at $19.69 at last check Friday.Also Read: Robinhood Launches Its First Crypto Staking Offering For Solana But Feature Limited To EuropePhoto via Shutterstock

Crypto Takes Center Stage in 2024 Election | Bankless


America is about to pick its next president, and this time, crypto is part of the conversation! It's shaping up to almost certainly be a race pitting Joe Biden versus Donald Trump (with long-shot contender Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. waiting in the wings).All of these men have had something to say about crypto over the years, but what they're saying right now matters an awful lot, considering the regulatory inquisition that crypto has endured over the past 18 months at the cavalier hands of the SEC and the watchful eye of a DOJ that has followed an unspoken mandate to prosecute and publicize all actions against crypto users, regardless of size or scope.The Democratic Party's loudest voices have turned crypto regulation into a political battleground. After years of branding themselves as the party poised to rein in Big Tech, a lack of progress there has pushed them to chase the budding crypto industry – a small, innovative corner of tech that has promised to challenge the centralized power of Big Tech. Elizabeth Warren’s Crypto Holy War on BanklessThe Senator’s ‘anti-crypto army’ is fighting against the resistance.In contrast, the Republican Party's efforts to generally favor lighter-handed regulation has put them in a favored position among crypto participants, incentivizing fresher lawmakers to build reputations as pro-crypto, pro-financial-freedom candidates, serving up bills that provide pathways and frameworks for the crypto industry to progress. Why talk about all of this now?We're at a key impasse this week. A bipartisan resolution which overturns a controversial SEC crypto accounting policy has just been voted through the Senate. But Joe Biden, who has been hesitant to insert himself into the crypto conversation has already signaled that he intends to veto the resolution, spotlighting himself as an adversary to the industry.All of this has been happening while Trump explicitly courts a crypto industry he has had mixed things to say about over the years, but now is ready to fully mobilize. At a Mar-a-Lago meetup for holders of his NFT collection (scheduled in between court days of his hush money trial in NYC) the former President wooed the industry.
All of these happening set up crypto regulation to increasingly be a battleground issue of this election that could draw more attention to the plights of the young industry and help either convert or entrench skeptical lawmakers eager to push the industry forward or tow their party line.In this article, let's dig deeper into this pressure cooker of political process and turmoil and see where the major parties have stood and currently stand 👇Senate Votes to Repeal SEC Crypto Rule on BanklessYour move, Joe.🔵 The BluesThe Democratic Party's broader stance can be summed up as generally hostile toward crypto, a stance reinforced by Biden's veto threat despite a number of Democratic Senators voting through the SEC rebuke resolution.
Top party members like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) have established reputations as critics concerned about consumer protection, financial crime, and environmental impact. Warren frequently warns of the risks posed by unregulated crypto markets and potential misuse for illicit activities. She’s emphasized:"Stablecoin legislation, which will grow the crypto market and provide opportunities for terrorist fundraising, must include the full suite of AML tools that the Treasury requested.” "Rogue nations, oligarchs, drug lords, and human traffickers are using digital assets to launder billions in stolen funds, evade sanctions, and finance terrorism."On the other hand, younger Democrats have recognized crypto as a tool for financial inclusion and innovation. These politicians believe that crypto can drive positive change with proper regulatory frameworks. Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) argues that crypto can provide financial access to those traditionally underserved by the banking system, co-sponsoring legislation to support this. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) considers crypto a force for financial democratization and economic empowerment, citing its potential for positive change and the need to keep the U.S. strong in the industry. Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL) supports clear regulatory frameworks, believing blockchains can enhance financial transparency and efficiency.These younger Democrats have sought to challenge the idea that their party is unilaterally anti-crypto, aiming to reframe the battleground as a generational one instead.🗣️ Joe BidenNevertheless, President Biden moving himself to the main stage of the fight threatens to further cement this fight as one political party versus the other.Initially, the Biden administration seemed to be adopting a balanced approach, aiming to foster innovation while ensuring consumer and financial stability through regulations. President Biden's executive order on cryptocurrency emphasizes the need for a coordinated federal policy to address the risks and benefits associated with digital assets.However, President Biden's threat to veto a House resolution rejecting the SEC's crypto accounting guidance (SAB 121) looks more in line with the stance of party members like Warren and Brown. SAB 121 proposes that banks meet different criteria for custodying crypto than for custodying traditional assets, which hinders adoption. While a measure to overturn it passed in the Senate, after passing last week in the House, the White House issued a statement last week saying they would veto it. 
This declaration reinforces the regulatory assault against the industry from the SEC, a predominantly Democratic body, to solidify the party’s majority stance as anti-crypto.🔴 The RedsThe Republic Party has, generally, more consistently supported the crypto industry, with the lion's share of pro-crypto bills being brought to the floor by Republican lawmakers and Trump's Administration generally being a much quieter time for the industry from a regulatory standpoint.VIDEOBeyond the former President, other prominent Republicans like Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN) have long advocated for clearer crypto regulation, introducing bills that create comprehensive frameworks for digital assets like stablecoins. Republican lawmakers like Lummis and Emmer tend to be wary of "over-regulation," arguing it drives innovation overseas and undermines America's competitive edge – something that has clearly been happening in the crypto space.Further, Republican lawmakers have tended to find more brand alignment than Democrats in the populism of Bitcoin as a check on Federal power.
For example, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has highlighted Bitcoin's potential for investment and financial independence while noting the benefits of Bitcoin mining for Texas's energy grid resilience. 🗣️ Donald TrumpTrump is setting himself as an industry savior, during a time when many crypto participants have grown frustrated with the regulatory approach of the Biden Administration.Trump was his most explicit yet in his recent speech at Mar-a-Lago. These statements occurred at an event explicitly designed for his NFT holders, from whom he has already profited millions. That financial incentive is potentially coloring his explicit stance, but many in crypto are just happy to have a mainstream candidate voicing the issues that matter to them.While Trump's comments at the event still lacked the specifics and the fervor some may have hoped for (he noted he was “fine with crypto” and emphasized the need for the U.S. to remain competitive in crypto globally and not be undercut by hostile regulation domestically), they served to drive a wedge between himself and President Biden, which was effective enough for many. As expected, Crypto Twitter broadly responded well to his messages. 
Where Does Conversation Move Next?As the election approaches, crypto is becoming increasingly front-and-center. The Democratic Party, led by figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, continues to be the face of the regulatory war on crypto. This stance has also spread to include President Biden following the White House’s recent threat to veto the rejection of SAB 121 — a move aligning with the party's hawks and the predominantly blue SEC.In contrast, Republicans have continued supporting the industry's domestic growth. Party members like Senator Cynthia Lummis, Representative Tom Emmer, and Senator Ted Cruz have publicly championed clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks while warning against overregulation that could drive businesses overseas — a message further emphasized by Donald Trump during his recent NFT holders event.Overall, the ideological divide on government intervention and financial innovation that underpins both parties sets the stage for crypto regulation to play a mainstage role in the upcoming election!Regardless of your personal stance, note the contrast between crypto’s role in the last election (nearly non-existent) and its role now. The evolution of its place in the political conversation from both sides clearly indicates that crypto's influence is growing.Trump’s Crypto Embrace on BanklessWith Democrats increasingly adopting anti-crypto stances, will Trump rally the industry around him?

SHIB Lead Shytoshi Kusama Makes Bullish Shibarium Announcement, XRP Made Strong Comeback, 3 Trillion SHIB Sent to Robinhood Amid 12.2% Price Surge: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Here are the top three news stories over the past day presented to you by U.Today.Shytoshi Kusama explodes SHIB army with bullish Shibarium announcementAs announced by the Shiba Inu official X handle on May 15, ShibaSwap decentralized exchange has finally gone live on the layer-2 solution Shibarium. In a short thread, the SHIB team shared the details of ShibaSwap's new capabilities, such as operating on both Ethereum and Shibarium blockchains and the creation of new liquidity pools on Shibarium. Following the announcement, Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama quoted the SHIB X account to praise the outstanding achievements of his team (and developer Kaal Dhairya in particular) that made bringing ShibaSwap to Shibarium possible. Concluding his X post, Kusama asked all SHIB enthusiasts to "stay tuned," as there is “so much more in store as we march forward.” Dhariya, in turn, commented on Shiba Inu lead's post, adding that the SHIB team will continue to push out updates and upgrades on a regular basis since Shiba Inu's journey is “not a race, it’s a marathon.” XRP made strong comebackIn a recent development, XRP made a significant recovery, returning to the previously invalidated descending triangle pattern. Although this technical formation often indicates bearish trends, the fact that XRP has returned to this pattern implies that XRP bulls may soon try to redefine the asset's present trajectory. For the first time in weeks, XRP's buying power saw an increase. This increase caused the price to move toward several important moving averages, such as the 50, 100 and 200 EMAs. These moving averages act as important levels of resistance, and a break through them can portend a change in direction toward a more bullish trend. But even with this recent uptick in bullish momentum, XRP is still downtrending. The price action is still struggling below the resistance line of the descending triangle, indicating ongoing bearish pressure. All of the moving averages are heading downward, suggesting that the majority of investors are more bearish than bullish. At the moment of writing, XRP is changing hands at $0.5254, up 1.59% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap.3 trillion SHIB mysteriously sent to Robinhood amid 12.2% price surgeData provided by Whale Alert crypto tracker shows that yesterday, May 16, an astonishing amount of Shiba Inu tokens, 3,000,000,000,000 SHIB, valued at $75 million, was transferred to Robinhood by an anonymous whale. The transaction occurred as SHIB showed 12% growth in its value over the course of 24 hours; the meme crypto is said to surge on the news of ShibaSwap launching on Shibarium - the development the SHIB community has been eagerly waiting for. The aforementioned transaction has also underscored the increase of whale activity that was observed throughout this week. On May 15, Cumberland, a large crypto trading firm, moved 144 billion SHIB worth $3.3 million to Coinbase. Prior to that, 50.36 billion Shiba Inu were deposited to OKX. In total, this week, before the movement of the previously mentioned three trillion SHIB, awakened SHIB whales transacted around 1.5 trillion Shiba Inu in a single day. They mostly carried between 42.6 billion and 397 billion SHIB to leading cryptocurrency trading platforms Binance, Coinbase, Gate.io and others. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002501, up 2.83%.

Senate Shuts Down SEC Plans: Does It Spell Doom for Gensler? - DailyCoin


        
SAB 121 has introduced controversial regulations impacting banking institutions and cryptocurrency holdings.



The Senate’s rejection of SAB 121 has signaled potential challenges to Gensler’s regulatory agenda.



Uncertainty has loomed over Gensler’s future as SEC Chair amid growing bipartisan resistance.
The U.S. Senate just dealt a blow to a major policy from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a move that could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry. The controversial rule in question? Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121.What Is SAB 121?SAB 121 is a proposed rule by the SEC that mandates regulated banking institutions to include their customers’ cryptocurrency holdings on their balance sheets. This rule was introduced as part of the SEC’s efforts to bring more transparency and accountability to the burgeoning crypto industry.Why is SAB 121 Bad/Good for Crypto?SAB 121 has faced significant opposition from the banking and crypto sectors. Critics argue that requiring banks to include crypto holdings on their balance sheets would complicate custodial services and negatively impact financial statements due to cryptocurrencies’ inherent volatility. 
On the other hand, proponents believe it could enhance transparency and investor protection in the crypto market. However, the strong backlash highlights widespread concerns about the potential negative impacts on financial stability and operational complexity for banks.How Does Gary Gensler Tie Into This? Gary Gensler, the Chair of the SEC, has been a central figure pushing for more stringent regulations in the cryptocurrency industry. SAB 121 is a key part of his broader agenda to regulate crypto assets more rigorously. Gensler’s tenure has been marked by initiatives aimed at increasing oversight and regulatory clarity in the crypto space, which he argues are necessary to protect investors and ensure market integrity.
The Senate’s rejection of SAB 121 is a significant setback for Gensler’s regulatory agenda. It reflects a growing bipartisan resistance to what many perceive as his overreaching regulatory measures. Is His Future as SEC Chair Under Scrutiny?This ruling challenges Gensler’s authority and could undermine his efforts to implement similar policies. Despite the pushback, Gensler’s legacy as SEC Chair will likely be judged on his ability to navigate this resistance and adjust his strategies or double down on his regulatory approach.While the Senate’s decision is a clear rebuke of Gensler’s policies, it does not necessarily mean his removal is imminent. President Joe Biden’s administration has expressed strong support for Gensler’s efforts, indicating that a veto of the Senate’s resolution is possible. However, the bipartisan nature of the Senate’s opposition suggests that Gensler will face increasing challenges. If the resistance continues to grow and his regulatory initiatives consistently face setbacks, his position could become untenable in the long term. Gensler remains at the helm for now, but his future as SEC Chair is certainly under more scrutiny.On the Flipside
Including cryptocurrency holdings on banks’ balance sheets would enhance their credibility and provide a clearer picture of their overall assets.



Despite the Senate’s rejection of SAB 121, Gensler’s position as SEC Chair probably remains secure for now.
Why This MattersWhile the fate of the Senate’s resolution remains uncertain, the vote represents a significant step forward for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. With the industry and lawmakers increasingly seeking a balanced approach, the future for digital assets appears brighter.If you’re interested in the legal wrangles surrounding cryptocurrency, then this article about Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC might be of interest:Ripple Seeks to Seal Documents from SEC: This Is WhyIf you like this article, you might also be interested in this piece on Gary Gensler’s defense of the SEC’s actions against Robinhood:Gary Gensler Defends Robinhood Action: SEC Follows the Law

Dolce & Gabbana face class action lawsuit after NFT delivery kerfuffle

A disgruntled customer has filed a class action lawsuit against Italian fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana and digital assets platform UNXD after alleged delays in delivering non-fungible token (NFT) products caused the digital assets to lose 97% of their value. According to a report from Bloomberg, a customer identified as Luke Brown paid $6,000 for “DGFamily NFTs,” a Dolce & Gabbana product combining digital and physical assets as privileges and experiences within the brand’s greater ecosystem. Class actionThe NFTs were allegedly delivered over a week late, which caused their value to plummet by $5,800. A set of accompanying “outfits” for the NFTs, which were purportedly meant for display in the metaverse, were further delayed by 11 days after the initial delivery. Brown has filed a class action suit on behalf of all customers who purchased the NFTs alleging that Dolce & Gabbana and UNXD failed to deliver on promises made at the point of transaction. Per the report, the delivery delays ensued after Dolce & Gabbana failed to obtain approval for the accompanying assets from the UNXD NFT platform. It’s unclear at this time how many customers may have been affected by the alleged delays. An NFT industry concernThis case highlights the ongoing struggle for companies, brands, and marketers as the realm of physical goods, products, and assets makes the transition to hybridized digitization. A physical product, such as a fashionable clothing item, functions in a dynamically different market than that of a digital asset, often with little correlation to one another. Further complicating the matter, the Dolce & Gabbana NFTs were created on the Ethereum blockchain for the “D&G Metaverse.” The Ethereum blockchain powers the world’s second most popular cryptocurrency and, as Cointelegraph reported, Dolce & Gabbana NFTs have sold for millions of dollars in the past. These facts could have an impact on the class action lawsuit if it moves forward.Related: Iconic brands including Nike, Gucci have made $260M off NFT sales Cointelegraph reached out to Dolce & Gabbana for comment but did not receive an immediate response.

Bitcoin Is Booming, Hits Highest Price Since the Halving - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe price of Bitcoin has surged to its highest since the much-talked about halving event on April 19, touching a recent high of $67,422 on Friday before dipping again.CoinGecko data shows that the biggest digital asset is up by nearly 3% in the past day. Over seven days, the coin has risen by more than 9%. It's now priced at $66,750. Bitcoin last hit today's high price on April 13, more than a month ago.Bitcoin dropped following the halving—a quadrennial happening baked into the coin's code—though experts told Decrypt that was to be expected.A combination of factors including geopolitical turmoil, cooling hype surrounding the new spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investor uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's next moves caused the virtual asset to nosedive down to under $57,000 last month.It has been rising ever since, though Bitcoin's price is still below its all-time high price of $73,737 set this March.The Bitcoin halving took place late on April 19 in the United States. It led to miners, the power-hungry operations that process transactions on the network, having their rewards cut in half from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for each block they process.Designed as a feature of Bitcoin to make it deflationary, the idea is that the event will make sure that as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to make new virtual coins. Four halvings have now taken place, and after about a year following each one, the coin has typically risen in price.Bitcoin's rise this year has mostly been thanks to new investors putting money into the asset via the new spot ETFs, which were approved in January. The investment vehicles have been massively popular, receiving billions of dollars in inflows.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Institutions Will Require Data Management Tools For Digital Asset Adoption

                        Institutional interest in digital assets is gaining traction. As of the end of Q1, more than 900 institutions based in the United States had disclosed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shareholdings exceeding $100 million, equating to $10.7 billion combined.In addition, leading asset management firms, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have launched tokenized treasury funds. Recent data indicates that more than $1 billion in treasury notes has been tokenized on public blockchain networks.A bi-annual survey conducted by KPMG in Canada further found that institutional investors located in the region greatly increased their crypto holdings in 2023. According to KPMG’s survey, 22% more financial services organizations offered crypto asset products and services to clients last year than in previous years.Institutions Need Better Data Management Tools
While notable, digital asset data is still a challenge for institutions.Isabella Henderson, Director of Product Strategy at Amberdata, told Cryptonews that digital asset data is dense and complex.“Each crypto exchange uses different tickers and hundreds of thousands of asset instruments,” said Henderson. “This makes consistency and reliability a challenge for institutions.”Henderson pointed out that in traditional finance, standardized security masters and asset references solve these challenges by aligning front, middle, and back offices.Yet she noted that the digital asset space lacks such solutions, resulting in a fragmented view of the crypto sector for institutions.An Open-Source Master Security Database for Digital Assets
To solve this problem, Amerberdata recently launched an asset reference and classification tool. Known as “ARC,” this is an institutional-grade security master database for digital assets.A security master database is a data store that contains reference data about financial products. Such a tool is used by market participants to organize their records across trading, risk, clearing, and settlement operations.Henderson explained that ARC is an open-source dataset that enables financial institutions to segment and view the digital asset sector consistently.“By combining reference details, classification, and categorization, ARC is a solution that provides transparency into the operations and use cases of any digital asset,” she remarked.Unifying Crypto Data Sets
Henderson elaborated that ARC unifies front, middle, and back offices for institutions holding digital assets. This is done through data collected by Amberdata, which tracks traded crypto pairs across over 150,000 spot, options, and futures instruments.“ARC shows token addresses, contract and trade specifications, price limits, exploits, and more,” said Henderson. “ARC IDs also map an asset’s associated instruments across the digital asset ecosystem, using a tagging classification system to flexibly classify industries and proper use cases.”Henderson believes that such a tool can help institutions with analysis and reference, trading, and for other instances.“For example, ARC will help institutions keep records of the highly dynamic universe of digital assets with a repository of accurate asset and classification information for reference and analysis,” she said. “It can also optimize execution workflows to enhance trade execution strategies.”Data To Evaluate Digital Asset Risk 
Institutions also require data management tools to evaluate risks associated with digital assets.A recent Deloitte poll shows that executives involved in managing digital assets expect risks to increase and the regulatory environment to become more complex this year.Tim Davis, a Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory principal and U.S. Blockchain Leader, believes, “Digital asset risk should be a mainstay board agenda item for any organization that actively uses digital assets in its operations.”Given this, a Chainalysis spokesperson told Cryptonews that institutions could use Chainalysis on-chain data to evaluate risks associated with digital assets.“For example, we can help clients understand how widely distributed an asset is, how liquid it is, what segments of the crypto economy are holding and using it, and whether those segments skew toward being illicit or risky,” the spokesperson said.Will Institutions Implement Digital Asset Management Tools?
Since digital assets represent a fairly new sector for institutions, it is questionable if data management tools will be immediately implemented.Yet Henderson noted that Amberdata expects institutions to use ARC moving forward.“We have heard from many financial institutions and crypto native firms – both clients and not – that mapping assets across exchanges and markets is a major pain point across the trading life cycle,” she remarked.Henderson added that Amberdata has already initiated the process of ARC integration for a few institutions. She further pointed out that because ARC is open-sourced, it will advance within the digital asset industry through community contributions and insights.“There is a vast community of financial professionals and digital asset investors who will contribute to ARC, keep the dataset relevant and up to date, and eliminate proprietary biases on how to classify digital assets,” she said.Yet challenges may arise. Sebastian Higgs, Chief Operating Officer and Co-founder of Cordial Systems – an institutional-grade self-custody software provider – told Cryptonews that while transparency benefits public blockchains, there is an extreme side for institutions who want to build products on blockchain infrastructure.“They are still beholden to customer data privacy laws, confidentiality, and will want to retain certain processes or business logic as private instead of publishing them for the general public to see,” said Higgs.

                        In the latest Solana meme coin skyrocket, ETF token (ETF) has exploded +207% in just 24 hours amid a flurry of interest around crypto ETFs.This article will provide an analysis of ETF’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity in the Solana meme coin market at this time.ETF token launched to much market excitement a few days ago, with hype generated by a prelaunch marketing campaign for an ETF token airdrop – with these tokens now in circulation – price growth for ETF seems set for organic growth from here on out.ETF Price Analysis: As New Solana Meme Coin Surges Into Relevance, Could This Other Upcoming Launch Be Next?
With price action continuing to hammer up to the upside, ETF token is currently trading at a market price of $0.00134 (representing a 24-hour change of +202%).This comes after a breath of life surged into the chart at around 12:30 UTC on May 16, in an electric move that saw an incredible 8 consecutive green hourly candles.The initial upside surge stalled at resistance around $0.0013, triggering a momentary consolidation above lower support at $0.0008.However, a successful defense by bulls at this level set the stage for a resurgent second rally leg that has so far seen ETF price hammer up a further +48% to a present local high at $0.0014.But, while price action remains trading high, all eyes are now on ETF’s market cap, which has surged over $1M to hit $1.3M in the past few hours – creating an allure for a potential 5-10x leap in the coming hours.Beyond this, buy pressure is holding its dominance to a moderate degree at 53% of taker buys in the past hour.Yet, with price action overextended to some degree, analysts are now shifting their attention to an emerging launch from the recent DOGEVERSE presale.This presale unlocked viral success in the crypto community throughout April and now stands set for major tier-1 CEX listings.Next To Pump: Dogeverse – Over $15M Raised in Viral Meme Coin Presale
While Dogecoin price basks in the afterglow of fleeting Tesla support, the Dogeverse presale continues to gain traction. The latest presale statistics show that the project has raised over $15 million. Going by recent trends, this could just be the beginning of this upswing.Dogeverse offers better features than Dogecoin.Most importantly, it is the first multichain meme coin and will deploy on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, and Base, among other platforms.Moreover, Dogeverse, unlike Dogecoin, supports staking, meaning presale investors can diversify income streams from passive gains and decent DOGEVERSE yields.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

Anthony Scaramucci Predicts More Pension Funds Will Invest in Bitcoin, Says ‘We Are Still Early’ in BTC Adoption - The Daily Hodl


								SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci is predicting that more pension funds will add Bitcoin (BTC) to their investment portfolios.
In a new interview on CNBC Squawk Box, the hedge fund veteran says other pension funds are likely to follow the State of Wisconsin’s decision to invest in Bitcoin to help pay for retirement benefits.










New U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings showed this week that The State of Wisconsin Investment Board, a state agency managing investments for public retirement and trust funds, has about $163 million invested in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
“I think the institutional adoption is happening now. The State of Wisconsin announced. We expect other pension funds to announce. And of course, Bitcoin now has the regulatory approval. And I think that was the rate limiting step for a lot of these large-scale institutions… 
A lot of smart institutions are saying, ‘Let me get long this thing.'” 
Scaramucci believes that Bitcoin remains in the early stages of adoption.
“Sometimes when you’re early, you get a lot of bumps and scrapes. But I think it pays to be early in Bitcoin and I think we’re still early in Bitcoin.”
Bitcoin is trading for $67,142 at time of writing, up 2.5% in the last 24 hours.

Developer Ignites Firestorm, Claims Ethereum Layer-2s Operate As Unregistered MSBs


								Ethereum is a legacy chain that has scaled over time to address the needs of the ever-demanding global user base. To relieve the mainnet of the deluge of transactions, more layer-2 platforms have sprouted. 
They are cheaper to transact on and scalable, allowing users to deploy intensive decentralized applications that won’t be feasible on the base layer.
Ethereum Layer-2s Are A Success, But There Is A Problem
According to L2Beat, layer-2 platforms on Ethereum currently manage over $39 billion in total value locked (TVL). Even so, Nikita Zhavoronkov, a lead developer at Blockchair, is concerned and thinks layer-2s are a “huge legal liability waiting to happen.”
Ethereum layer-2s TVL | Source: L2Beat
Taking to X, Zhavoronkov argues that layer-2 protocols on Ethereum and Bitcoin are vulnerable to regulator crackdown. In the developer’s assessment, these platforms resemble money service businesses (MSBs), considering how they are designed to operate. Since they are not regulated, the developer said they might be operating illegally.

Top of the list, Zhavoronkov argues that most existing layer-2 solutions are not truly decentralized. They point to using multi-signature contracts or “emergency councils” controlled by limited groups as evidence of centralized control. 
Moreover, the developer highlighted the custodial nature of many layer-2s. Users do not directly control user funds based on how these scalable platforms operate. The analyst says this tinge of centralization presents a vulnerability if regulators target these entities.
Zhavoronkov adds that though layer-2 platforms are enablers, working from a trustless base, they function as for-profit businesses, generating revenue from transaction fees. Because some of them, like Optimism and Arbitrum, issue tokens, revenue accrued can impact token prices. 
The developer contends that this is why layer-2 platforms are no different from traditional companies than truly decentralized platforms.
More Headwinds For ETH, United States SEC Reported Investigation
Given their mode of operation and model, Zhavoronkov’s assertion that layer-2 solutions could be classified as MSBs under United States laws is a concern. Such a classification could subject these protocols to stringent regulations, compliance requirements, and potential sanctions. 
This not only threatens to stifle innovation but also has the potential to hamper Ethereum’s scalability severely.

While some have dismissed Zhavoronkov’s viewpoint as “distorted,” the fact that Ethereum is reportedly under investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adds a layer of complexity to the situation. 

Analysts say the SEC’s classification of ETH as a security rather than a commodity like BTC could further delay the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Solana meme coins surge up to 210% despite Pump.fun incident - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Meme coin marketplace Pump.fun was attacked by a former team member yesterday, resulting in halted trading, users unable to liquidate their tokens, and the platform losing $1.9 million, according to a May 16 post-mortem. Despite this episode, the meme coin sector on Solana stood firmly in the last 24 hours, with tokens making two-digit leaps.The best performance in the period was registered by DogeBoy (DOGB), with a nearly 210% upside, while Pepe Trump (PTRUMP) also saw significant positive movement of 67.5%. Maga VP (MVP), another Trump-themed token, is also among the biggest winners in the period, presenting almost a 31% price advance.On the cat-coins front, MANEKI has shown 34% growth in the past 24 hours at the time of writing, a movement that made its market cap surpass $91 million. UpSideDownCat (USDC) surged almost 54% in the same period, and the cat Chipi (CHIPI) showed a 72% upside.Solana meme coins with the best performances in the last 24 hours. Image: CoinGeckoThe Costco Hot Dog (COST), a meme coin that backpacked the meme of hot dogs sold at Costco markets never rising in value, has risen 38% at the time of writing. The meme coin FindMe shown in the image above was, in fact, a honey pot attack.Honey pots are smart contracts programmed to forbid tokens from being sold, while the contract deployer drains all the liquidity. Currently, the only FindMe pool available has $231 in liquidity, which highlights the risks of trading meme coins.Moreover, despite showing a 33% growth in the last 24 hours, the token Lola Cat (LOLA) is still relatively new to the meme coin market. Hence, the asset still doesn’t have a seven-day track record.Solordi (SOLO) represents the dog-themed coins on the meme coins with the most substantial growth in the last 24 hours after leaping 37.7%.Pump.fun explains the ‘exploit’As reported by Crypto Briefing, a user used flash loans to manipulate token prices on Pump.fun, borrowing SOL from the money market Drift. However, the exploiter was able to move liquidity from Pump.fun’s pools, which would be possible only by using an authorized wallet.Wintermute’s head of research Igor Igamberdiev identified that the wallet commonly used to move liquidity from Pump.fun to decentralized exchange Raydium was being controlled by the exploiter, suggesting a private key compromise or an inside job.In their post-mortem, the meme coin marketplace revealed that a former employee was responsible for the attack, and misappropriated nearly 12,300 SOL. Pump.fun tackled the issue by deploying their smart contracts again, launching pools with the whole they met in the bonding curve during the incident, and removing the platform fees for the next seven days.

Proton Mail exposing activist's info showed the limits of encryption

Proton AG — the Swiss company behind Proton Mail, the popular encrypted email service — came under fire in April for complying with a request from Spanish police for information about one of its users — a Catalan pro-independence activist. It’s obvious why that was a controversial move. It feels gross when the “good guys” get “sold out” by a company that promises privacy. But if you’re pissed off at Proton for complying with legal requests, you need to reassess your fantasies about privacy tech.We all love encryption and its attached ideals. But encryption isn’t a panacea, and the more we encrypt, the more metadata matters. When it comes to privacy, metadata is an exercise in minimization — but centralized services have natural limits on how mini they can make their metadata collection.Related: Big miners pose a growing existential threat to BitcoinProton has done an amazing job limiting access to user metadata. They should get a pat on the back for building a system where all they can provide is an optional recovery email. (In this case, the company provided their user's recovery email address, which led police to their Apple account.) Instead, they’ve been met with online anons brandishing “Cancel Subscription” buttons and ominous headlines that begin with “Is Proton…” and end with question marks.The Platonic ideal of privacy techThe fantasy goes like this: privacy company receives formal legal request from authorities, privacy company flips off authorities, privacy company delivers news of triumph to the frenzied cheers of their fans. This expectation has reared its head multiple times, including another ProtonMail case from just a couple of years ago. But the fantasy is delusional and self-destructive.If Proton took this route, they’d be met with crippling legal pressure which would set the sun on the entire company rather quickly — and then we’re down to just a couple of established encrypted email providers. That’s not a useful outcome for Proton, Proton users, or privacy at large. FreedomTech editor SethForPrivacy defended Proton Mail in a post on X, writing thatthe case had "proven" Proton's architecture "minimizes the amount of data they have on any user."Proton is well aware of this, so the reality is they complied with almost 6,000 legal requests in 2023 alone. Once the shock of the news wore off and steady hands like SethForPrivacy weighed in, more people accepted that outrage wasn’t really warranted nor was it helpful. Blaming opsec is a copoutAs the story cooled down, Proton defenders pointed out that deanonymization was only possible in this case because an opt-in recovery email was provided. They say it’s actually the activist’s fault for having leaky operational security (opsec) — but this is just another unproductive iteration of the blame game.We can’t just end this story with, ‘Oh well, you just have to have better opsec than that.’The core question is: Can we do better?Encryption is our baseline. We should use it, we should advocate for it, we should protect it. Proton has this and minimal metadata collection, so we’ve got a good foundation to work with here.On top of this, the sage advice is to access Proton with a VPN/Tor (importantly, not ProtonVPN) and pay for your subscription using crypto. This message spread far and wide over the last couple of weeks — but it’s not new advice, and we’re still seeing cases like our Catalan activist pop up. People will get left behind if services require manual user hardening, and sometimes they’ll be the same at-risk people we’re trying to protect.In the Catalan case, an email provided to sign up for an E2EE messaging app, a recovery email provided to a secure email service, and an iCloud email were the puzzle pieces required for deanonymization. These are small mistakes that anyone could make, but together they create a metadata breadcrumb trail that can be followed with relative ease.Potential for decentralization in limiting metadata collectionOur goal should be to create tooling which is hardened out of the box, and to make damn sure any options that might jeopardize privacy are clearly described in-situ.Perhaps decentralizing parts of the system could help us take things a step further than Proton. Decentralization is a meaningful way to reduce the amount of data that a centralized company actually needs to process in order to offer a service.For example, building applications on top of decentralized networks capable of storing or routing the data required for a service. For an email service, that would mean storing and forwarding the mail itself — including vulnerable metadata such as subject lines and mail timestamps. That decentralized network layer would employ more advanced privacy-preserving techniques like onion routing, too. This way, a user’s IP would be better protected even if they’re not using a VPN. There are already some networks like this — such as Tor — but we’ve got similar networks that are secured and incentivised by blockchain, like the Nym mixnet. Related: Welcome to the United Kingdom — Please hand over your cryptoNetworks like Nym are generalisable for data-routing needs, and they already provide software development kits (SDKs) for integrating into third-party applications. Mixnets are pretty slow, so this might not be a good solution for instant messenger or conferencing services, but for email — it might work. The storage side of things is more complicated, app-specific networks, like the Session Network (used by the messaging app I work on), offer ephemeral message storage in a decentralized way, but this won’t suit email — which is a de facto record-keeping utility for a lot of people.This limitation combined with spam filters and the email mafia might make a top-to-bottom decentralized email service impractical — although it won’t stop people from trying — but we can absolutely make this work for other communication tools, like messaging, video and voice conferencing, and team communication platforms (like Slack and Discord). In the end, legal requests are going to keep on coming — and companies are going to keep complying. It’s the way it has to be. But in cases where safety and security is critical, purposeful decentralization could offer an extra layer of protection that is vital for at-risk people.Proton — people have already designed and built solutions that could be useful for you and your users. We can help, all you have to do is call (or, I suppose, send an email). Alexander Linton is a director of the encrypted messaging app Session and its nonprofit foundation OPTF.

U.S. banking giants experiment tokenization with this cryptocurrency


The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), recognized as the world’s largest settlement system, has teamed up with blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK) to conclude a pilot program with several major U.S. banking firms.
The primary goal of this initiative was to advance the tokenization of traditional finance funds.
Following the announcement of DTCC’s successful completion of the tokenization pilot, Chainlink’s token saw a notable surge of up to 20%. 


This pilot, which included prominent Wall Street firms such as JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) and BNY Mellon, leveraged Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to merge traditional finance with blockchain technology.
According to a report from DTCC, the firm recently completed the pilot program, dubbed Smart NAV, in conjunction with Chainlink. The program was designed to explore an extension of a DTCC service, Mutual Fund Profile Service I (MFPS I), the industry standard for transmitting ‘Price and Rate’ data, also referred to as ‘NAV data’.

The pilot showed that by delivering structured data on-chain and creating standard roles and processes, foundational data could be utilized in various on-chain use cases. These included tokenized funds and bulk consumer smart contracts, which hold data for multiple funds.
Prominent participants included American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street, and U.S. Bank
Market response and price movements

Following the release of DTCC’s report, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, experienced a 12.5% increase in value. At press time, LINK surged past $16, with its market cap increasing by 14% in the past 8 hours, triggering the liquidation of $1.96 million in short positions over the last 24 hours. 
This spike in LINK’s price demonstrates the market’s positive reaction to the potential of integrating traditional finance with blockchain technology.

This pilot program is part of a broader trend where major traditional financial institutions are showing a growing interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.
As reported by Finbold, tokenized real-world assets have soared to nearly $8 billion in value as demand surged. 
For instance, on March 19, BlackRock  (NYSE: BLK)  introduced a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL on the Ethereum (ETH) network. This fund allows investors to acquire tokens representing shares in the fund, which primarily invests in U.S. Treasury bills.
The future of tokenized funds
Wall Street firms have long shown interest in blockchain technology but have often hesitated to operate on public blockchains.
In 2023, several notable firms, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), joined the Canton Network—a private pilot network aimed at allowing large institutions to explore decentralized infrastructure. 
The new test with Chainlink is different because its goal is to obtain Wall Street data directly from the institutions and make it available for use by smart contracts and other Real World Asset protocols on public networks. 
This marks a significant step towards integrating blockchain technology with mainstream finance, highlighting the potential for real-time, more automated data dissemination and built-in access to historical data.

South Korean Government Publishes Cryptocurrency Report: "There is a Crazy Trend Among Koreans" - Bitcoin Sistemi


South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) has published a survey that reveals a significant increase in the number of cryptocurrency users in the country. The survey shows that the number of cryptocurrency users has reached 6.45 million, accounting for 12.9% of South Korea's total population. It is noteworthy that 4.55 million of these users are small investors with cryptocurrencies worth less than $ 734.
The Korean Financial Intelligence Unit, under Gwang Park, conducted a survey of 29 reported businesses in the second half of 2023. The aim was to understand the current state of the local virtual asset market.


As the market price of virtual assets rose, there was a noticeable increase in average daily transaction size (24%), market capitalization (53%) and deposits won (21%) compared to the first half of 2023 in South Korea. Additionally, the number of users making transactions increased by 6%.

The survey also highlighted that the number of new altcoin listings in the Korean won market increased significantly by 70%. However, with a significant increase in the number of transaction suspensions in the coin market (42%), the total number of coins decreased slightly by 3.5%.





The survey warned that despite growth, volatility in virtual asset prices remained high at 62% and called on investors to make careful investment decisions. Additionally, the number of virtual asset operators announcing the closure of their businesses continues to rise to four, urging users to be extra careful.

Will the USDC outperform USDT in 2024?


The stablecoin Circle USD (USDC) has been growing in market share and approaching the undisputed leader, Tether USD (USDT). Ongoing regulatory developments threaten Tether’s presence in key markets, which could affect the company’s flagship product.
Notably, Circle launched the USDC in September 2018 in a stablecoin market highly dominated by USDT. Over the years, traders and investors welcomed the competition, considering growing concerns about Tether’s reserves and redeemability. 
In over five years, the USDC has increased its market cap to $33.34 billion, becoming the sixth-most valuable cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the USDT grew even more to $111.22 billion and kept third place among the most valuable cryptocurrencies.


Tether’s stablecoin also dominates the trading volume on centralized exchanges, although Circle has a larger presence in DeFi.

Kraken considers delisting USDT in Europe
However, Circle has a strong political presence in the United States, which the company has used in its favor against the competitor, as reported by Finbold in February 2024. Further regulatory developments outside the U.S. threaten USDT’s hegemony, opening space for USDC to take over.
In particular, Kraken is considering removing support from the USDT in Europe, according to a Bloomberg report on May 17. The possible delisting of Tether products surges amid concerns related to the European Union (EU) MiCa rules that regulate cryptocurrencies.
Kraken is one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges and the second-largest provider in the United States. The company represents a key market previously mostly dominated by Tether, and others could follow its lead.
According to crypto journalist Colin Wu, the OKX exchange recently announced the delisting of most USDT pairs. Therefore highlighting a possible trend favoring USDC over its stablecoin competitor.

Interestingly, the finance giant BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK) has previously disclosed “exposure to stablecoin risks” on its spot Bitcoin ETF filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At that time, BlackRock mentioned concerns over Tether’s reserves and Circle’s abilities to keep the $1-peg.  
Now, the market awaits to see what will happen in the battle among the leading stablecoins. Losing key markets like Kraken and OKX could be a significant hit to USDT and a massive win to USDC, as capital is expected to migrate from the first to the second. As reported by Bloomberg, the new digital asset’s regime is set to take effect in July.

US arrests two Chinese nationals in $73 million crypto scam - CoinJournal



                    

                    
US authorities arrested Daren Li and Yicheng Zhang in connection with a $73 million money laundering scheme.
The defendants laundered the money via US and international bank accounts.
Proceeds of the investment scam were converted to the USDT stablecoin.

The US Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals alleged to have played a prominent role in a scheme that laundered $73 million in cryptocurrency investment schemes.
According to an indictment unsealed on Thursday in the Central District of California, authorities arrested Daren Li, 41, on April 12 and Yicheng Zhang, 38, on May 16.
Li is a dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis, while Zhang is a Temple City, California.
Defendants ran an international crypto investment scam
Li, Zhang and others are alleged to have been behind an international money laundering syndicate that scammed victims via pig butchering, among the common crypto scams.  
In Court documents show that the suspects laundered proceeds of these crypto scams via bank accounts of multiple shell companies.
DOJ’s Office of Public Affairs announced that more than $73 million was defrauded from victims and laundered through US and international bank accounts. The laundered money found its way to The Bahamas and was converted to Tether (USDT).
“Cryptocurrency investment scams exploit the borderless nature of virtual currency and online communications to defraud victims,” Lisa Monaco, the United States Deputy Attorney General, said in the press release.
“While fraud in the crypto markets takes on many forms and hides in many far-off places, its perpetrators aren’t beyond the law’s reach. Today, we announce the arrests of two foreign nationals charged for leading a scheme to launder funds to the tune of at least $73 million tied to an international crypto investment scam,” she added.
According to the court documents, a crypto wallet linked to the scam received more than $341 million in cryptocurrencies.
The DOJ has charged Li and Zhang with conspiracy to commit money laundering as well as six counts of international money laundering. Each of the counts carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.
In November last year, the DOJ said it had seized $9 million in USDT linked to an international romance and pig butchering scheme.

Coinbase Sees Upside for Ether Despite Recent Bitcoin Outflow


							

Coinbase: Ether underperforms Bitcoin in 2024 so far



Report sees positive long-term outlook for Ether despite underperformance



Coinbase: U.S. Ether ETF approval could be underestimated by market




In a recent report, Coinbase acknowledged that Ether (ETH) has underperformed compared to Bitcoin (BTC) in the cryptocurrency market so far this year. Despite this, the report emphasizes a positive long-term outlook for Ether.




Ether may have the potential to surprise to the upside in the coming months,” Coinbase’s repost stated, stressing that digital assets don’t “major sources of supply-side overhangs” such as token unlocks or pressure created by miners’ sales.




Coinbase’s data shows that Ether has risen in price by 29% over the past year, trailing Bitcoin’s 50% year-to-date gain. Analyst David Han attributes Ether’s potential future growth to its lack of significant supply-side pressures. He emphasizes the increasing role of staking and layer-2 solutions in absorbing ETH liquidity. He further explained:




ETH’s position as the center of decentralized finance (DeFi) is also unlikely to be displaced in our view due to the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its layer 2 innovations,” 




Coinbase also points to the potential impact of a U.S. Ether ETF, suggesting the market might be underestimating the timing and likelihood of its approval. The report acknowledges the initial deadline of May 23, 2024, but expresses optimism about potential litigation reversing a rejection.



Overall, Coinbase maintains a positive outlook for Ether, citing ongoing structural demand drivers and technological advancements within the Ethereum ecosystem. These factors, the report argues, will allow Ether to navigate various market conditions and maintain a stable trajectory.









In a separate development, data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that Coinbase experienced its third-largest Bitcoin outflow of 2024 on May 15th. The outflow, totaling nearly $1 billion, originated from Coinbase cold storage and involved two transactions, each comprising 8,000 Bitcoins.



However, the recent large Bitcoin outflow from Coinbase raises questions about investor sentiment and potential short-term market volatility. The interplay between these contrasting narratives – positive long-term outlook for Ether versus immediate market uncertainty – will likely shape the cryptocurrency’s performance in the coming months.

Is It Time To Buy Ethereum Ahead Of The ETF Decision? 'It Might Be Time To Pull Another Crazy Rally,' Trader Speculates - Benzinga

With a decision on the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs looking on May 23, the cryptocurrency community is discussing whether Ethereum ETH/USD is ready to rebound.What Happened: Cold Blooded Shiller kicked off the discussion by referencing a thread he wrote back in November when Ethereum was at a psychological low. He believes the situation now is similar, if not worse, and has decided to go long on ETH again."ETH maxi’s are in shambles," he notes, pointing out the euphoria among Solana enthusiasts and the peak of memes. Despite the undeniable poor performance, he asserts, "It’s time."Jelle provides a more technical outlook, mentioning a forming falling wedge pattern for Ethereum. He believes that if Bitcoin can set a positive path, Ethereum might follow with a significant rally. "Still has some work to do, but if Bitcoin can show the way, it might be time for ETH to pull another crazy rally," Jelle comments.While Jelle notes that Ethereum is building one of its own falling wedges, another trader, Eugene, brings a strategic perspective, focusing on positioning in the ETH/Bitcoin BTC/USD pair.He observes the recent apathy and capitulation as ETHBTC hit a 3-year range low. Despite expecting a possible ETH ETF rejection, Eugene is optimistic about a rebound, predicting, "ETHBTC finds its bottom within the 0.043 – 0.045 region during the next 1-2 weeks."He concludes with cautious optimism, "Only time will tell if I become just another one of those slain ETH bulls."On the contrary, Altcoin Sherpa offers a different angle, noting that the charts don’t provide much reason to buy ETH, citing resistance levels and negative sentiment among holders. However, he also hints that the prevailing bitterness might be a contrarian buy signal. "Sentiment is horrid," he states, adding, "Which means it’s prob time to buy?"Also Read: Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Odds Decrease For Later This Month As Analyst Points Out SEC ‘Considering the Security Question for the Asset’Why It Matters: The potential approval of an Ethereum ETF has been a topic of discussion among market participants.

Good News from the US to Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies This Time - Bitcoin Sistemi


The US state of Oklahoma took an important step this week, passing a bill guaranteeing the state's residents the right to keep their digital assets to themselves.
The bill, known as OKHB3594, was signed by Governor Kevin Stitt and will go into effect on November 1, 2024.


The legislation was sponsored by four Republicans, State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto, and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard. The law aims to protect Oklahomans' 'fundamental bitcoin rights' by banning self-custody wallets or restrictions on hardware wallets.
The bill also addresses the issue of Bitcoin mining by banning discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses. Oklahomans are now allowed to mine cryptocurrency both at home and industrially, provided they comply with local noise ordinances. “Persons who engage in home-based digital asset mining or digital asset mining business, staking or staking as a service, or engage in commercial staking will not be required to obtain a money transmitter license,” the bill states. The statement is included.






Additionally, the legislation allows residents to use cryptocurrency to pay for goods and services without paying additional taxes. “Digital assets used as a payment method may not be subject to any additional taxes, withholdings, assessments, or fees imposed by a state or local government based solely on the use of the digital asset as a payment method,” the bill states.
The bill was described as “groundbreaking” by Satoshi Act Fund CEO Dennis Porter. Porter believes the legislation is designed to protect the fundamental rights of Bitcoin users.

Cryptocurrencies rally, stocks trade sideways as traders speculate interest rate decision - Blockworks


Bitcoin and ether extended their rallies Friday, a sign pointing to sustained higher prices ahead, according to some analysts. 
Bitcoin (BTC) was up around 2% over the past 24 hours at time of publication to trade around $67,000, according to data from Coinbase. The largest cryptocurrency is now up more than 10% over the past seven days to hit the highest price since late April. Researchers from Matrixport attribute the run to favorable macroeconomic conditions. 
US inflation eased slightly in April, according to the latest consumer price index report released Wednesday, which showed prices were up 0.3% last month, slightly below expectations of a 0.4% increase. 
Read more from our opinion section: Don’t dismiss the misunderstood techno-optimist voter
“The trigger for the post-CPI pump this week was a marginally lower-than-expected inflation number that catapulted [b]itcoin +7% higher,” Matrixport analysts wrote in a note Friday. “However, the buying occurred relatively [gradually], indicating a persistent buyer in the market instead of a fast re-pricing, as we usually see when economic data causes a huge surprise.” 
Ether (ETH) also posted a rally this week, gaining close to 7%, per Coinbase. The cryptocurrency is now trading back above the $3,000 level after hovering around $2,900 last week. 
US equities on Friday were relatively flat after a week of returns. The S&P 500 is up 1.2% over the past five trading days while the Nasdaq Composite has gained 1.8%. 
Wednesday’s inflation print was enough to assure markets that the Federal Reserve will refrain from raising interest rates in June. Traders still widely anticipate that central bankers will opt to hold rates steady, according to Fed fund futures data from CME Group. Now that an increase is off the table, markets can breathe a sigh of relief, Matrixport analysts said. 
Even after three Fed officials — Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, New York Fed President John Williams and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin — on Thursday in separate speeches insisted that rate cuts are a long way off, traders were undeterred. 
“Interestingly, the total number of expected cuts has not moved — CME futures are still pricing in two before December,” Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said. “Rather, it’s the timing that is in question, with a slight increase in hopes the first comes in July and 70% odds it comes in or before September.”

How Lorenzo Protocol is Supercharging Bitcoin DeFi With Liquid Restaking - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin is the original cryptocurrency—and dominates the market as the largest crypto by market capitalization.But as a trailblazer, it also suffers from limitations that have been addressed by the cryptocurrencies that followed in its wake. Those limitations—Bitcoin’s slow consensus mechanism, limited data storage capacity and lack of smart contract compatibility—mean that much of Bitcoin’s liquidity is cut off from the flourishing decentralized finance (DeFi) space.That’s what Lorenzo Protocol is aiming to address with its novel Bitcoin liquid restaking protocol.Liquid restaking builds on the existing model of liquid staking, which enables investors to participate in staking on proof-of-stake blockchains, while still retaining their personal liqudity.Lorenzo Protocol’s liquid restaking enables users to stake the stBTC derivative token that represents their staked asset across multiple blockchains, earning additional yield from their staked Bitcoin.“We are a platform to help stakeholders to lend BTC liquidity to the projects needing them for scale, and then to provide the yield from these projects,” Lorenzo Protocol founder Matt Ye told Decrypt. He added that, by tokenizing the lending and borrowing of BTC liquidity, it effectively creates BTC bonds.“First of all, we’re matching BTC holders with all the projects for BTC yield,” Ye said. “Two, we do the tokenization for staking.”“On top of that, we build StakingFi or YieldFi application layers on top of them,” he added. The platform uses the Lorenzo Appchain, an EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer 2 network that’s secured by BabylonChain's Bitcoin shared security. “This L2 is in charge of the issuance and settlement of these staking tokens, and then also for building the DeFi ecosystem on top of these token standards,” Ye explained.The platform’s testnet will be launched “very soon,” Ye told Decrypt, enabling users to trial Lorenzo Protocol’s staking portal. “You can basically stake through us to Babylon, and at the same time we’re going to issue stBTC on our own L2s, and you can bridge them to the other L2 or L1 ecosystem with our bridge,” he explained.“Eastern BTC capital can meet western projects.”As the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem evolves, Ye predicted “huge demand for Bitcoin liquidity,” across purposes including L2s, BTC yield products, and staking portfolio management. “Every L2 is one BTC yield source; trading desks, trading strategies are others,” he said. “Given that BTC’s been expanding, demand in every single sector will grow.”“We tokenize everything every single staking opportunity, and we become like a marketplace,” he said, adding that Lorenzo Protocol aims to help to bridge the divide between BTC holders and staking opportunities across projects in the English-speaking world and Asia. At the moment, he said, there’s “no trust base, there are language barriers, it’s impossible for them to work together.” With Lorenzo Protocol in the middle, he said, “Eastern BTC capital can meet western projects.”Lorenzo also functions as a BTC bond trading protocol. “You could lend your money to anyone in the world, but without a bond market or money market your assets are very illiquid,” Ye said. A BTC bond market, he said, enables holders to “keep your liquidities and safety for financial stability for your asset investment.Its ecosystem could expand to encompass a wide range of products, Ye said, including yield swap products, lending protocols, structured Bitcoin yield products, insurance products, and BTC-backed overcollateralized stablecoins that use Lorenzo Protocol's stBTC derivative token as collateral.Ultimately, Lorenzo Protocol has sweeping ambitions, said Ye. “My hope is that eventually, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Brevan Howard, Two Sigma, Citadel, Fidelity—they could all be borrowing BTC capital on our platform,” he said, adding that, “We want to go very institutional. We're supposed to be the BTC bond exchange market in the world.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin Adoption Slows Down To Multi-Year Lows, But Why?


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin adoption rate has slowed to the lowest since July 2018. Here’s what could be behind this trend.
Bitcoin New Addresses Count Has Plunged To Multi-Year Lows
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, an interesting trend has appeared in the Bitcoin New Addresses metric. The “New Addresses” indicator keeps track of the total number of new addresses created on the BTC network every day.
When this metric has a high value, it suggests many new addresses are currently popping up on the blockchain. Such a trend could indicate that new investors are entering the cryptocurrency.

However, this isn’t the only reason why the metric would register an increase, as old investors who had exited earlier could also contribute to the indicator’s value when they return. Holders making multiple wallets for privacy purposes would also naturally influence the metric.
In general, though, all of these are happening at once to some degree, so on the net, some adoption would occur for the asset. Thus, a high number of new addresses can be a bullish sign in the long term.
On the other hand, the indicator’s low value potentially suggests the cryptocurrency isn’t currently attracting fresh investors. Naturally, this would possibly imply a bearish outcome for the asset.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average New Addresses metric for Bitcoin over the history of the asset:

The value of the metric appears to have been going down in recent months | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As the above graph shows, the 7-day average of Bitcoin New Addresses has declined this year. This suggests that fewer and fewer new hands are potentially entering the asset.
Following the latest decrease, the metric’s value has dropped to just 276,000, the lowest since July 2018. The chart shows that a sharp cooldown in new addresses has generally coincided with the end of bullish periods.
Thus, going by this pattern, the latest rally may have run out of steam. There can, however, be alternative reasons for the recent trend rather than just a lack of interest among investors.
A big event for Bitcoin at the start of the year was the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that provide an alternate route of gaining exposure to the cryptocurrency in a format that’s more familiar to traditional investors.
It’s possible that the new users these days simply prefer to buy into spot ETFs instead. Since this adoption is happening off-chain, it makes sense why an on-chain metric wouldn’t be able to detect it.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,100, up more than 5% over the past week.

What Bitcoin ETFs and their record volumes tell us about HODLers - AMBCrypto



ETF volumes surged as BTC’s price appreciated on the charts
Number of long term holders declined though, despite recent hike in price

Bitcoin [BTC]’s recent push past the $65,000-level has inspired massive optimism among traders and investors alike. This, despite the minor correction that followed soon after. However, it isn’t just the crypto-market where BTC is making waves. In fact, Wall Street is pretty keen on Bitcoin as well.
Interest in ETFs grows
According to Santiment, seven major Bitcoin ETFs together recorded a trading volume of $5.65 billion, marking their highest volume since 24 March.
On 16 May, the net inflows of U.S Bitcoin spot ETFs amounted to $257 million, indicating significant investor activity. Notably, Grayscale’s ETF GBTC saw single-day net inflows of $4.6382 million. Similarly, BlackRock’s ETF IBIT recorded net inflows of $93.7004 million, while Fidelity’s ETF FBTC registered net inflows of $67.0829 million on the same day.

The interest showcased by institutional investors from the traditional finance world can help inject massive amounts of liquidity into the Bitcoin market.
However, large investors in the crypto-space, known as whales, did not show similar levels of interest in BTC. AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that addresses holding 10-10,000 BTC slowed down their accumulation. On the contrary, retail interest has been on the rise. Investors holding anywhere between 0.001 to 1 BTC were seen accumulating BTC at a high rate.
Accumulation of BTC by retail investors could be a positive for BTC in the long run as it will help make the overall network more decentralized.

How are holders doing?
At press time, BTC was trading at $66,314.84, with its price up by 0.47% in the last 24 hours. Due to the recent uptick in price, the MVRV ratio for BTC grew significantly over the last few days. This indicated that most holders were starting to get profitable. As the price of BTC hikes further, there is a high chance of profit taking that could take place in the future.

Despite the surge in price, however, there was a concerning trend that emerged over the last few weeks. The Long/Short difference for BTC declined significantly, indicating that the number of long-term holders accumulating BTC fell and the number of short-term holders grew.
Short term holders are much more likely to respond impulsively to market fluctuations, having a negative impact on BTC’s price.

Bitcoin ETFs show $1.3 billion inflows and bounce back from April's slump - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US registered $1.3 billion in inflows over the past two weeks, shared Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X. This was enough to recover completely from April’s net outflows of over $343 million.The Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US now hold more than $12.3 billion under management, which Balchunas considers a key number for considering inflows and outflows.Moreover, Balchunas highlighted that those numbers make a point of not getting “emotional” over Bitcoin ETF flows, sharing his belief that the net flows will turn out as positive in the long term and that the flow amounts are relatively small when compared to the total under management.As reported by Crypto Briefing, professional investment firms showed a high interest in Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter, with 937 of them reporting exposure to those investment instruments in their 13F Forms.Balchunas doubled down on that, highlighting that BlackRock’s IBIT got 414 reported holders in Q1. He adds that having 20 holders for a recently launched ETF is “highly rare,” showing that at least four Bitcoin funds surpassed that mark with ease.Number of holders for ETFs launched in January. Image: Eric Balchunas/Bloomberg IntelligenceIn the last 24 hours, nine Bitcoin ETFs in the US added 3,743 BTC to their holdings, as reported by X user Lookonchain, which is equivalent to over $250 million. Grayscale’s GBTC added 397 BTC, while BlackRock’s IBIT added 1,435 BTC.Galaxy’s BTCO was the only Bitcoin ETF showing daily net outflows, with 543 BTC leaving their chest.Regulatory movementsFurthermore, recent regulatory developments in the US could heat up even more the Bitcoin ETF landscape. Yesterday, the Senate passed a vote to overturn the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), which makes it more expensive for banks to hold digital assets for their customers.However, US President Joe Biden has already manifested himself contrary to the bill, and a presidential veto is very likely.

Crypto's Altcoin Gainers | Bankless


Building Strength. While broader crypto alts have struggled to catch a bid since mid-April, many are lighting up the charts with green today! Can this rally persist?GameStop’s announcement this morning to sell 45M shares (15% of GME’s current float) may have extinguished animal spirits for TradFi retail participants for the moment, but crypto degens appear to just be getting the party started…Base’s DEGEN memecoin was the top-performing token of note on the CoinGecko Top 300 gainers board, experiencing a healthy pump on a percentage basis and gaining 26% on the day.Although memes have been one of the top performing crypto asset classes throughout 2024, tokens with actual fundamentals were also in the mix for the top gainers spots today, with holders of the Solana DePIN token MOBILE bagging 21% returns and those of LINK, LDO, and PENDLE experiencing mid-teens gains.Zooming out beyond the daily price action, however, it is clear to see that these tokens were caught in a downturn when crypto markets rolled over in April and that persistent red days have come to take their toll alts; despite recent strength, many crypto assets are still underwater.Source: TradingViewUndeniably, all rallies must start somewhere, and while broader alts have largely bled throughout the past month, gains in BTC are seeding cause for optimism. Crypto’s largest asset is up nearly 20% in May and pressed against its highs from recent weeks, threatening a breakout to establish new all-time highs!With crypto funding rates for perpetual swaps are remaining cool and supportive for bulls in long positions, there is certainly a possibility that longer-tail crypto assets continue to run from here as degens become increasingly risk-on.TradFi stock indexes broke out to new all-time highs this week, meanwhile the rolling 90-day correlation between BTC and tech stocks has reached its highest level since August, suggesting that the prices of crypto and equities will continue to rise together if bullish sentiment holds.

Kraken considers ending USDT support in the EU - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Kraken is reportedly considering pulling support for the stablecoin USDT in Europe.
The exchange’s plans come amid the push for compliance ahead of EU’s crypto regulations MiCA.
Crypto exchange OKX ended its USDT trading support in the EU in March.

Kraken is considering a move that would see the crypto exchange end its support for the Tether (USDT) stablecoin in Europe.
A Bloomberg report published on Friday, May 17, noted that the crypto exchange was “actively reviewing” this position.
Kraken eying USDT delisting ahead of EU’s MiCA rules
According to the report, Kraken is looking at ending USDT support for the market ahead of the region’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation roll out date.
The delisting of USDT for the exchange’s EU users is part of the compliance procedure. 
Crypto exchanges and other providers with operations in the EU know that MiCA’s stablecoin rules are set to come into effect on June 30, 2024. The comprehensive regulatory framework also includes rules targeted at cryptocurrency service providers – these will take effect on December 30, 2024.
Kraken is “absolutely planning for all eventualities,” Marcus Hughes, the exchange’s global head of regulatory strategy, told Bloomberg. The crypto platform will take a firm position on this in due course, the official added.
If it takes this step, Kraken will join OKX which ended support for USDT trading pairs on its European platform in March.
Tether is currently the world’s largest USD-pegged stablecoin with over $110 billion in market cap, accounting for 68.7% of the $160 billion market. According to data from CoinGecko, USDT is currently available across 347 exchanges.

More Than 900 Professional Firms Bought Into Spot Bitcoin ETFs in Q1, According to Crypto Intelligence Firm - The Daily Hodl


								A senior analyst with crypto intelligence platform K33 Research says investments in spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are surging.
In a post on social media platform X, Vetle Lunde says that the number of professional firms that invested in Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 outpaced the number of firms that invested in gold ETFs in their first quarter.










“According to 13F reporting, 937 professional firms were invested in US spot ETFs as of March 31. In comparison, gold ETFs had 95 professional firms invested in their first quarter (Bitwise).”
13F filings are the quarterly reports that institutional investment managers with over $100 million in assets under management (AUM) submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Lunde notes that retail investors make up the lion’s share of those who hold spot Bitcoin ETFs, with $47.96 billion in investments, representing 81.3% of the assets under management in spot BTC ETFs.
“Retail owns a majority of the float. Professional investors held exposure of $11.06 billion by the end of Q1, representing 18.7% of the BTC ETF AUM.”
Lunde says the biggest ETFs, including ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), have attracted the largest portion of institutional capital.
“ARKB and HODL have seen greater institutional dominance, helped by ARK and VanEck’s allocation to these ETFs.”
Financial giants have been buying up Bitcoin ETF shares: Morgan Stanley has purchased 4.27 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) worth $269.8 million, and JPMorgan is holding around $760,000 in spot BTC ETFs on behalf of its clients. Similarly, Wells Fargo disclosed that it was holding 2,245 shares of the GBTC worth $121,000 for its clients.
The state of Wisconsin also recently disclosed that it has large holdings in two Bitcoin trusts. New 13F filings show that the State of Wisconsin Investment Board has nearly $163 million worth of Bitcoin ETF holdings with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and GBTC.

OpenAI Exec Who Quit Says Safety 'Took a Backseat to Shiny Products' - Decrypt

Jan Leike, the former head of OpenAI’s alignment and "superalignment" initiatives, took to Twitter (aka X) on Friday to explain his reasoning for leaving the AI developer on Tuesday. In the tweet thread, Leike pointed to a lack of resources and safety focus as reasons for his decision to resign from the ChatGPT maker.OpenAI’s alignment or superalignment team is responsible for safety, and creating more human-centric AI models.Leike’s departure marks the third high-profile member of the OpenAI team to leave since February. On Tuesday, OpenAI co-founder and former Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever also announced that he was leaving the company.“Stepping away from this job has been one of the hardest things I have ever done,” Leike wrote. “Because we urgently need to figure out how to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us.”Leike noted that while he thought OpenAI would be the best place to do research into artificial intelligence, he didn’t always see eye-to-eye with the company’s leadership.“Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor,” Leike warned. “But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.”Noting the dangers of artificial general intelligence (AGI), Leike said OpenAI has an “enormous responsibility,” but said the company is more focused on achieving AGI and not on safety, noting that his team “has been sailing against the wind” and struggled for computing resources.Also known as the singularity, artificial general intelligence refers to an AI model able to solve problems in various areas like a human would, as well as having the ability to self-teach and solve problems the program was not trained for.On Monday, OpenAI revealed several new updates to its flagship generative AI product, ChatGPT, including the faster, more intelligent GPT-4O model. According to Leike, his former team at OpenAI is working on several projects related to more intelligent AI models.Before working for OpenAI, Leike worked as an alignment researcher at Google DeepMind.“It's been such a wild journey over the past ~3 years,” Leike wrote. “My team launched the first ever [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback] LLM with InstructGPT, published the first scalable oversight on LLMs, [and] pioneered automated interpretability and weak-to-strong generalization. More exciting stuff is coming out soon.”According to Leike, a serious conversation about the implications of achieving AGI is long overdue.“We must prioritize preparing for them as best we can,” Leike continued. “Only then can we ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.”While Leike did not mention any plans in the thread, he encouraged OpenAI to prepare for when AGI becomes a reality.“Learn to feel the AGI,” he said. “Act with the gravitas appropriate for what you're building. I believe you can ‘ship’ the cultural change that's needed.”“I am counting on you,” he concluded. “The world is counting on you.”Leike did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Huge Altcoin Project Everyone's Been Waiting For Finally Clarifies When Airdrop Will Be Distributed - Bitcoin Sistemi


ZkSync, a zero-knowledge (ZK) community, has hinted that the airdrop of the governance token will be held at the end of June. ZkSync, the Ethereum layer-2 network, has been the subject of speculation since March last year, when investors transferred over $8 million in tokens to the platform to qualify for the airdrop. The total value locked (TVL) has since risen to $141 million, as reported by DefiLlama.
The upcoming v24 is the last planned protocol upgrade before network management is handed over to the community. ZkSync stated that the remaining components are expected to be ready by the end of June.



ZkSync is a layer-2 network designed to scale Ethereum by storing computations and data off-chain. ZK falls into the rollup category, it is known as a subtype of layer-2 that takes advantage of zero-knowledge cryptography.
Following Ethereum's Dencun upgrade in March, transaction fees have decreased significantly. This upgrade enabled layer-2 networks like zkSync to compress transactions before sending them to the Ethereum mainnet, allowing for transaction fee savings.





Matter Labs, the developers behind zkSync, has raised a total of $458 million across various funding rounds.

League of Legends Patch Addresses Community Feedback | Cryptopolitan

Micro patch buffs Corki Smolder; nerfs Draven Samira.Players are building Ezreal, Gangplank, Yasuo, and Yone wrongly.Item rebalancing focused on improving builds over buffs.In the League of Legends patch, Riot listened to the community even during the first complications in balancing the game. Patch update rundownA second micro patch from Riot is due tomorrow, which will buff Corki and Smolder, who will be attracted to the new game, and Nerf Draven and Samira, who will be running away. Some boolean players have indicated that they keep requiring more boosts, but the former caster and current game designer David ‘Phreak’ Turley has said there is a lack of buffs in the probable status. Also Read: League of Legends PRO SuspendedPhreak states that Ezreal, Gangplank, Yasuo, and Yone are weaker because players build incorrectly. In this way, Yasuo and Yone were considered both winners and losers after the recent League of Legends patch 14 update. Finally, the items were frequently rebalanced. So, 10 critical strikes were increased. For Ezreal and Gangplank, nothing changed.Champion performance analysisOn the other hand, Faker recognizes Yasuo as one of the most powerful heroes in the current patch, with 48.5% to 50.19%. It should be noted that collected statistics based on the Smurf Patch 14 and Patch 18 show a 25% drop, and Yone’s statistics remain similar to the original statistics (48% to 49.8%). MF: Ezreal has continued to drop since 14.08 and tapered to 48%. Also Read: Most Played League of LegendAlthough this leads to some players calling for such buffs, and most of the champions seem to be completely fine, the issue that looms over Riot’s horizon is the lengthy process of perfecting items and creating the most suitable builds. Item and build adjustmentsThis might be a hard fact to handle for those expecting Riot to break this rule, yet it is agreeable for those who see Riot sticking to its script. Besides such changes, many people say that the atomic age is 14. they also have a 10-patch micro buff for Corki, who had his chance. This perhaps can be related to many changes as his win rate decreased. Furthermore, some changes were applied to the new Blackfire Torch and Fated Ashes. Of all these list items, the Fated Ashes was the most often used to cause trouble before the jungle.If you haven’t tried the new, well-known patch yet, don’t just watch a LoL tier list to find out which champions you should be locking in the next time you play.

How Canada’s 'Crypto King' Defrauded Investors of $30M - DailyCoin


        

Ontario police charge Aiden Pleterski with $41.5M fraud and money laundering.



Pleterski spent investor funds on luxury cars, private jets, and mansions.



At least one investor took justice into their own hands. 




Cryptocurrency investments have attracted both eager investors and opportunistic fraudsters. One such case has recently rocked Canada, as the self-proclaimed “Crypto King” was arrested for a $30 million scam. 



Ontario police recently charged Aiden Pleterski, who promised significant returns through his investment schemes, for money laundering and fraud. Instead of delivering to his investors, he used their money to fund his lavish lifestyle. 



‘Crypto King’ Charged



In May 2024, Ontario police, in collaboration with the provincial securities commission, charged Aiden Pleterski, known as Canada’s “Crypto King,” with fraud and money laundering. The charges followed a 16-month investigation named “Project Swan,” which revealed that Pleterski had defrauded investors of over C$41.5 million. 




According to the investigation, Pleterski raised approximately 41.5 million Canadian dollars (30 million US dollars), promising substantial returns through crypto investments. However, court documents revealed he only invested 1.6% of the funds. He used the rest of the money to finance a lavish lifestyle.



Pleterski’s extravagant spending included luxury cars, flights on private jets, and high-end properties. He rented multi-million dollar homes, such as a five-bedroom mansion in Burlington, and purchased high-end sports cars. Pleterski also showcased his opulent lifestyle on social media, which helped him maintain the illusion of a successful investment operation. However, this lavish lifestyle would soon backfire, as some of his victims took matters into their own hands. 



Disgruntled Investor Kidnaps ‘Crypto King’



In December 2022, as his fraud began to unravel, Pleterski was kidnapped in downtown Toronto. He was lured into a vehicle, where he was threatened with firearms and held captive for three days.




VIDEO




During his captivity, Pleterski was moved to various locations and repeatedly assaulted. The kidnappers filmed Pleterski apologizing to investors, demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom, and threatening his life and family. This video later surfaced during the investigation.




The investigation led to the arrest of five suspects involved in the kidnapping. According to the police, one of the kidnappers had lost $740,000 in investments to Pleterski. He and the other suspects face multiple charges, including kidnapping, forcible confinement, aggravated assault, and conspiracy.  



On the Flipside




Investment fraud is not confined to crypto. The most famous investment fraud case was that of Bernie Madoff, who managed to steal $64 billion from investors. 



A recent study uncovered the dangers of trusting the financial advice of crypto influencers. In the long term, their advice tends to lead to substantial losses. 




Why This Matters



The $30 million fraud case highlights how dangerous financial scams can be for both victims and perpetrators. Once faced with the loss of their life savings, victims can act dangerously, not shying away from illegal acts.

Solana (SOL) Price Targets $200 Leading the Crypto Rebound, Hedge Fund Founder Says

Bitcoin (BTC) Trading in Tandem with Tech Stocks


Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, is trading in lockstep with technology stocks once again, according to a Friday report by Bloomberg. The 90-day correlation between the flagship cryptocurrency and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has reached 0.46, the highest level in almost a year. The increasing correlation undermines the portfolio diversification narrative that is frequently being pushed by Bitcoin proponents. Earlier this year, Bitcoin's correlation with stocks declined significantly. In fact, it turned negative in April, according to Fidelity's Jurrien Timmer. The correlation between the largest cryptocurrency and equities tends to fluctuate based on macro-financial conditions. For instance, it soared to as high as 0.50 in May 2022. It also surged through the roof in 2020 during the QE era.   Earlier this week, major US stock market averages managed to jump to record highs after the most recent CPI report showed declining inflation in the US.Bitcoin has also rebounded, reclaiming the much-coveted $67,000 level and reaching the highest price point since early April. The latest inflation data has revived bullish sentiment since Wall Street believes that the U.S. Federal Reserve might now end up cutting rates multiple times this year. Lower borrowing costs would be hugely beneficial for risk assets like stocks and crypto. However, the Fed has yet to break the back of inflation, which might suggest that this investor optimism could be premature.   Earlier today, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman predicted that inflation would likely remain elevated "for some time." However, Bowman has stressed that she would be willing to hike rates if needed.

US Treasury strategy would tighten virtual asset regs, increase use of AI

The United States Treasury Department has released its biannual National Strategy for Combatting Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing. It contains four priority recommendations that may affect virtual assets in a variety of ways.The Treasury strategy acknowledged that law enforcement is scrambling to keep up with developing financial technology. The first two Treasury priorities are to address regulatory gaps in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and create a more focused and effective supervisory framework. The Treasury said it would “assess the need for additional action on sectors not subject to comprehensive AML/CFT measures.” Increasing enforcement is also on the agenda. The strategy said:“The explosion of new payment channels and financial service providers, including VASPs [virtual asset service providers], over the last decade, have stretched thin the limited supervisory resources historically applied to more traditional MSBs [money service businesses].”A new emphasis on blockchain technology is part of the strategy. For example, there is the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Virtual Assets Unit, which “provides technological equipment, blockchain analysis and virtual asset seizure training, and other sophisticated virtual asset training for FBI personnel.”Source: Under Secretary Brian NelsonFinally, the Treasury seeks to “support responsible technological innovation and harness technology to mitigate illicit finance risks” through a broad set of measures. It recommends increasing inclusivity in the financial system and combatting derisking — the practice of denying all correspondent services to small banks in areas of high illicit activity. Derisking has harsh consequences for legitimate users of bank services and encourages the use of crypto-based payment and remittance solutions that are not dependent on banking. Related: US Treasury official urges Congress for more power against crypto crimeCreating better cross-border payment systems and money transfer options under regulation are part of the strategy. It pointed to the G20 Roadmap and FedNow domestic transfer system as good implementations of this approach.Artificial intelligence and digital identity could play a big role in the strategy’s success:“We will provide regulatory and policy support for reliable digital identity solutions and […] expand the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics in U.S. government efforts to […] promote U.S. technological leadership on payments that reflect U.S. standards, practices, and values.” AI can be harnessed to enhance government regulatory and enforcement efforts, but it can equally well be applied by illicit users of the financial system, the strategy noted.

Price analysis 5/17: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, TON, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, SHIB

The bears' failure to sink and sustain Bitcoin (BTC) below the psychological level of $60,000 seems to have attracted buyers who are trying to propel the price toward the range resistance.

Source: TradingViewThe 20-day exponential moving average ($63,507) has started to turn up gradually, and the relative strength index (RSI) has jumped into the positive territory, indicating that the bulls have a slight edge.

The BTC/USDT pair may then travel to the stiff overhead resistance at $73,777.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $68,000 and breaks below the moving averages, it will signal that the bears continue to sell on relief rallies.

Lightspeed Newsletter: The Pump.fun exploit draws yawns and jeers - Blockworks


Howdy!
Happy Friday, folks. New York seems to be holding its collective breath today as the Knicks are about to play the Pacers for a trip to the conference finals. 
Solana seems less nervous today, since the memecoins are already back online after yesterday’s shenanigans.
Let’s get into it, shall we?
— Jack Kubinec

The Pump.fun exploit makes no sense 
Solana’s highest-grossing protocol by revenue was exploited for millions of dollars-worth yesterday, but no one seems particularly upset.
Pump.fun, the Solana memecoin app, lost nearly $2 million after a rogue employee with admin privileges used their access to the project’s withdrawal authority and a number of flash loans to buy up tokens. The employee then siphoned out the liquidity held in its bonding curve contracts, Pump.fun detailed in a postmortem Thursday evening. 
Usually, platforms being exploited creates pretty bad PR — both for the project, and in some cases, its underlying blockchain. 
That doesn’t seem to have been the case so far. Pump.fun redeployed its contracts and resumed trading the same day it was exploited, and DeFiLlama data shows the platform’s revenue was higher Thursday — the day of the exploit — than the day before. 
Pump.fun has been a big driver of Solana activity overall. The platform has been the highest-revenue protocol not named Ethereum over the past 30 days, hauling in $3 million more than DeFi heavyweight Uniswap Labs, according to DeFiLlama.
The app said on X that it was “working with some of the most esteemed security folks in the space,” but it didn’t say which esteemed security folks, and a representative for Pump.fun  declined to comment. The project’s code is still closed-source.
Solana investors also responded with a collective shrug to the exploit of Pump.fun. Solana traded mostly sideways throughout the day Thursday before climbing to a monthly high near $170 after Pump.fun released its postmortem, according to CoinGecko. Solana was trading at around $167 at press time, a level it hadn’t seen since April 12. 
Even the apparent exploiter, who took credit for the hack in a colorful series of X posts criticizing the Pump.fun team for mistreating them and custodying user funds, didn’t seem to garner much ill will from Solana’s community. They went on a series of X spaces Thursday afternoon where speakers broadly praised the exploiter’s actions. They’ve variously been compared to crypto’s Robin Hood or Edward Snowden. 
Sometimes markets aren’t all that rational, I guess, but also, as we have previously written regarding Pump.fun: “Sometimes, the grift is itself entertainment.”
If memecoins exist mainly for fun rather than for profit, then perhaps a memecoin platform being exploited isn’t so catastrophic — so long as the exploit was entertaining. And in this case, boy was it.

Another big week for Solana, with unique active programs increasing by 1,611 and total on-network instructions surging to nearly 4.6 billion. In other words, more developers are deploying and maintaining applications within the ecosystem, leading to higher computational demand. 
Concurrently, Solana surpassed Ethereum in daily transaction revenue on May 12, driven by a significant spike in fees. This surge provides further evidence of Solana’s ability to attract high-value transactions despite congestion. 
Although the increase in fees has raised concerns about potential deterrence in the past, we continue to see heightened demand for Solana-based services.

The Pulse
Island DAO kicks off today in Chania, Crete. But don’t be fooled by the name — it seems to be more of a coworking meetup than a decentralized autonomous organization. 
The event — aimed at apparently transforming a beachfront villa into a Solana coworking paradise — has sparked interest on social media as attendees arrive on the island. 
It might be good that the gathering seems to be mostly isolated to this one location, given that digital nomads are known to have a significant impact on the places they congregate. 
But for visitors who are true students of history, Crete will add a rich cultural backdrop to the gathering. The island is deeply connected to the ancient Minoan civilization, believed by some to have inspired Plato’s tales of Atlantis. In fact, locals claim the Atlantis story may recount a volcanic disaster that occurred on the nearby island of Thira, known today as Santorini (a theory that this editor wholeheartedly believes.)
This gathering is sure to be exciting for the Solana tribe, but it’s vital to tread lightly, preserving the island’s beauty and heritage. If DAO members are mindful of their impact, the island can remain a welcoming destination long into the future. Γεια μας!

Miners Eye Middle East as Next Region for Growth

“Compared to the U.S., the south of Oman has a few geopolitical advantages that are unique. It is very good for connections, as it’s next to submarine cables landing. It has, low [cost] electricity, reduced political risk, and favorable weather conditions for data centers,” said Olivier Ohnheiser, CEO of Green Data City, an Oman crypto-mining firm, told CoinDesk during Bitmain’s World Digital Mining Summit in Oman at the end of March.

MakerDAO Founder Unveils Two New Stablecoins - The Defiant

The new stablecoins are part of MakerDAO’s controversial Endgame plan and are intended to eventually replace DAI.Reconciling decentralization is the aim of MakerDAO’s endgame. At least according to the protocol’s founder, Rune Christensen.The latest phase of the Endgame was unveiled on May 15, when Christensen unveiled two new stablecoins: NewStable and PureDAI. Both tokens are meant to eventually replace DAI, which currently commands a $5.4 billion market cap, placing it in third overall for the sector.DAI Market Cap“From the moment Dai started scaling, it has been straddling two worlds,” wrote Christensen in a post titled Reconciling the two opposing paths for Decentralized Stablecoins. “One world is the culture of pure decentralization as introduced with Bitcoin. The other is the desire to fulfill the original purpose of DAI by delivering utility and value to real people at scale.”Christensen elaborated on the idea of the stablecoin trilemma, which claims that maintaining a stable peg while also being fully decentralized and scaling to large sizes, is not feasible.He promotes two options. The first prioritizes utility and scale by choosing a dollar peg backed by real-world assets (RWA) as collateral. The second, he wrote, demands complete independence from any sort of centralized control.With the unveiling of NewStable and PureDAI, achieving both is now possible, argues Christensen.What are NewStable and PureDAI?NewStable will be the main successor to DAI focused on growth, yield and resilience.However, its name will be revealed later this year once the new branding is complete. The token will take over the RWA aspect of MakerDAO (a sector that has been gaining significant traction over the past year) while remaining attached to Maker.It will introduce a novel freeze function “similar to the industry standard of other RWA-backed stablecoins,” although it will have to go through a governance process beforehand.Users wondering about DAI can sleep easy knowing that the token will continue to operate as is but can opt to be upgraded to NewStable.PureDAI and a Return to Ideological RootsAccording to Christensen, PureDAI is a return to the project’s ideological roots, one he says is supported by OG community members and cypherpunk idealists who continue to exist in the Ethereum space.In a lengthy May 17 post, he outlined how PureDAI will operate, although he let out a somewhat strange roadmap: the token won’t be ready to launch for years to come.Nevertheless, its main features include a free-floating target price, “only very decentralized” collateral through ETH and staked ETH (stETH), maximally decentralized oracles, minimal governance (no budgets or contributors), permanent location on Ethereum’s mainnet, and what he deems simple tokenomics that will promote stablecoin supply-side growth.Christensen also highlighted how PureDAI’s mechanics and tokenomics will work. An initial “genesis supply” of 2 billion PureDAI governance tokens — which calls into question its “minimal governance structure”— will be distributed in batches of 400 million over five years.Maker’s founder did explain, however, that there will be a burn mechanism for those governance tokens.What’s unique is that PureDAI offers the opportunity to experiment with tokenomics brought to life by Maker’s Endgame plan. The plan is to provide permanent emissions, which, according to Christensen, might support a greater level of PureDAI demand and growth without ever having to return to a negative rate.Christensen has called for the community to provide input about key features regarding other pure decentralized stablecoins, especially “observations about how their mechanics perform in the wild after launch.”

Crypto firms rally behind FIT21 bill approaching US House floor vote

Several cryptocurrency companies and advocacy groups urged United States lawmakers to support legislation clarifying the roles of the country’s financial regulators over digital assets.In a May 16 letter to the U.S. House of Representatives leadership, roughly 60 firms represented by the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) called on lawmakers to pass H.R.4763, or the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act. The bill, passed out of the House Financial Services Committee in July 2023, would clarify how the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulate digital assets.“We recognize that FIT 21 will introduce new compliance challenges for digital assets companies, but regulatory clarity is indisputably more responsible, safer for consumers, and preferable to the status quo,” said the CCI. “Currently, digital assets firms are instructed to somehow comply with U.S. securities laws that were designed nearly 100 years ago without consideration of the technological advances of today, including the ability for transactions to move at the speed of the internet.”Source: CCICoinbase, Circle, Block, Kraken, Gemini and Stand With Crypto were among the letter’s signees. The advocacy group urged U.S. voters to contact their representatives and support the bill.House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry said the FIT21 bill could be ready for a full floor vote “later this month” after consideration in the rules committee. This would give lawmakers roughly five days in session before June. Many lawmakers, including Representative French Hill, have already suggested they intend to vote in favor of the legislation.In the last ten days, the House and Senate passed a resolution to overturn an SEC rule on how banks are expected to handle digital assets. Though the legislation received bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress, U.S. President Joe Biden said he planned to veto it. Related: US stablecoin bill to ‘cement’ dollar dominance, fight sanction evasionAccording to digital asset advocate and Senator Cynthia Lummis, the resolution overturning the SEC rule was the first time this session of Congress passed “standalone crypto legislation.” It’s unclear whether lawmakers will follow suit in passing FIT21. The White House has not suggested whether President Biden will immediately sign the bill into law if passed by the House and Senate.The potential passage of the two crypto bills comes as the United States moves deeper into an election year. President Biden and former President Donald Trump, the presumptive candidates for the Democratic and Republican Parties in 2024, have agreed to two debates on June 27 and Sept. 10 in which crypto could be a topic of discussion.Magazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto

Analytics Company Announces Solana (SOL) Price Prediction for the End of May - Bitcoin Sistemi


Solana (SOL) has been at the forefront of the recent cryptocurrency market recovery, outperforming most major digital assets and is predicted to hit new cycle highs soon, according to one analyst.
On Friday, SOL reached $170, its highest price in more than a month, before pulling back slightly to $166. It has gained nearly 7% in the past 24 hours and is up over 40% from the crypto market's local lows in early May, when Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $56,000.


Daniel Choung, co-founder of digital asset hedge fund Syncracy Capital, praised SOL's resilience in a recent post. “The strength of SOL has been incredible in this bounce,” he said. “It's clear that this is still the best trade of this cycle.”

Choung expressed increased confidence that SOL could regain the $200 level by the end of the month and push new record levels soon. SOL reached an all-time high of $260 in November 2021 at the peak of the previous bull cycle.





Solana is currently benefiting from several catalysts, including active memecoin trading, strong stablecoin volumes, and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. Choung noted that upcoming network upgrades lay the groundwork for the highly anticipated Firedancer, a secondary chain client developed by Jump Crypto that aims to improve the performance of the network.

Bank Executive Embezzles $1,528,321, Steals Customers' Personal Information To Deploy False and Fictitious Loans: DOJ - The Daily Hodl


								A former bank executive is facing decades behind bars for abusing her position to embezzle more than a million dollars.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri says Stacia Wilson has pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud.










Wilson, who worked as vice president at St. Clair County State Bank in Osceola, Missouri, has admitted to defrauding the bank and its customers in a scheme to enrich herself to the tune of $1.528 million.
The FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation say Wilson exploited her authority as a loan processor to create false and fictitious loans using bank customers’ information without their knowledge and consent.
Prosecutors say that Wilson set up the loans using the bank’s computer systems before redirecting the funds for her own benefit.
Under the conditions of the plea agreement, Wilson is required to return the entirety of the funds that she stole to the government. She’s also facing a maximum of 30 years in prison without parole under federal statutes.
Wilson will be scheduled for sentencing after the United States Probation Office completes its pre-sentence investigation.
St. Clair County State Bank is a commercial bank with more than $200 million in assets.

It’s Almost Time For A Good Dogecoin Pump, Analyst Says | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo has laid out a bullish narrative for Dogecoin (DOGE). Based on his analysis, the foremost meme coin may make a parabolic run to the upside soon enough. The analyst also alluded to history to reaffirm that this rally will definitely happen. 
“It’s Almost Time” For A Good Dogecoin Pump
Crypto Kaleo remarked in an X (formerly Twitter) post that it is almost time for Dogecoin to rally significantly, as he stated that the foremost meme coin is “overdue for a good pump.” The crypto analyst made reference to a DOGE and GME chart while reminding his followers that it was GameStop “that led the way back in early 2021.” He claimed that it wasn’t until after GME topped that Dogecoin started pumping. 

Source: X
Indeed, the GameStop short squeeze is believed to have ushered in the meme season, leading to significant price surges for Dogecoin and other meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB). Besides Dogecoin’s correlation with GameStop, the analyst suggested that Dogecoin is also due to a pump because the “DOGE/BTC ratio still looks primed for a move higher.”
Source: X
As to when this Dogecoin rally is likely to happen, Kaleo mentioned that investors might have to “wait a few days, maybe a couple of weeks, for the Doge move to start” because he doesn’t think GME has topped yet. He also revealed that he is well positioned for this move as he has had “a bag for ages” and will continue accumulating the meme coin.
In the meantime, Kaleo remarked that a DOGE dip wouldn’t be surprising and might even be necessary for the imminent pump. He alluded to a Dogecoin pump in 2021 and noted that the meme coin retested a lower range before it eventually ripped that time, suggesting that a similar move could play out again this time around. Kaleo is also among crypto analysts who believe that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $1 in this bull run. 
A DOGE Breakout Is Near
Crypto analyst World of Charts recently noted that Dogecoin was on the verge of another breakout. According to him, a successful breakout will see the meme coin enjoy a 100% move as it rises to $0.3. Crypto analyst Jaydee also echoed a similar sentiment, highlighting DOGE’s monthly chart, which suggested that a breakout is imminent. Jaydee claimed that “Dogecoin will be life-changing for some very soon.”

Meanwhile, crypto analyst Crypto Scient predicted that a bullish reversal for DOGE could trigger a meme coin mania like the one in February. Going by Kaleo’s prediction, this meme coin mania could be similar to what happened in 2021, when meme coins enjoyed significant price surges after GameStop’s stock tops. 
At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.15, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

MakerDAO founder introduces new stablecoins: NewStable and PureDAI - Crypto Briefing

PureDAI, on the other hand, is positioned as a “return” to the project’s “ideological roots” supported by early community members and cypherpunk idealists. It will feature a free-floating target which “only very decentralized” participants can use as collateral through ETH and staked ETH (stETH).

‘Change Your Life With Crypto’: With Bitcoin (BTC) on the Rise, Analyst Breaks Down Altcoin Markets - The Daily Hodl


								One widely followed crypto analyst believes digital assets are on the precipice of a prosperous new era.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 718,500 followers on the social media platform X that better times are ahead for the markets.










“This might be the final easy rally to change your life with crypto. 
If you have survived this correction and are still here, congratulations.
The coming period is going to be great.”
With Bitcoin (BTC) up 10% in the last week, Van de Poppe says that the $61,000 price zone has become the support for BTC’s next rally.
“Crucial level has flipped for Bitcoin at $60,500-$61,000.
It’s likely that the momentum will continue from here and the trend has switched.
As a response, altcoins are running up substantially as confidence comes back in.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is worth $67,276 at time of writing, up 2.5% on the day.
As the altcoin markets follow Bitcoin’s lead, the analyst points out one notable exception: the leading altcoin by market cap, Ethereum (ETH).
“Altcoins are waking up already, the only one lacking behind is ETH.
On edge of a reversal here, as the dominance chart is facing a higher timeframe resistance + multiple big events are coming up for Ethereum with the exchange-traded fund and the lawsuits.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
ETH is trading for $3,111 at time of writing, up 5.5% in the last 24 hours.

Santiment Announced: Sentiment For This Altcoin Reaches Levels Not Seen In 1 Year - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to analysis company Santiment, the price of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency in terms of market value, surprisingly rose above 67 thousand dollars today.
In addition to Bitcoin's rise, Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts on the blockchain, has also been very bullish for over a year. According to Santiment, the FOMO index for LINK remains low, which could help these rallies continue.


According to Santiment data, sentiment for Chainlink has reached its highest level in the last year.

In related news, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world's largest securities settlement system, has successfully completed a pilot project with Chainlink and several major US financial institutions. The project, called “Smart NAV”, aimed to accelerate the tokenization of funds.





Market participants included American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street and US Bank.

Alarming USDT Hints from the Second Largest Cryptocurrency Exchange in the US - "We May Remove" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Kraken is actively evaluating plans that could lead to the removal of support for Tether (USDT), the world's most traded cryptocurrency, from its platform in the European Union.
This comes in line with a new regulatory legislation for digital assets that will be implemented in the EU in July.


Tether USDT, a stablecoin designed to maintain parity with the US dollar, is expected to be affected by upcoming EU regulations known as MiCA. These guidelines of the European Banking Authority, which have not yet been finalized, will impose restrictions on stablecoins offered to investors in member countries.
Marcus Hughes, Kraken's Head of Global Regulatory Strategy, said in a recent interview: “We are certainly planning for all possibilities, including situations where it may not be appropriate to list certain tokens like USDT. This is something we are actively looking at and will be firm on this as the situation becomes clearer.” We can make decisions.”





In response to Kraken's comments, Tether stated that while it expects USDT to remain an option for entering and exiting the market, it expects exchanges to focus on EUR liquidity for European customers.

OKX, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, modified trading support for USDT in the EU this year and removed the ability to use stablecoins to buy or sell other crypto assets. However, on the exchange, European users can continue to deposit or withdraw USDT assets, conduct over-the-counter transactions, and exchange them for Euros.


European regulators are nearing completion of technical guidance for MiCA, which is expected to be fully implemented by 2025.
“This is an evolving picture. What we are clear about is that it is not possible to present the scope of the type and number of stablecoins offered in Europe today going forward,” Hughes said. said.

It has now been over a month since it was revealed that Uniswap Labs UNI/USD had received a Wells Notice, indicating the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission intends to bring charges against the developers of the largest decentralized exchange. Many people considered this the true start to the "war on DeFi" since it's the first case being brought against a major DeFi platform. While it's no secret the SEC has an unfavorable view of crypto, its previous big-name targets have typically been centralized entities.Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Macro Continues to be a Key Driver for Crypto: Coinbase - Coinbase Glb (NASDAQ:COIN) - Benzinga

The macro environment continues to be a key driver for crypto performance, according to a Coinbase COIN report. Analysts David Han and David Duong cited the rebound in Bitcoin BTC/USD prices following the softer CPI print for April as evidence of a macro-led driver in the sector. "Macro continues to be a key driver for crypto performance. The 3.4% year-on-year inflation figure is consistent with our out-of-consensus view that we're still operating within a disinflationary trend that could take inflation growth to within the mid-two handle by year-end" Han and Duong said.Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Does the SAB 121 Vote Mean Anything for Future Crypto Legislation?

Unfortunately however, the legislative measure is now heading to the desk of President Joseph Biden, who has vowed to veto it in a show of solidarity with the SEC. Although a number of high profile Democrats, including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, voted in favor of overturning the bulletin, the Senate’s 60 to 38 vote on Thursday failed to cross the threshold to override a presidential veto.

Chainlink & DTCC Unite to Modernize TradFi Infrastructure - DailyCoin


        

Chainlink teams up with major US banks to pilot improvements to TradFi investing infrastructure.



The program explored using blockchain technology to improve data dissemination. 



This provided a proof of concept on innovative use cases for the investment sector.




The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) offers critical TradFi infrastructure in clearing and settlement services for US investment firms. The entity processes trillions of daily transactions, underpinning the TradFi investment market. As blockchain technologies continue gaining traction, DTCC has recognized its potential for enhancing its core services and operational efficiencies.



One area the firm has been focused on is its Mutual Fund Profile Service I (MFPS I) system, which offers a standardized way for transmitting price and rate data, including net asset value (NAV) and dividend distribution data. Seeking to improve this process, DTCC recently launched the Smart NAV pilot, in conjunction with Chainlink, to explore enhanced data dissemination capabilities.



Tapping Chainlink Technology 



The Smart NAV pilot aimed to improve MFPS I’s data dissemination capabilities. Current processes for calculating and distributing NAV data are complex, manual, and riddled with inefficiencies. The need to bring MFPS I processes into the 21st century is all the more pressing considering the investment fund industry’s massive size and global assets under management’s expected reach of $145 trillion by 2025.




To tackle these challenges, the Smart NAV pilot brought together DTCC, Chainlink, and ten major financial institutions, including BNY Mellon, JPMorgan, and Invesco, to name a few. The goal was to utilize Chainlink’s blockchain technology to assess the feasibility of enhancing efficiencies and bringing more streamlined operations to the existing MFPS I platform.



How Smart NAV Worked



The Smart NAV pilot improved the existing MFPS I platform’s data dissemination by using a modern JSON data structure, wrapping it into a blockchain transaction secured by DTCC’s private cryptographic keys, and relaying it via Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP). 



The CCIP transmitted data loads across multiple blockchains, including DTCC’s private Ethereum blockchain. On this network, a smart contract system verified DTCC as the authorized and permissioned publisher before securely storing the on-chain NAV data in a decentralized manner. With the data made available on-chain, clients could consume and leverage the information.




Leveraging the information included using real-time APIs that pushed data updates to connected systems, smart contract models such as tokenized fund contracts directly inheriting the NAV data, and “bulk consumer” contracts representing baskets of multiple funds’ data. 



This enabled streamlined, automated dissemination of investment data while demonstrating powerful new ways to leverage the on-chain data for investment applications.



The Pilot’s Findings



The Smart NAV pilot demonstrated how delivering structured investment data on blockchain and establishing clear roles and processes governed by smart contracts enabled a wide variety of innovative use cases for investment applications.



By bringing pricing and distribution data on-chain in a standard, accessible format, Smart NAV opened the door for imaginative new applications and services leveraging the investment data flows. 



The pilot showcased the capability for real-time, fully automated dissemination of NAV and rate updates, a massive improvement over the sluggish manual processes of the existing system. It also provided built-in access to complete historical records, a previously unavailable capability.



The success of the Smart NAV pilot also laid the groundwork for DTCC and its partners to explore additional use cases, such as triggering automated workflow events and enabling asset managers to publish data directly to smart contracts without requiring a centralized hub.

Crypto Industry Relieved as Wallet Drainer Bites the Dust - DailyCoin


        

Notorious crypto wallet drainer Pink Drainer is shutting operations.



Pink Drainer caused a significant portion of the losses suffered by investors last year.



Wallet trainers are widely utilized by malicious actors, and several others still plague the industry.




Phishing scams are among the most weaponized forms of fraud in the crypto industry, often perpetrated by crypto wallet drainers who target unsuspecting victims. Last year, nearly 350,000 individuals fell victim to these schemes, collectively incurring losses totaling up to $295 million.



In a surprising turn of events, one of the most notorious drainers is stepping out of the ring.



Pink Drainer Bids Bye to Crypto: Is It True?



In a message flagged by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT on Friday, May 17, 2024, the group behind Pink Drainer, which stole funds to the tune of $85 million from thousands of crypto investors, announced the finalization of its operations, bidding farewell to the industry.




The message, posted on a Telegram channel, stated that the group would completely wind down its operations following publication and destroy all stored information.





Celebrating its growth, the Drainer expressed gratitude to its supporters, although ironic considering the extensive losses the group inflicted on the industry. Pink Drainer did not depart without offering some “words of wisdom” to its victims.



“If you have enough money right now to financially support yourself, we advise you to hold onto it and take a step back from the grind and enjoy what this world has to offer. Life is too short to get caught in the perpetual cycle of needlessly spending, going broke, and trying to make it back,” the message stated.



While the group asserted the finality of its decision by cautioning, “beware of impersonators; we are not planning on returning in the future,” the crypto industry remains vulnerable to similar threats from other drainers.



Crypto Wallet Drainers Plague



According to the January analysis by Web3 security platform Scam Sniffer, several wallet drainers are responsible for deploying crypto-related malware on phishing websites to grant threat actors unauthorized access to unsuspecting users’ accounts.




In addition to Pink Drainer, which announced its exit, other notorious ones include Inferno Drainer, MS Drainer, Angel Drainer, Monkey Drainer, and Venom Drainer.





Inferno Drainer and Monkey Drainer reportedly orchestrated some of the most notable heists of 2023 before their exposure, siphoning off over $81 million and $16 million over months, respectively. 



Many of these malicious groups continue to lurk in the industry’s shadows, becoming adept at circumventing promotion guidelines on trusted social media platforms like Google and Twitter, which enables them to promote malicious URLs to a broader range of investors for selfish gain.

Tether's USDT Faces Potential Delisting From Kraken's Platform Within 2 Months: Details | Bitcoinist.com


								In a move that could have significant implications for the global cryptocurrency market, the US-based crypto exchange Kraken is “actively reviewing” plans, including removing support for Tether’s USDT stablecoin within the European Union (EU).
The potential delisting comes as the EU prepares to implement a new regulatory framework, Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), set to take effect in July. According to a Bloomberg report, the upcoming EU rules are expected to impact USDT, the world’s most-traded cryptocurrency.
Kraken Considers Tether’s USDT Delisting In Europe
MiCA, which the European Banking Authority (EBA) is still finalizing, will restrict the sale of stablecoins to EU investors. 

Traders widely use stablecoins like USDT to move digital assets between exchanges or to store wealth away from token price volatility. Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, stated:
We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT. It’s something that we’re actively reviewing, and as the position becomes clearer, we can take firm decisions on that.
Tether, the issuer of USDT, acknowledged Kraken’s remarks, stating that the firm expects exchanges to “rightfully focus on EUR liquidity for European customers while maintaining USDT as an on-ramp off-ramp solution.” 
However, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, has previously expressed concerns about certain aspects of MiCA’s requirements, and the company has no plans to be regulated under the new rules in the medium term. 
The potential delisting of USDT on Kraken’s European platform follows a similar move by another major crypto exchange, OKX, which removed EU users’ ability to buy or sell other cryptocurrencies using USDT earlier this year. Hughes further claimed:
It’s an evolving picture. What we’re clear on is that the scope of the type and number of stablecoins that are offered today in Europe are unlikely to be able to be offered going forward. At some point in the future, there’ll be a cut off at which that won’t be possible.
Kraken Evaluates European HQ Options
For further context, the upcoming MiCA regulations will require issuers of asset-referenced and e-money tokens, like USDT, to hold a license from a national financial authority in at least one EU member state by June 30. 
Issuers will also be mandated to meet “higher standards” on corporate governance, conflicts of interest, and reserve management, such as holding at least a third of all funds at an independent credit institution.

Per the report, as Kraken navigates the changing regulatory landscape, the exchange is also in the “advanced stages” of selecting its post-MiCA European headquarters, with France and Ireland emerging as popular destinations among its rivals, such as Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini.
However, if Kraken moves forward with delisting Tether’s USDT stablecoin from its European platform, it could have significant implications for the exchange’s users and customers in the EU. 
Kraken’s European customers would no longer be able to directly trade or transact using USDT, potentially leading to decreased liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads, increased price volatility, and lower trading volumes. 
This could create inconvenience and disruption for customers accustomed to using Tether’s stablecoin, as they may need to explore alternative stablecoins like Circle’s USDC or fiat on-ramps, adding complexity to their cryptocurrency transactions.

One Week to Go Until the Big Day: Analysts Update Expectations for Ethereum Spot ETF Decision - Bitcoin Sistemi

Investment companies eager to introduce the first ETFs based on Ethereum face potential disappointment. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet indicated it is ready to approve such products.
After months of silence, the US regulator is expected to announce its decision next week on at least one application for an ETF that invests directly in Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Some fund companies are expecting a rejection, citing less robust private dialogues with the SEC than before the approval of spot-Bitcoin ETFs in January.


In the weeks leading up to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, fund companies submitted multiple versions of revised paperwork to address the SEC's concerns, a process that significantly contributed to their final approval. However, spot ETH ETF filings have seen much less activity.
“Most people generally expect a rejection,” said Katherine Dowling, general counsel at Bitwise, which filed for a spot ETH ETF in March. and added: “You're not seeing the kind of public activity that you would see if there were to be an approval.”






The SEC, which postponed decisions on fund applications for several months, has until May 23 to approve or reject VanEck's application. ETH's value fell nearly 20% in April as approval hopes faded.
“If the SEC doesn't approve ETH ETFs now, it may be because the line the SEC has drawn is that they won't approve any spot crypto product without an actual court order,” said Jeremy Senderowicz, an attorney specializing in investment services at law firm Vedder Price.


Whatever the outcome, for the first time the SEC will provide significant public information about its position on spot Ether ETFs. Even among issuers who are pessimistic about the regulator approving the product, this is seen as a ray of hope as it will give a concrete idea about the regulator's thoughts on these products.

Most are scams/pump-and-dumps.Brett (BRETT)An Ethereum copycat version of popular Solana meme coin Brett (BRETT) is pumping hard, up 200% on Friday.As per DEXScreener, its market cap was last around $4.6 million with $260,000 in locked liquidity.Go+ Security identifies two smart contract issues, a blacklist and a white list.Amaterasu Omikami (OMIKAMI)An old meme coin called Amaterasu Omikami (OMIKAMI), that was launched back in 2022, is coming back strong on Friday.After gaining over 60% in 24 hours and 250% in two days, OMIKAMI has reached a $10 million market cap.The token currently has $440,000 in locked liquidity, and is unlikely to be a scam given how old it is.Better Crypto Alternatives to Consider
Trading new meme coins is fraught with risk. Sure, some of these coins might 100x or more.But traders are very unlikely to get in right at the bottom. And the vast majority of coins will fall flat, with investors unlikely to be able to find the liquidity to sell.Moreover, the meme coin market’s fast price action tends to trigger FOMO in traders. They often neglect to do the required due diligence.A potentially better alternative to investing in just-launched meme coins is to invest in presales.Here, traders have more time to research a project and see if it is a good fit for them.If investors are able to reliably identify projects that gain traction, they can make big gains.With so many presales out there vying for invest funds, it can be tough to know where to start.That’s why analysts at Cryptonews keep a close eye on the presale market.

                        Oklahoma passed a bill on May 13 to protect the rights of its residents to self-custody their digital assets.The legislation, known as OKHB3594, was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt and sponsored by four Republicans: State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard.The bill prohibits any restrictions or bans on using self-custody or hardware wallets to store digital assets, which ensures that individuals in Oklahoma have the freedom to control and safeguard their own digital assets without interference from third parties.The legislation also allows Oklahomans to engage in both home-based and industrial crypto mining as long as they comply with local noise ordinances.Self-Custody Bill to Go into Effect This November
The digital asset self-custody bill will go into effect on November 1, 2024.One notable provision of the bill is the exemption of crypto miners from obtaining a money transmitter license.This means that individuals involved in home digital asset mining or running digital asset mining businesses, as well as those engaged in staking or staking as a service, are not required to acquire a license typically associated with financial transactions.Additionally, the bill outlaws discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses, ensuring fair treatment in terms of energy costs.The legislation also addresses the use of digital assets as a payment method.Oklahoma residents can utilize cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services without being subjected to additional taxes, withholdings, assessments, or charges imposed solely because of the use of digital assets in transactions.Dennis Porter, the CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, emphasized the bill’s importance in protecting fundamental Bitcoin rights.“Without the ability to manage our wealth, we lose control of our destiny and the chance to create better futures for our families,” he wrote in a post on X. “This law ensures that everyone can secure not only their [bitcoin] but all their assets.”Countries Consider Crypto Seizure for Tax Evasion
Countries worldwide are increasingly considering confiscating crypto assets for debt collection from taxpayers.South Korean tax officials in the city of Pohang revealed plans to seize crypto from 5,208 residents who failed to pay local taxes.Per local reports, the individuals have all evaded local tax bills worth $370 or above.The drive saw tax officials seize almost $29 million in coins and fiat in 2023.Likewise, the Spanish Ministry of Finance wants to enable the seizure of digital assets to settle tax debts.Under the leadership of María Jesús Montero, the ministry is currently working on legislative reforms to the General Tax Law.The proposed changes would grant the Spanish Tax Agency the authority to identify and control crypto assets owned by taxpayers with outstanding debts.

                        Sam Trabucco, the co-CEO of Alameda Research, has spoken out in support of FTX executive Ryan Salame ahead of his sentencing on May 28, according to an updated May 14 court filing.In a character reference for the former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO, Trabucco described Salame as an “affable” and “complex” person who “doesn’t deserve to be defined by his worst actions.”Alameda Research’s Sam Trabucco Defends FTX Exec Ryan Salame
“Simply put, Ryan is my best friend. He has also committed crimes,” Trabucco wrote. “He’s acknowledged that and is prepared to accept the consequences.”Trabucco further said that he had hoped Salame would receive a “fair” sentence in relation to the digital asset scandal, referring to him as a “sought-after employee in the crypto space.”Salame, who recently requested a sentencing length of eighteen months in prison, pled guilty to conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting license and conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions back in September 2023.Salame has largely distanced himself from the doomed crypto exchange, with lawyers for the FTX executive arguing that he had limited knowledge of the company’s $8 billion fraud scheme.“As was true for thousands of other FTX employees, customers, investors, and lenders, Ryan lost years of hard work and nearly his entire net worth almost instantaneously,” the court filing read. “Ryan, who was not part of Sam Bankman-Fried’s innermost circle, was unaware of the crimes at the center of this case.”Salame In Hot Water Over SBF Political Donations, Faces Prison Time
Salame’s unlawful political contributions charge stems from over 300 secret donations totaling tens of millions of dollars made by Bankman-Fried, with the willing participation of the former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO and the company’s Head of Engineering, Nishad Singh.Prosecutors allege Bankman-Fried, who is currently serving 25 years in prison for orchestrating the fraud scheme, used the straw donor scheme to levy influence and power to pro-crypto politicians.Of course, these donations were largely funded by FTX customers’ money, which Bankman-Fried stole and used to fund venture investments, real estate purchases, and more while claiming investors’ funds were safe.“He built a pyramid of deceit on a foundation of lies and false promises,” U.S. prosecutors claimed during SBF’s trial. “And when it collapsed, it left a trail of destruction in its wake.”Salame’s sentencing will take place at Manhattan federal court on May 28 at 11 a.m. He is facing a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

FLOKI To Burn 15.2B Coins, Solidifying Bullish Pennant Setup - DailyCoin


        

The FLOKI coin community chooses to burn $3.2M worth of FLOKI tokens.



FLOKI briefly ranked as the #1 altcoin by combining social and trading activity.



Analysts mark FLOKI’s bullish pennant, reinforcing new all-time high hopes.




A new proposal by FLOKI’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) suggests burning 15,246,000,000 excessive FLOKI tokens. The Floki burning proposal quickly gained traction among community members, who have almost unanimously voted to implement it.



According to the results, 99.84% of voters agreed to burn the 15.2B Floki coins, as the proposal overviewed the previous three burns initiated by Floki DAO. Back in July 2022, the Floki community had a vote on whether or not to burn the excessive tokens recovered from a blacklisted wallet, while another 4.97T Floki coins were burned by the community’s decision in January 2023.







Further, Floki holders voted to burn another 190B FLOKI coins in February 2024, retrieved from the multi-chain bridge. Notably, the latest FLOKI DAO burning campaign has fewer Floki coins than the first three DAO-initiated burns.




However, the deed aligns with FLOKI’s goal to remain a deflationary cryptocurrency fully controlled by the community’s decisions. According to the proposal’s description, the burns will be executed one week after approval.



FLOKI Crowned The New Social Champion



Along with the upcoming $3.2 million FLOKI burn, the Viking horn-themed canine cryptocurrency has recently shown a remarkable record in combined social and trading activity. LunarCrush, a social blockchain data enterprise that closely tracks the sentiment surrounding the most talked-about cryptocurrencies, calculates this unique metric.







Since last week, FLOKI has championed the social on-chain metrics with a steady increase in social mentions, trading volume, and FLOKI’s market price simultaneously. LunarCrush spotted the beginning of this trend on May 11, 2024, as the Viking dog-themed crypto climbed the social intelligence company’s rankings.




Starting at the #977 position on May 11, 2024, FLOKI continued its social dominance to claim the #1 position in LunarCrush’s AltRank by May 15, 2024. That day, Floki embarked on a 23% bull run to claim a new monthly peak at $0.0002265, according to CoinGecko.



Bullish Pennant To Stir Up A New Peak?



As Floki’s bullish momentum escalates, traders are looking for validation of FLOKI’s bullish pennant status. A pennant is a continuation pattern formed by a flagpole and followed by converging trend lines, signaling a phased consolidation period. The pennant is then followed by a breakout in the same direction as the initial large price movement.







According to crypto analyst World Of Charts, Floki broke the bullish pennant in a 12-hour time frame on May 13, 2024. This price movement showcases a 120% to 130% bull run potential, World Of Charts claims. If that’s the case, FLOKI could erupt into a new all-time high. 



As of press time, FLOKI is changing hands at $0.0002122, with a 2.2% increase over the past 24 hours. Still 37.7% down from the all-time peak, FLOKI maintains a bullish stance with 57.7% monthly gains.



On the Flipside




Other key on-chain indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) index, gave mixed signals.



To illustrate the ambiguity, the CMF index, used to define large holder interest, was slightly negative at -0.06.



Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was completely neutral at 50, neither oversold nor overbought.

Is Avalanche (AVAX) Set for Consolidation?


Avalanche’s (AVAX) price is expected to remain consolidated owing to the lack of substantial growth expected from the altcoin.
AVAX holders also exhibit a selling sentiment since short-term investors dominate the supply.
Avalanche Investors Look to Sell

Avalanche’s price could soon observe the impact of investors’ behavior; the supply is dominated by short-term holders known to hold their supply for one month or less. 
This makes their holdings susceptible to selling. In the case of AVAX, nearly 28% of all circulating AVAX is in their hands. Forty percent of the AVAX is still held by mid-term investors who hold their assets for over a month and less than a year.
However, 28% still makes up for over 107 million AVAX, making these investors a major threat to Avalanche’s price.
Avalanche Supply Distribution. Source: IntoTheBlock

Secondly, Avalanche’s price will face significant resistance owing to a massive demand barrier. According to the Global In/Out of the Money indicator (GIOM), about 12.47 million AVAX await profits. This supply was bought at an average price of $38, making it worth over $473 million.
This would require strong bullish cues, as AVAX would have to push to $42 to ascertain absolute and complete profits. However, considering the market conditions, this may not happen.
Read More: How To Buy Avalanche (AVAX) and Everything You Need To Know

As a result, Avalanche’s price will fall back down.
AVAX Price Prediction: Consolidation Ahead
Avalanche’s price, $36, has rallied 15% in the past three days, pulling it up from $31. The latter marked the lower limit of the consolidation range AVAX has been stuck in for a month. The upper limit stands at $39.

The altcoin has attempted to break out of this consolidation nearly three times in the last month but has failed each time. Even during this week’s rally, AVAX only made it halfway. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency has been unable to invalidate the death cross that occurred over six weeks ago.
The bearish influence will continue until the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crosses over the 200-day EMA. As a result, Avalanche’s price will likely remain consolidated until the end of the month.

However, the bullish thesis could be invalidated if the winds shift and AVAX investors opt not to sell but push forward instead. AVAX would need to break out of the consolidation and flip $39 into support.

Vitalik Addresses MEV and Decentralization Concerns | Bankless


Today, Vitalik Buterin published a new blog post outlining strategies to enhance Ethereum’s “permissionlessness and decentralization.” The post was inspired by Geth core developer Péter Szilágyi’s concerns on maximal extractable value (MEV) and the specter of centralization. What's the context?In a May 16 Twitter thread, Szilágyi argued the Ethereum community has prioritized vested interests and quick fixes over the protocol’s integrity. He decried the acceptance of MEV, liquid staking, and increasing hardware requirements as leading to centralization and making Ethereum similar to traditional financial systems, leading to a wider debate with Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist.tl;dr of Vitalik’s ResponseIn his new May 17 post, Buterin said these were “valid concerns” but asserted the situation wasn’t “anywhere near as hopeless as Peter’s tweets imply.” He emphasized that many of these issues were already being addressed through ongoing protocol improvements and roadmap tweaks, including:MEV minimization — Promoting MEV-free apps like CoW Swap and implementing encrypted mempools to prevent front-running attacksMEV quarantining — Using proposer/builder separation (PBS) and inclusion lists to limit the power to exclude transactionsVerkle trees and EIP-4444 — For reducing hardware requirements, expanding validator sets, and improving node operation efficiency and storage requirementsButerin concluded by acknowledging past over-reliance on “large-scale actors,” but added that Ethereum has shifted considerably toward true decentralization in recent years and that while there is plenty of work left to do, the ongoing progress is promising. Bankless take:It would be a travesty for Ethereum to turn into a captured TradFi-like behemoth, yet as Buterin pointed out in his new post, the network has moved considerably away from this specter through various ongoing development efforts, and with no signs of slowing down here.Of course, it will take years for Ethereum to complete the full arc of its decentralization journey, but the wait will be worth the end result: a remarkably robust base layer that can “hyper-scale” in all directions with Layer 2 (L2) networks. This vision is best realized by focusing on decentralization now, not later.

Market Overly Bearish on ETH ETF Odds: Coinbase Institutional | Bankless


The ETH/BTC ratio may have just set a new multi-year low amid depressed sentiment on the odds of spot ETH ETF approval next Thursday, but Coinbase Institutional believes that Ether has the potential to surprise to the upside in the second half of 2024!What’s the scoop?Underpriced Approval Odds: While the Polymarket implied odds of ETF approval currently stand at just 10%, Coinbase Institutional sees a 30-40% chance of approval considering crypto has increasingly become an election topic. The Biden Administration’s SEC may be unwilling to expend political capital on a denial.Layer 2 Boon: Leading L2s now constitute 17% of aggregate DEX volumes, and are acting as massive ETH sinks, helping drive demand for ETH as a monetary asset, meanwhile Arbitrum and Base have seen explosive growth in stablecoin supply.Staker Support: ETH has been inflationary for over a month, but the growth in staked ETH has vastly outpaced the rate of issuance and stakers are not structurally forced to sell ETH to support operations, like BTC miners.Ethereum’s Edge: Ether’s usage across Ethereum-native DeFi, the ecosystem’s consistent drive to decentralize, a rapid pace of L2 innovation, the proliferation of the EVM, and L1 blockspace demand to tokenize real world assets are all long term strengths could allow Ethereum to retain dominance.  Bankless Take:Crypto has increasingly become an election issue, but only because the Biden Administration has taken a clear stance against the industry, making it unrealistic that the SEC of this hostile administration would approve spot ETH ETFs solely based on political concerns.The SEC’s October approval of ETH ETFs holding commodity futures suggests that the SEC viewed Ether as a non-security at that time, indicating spot instruments should receive approval on May 23 despite the overwhelming amount of evidence to the contrary. Although ETH sentiment is low, an unexpected approval likely reverses the tide; alternatively, a denial likely lays out the SEC’s case for why Ether is a security and could cause problems for alts.

Telegram Founder Pavel Durov Says He’ll Hold $7 Million Notcoin Gift Until 100x - Decrypt

Notcoin users were feeling generous ahead of Thursday’s NOT token launch, as over half a million players of the viral Telegram-based clicker game donated a share of their in-game coins to Telegram founder Pavel Durov. Now that haul is worth millions of dollars—and Durov says he’s holding for a potential 100x gain.More than 552,000 players of Notcoin donated a share of their in-game coins to Durov back in February, part of an effort by the Notcoin team—called Open Builders—to thank the Telegram founder for the messaging app that houses the crypto game.Ultimately, Durov ended up with over 1.03 billion NOT tokens, or just over 1% of the total Notcoin supply on The Open Network (TON). That’s worth about $7.3 million as of this writing, but was a bit lower at $6.8 million when Durov posted earlier Friday.Durov, who’s estimated to have a $15.5 billion fortune by Forbes, hardly needs the cash. And he’s not selling. But should the NOT token surge in value, he says he’d sell them to ultimately better support Telegram.“Half a million Notcoin users gifted me $6.8 million worth of Notcoin! Thank you,” Durov wrote on Telegram. “I will hold these coins until they turn to $680 million, at which point I will use them to buy more servers for Telegram.”Notcoin is this year’s biggest gaming token launch so far, debuting at a market cap of nearly $1.5 billion early Thursday. New cryptocurrencies are often volatile, and indeed, NOT has plunged in value since the debut—dropping by 50% to a current price just above $0.007, according to CoinMarketCap.Even so, NOT is the 101st most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap at $746 million, and racked up more than $1 billion worth of trading volume in its first 24 hours after launch.Notcoin paused its coin-tapping gameplay in April to prepare for the token rollout, but it set to relaunch its crypto-earning game—and ultimately serve as a platform for additional games in an effort to become the “Netflix of social, viral games,” co-creator Sasha Plotvinov told Decrypt’s GG in April.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Ethereum price rallies above $3.1K after unexpected regulatory victory

Ether (ETH) price rose by 5.5% on May 17, nearing $3,100 for the first time in 10 days. Analysts attributed this rally to a decrease in demand for fixed-income instruments following stagnant United States retail sales data in April. This data increased the market’s expectation of a potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve to boost the economy.Expansionary measures by the central bank are typically seen as bullish for risk-on markets, whether due to an increased monetary supply or reduced credit costs for businesses and individuals. Investors sought exposure to scarce assets, including cryptocurrencies, leading to gold reaching $2,410, just 0.8% below its all-time high.A court ruling gave Ether investors a confidence boostEther’s surge was also driven by a U.S. Department of Justice indictment unsealed on May 15. The indictment accused two individuals of wire fraud and money laundering by manipulating the Ethereum blockchain. The document stated that “Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain […] without the need for a trusted intermediary” and added, “No central actor runs the Ethereum Network.”Additionally, the court noted that Ethereum smart contracts enable transactions without a trusted intermediary. These statements boosted Ether investors’ confidence, especially after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Wells notice to the trading platform Robinhood on May 4 over alleged securities violations related to crypto listings and custodian operations.According to Orlando Cosme, founder and CEO of Lexproof, such a verdict contradicts regulators’ classification of ETH as a security, “as there would be no management or entrepreneurial efforts of others.” While this analysis does not change the approval odds of U.S. spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it certainly lifted investors’ spirits.The U.S. SEC is expected to provide its final ruling on VanEck’s spot Ether ETF request on March 23 and rule on the conversion of Grayscale’s ETHE fund by June 18. Although analysts predict approval odds below 35%, the regulators’ case for classifying Ether as a security instrument has weakened, which might have contributed to the rally above $3,050 on May 17.Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko praised Ethereum’s network security, highlighting how coordinating “an invalid state transition or double spend attack” would be nearly impossible. In a May 17 post, Yakovenko added that layer-2 scaling reduced costs without compromising security due to the network’s large number of validators and operators.In short, investors realized that whatever setbacks Ethereum faced, including high transaction fees and its lackluster efforts to increase scalability, were, in fact, decisions that prioritized security and decentralization. Meanwhile, competitors Solana and BNB Chain opted for solutions that allowed a higher processing capacity, regardless of the merits of increasing dependency on fewer entities.Ethereum network’s dominance remains undisputedEthereum’s strength becomes evident when analyzing its dominance in decentralized application (DApp) activity. The growth of layer-2 solutions such as Base, which quickly gained traction due to its low fees and integration with the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, further reinforces Ethereum’s ability to become a global settlement layer.Top blockchains ranked by 30-day Dapps volumes, USD. Source: DappRadarEthereum’s $181.5 billion in DApp volume over 30 days is more than seven times larger than its direct competitor, BNB Chain. More importantly, this volume declined merely 3% compared to the previous month, while BNB Chain and Solana experienced 52% and 41% decreases in volume, respectively.Related: U.S. Senate passes resolution overturning SEC crypto rule on banksAnalyzing unique active addresses engaging with DApps yields similar results, with Ethereum gaining 3% in 30 days while BNB Chain and Solana faced steep declines. Highlights from the Ethereum network include Balancer, which saw a 34% volume increase in 30 days, Morpho Optimizers, which gained 80%, and DODO, with a 61% volume boost.In essence, even if the U.S. spot Ether ETF approval odds remain low, investors are realizing that the network’s dominance in the DApp ecosystem remains unaffected. This realization contributed to the ETH price gains on May 17. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Is Tether Minting $1 Billion USDT a Sign of Upcoming Surge? - DailyCoin


        

Bitcoin’s price has surged past $66,000 coinciding with positive news on inflation.



Tether has minted billions of tokens, fueling speculation about its impact on Bitcoin’s price.



Stablecoin holdings on exchanges have surged, raising liquidity and potentially increasing market volatility.




The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of renewed life as Bitcoin surges past $66,000, coinciding with positive news on the US inflation front. This rally comes alongside a significant rise in stablecoin holdings on crypto exchanges, potentially setting the stage for a broader market upswing.



Stablecoin Supply on the Rise



Data from Lookonchain reveals that Tether, a major stablecoin issuer, minted an additional $1 billion worth of USDT tokens just 13 hours ago. This follows a trend of increased minting throughout the past month, with Tether’s market cap rising from $108 billion to over $111 billion. 







In total, Tether has minted a staggering 31 billion USDT tokens over the past year, potentially fueling the rise in Bitcoin’s price from $27,000 to $73,000. 




This trend extends beyond Tether. According to Woominkyu on CryptoQuant, a market analysis firm, there has been a recent surge in overall stablecoin inflows, suggesting a significant influx of fresh capital entering the cryptocurrency market. 



This increased liquidity has the potential to significantly impact Bitcoin’s price dynamics, with the possibility of heightened volatility as supply and demand forces adjust.



Bitcoin in a Consolidation Phase



While the influx of stablecoins suggests a potential market rally, cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo believes Bitcoin is currently in a “warm-up phase” within its liquidity cycle. Woo points out that Bitcoin is consolidating below its all-time highs, indicating a period of relatively low long-term risk for investors. 







He highlights that significant market activity tends to correlate with increased risk, suggesting the current phase offers a degree of stability. The combined factors of a rising Bitcoin price, increased stablecoin holdings, and a cautious yet optimistic market outlook paint a picture of a crypto market preparing for potential growth. 




While future volatility is a possibility, the current trends suggest a market primed for further movement. Overall, the rise in stablecoin activity injects optimism into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts like Woo caution that Bitcoin’s price may experience volatility as the market absorbs this influx of liquidity.



On the Flipside




While a rise in stablecoins can signal new investment, it can also indicate investors seeking to hedge their bets or move capital out of riskier assets.



A downturn in traditional markets could still impact the crypto market, even with an influx of stablecoins.



The rise in stablecoin supply might not directly cause a sustained Bitcoin price increase.




Why This Matters



The surge in stablecoin holdings, particularly Tether’s minting of new tokens, coincides with Bitcoin’s price rise and suggests a potential influx of fresh capital. This increased liquidity could fuel a broader market upswing but also heighten volatility as supply and demand forces adjust within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

All Bitcoin Sold: Analyst Reveals Why He Swapped To Altcoins


								A prominent figure in the crypto space revealed he has sold all his Bitcoin (BTC) holdings in favor of Altcoins. In an X post, the market expert claimed to still have faith in the flagship cryptocurrency and explained what he did and the reasons why.

Expert Takes A Risk To Get More Bitcoin
On Thursday, renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe announced to his X followers that he had sold all his Bitcoin holdings. He prefaced his explanation by stating that he had not lost his faith in BTC.
The expert explained he is not expecting the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to be “topped out for this cycle.” Additionally, he clarified that he has not become a “complete believer in gold.”

Van de Poppe’s goal is to buy back more Bitcoin later in the year since “It’s a bull cycle; we can’t deny that.” However, he explains that the simplicity of the four-year cycle and the impact of “Halving” events will reduce over time as Bitcoin becomes a mature asset worldwide and institutions prioritize “risk appetite in their portfolios.”
According to the analyst, “It’s all about risk,” and institutions will de-risk when liquidity dries up. As a result, this cycle may be the final “easy” cycle to make big profits through altcoins.
He asserted that he must take a risk as a 31-year-old entrepreneur who has been surviving several bull and bear markets since 2017. To obtain more Bitcoin, van de Poppe decided to trade Altcoins within the Web 3.0 ecosystem, which he considers the riskiest path:
“I know the tides, and I know that to get a large return, you’ll need to get more knowledge and dare to take the risk against all odds and sentiment. That’s where I fancy it the most and where I’ve had periods when things went south. Can’t deny that.”
Altcoins Poised For Big Returns
Further explaining why he chose this path to earn back his Bitcoin, the analyst stated that “altcoins have been crushed unreasonably hard” during this cycle. Due to this, van de Poppe is considering several events that could make or break his bet on altcoins.
First, he listed the slim chances of an Ethereum (ETH) spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETH) being approved alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s crackdown on ETH. The clarification on the status of the second-largest cryptocurrency could “make a significant U-turn.”
Second, the results of the US House of Representatives vote regarding the FIT21 bill could provide a clearer regulatory framework for the crypto industry in the US. Lastly, the outcome of the XRP lawsuit, which he believes will result in the asset not being classified as a security, could also positively affect the market.
Van de Poppe stated that the upside of his bet cannot be denied. Nonetheless, he recognizes that the downside is relatively huge. The expert explained he’s currently 20% down on the overall investment in two weeks, claiming that he’ll be fine with the possibility of losing 50-80% of his investment.
For the analyst, the chances of making a 300-900% return in the coming 6 to 12 months outweigh the risks. With the possibility of earning between 900% and 4500% in the next one to two years, van de Poppe is “happily allocating entirely towards altcoins.”  He closed his post optimistically stating, “The bull cycle will be glorious.”

Ghana, Singapore conduct trade in semi-fungible token pilot project

The Bank of Ghana (BOG) and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have completed a proof-of-concept for the Digital Economy Semi-Fungible Token (DESFT) Project, according to various local press reports. The project is intended to encourage trade between micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the two countries.Within the project, live transactions have been carried out between the sides. To do so, they leveraged the Universal Trusted Credentials semi-fungible token protocol developed by the United Nations Development Program, according to Singapore-based Ample FinTech, which identified itself as the developer of the DESFT. The token contained verified licenses, certificates and trade records.A stablecoin pegged to the Singapore dollar (XSGD) and the BOG’s e-cedi central bank digital currency (CBDC) were used for exchange within a Purpose Bound Money protocol on a distributed ledger.Source: Fintech Association of Kenya The MAS developed the Purpose Bound Money protocol in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund and the central banks of Italy and South Korea. It incorporates both programmable money and programmable payment technology and has been tested by Amazon and other international retailers.Related: Bank of Ghana to foster financial inclusion through CBDC projectBank of Ghana director of fintech and innovation Kwame Oppong described the project at the 3i Africa Summit in Accra. He said:“After nearly a year and two phases of development, we have crafted a reliable information exchange solution founded on UTC standards and Semi-fungible Token technology […] and conducted real trade experiments which fully align with our predetermined objectives.” Oppong continued that the project's future development would focus on supply chain finance and payments across multiple digital currencies. Details were scarce in the press about the semi-fungible token technology. Ample FinTech said it operates on the ERC-3525 standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain.According to an announcement of a panel discussion scheduled for the Singapore Fintech Festival in November, the Digital Economy Semi-Fungible Token “combines NFTs and traditional blockchain information” that enables the tokenization of self-ownership through the DESFT. The e-cedi is in its pilot phase.

How a Crypto Trader Made Over $100K With Two Tweets - Decrypt

Ethereum layer-2 solution Blast continues to be a lucrative place to earn money. On Thursday, Twitter user Punk9059—a notable pseudonymous crypto personality—said he had made well over $100,000 worth of crypto primarily from posting two tweets related to the Pacmoon meme coin.“I got paid over $100k for two tweets,” Punk9059 tweeted. “What's crazy is I had no idea it would happen.”Pacmoon is a meme coin on the Blast network, which launched its mainnet in late February. The Blast network has attracted considerable attention, amassing over $1.4 billion in total value locked ahead of its upcoming BLAST token airdrop in late June.Meme coins are tokens based on internet memes, celebrities, or brands. Pacmoon uses Pac-Man-inspired visuals, and rewards social media interaction and community engagement by giving supporters tokens for sharing relevant content.Showing the tweets, Punk9059—who works for Memeland, and previously was at Proof—said that the first tweet was of news of a free airdrop of Pacmoon (PAC) tokens to Blast stakeholders, along with his referral code, on February 28. It was a popular tweet, sure, but the benefits were even bigger than expected thanks to a mistake.“This tweet went viral,” Punk9059 said. “People copy/pasted the wording. And my friend [Frank DeGods] mistakenly tweeted my code instead of his own.”Frank DeGods, aka Rohun Vora, is the founder of the DeGods and y00ts NFT projects and commands a sizable following on Twitter. His mistaken referral code share ultimately paid off big for Punk9059—though at the time, the PAC token wasn’t worth very much.Punk9059 said he gave Frank $50 as a thank you after he mistakenly tweeted out the wrong referral code. And that tweet, including the photo of Frank holding a $50 bill while being embraced by Punk9059, also went viral—so more rewards gained.He received 354,179 PAC for referrals, followed by another 698,137 PAC tokens for tweet views, ultimately totaling 1,052,316 tokens—which equaled $168,370 as of Thursday. As of this writing, that tally is worth about $218,000 with PAC up 7% over the past 24 hours.“There were a couple more tweets in the mix, but these two did the lion's share of the work,” Punk9059 said. “The best part? My followers got a W too if they saw the tweet & registered.”“We’ll take it,” he added.Punk9059 did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Two Giant Whales Became Active: They Made Big Trades in These Altcoins - Bitcoin Sistemi


It seems like a lot of whales have been active in the cryptocurrency market in recent hours.
According to onchain data provided by Lookonchain, the whale with short address 0x8036, which we will talk about first, first purchased $ 5.7 million worth of Ethereum on the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. This wallet was created from scratch approximately 1 day ago.



Then, the whale in question used all of the ETH he withdrawn to buy Ondo (ONDO). Whale purchased 6 million ONDO tokens at an average price of $0.95. At the time of writing this article, ONDO price is trading at $0.93.
Another whale that has been active in recent hours seems to have experienced a very unfortunate situation. Roosh, a well-known whale in the cryptocurrency market, sold a large amount of Chainlink (LINK) worth $ 2.78 million. Unfortunately, after the whale sold, there was an 18% increase in the LINK price. According to the data, if the whale wallet had waited a little longer, it could have made an additional profit of $497. At the time of writing this article, LINK is trading at $16.20.

Bitcoin ETFs Record $300 Million in Net Inflows as Bitcoin Nears $67,000 ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Net inflows into the 9 spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) reached $300 million yesterday as the market experienced a healthy bullish phase. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had been languishing below $63k for the better part of the last three weeks, so this price rally was a breath of fresh air for the bullish cause.



Daily ETF Flow



According to Bitcoin ETF Flow data, the net inflow for the ETFs was $303 million on May 15, 2024. Here is the entire breakdown:



Image Source: Farside



According to the spreadsheet, Fidelity’s FBTC fund was the biggest gainer, with a net inflow of $131 million, dwarfing the rest of the pack considerably. BitWise’s BITB and ARK Invest’s ARKB ETFs stood second and third, with $86.3 million and $38.6 million, respectively. The remaining five spot ETFs, including Grayscale, were in single digits.



Bitcoin ETFs Hit the Ground Running



Bitcoin ETFs hit the ground running after being approved at the end of January this year. They have become the best-performing ETFs ever launched in the history of exchange funds. Four top spot ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT, FBTC, ARKB, and BitWise, have seen a massive $28 billion worth of buying in just three and a half months.



After the success in America, several other financial destinations have launched their spot crypto ETFs. Hong Kong, in particular, not only launched three Bitcoin funds but also allowed the same three companies to file for Ethereum ETFs, which were also approved. However, the Hong Kong-based funds couldn’t perform as well as their counterparts across the Pacific Ocean. The US has taken the lead here even though it wasn’t the first to cross the line.

&nbsp



However, the performance in the last few weeks has slowed as the crypto market has suffered overall. The end of April witnessed considerable net outflows, with all the top ETFs bleeding value.



The Future



While the total $28 billion invested in US-based Bitcoin ETFs is peanuts compared to the multi-trillion valuation of the entire crypto market, it is important to note that this is a long-term play. 



These ETFs are being eyed by top investment banks worldwide, with big names like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan already dipping into the market. The US state of Wisconsin has also bought $100 million worth of shares in the ARKB ETF, and that is just one state. It is predicted that sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and national treasuries will invest in Bitcoin in the near future.

Alleged crypto scammers arrested in 'pig butchering' scheme

The Justice Department said on Friday that it arrested two alleged scammers for laundering “at least” $73 million through shell companies connected to “pig butchering” cryptocurrency investment schemes. Nvidia stock has all-time closing high in its crosshairsIn a pig butchering scam, scammers contact victims online and gain their trust before manipulating them into investing in a fake cryptocurrency. Daren Li, a 41-year-old dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis — and resides in China, Cambodia, and the United Arab Emirates, was arrested on April 12 at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. According to a Justice Department statement, he was subsequently transported to the Central District of California. Yicheng Zhang, 38, a Chinese national and resident of Temple City, California, was arrested on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, the statement said.The DOJ accused the individuals of having lured victims into depositing money into U.S. accounts. From there, the two allegedly utilized co-conspirators to launder the money through U.S. financial institutions to Bahamas bank accounts, before converting the funds into the stablecoin Tether, also known as USDT.“Cryptocurrency investment scams exploit the borderless nature of virtual currency and online communications to defraud victims,” said U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. “While fraud in the crypto markets takes on many forms and hides in many far-off places, its perpetrators aren’t beyond the law’s reach,” the Li and Zhang face charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and six counts of international money laundering. According to the Justice Department, if found guilty, they could be sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison for each count.Two days before announcing the arrests, the Justice Department said it arrested two brothers for allegedly stealing roughly “$25 million worth of cryptocurrency within approximately 12 seconds.” And earlier this month, the department charged ‘Bitcoin Jesus’, a.k.a. Roger Ver, with evading nearly $50 million in taxes.

Alex Labs freezes $3.9M of exploited funds sent to CEXs after hack

Bitcoin layer-2 developer Alex Labs has successfully frozen more than $3.9 million worth of crypto that was exploited from its BNB Smart Chain bridge, according to the team’s May 16 social media post. According to the post, the attacker sent the funds to several different centralized exchanges (CEXs), which allowed them to be frozen with the cooperation of the exchanges.Source: Alex LabsThe team said it recovered the complete balances for 17 different tokens, including “all aBTC, sUSDT, xBTC, xUSD, ALEX, atALEX, LiSTX, LUNR, SKO, CHAX, $B20, ORDG, ORMM, ORNJ, TRIO, TX20 and STXS.” $13.7 million worth of Stacks (STX) tokens were also exploited. Of these, the attacker made the mistake of sending “about 3 million” to centralized exchanges. The post links to a spreadsheet showing the STX balances at each exchange the hacker used to transfer funds. It shows that a total of $3.7 million is held at exchanges, whereas $9.6 million are held in wallets under the direct control of the attacker.List of CEXs holding exploited funds. Source: Alex LabsThe attacker withdrew the funds by taking control of a private key that provided access to one of the bridge’s “vaults.” However, “The smart contract code and infrastructure underlying ALEX were not compromised,” the team claimed.Related: Alex bridge on BNB Smart Chain drained of $4.3M after suspicious upgradeAlex Labs has offered a 10% bounty to the attacker and a promise not to prosecute if they return the other 90% of the stolen funds. They are also preparing a police report, which will be filed if the attacker does not agree to negotiate.Because there is a possibility that not all funds will be recovered, the team is “evaluating deployment of $ALEX reserves held by ALEX Lab Foundation.” These reserves may be used for a “treasury grant program” to compensate users who lost funds in the attack. A disproportionate amount of the exploited funds consists of STX tokens, so the team may also propose a Stacks network upgrade that will freeze the remaining funds and mint new tokens to be sent to victims.Upgrading a network to freeze an attacker’s coins is not completely unprecedented. It was done during the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack and after the PopcornSwap rug pull on the BNB Smart Chain. However, these upgrades are rarely approved. In the case of the PopcornSwap rug pull, the upgrade froze funds but did not reimburse investors.In its post, Alex Labs claimed that it continues to monitor the attacker’s addresses and has “multiple alarms” in an effort to prevent the funds from being cashed out.Alex is not the only Bitcoin layer-2 bridge that has been attacked recently. On May 17, the XLink bridge was also attacked, and $10 million was lost. In that case, a white-hat hacker managed to recover $4.3 million of the stolen funds. The XLink attack was almost identical to the one against Alex, as the attacker in both cases used a phishing technique to obtain the team’s private key, which was then used to make unauthorized withdrawals.

Crypto Biz: Galaxy, CoinShares Q1 results, ETFs on the blockchain, and more

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) managers have released their first financial results since the crypto funds began trading. Galaxy Digital’s net income rose 40% in the first quarter, with management and performance fees reaching $17.8 million — a 113% increase from the previous quarter. CoinShares, which recently completed the acquisition of Valkyrie’s spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, posted a 216% revenue gain in Q1 to 19.5 million British pounds ($24.5 million). On the tokenization front, executives from Ripple and Stellar recently discussed the blending of payments and investments enabled by asset tokenization. Franklin Templeton’s CEO Jenny Johnson also forecasted that all ETFs and mutual funds could soon be on blockchains.

CoinShares posts record revenue in Q1, backed by markets, Bitcoin ETFsEuropean asset manager CoinShares reported a significant performance boost in the first quarter of 2024, largely attributed to a recovering market in the period. The firm saw its revenue surge to 19.5 million pounds ($24.5 million), a 216% increase from the same period in 2023. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also saw a substantial rise, reaching 34.2 million pounds ($43 million), up from 7 million pounds ($8.8 million) in the previous year, marking a fourfold increase and an EBITDA margin of 78%. Additionally, CoinShares completed the strategic acquisition of Valkyrie Funds on March 12, expanding its offerings with the rights to Valkyrie’s spot Bitcoin ETF and other crypto funds.Franklin Templeton CEO says all ETFs and mutual funds will be on blockchainFranklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson reiterated her support for blockchain in a recent Bloomberg interview. During a discussion over tokenization, Johnson said to believe that “ETF and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain,” adding that the technology had demonstrated significant cost reductions compared to traditional accounting methods. She attributed this prediction to the “huge costs” associated with verifying data between disparate systems — a problem that blockchain was intentionally designed to solve. Polymarket raises $70 million from Vitalik Buterin, Founders FundPeter Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have led a $70 million fundraising effort for Polymarket, a platform enabling betting on political events. According to Bloomberg, Polymarket successfully raised $70 million across two funding rounds as betting on the 2024 United States presidential elections gains momentum. The latest Series B Polymarket funding round was spearheaded by Founders Fund, raising $45 million. Polymarket has witnessed a surge in electoral betting, resulting in over $170 million in wagers placed on the upcoming U.S. elections, according to the platform’s website. Galaxy Digital’s revenue soars with mining, fees at record levelsGalaxy Digital experienced a robust first quarter in 2024, with its net income soaring to $422 million, marking a 40% growth from the previous quarter. The increase was bolstered by record-breaking revenues in both its mining operations and management fees. The company’s mining revenue hit a new high of $31.5 million, up 69% from the previous quarter, largely due to an expanded mining capacity that achieved a hash rate of 5.7 exahashes per second. The company mined 373 Bitcoin at an average cost of less than $19,500 each.

Changpeng Zhao teases writing project ahead of reporting to prison

The former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, has suggested he plans to “write something” during his upcoming four-month incarceration.At an April 30 hearing, Judge Richard Jones sentenced Zhao to four months in prison. The former Binance CEO pleaded guilty to one felony charge for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the exchange. Zhao is expected to report to either the Camp at the Federal Correctional Institution Sheridan in Oregon or the Federal Detention Center SeaTac in Washington at a date that had not been determined at the time of publication.Before and after the sentencing hearing, CZ remained active on social media, hinting at his plans on X. The former Binance CEO launched a youth-focused crypto and blockchain education program called Giggle Academy. He also reached out to his 8.9 million X followers, hinting at suggestions on how to pass the time in prison.Source: Changpeng ZhaoZhao suggested he had “nothing else to do” but read books and wait until his reporting date. He pleaded guilty to the felony charge in November 2023 and was allowed to remain out of jail and travel within areas of the United States on a $175 million bond. He will likely continue to be free until the Probation or Pretrial Services Office notifies his legal team where and when he will be required to report.With an estimated net worth of $33 billion, CZ would be one of the wealthiest individuals to ever go to prison. Before sentencing, Zhao’s lawyers submitted declarations from experts suggesting that his wealth and status could pose a risk of theft and extortion. Related: Changpeng Zhao gets 4 months, Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years — Why?These factors could have contributed to Judge Jones not immediately ordering CZ behind bars. The Federal Bureau of Prisons may be weighing which facility could present the least risk of physical harm to Zhao during his four-month imprisonment — both FDC SeaTac and FCI Sheridan house violent offenders. “After sentencing, [...] presentence reports are utilized by the Bureau of Prisons to designate the institutions appropriate for offenders to serve their sentences, to select prison programs to help the offenders, and to develop case plans for their custody and eventual release,” states the Probation or Pretrial Services Office of the Western District of Washington’s website.Zhao already paid a $50 million penalty as part of a deal between Binance and U.S. authorities in November. The crypto exchange agreed to pay $4.3 billion to settle “civil regulatory enforcement actions,” but the matter did not resolve a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Magazine: ‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of Flame

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) Will Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gambling Cat (GAMBCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAMBCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gambling Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gambling Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Gambling Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gambling Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gambling Cat by entering its contract address – B4BQTfBJ6uQYkzaZyQjTmH7k3c9gzXQ3FrPMPDstpYAn – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAMBCAT.

Two senior Binance executives are at the center of the dispute: Tigran Gambaryan, the head of financial crime compliance, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, the regional manager for Binance in Africa. The Nigerian government has charged both men with a litany of financial crimes.
Binance Embroiled In High-Stakes Legal Battle
The legal saga began earlier this year when Gambaryan traveled to Nigeria to participate in talks with the government about Binance’s operations in the country. However, upon arrival, he was promptly arrested and incarcerated. 
A Nigerian court has dealt another blow to Binance, refusing to grant Gambaryan bail as his money laundering trial begins.

According to local media reports, Justice Emeka Nwite of the Federal High Court in Abuja cited Gambaryan’s flight risk as the primary reason for denying bail. 
The prosecution argued that Gambaryan, who holds both American and Armenian citizenship, could easily flee the country if released. They also noted his colleague Anjarwalla’s escape from custody in March, which they claimed was suspicious.
Nigeria Ramps Up Crackdown
Binance’s legal troubles in Nigeria stem from a broader crackdown by the government on the cryptocurrency platform. Authorities have accused the exchange of facilitating over $26 billion in illicit funds transfers without proper oversight. 
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has alleged that Binance engaged in tax evasion, currency speculation, and money laundering, totaling $35.4 million.
Anjarwalla, who served as Binance’s regional manager for Africa, was also charged alongside Gambaryan. However, in March, he escaped from the custody of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu. The Nigerian government traced him to Kenya, where local authorities reportedly arrested him.

The legal battle between Binance and Nigeria highlights the growing regulatory scrutiny facing cryptocurrency exchanges globally. As digital assets become more mainstream, governments are increasingly increasing efforts to monitor and control the flow of funds through these platforms.
For Binance, the stakes in this case are high. Conviction of its executives could result in hefty fines and potential jail time and further damage the exchange’s reputation and ability to operate in one of Africa’s largest economies.

Solana Takes The Crown: CoinGecko Ranks It The Best, Leaving Ethereum Behind In Key Metric


																The race to achieve the fastest blockchain transaction processing speeds is heating up, Solana (SOL) is in the spotlight as a new report from crypto data aggregator CoinGecko reveals some surprising findings. 
The study analyzes the real-world transaction per second (TPS) performance of a range of large blockchain networks, both Ethereum-based and non-Ethereum (ETH) Virtual Machine (EVM) protocols.
Solana Emerges As The Undisputed Speed Champion
According to the findings, Solana has proven to be the fastest among large blockchains, with its actual daily average transactions per second (TPS) reaching a record high of 1,504 on April 6th, 202. Notably, this figure makes Solana 46 times faster than Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
Furthermore, Solana’s TPS is more than 5 times faster than Polygonm (MATIC), which currently holds the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.

According to CoinGecko, this demonstrates the superior processing power of the non-EVM blockchain and its ability to handle a large influx of transactions, especially during periods of heightened market activity, such as the recent Memecoin mania, specifically within the Solana network.
However, it’s important to note that despite Solana’s performance, the blockchain has only achieved 1.6% of its “theoretical maximum speed” of 65,000 TPS. This suggests that there is still significant room for improvement, and the network’s upcoming upgrades will be closely watched to see how quickly it can record even higher real TPS.
Ethereum Scaling Solutions Lag Behind Non-EVM Blockchains
The second-fastest blockchain in the study is another non-EVM protocol, Sui (SUI), which recorded its highest real TPS of 854 in July 2023 as the on-chain game Sui 8192 gained popularity. Other fast blockchains among the non-EVMs include The Open Network (TON) at 175 TPS and Near Protocol (NEAR) at 118 TPS.
In contrast, the non-EVM blockchains that have recorded relatively lower real processing speeds are Aptos (49 TPS), Starknet (12 TPS), Bitcoin (11 TPS), and Thorchain (2 TPS). 
Collectively, the 8 non-EVM large blockchains have an average peak TPS of 284, which is 3.9 times faster than the 17 largest EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains, which have an average of just 74 TPS.

	Related Reading



The EVM-compatible blockchain that has achieved the fastest real TPS is BNB Smart Chain (BSC), which recorded 378 TPS on December 7th, 2023, amid the surge in on-chain activity driven by the inscriptions craze. This performance places BSC as the fastest Ethereum-based blockchain, though it still lags behind the top non-EVM protocols.
Similarly, the surge driven by inscriptions allowed Polygon to record 190 TPS on November 16th, 2023, making it the fastest among the largest Ethereum scaling solutions and 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself. However, the leading non-EVM blockchains still outpacing even Polygon’s impressive speed.

At press time, SOL was trading at $168, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours and registering an impressive 720% gain year-to-date.

                        A South Korean convenience store chain, Emart24, is teaming up with the popular cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb to offer Bitcoin Meal packs. These unique meal boxes will provide customers with an opportunity to win small amounts of Bitcoin, adding a crypto twist to their lunch break.
Bitcoin Meal Packs
Approximately 30,000 Bitcoin Meal packs will be available for purchase at Emart24 locations by the end of the month, priced at 5,900 Korean won (USD $4.30) each. The process is simple: after purchasing a meal pack, customers can download the Bithumb app and enter a coupon code inside the box to potentially win 10,000 won worth of Bitcoin.An additional 20,000 won worth of Bitcoin will be awarded to those who choose to create a Bitcoin account with NH Nonghyup Bank. Existing Bithumb users need to connect their accounts to redeem their rewards.Bithumb, a Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA) member alongside Coinone, Upbit, Gopax, and Korbit, plays a major role in South Korea’s crypto market. Despite delays in IPO plans, the exchange recently announced its plans to become the first crypto exchange listed on the South Korean stock market.
Crypto Regulations in South Korea
Over the past few years, South Korea has implemented stricter crypto regulations surrounding the market. Legislators have also implemented stricter penalties for crypto-related crimes and established new regulatory guidelines. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, South Korean financial authorities mandate that cryptocurrency users report any unlicensed exchanges operating within the country.Despite these regulations, the collaboration between Emart24 and Bithumb demonstrates the continued growth and integration of cryptocurrency within South Korea’s economy.

XRP Price to Experience ‘One Last Nuke’ Before Soaring, Crypto Analyst Suggests | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the native otken of the XRP Ledger, XRP, has been underperforming the wider cryptocurrency market over the last few months, having dropped around 15.6% so far this year while Bitcoin moved up 57% in the same period.



A popular pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst, however, suggested that the price of the cryptocurrency could endure “one last nuke” before surging significantly, sharing a chart on the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance pointing to a drop to the $0.40 mark, significantly below its current $0.518 level, as part of the cryptocurrency’s five-wave price action with a bullish divergence.



The price of the cryptocurrency, according to the shared chart, would then explode upward towards $0.747, which would represent an upside of 44% from current levels.







Other analysts are also bullish on the native token of the XRP Ledger, with digital content creator Block Bull pointing to a massive value increase to the point the cryptocurrency would reach the $250 mark by 2025, supporting the prediction with an analysis of historical market trends, especially those related to Bitcoin halving events.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Another cryptocurrency analyst, Jonathan Carter, has suggested XRP may be on the cusp of a significant upswing, pointing to a symmetrical triangle on the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart, from which XRP could soon break out of.



The price of XRP has been trapped within this triangle for several years, reflecting a potential tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. A successful breakout, Carter said, would see XRP move upward significantly.



Despite the bullish analysis,  the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and unforeseen events can significantly impact price movements. Additionally, the lingering SEC lawsuit, which centers around XRP’s classification as a security, continues to cloud the token’s future.



A negative outcome in the lawsuit could dampen investor sentiment and derail any potential price surge. Nevertheless, other analysts remain bullish, with Egrag Crypto recently saying a potential surge to the $4 mark is “feasible.”

Feds Charge Chinese Nationals in $73 Million 'Pig Butchering' Crypto Scam - Decrypt

Two Chinese nationals were charged with orchestrating a large-scale cryptocurrency scam that netted at least $73 million in laundered funds, the U.S. Department of Justice announced on Friday.According to the DOJ, Daren Li, 41, a dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis, was arrested on April 12 at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Yicheng Zhang, 38, a resident of Temple City, California, was arrested in Los Angeles on Thursday.The pair are charged with committing money laundering and six counts of international money laundering.“Cryptocurrency investment scams exploit the borderless nature of virtual currency and online communications to defraud victims,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. “While fraud in the crypto markets takes on many forms and hides in many far-off places, its perpetrators aren’t beyond the law’s reach.Li and Zhang are accused of instructing unnamed co-conspirators in opening bank accounts in the name of shell companies, running an international syndicate laundering money from cryptocurrency investment scams known as "pig butchering.”Pig butchering scams are a type of long-term investment fraud that involves scammers luring victims into cryptocurrency schemes. The DOJ said victims were tricked into transferring millions to U.S. bank accounts of shell companies set up by Li and other conspirators.Funds deposited into the accounts would be sent to off-shore accounts in the Bahamas and converted into Tether (USDT) and deposited into wallets allegedly controlled by Li. Zhang allegedly also received victim funds, the DOJ said.While the pair is charged with laundering $73 million, the DOJ said over $341 million worth of “virtual assets” was received by a wallet connected to the duo.“As alleged in the indictment, Li and Zhang helped launder millions of dollars obtained from victims of cryptocurrency investment scams,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri said in a statement. “Money laundering is critical to the success of these scams, allowing fraudsters to quickly move illicit proceeds and try to make them appear legitimate."The arrests were made through a collaboration between U.S-based and international law enforcement, reflecting the agency’s “ongoing commitment to disrupting the entire cybercrime ecosystem and stopping fraud across all financial markets.” If convicted, Li and Zhang face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.Since the collapse of FTX in November 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice and policymakers have stepped up investigations and prosecution of cryptocurrency-related crimes.In January, the DOJ charged an Australian and two Americans with running a $1.9 billion cryptocurrency scam based around a purported DeFi platform, HyperFund.And in April, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren—a longtime crypto critic—called on the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to report on the use of cryptocurrency in facilitating the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), calling it the payment of choice for that market.In the most prominent criminal case related to cryptocurrency since Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison in March, Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao was sentenced to four months in federal prison after being convicted of money laundering violations in April.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Why Trust Non GamStop Casinos?



                    

Since it started in 2018, GamStop has become an important part of the UK’s online gambling scene. It works with many gaming sites to help promote safe gambling by allowing players to exclude themselves from betting. Despite this, more and more players are turning to trusted non GamStop casinos for alternative options.



These players are likely looking for more freedom in their gaming choices, which strict UK regulations might limit. Non GamStop casinos attract these players by offering fewer betting restrictions and a wider variety of games than those typically found on GamStop sites.




However, it’s important for potential users to carefully check these sites before using them. They should look into the site’s licensing, security measures, and what games and bonuses are available to make sure they have a safe and enjoyable gambling experience.



Advantages of Choosing Non GamStop Casinos



Licensed and Safe



Some people mistakenly think that non GamStop casinos aren’t licensed or secure, but that’s not true. Many of these casinos are regulated by well-known authorities like the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), which has rules as strict as those of the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC). These casinos must use SSL encryption to keep their websites safe, work with trustworthy payment providers, and ensure their games are fair.



If you’re interested in these casinos, it’s important to check that they are properly licensed. You should also look for extra security features such as two-factor authentication and trust seals from respected organizations like eCOGRA or GLI. These features help confirm that the games are fair and that your personal information is protected.








No Limits on Deposits and Betting



One big benefit of non GamStop casinos is that they often don’t have strict limits on how much money you can deposit or bet. This gives both casual players and those who want to bet more money a lot of flexibility. The amount you can deposit can vary a lot, from as little as £1 to as much as £100,000, and it depends on the casino and the payment method you use, like PayPal or different cryptocurrencies.



However, players should be aware that some casinos might set limits to help prevent illegal activities like money laundering. For example, some places might allow you to deposit up to £20,000 per week, while casinos that cater to high-stakes betting might let you deposit as much as £100,000.



Expansive Game Libraries



The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) sets strict rules that sometimes limit the types of games available from certain providers in the UK. On the other hand, non GamStop casinos usually follow less strict regulations, which means they can offer a wider variety of games.



These casinos have games from well-known and new software developers like NetEnt, Betsoft, and Play’n GO. This gives players a large selection to choose from, including slots, table games, and live dealer games. This wide range ensures that there’s something for everyone, unlike many UK-based sites that might have more restrictions on their games.




Generous Bonuses



UK casinos often have to follow strict rules, which means they usually offer smaller bonuses with tougher conditions. In contrast, non GamStop casinos are not bound by these strict regulations, so they can give out more generous bonuses. It’s common to see welcome bonuses as high as £10,000 at these casinos.



However, players should carefully check the terms of these bonuses. Pay attention to the wagering requirements, withdrawal limits, how different games contribute to these requirements, and how long the bonuses last. This will help ensure that the bonuses are truly worthwhile.







Self-Exclusion Tools



Even though they are not part of the GamStop network, many non GamStop casinos still take responsible gambling seriously. They provide tools for self-exclusion, allowing players to set their own deposit and betting limits, and to take breaks after certain periods to help control their gambling habits.



These features are very important for players who are aware of the risks of excessive gambling and want to take active steps to keep their habits in check. By offering these responsible gambling tools, non GamStop casinos show that they care about their players’ well-being and support a balanced approach to online gaming.



Disadvantages of Non GamStop Casinos



Self-Exclusion Loophole



One major issue with non GamStop casinos is that they allow players to avoid self-exclusion agreements set up through GamStop. This situation can be problematic for people who have gambling addictions. At non GamStop casinos, individuals who previously chose to self-exclude as a way to control their gambling can easily sign up and start betting again. This can make their gambling problems worse.



The fact that these players can access these casinos without the protective barrier they wanted through GamStop is a big risk. It could lead recovering addicts to fall back into harmful gambling habits.



Currency and Payment Limitations



Non GamStop casinos usually serve international players and might not use British pounds as a standard currency. This means UK players may face extra costs due to currency conversion fees. These fees can accumulate, making gambling more costly than expected. Additionally, the payment methods these casinos accept may not always match what UK players prefer.



While common options like PayPal or credit cards are often accepted, specific e-wallets or local payment methods popular in the UK might not be available. This could make it less convenient for players who prefer these options for reasons of ease or security.



Lack of UKGC Support in Disputes



A major downside of non GamStop casinos is that they do not have support from the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), known for its strict monitoring and ability to resolve disputes effectively, ensuring fair play. However, at non GamStop casinos, this layer of protection is missing.



While regulatory bodies like the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) do offer dispute resolution, their help may not be as quick or effective, especially if the casino is based far from the UK, like in the Caribbean.



This distance, both geographically and in terms of regulation, can make resolving disputes more complicated, potentially leaving players needing a solution to their problems and fewer ways to get help.



FAQ



What are Non GamStop Casinos?



Non GamStop casinos are online gambling sites that are not part of the UK’s GamStop self-exclusion network. These casinos often offer more flexibility in terms of betting limits and game selection because they are regulated under different jurisdictions.



Are Non GamStop Casinos Safe?



Yes, many non GamStop casinos are safe as they are regulated by reputable authorities like the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). However, it’s important to check that they use security measures like SSL encryption, are properly licensed, and have additional security features like two-factor authentication.



What are the advantages of Non GamStop Casinos?



Non GamStop casinos often offer more lenient deposit and betting limits, a broader range of games from various providers, and more generous bonuses compared to UK-regulated sites.



What should be cautious about when playing at Non GamStop Casinos?



Be aware of the potential for higher gambling costs due to currency conversion fees, less support in dispute resolution since these casinos are not regulated by the UKGC, and the risk of bypassing self-exclusion measures if you have gambling issues.



How can ensure responsible gambling at Non GamStop Casinos?



Look for non GamStop casinos that offer responsible gambling tools like deposit limits, betting limits, and self-exclusion options. These tools can help you manage your gambling habits effectively, even if the casino is not part of the GamStop network.

XRP Really Needs That Breakout, Ethereum (ETH) Is Hiding Something, Nothing Stops Bitcoin (BTC) Before $71,000

Bitcoin has been on a steady rise, and the recent price action suggests that nothing can stop it before it hits $71,000. Analyzing the chart, BTC has successfully broken through several key resistance levels, finally showing us some bullish momentum.The first significant resistance level was around $63,000, where Bitcoin faced some consolidation but eventually pushed through. The next resistance was the 50 EMA, currently sitting near $65,000. BTC has managed to break above this level as well, indicating strong buying pressure and confidence among investors.BTC/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe price action shows BTC trading above the 50, 100 and 200 EMAs, a bullish signal suggesting that the upward trend is likely to continue. The 100 EMA around $62,000 and the 200 EMA at approximately $60,000 now act as strong support levels. As long as Bitcoin remains above these moving averages, the bullish trend is intact.Looking ahead, the next major resistance level is around $70,000, which was the previous all-time high. If Bitcoin can break above this level, the path to $71,000 and beyond becomes much clearer. The volume analysis supports this bullish thesis, with increasing buying volume as BTC moves higher, indicating sustained interest and demand.The RSI is currently above 60, suggesting that BTC is in bullish territory but not yet overbought. This gives Bitcoin room to run further without immediate risk of a significant pullback.Ethereum's ace in holeEthereum has been in a tough spot in the last few weeks. However, the situation has somewhat changed in favor of bulls after the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market broke the $3,000 threshold once again. But there is always a silver lining.Despite the recent surge above $3,000, Ethereum is still facing significant resistance. The 100 EMA, currently around $3,060, and the 50 EMA, near $3,180, are critical levels that ETH needs to surpass for a sustained bullish trend. More importantly, those moving averages might converge in the foreseeable future, causing a volatility surge not many would expect.On the downside, if Ethereum fails to maintain its position above $3,000, it could retrace back to the support level at $2,800. This support is reinforced by the 200 EMA, which has historically acted as a strong foundation for ETH. A break below this level could signal a deeper correction, potentially dragging the price down to $2,500 or lower.The volume data shows mixed signals. While there has been an uptick in buying volume as ETH crossed the $3,000 mark, it is not as significant as one would hope for a strong bullish continuation. This suggests that while there is interest, it is not enough to guarantee a sustained uptrend without further confirmation.XRP's old nemesisXRP has reached the lower border of the previously invalidated descending triangle. The lower border of that formation now acts as a resistance level which, if broken, can send XRP above $0.55. Apart from the historical resistance, there is a 26 EMA at the same price threshold that also acts as a resistance level.The price action shows XRP consolidating near the $0.52 mark, struggling to break through the resistance levels mentioned above. A successful breakout above these levels could potentially trigger a bullish run, pushing the price toward $0.60 and beyond. However, if XRP fails to break through, it might retrace to support levels around $0.50 or even lower.The volume data suggests a lack of significant buying power at the moment. For a breakout to be successful, XRP needs a surge in volume, indicating increased buying interest. Without this, the resistance levels might hold, preventing any upward movement.Additionally, the Relative Strength Index is currently around the neutral zone. This indicates that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold, giving it room to move in either direction. A rise in RSI above 60 could signal increased bullish momentum, supporting the potential breakout.

$22,000 Disappears From JPMorgan Chase Account After Customer Reports Suspicious Activity - Now Bank Says Reimbursement Is Not Happening: Report - The Daily Hodl


								An Ohio family says a single phone call led to thousands of dollars being drained from their JPMorgan Chase bank account – and Chase says they’re on the hook for it.
The Kalista family says they recently received a phone call from what was allegedly Chase, notifying them of suspicious activity, News 5 Cleveland reports.










Michelle Kalista says whoever was on the other line sounded legitimate and somehow knew much of her personal information, including her transaction history.
“I never thought I would be a victim of fraud just because I know better… How did they get into my account to begin with? How did they know my transactions? And how were they able to transfer money? None of those things have been answered yet.”
The person told Michelle that someone was trying to wire money to Florida.
Meanwhile, her husband Mike called Chase on his own to confirm there was a real emergency, and the bank confirmed that fraud attempts were indeed taking place.
However, confirming the fraud with Chase employees was apparently not enough to stop the scammer on the phone from accessing the Kalistas’ money.
Mike says there were two unsuccessful wire attempts from their bank account, which is when Chase should have frozen the funds. However, that didn’t happen, and on the third attempt, $22,000 disappeared.
Says Michelle,
“I mean, it was panic, and then it was tears, and then it was I’m made… I mean, I am literally emotionally exhausted at this point.”
Chase says that after investigation, the trillion-dollar bank determined that the Kalistas “authorized or (they) received benefit” from the transactions, and will not reimburse the family.
Chase contacted the local news outlet saying that “these types of scams are heartbreaking,” but also confirmed its “decision to deny (Michelle’s) claim because she compromised her account.”
Similar scams appear to be on the rise across the US.
A Memphis woman recently discovered $81,000 missing from her Wells Fargo account, and is worried she won’t receive a single cent back.
And 70-year-old Houston resident Jodene Danials also says Chase isn’t taking responsibility after her account was gutted by cyber thieves for $4,500.
Two other Wells Fargo customers say the bank is “rolling their eyes” at them after $83,000 went missing, and is refusing to reimburse.

Trump Fuks Biden (TRUMFBID) to Skyrocket 9,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Trump Fuks Biden (TRUMFBID) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Trump Fuks Biden (TRUMFBID), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 9,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because TRUMFBID has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Trump Fuks Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fuks Biden could become the next viral memecoin.



Trump Fuks Biden launched with over $54,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Trump Fuks Biden on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fuks Biden by entering its contract address – 2QjukUrxYfeZxd8xJwkWGSu8w78MhcbMjr9q4TEEHBRV – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMFBID.

Fantom (FTM) Defies Crypto Market Doldrums and Surges 15% This Week Amid New Chain Upgrade - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum (ETH) rival Fantom (FTM) has outpaced the broader crypto market and surged in price this week amid a new upgrade.
FTM is trading around $0.801 at time of writing.









The 55th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 5.5% in the past 24 hours and more than 15% in the past week.
By comparison, the overall crypto market cap is down 1.5% in the past 24 hours and up around 5% in the past seven days.
Validators on the Fantom Opera mainnet began upgrading their nodes to be powered by the project’s new “Sonic” technology on Tuesday. Fantom says Sonic will “scale the network to unprecedented heights” and can process 2,000 transactions per second.
The new technology will also reduce storage requirements by up to 90%, according to the project.
It’s not the only recent tech development for the project: Last month, Fantom announced a new “canonical” stablecoin in partnership with USDC-issuer Circle.
Fantom said it utilized the cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole (W) to roll out the new stablecoin, USDC.e.

Explained the Fantom Foundation,
“USDC.e on Wormhole is bridged from native USDC, located in a smart contract on Ethereum, and holds the potential to be upgraded to native USDC in the future. It will be the official, endorsed stablecoin of the Fantom ecosystem (and all future network upgrades).”
This initiative reduces liquidity fragmentation, introduces stability, and provides additional on-ramps to the ecosystem. By leveraging the Wormhole Native Token Transfers (NTT) standard, USDC.e will be available to all users and developers on Fantom.”

Here Are The Latest Shiba Inu Developments You Should Be Aware Of | Bitcoinist.com


								There have been a number of significant developments coming out of the Shiba Inu ecosystem recently and it can be hard to keep up. So, we have compiled a list of the most important developments that community members should be aware of at this time.
ShibaSwap Launches On Shibarium Blockchain
The ShibaSwap decentralized exchange (DEX) had been on the Ethereum blockchain since its launch and was yet to migrate the Shibarium, the Layer 2 blockchain developed by the Shiba Inu team. However, the time has finally come as the team has announced that the DEX is finally moving to Shibarium.

As Bitcoinist reported, the integration of the ShibaSwap DEX with the Shibarium network comes with a number of features. One of the major ones is the reduced fees that come with carrying out transactions on the blockchain.
Shibarium, which is an Ethereum Layer 2 network, drastically reduces the cost of transacting on the blockchain. In addition to this, it comes with enhanced scalability, as well as new liquidity pools for tokens. The team also debuted a new look with a reimagined dashboard and user interface, in addition to technical upgrades.
Shiba Inu Is Sponsoring The Major Conferences
Another development in the Shiba Inu ecosystem is that the project is once again sponsoring the Blockchain Futurist Conference as a title sponsor. The conference is important as is billed as the largest Web3 event in Canada, drawing industry leaders from all across the globe.
In addition to the Blockchain Futurist Conference, Shiba Inu is also the title sponsor for the ETHToronto and ETHWomen events as well. These events are expected to take place in Toronto, Canada, running for two days from August 13-14, 2024.


Binance Launches Dedicated SHIB Payments Page
Binance has been a leading supporter of Shiba Inu since listing the meme coin and has continued to develop ways to help investors take full advantage of their holdings. In its latest move, the crypto exchange has launched a dedicated payments page for Shiba Inu payments, through its payment platform, Binance Pay.

This move is to make it easier for Shiba Inu investors to make payments using SHIB without any hassle. At the same time, there are also exclusive deals for using the payment platform, as well as fee-less transactions when paying with the meme coin.
SHIB Price
Amid all of the developments, the Shiba Inu price has not performed poorly. Although it is down 1.24% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing, it is still seeing 6.36% gains on the weekly chart. More importantly, the meme coin has broken above the $0.000024 resistance, suggesting that it is ready for another rally.

Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run


																With the Bitcoin price having already seen a massive rally over the past year, crypto investors have turned their attention to altcoins. This is because altcoin season usually comes after Bitcoin finishes rallying and they present more potential for upside. Ahead of the second leg of the crypto bull market that is suppose to happen sometime this year, the crypto analysts at Analyst Buzz have revealed the top altcoins that are trading under $1 right now that could be a good buy.
Still Bullish On Polygon’s MATIC
The first of the altcoins featured on the list is Polygon’s MATIC. This comes as a surprise, as MATIC has been one of the only top altcoins that has failed to see any kind of outperformance in the last year. However, this could be part of the reason why the analyst feels the altcoin is set to outperform.

	Related Reading



Despite rallying in the last day, the MATIC price is still down more than 75% from its all-time high price of $2.92. This is in start contrast to larger cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have either broken a new all-time high or come close to it this year.
Ondo Finance Still A Top Contender Among Altcoins
Ondo Finance has been making waves this year, and despite being relatively new compared to the other altcoins on this list, its performance has been among the top movers. The cryptocurrency was pushed into the limelight following its partnership with trillion-dollar asset manager BlackRock.
In 2024 alone, the coin has seen an over 1,000% gain, going from $0.08355 to over $1 before correcting back downward. But despite this, the crypto analysts expect the altcoin to continue to perform well going into the bull run.
Oasis Network (ROSE) Makes List Of Altcoins With Potential
Oasis Network’s ROSE also makes it into Altcoin Buzz’s list of altcoins set to outperform in the bull market. This Layer 1 blockchain project had flown under the radar during the bear market, which eventually saw its price fall around 90% from its all-time high of $0.59.
However, the price of ROSE is beginning to pick up now and is currently trading at what many call a steal at $0.091. Unlike the altcoins already mentioned, the ROSE market cap is still under $1 billion, which gives it a lot of room to run during the crypto bull market.
Golem (GLM) Is Still In The Game?
Featuring among the list of altcoins with the potential to outperform in the crypto bull market is GLM, the native token of the Golem platform. Golem has been in the crypto market for a while but it is only now that it is making its play as AI and computing become a leading narrative in the market.

	Related Reading



The project features a peer-to-peer distributed computing resource which allows users to interact directly with each other. As computing becomes an even hotter narrative, Golem could very well be a great investment.
GLM is currently down around 57% from its $1.25 all-time high after a rather eventual start to 2024. Just like Oasis Network (ROSE), its market cap is still under $1 billion, making it one of the altcoins with the potential to run hard.

Meme coin supercycle or liquidity crisis? Expert discuss RoaringKitty's return - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            After a nearly two-year hiatus, the trader known as RoaringKitty returned to social media on May 13. Keith Gill, the real identity of RoaringKitty, is largely credited for spiking the GameStop stock (GME) surge in late 2020, and his return was enough to make GME price jump nearly 147% in 24 hours.Moreover, following his first publication, Gill started sharing cryptic videos that attracted the attention of known crypto investors, such as Ansem. This formed a landscape that is seen by the trader who identifies himself as EllioTrades as a preparation for a ‘meme coin super cycle.’However, some investors from the crypto community manifested their worries about movements in traditional finance being capable of draining liquidity from crypto. Eneko Knörr, CEO and co-founder of Stabolut, shared with Crypto Briefing that the crypto market’s liquidity is unlikely to be substantially affected.
“On the contrary, it feels like the meme stocks comeback has brought back attention to meme coins, with PEPE trading at a striking all-time high, for instance. This parallel surge in both meme stocks and meme coins indicates that the enthusiasm generated by RoaringKitty’s return is not limited to a single market, but rather is a broader phenomenon that transcends traditional boundaries,” explained Knörr.
Furthermore, Stabolut’s co-founder believes that the crypto market is well-equipped to absorb and respond to such shifts in investor sentiment, another sign that the liquidity will remain robust in crypto. “In fact, the overlap between the meme stock and crypto communities may even lead to a cross-pollination of ideas and investment strategies, further fueling the growth of both markets.”A possible meme coin supercycleKnörr highlights the impact influencers and key opinion leaders (KOL) have on the crypto industry, mentioning Max Keiser and Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, as examples. Their voices, he adds, can shape market sentiment.Therefore, RoaringKitty’s return combined with interactions with notable crypto investors has the potential to trigger a meme coin supercycle.
“The evolution of KOLs has led to a budding economy where influencers not only promote projects but also invest in them, often under favorable terms of course. This shift has raised concerns about transparency and potential conflicts of interest, as many KOLs fail to disclose their financial ties to the projects they promote. Despite these concerns, the influence of KOLs on the crypto market is undeniable, with research suggesting that they can significantly impact token prices and market trends.”
The impact mentioned by Stabolut’s co-founder is even more significant when it comes to meme coins, which often thrive on the enthusiasm and participation of influencers’ followers, and the endorsement of a prominent influencer can be a significant catalyst for their growth.

                        The crypto industry has made a record $94 million in political donations since 2023 in an effort to support pro-crypto governance.According to a May 17 Bloomberg report, crypto industry donors have contributed $94 million to federal political committees since 2023. This is more than the $83 million donated during the last 2020 election cycle.Most political donations come from political action committees (PACs). These organizations pool member contributions and donate the funds to campaigns for or against candidates, ballot initiatives, or legislation.PACs strategically allocate funds in primaries to influence candidate selection that is favorable to their interests.Who is Making Crypto Political Donations?
The Super PAC Fairshake has raised over $85 million to support political candidates who endorse crypto and blockchain technology in the upcoming election.Fairshake seeks to ensure that elected candidates will advocate for establishing and adopting much-needed regulations for the cryptocurrency industry.Most recently, Fairshake spent over $10 million successfully opposing a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in California through a series of negative ads that helped keep her off the ballot.Fairsake’s mission has attracted the attention of major players in the crypto space, including venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who each gave Fairshake $9 million.They have also attracted large crypto firms like Coinbase, which donated $20.5 million, and Ripple Labs, which contributed $20 million, according to the report.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been vocal about his opposition to anti-crypto governance and contributed $1 million personally.The largest crypto industry contributor is Jeffrey Yass, a major donor from Susquehanna International Group, who supports a range of networks from Bitcoin to ByteDance.Describing himself as a libertarian, Yass predominantly backs Republican candidates and has already donated $70 million toward political causes.Crypto in the 2024 Election
Elections are now crucial to the future of cryptocurrency. As major jurisdictions slowly become hubs for cryptocurrency development, it is critical to establish strong regulatory support for the technology.One of the most influential is the US. The 2024 election is shaping up to be key in the future of cryptocurrency in the country.According to a Digital Currency Group poll, this has become a major issue among voters in the 2024 US Elections.This is primarily fueled by the contrasting views held by leading political candidates. The current Biden administration has displayed a rigorous regulatory standpoint, which some interpret as hostility.On the other hand, the Trump administration seeks to foster a more supportive environment for crypto in the US. During a Q&A session, he agreed that many cryptocurrency businesses are leaving the country “because of the hostility.”“Well, we’ll stop it because I don’t want that… If we’re going to embrace [crypto], we have to let them be,” he claimed.This move has been under question as opportunistic, however. He has raised much less than his primary competitor, the Biden administration, according to a Financial Times report.In addition, Trump’s ongoing legal expenses may have prompted a personal appeal to the industry.“If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump,” Trump said during a Q&A.A 2023 Greyscale survey indicates that US voters want presidential candidates to have an informed perspective on new technologies like crypto.According to a Coinbase report, about 20% of American adults claim to hold crypto. Therefore, a pro-crypto stance may be a valuable tool in the upcoming 2024 election.

Redfall's Unexpected Last Hurrah Final Update Brings Offline Mode and More | Cryptopolitan

It is a shock for gamers that Redfall, Red Bethesda’s doomed game, will receive one last update before the developer halts further development.Lessons have been learned, and EA has taken the feedback of its players to heart. The announcement came through a Twitter post from the team, where it was said that the team will make the final update, Game Update 4, which will feature improved Neighborhood systems and Nests, and the capacity to pause the game in Solo mode and Offline Mode. There is already a launch date for the update, with more details coming soon.Contradicting previous statementsThis revelation directly contradicts earlier statements from Matt Booty, the head of Xbox Game Studios. Booty had previously declared that with the closure of Arkane Austin, the studio responsible for Redfall, active development on the game would cease. In an email to staff, Booty had categorically stated, “Redfall’s previous update will be its last as we end all development on the game.”Also Read: Xbox Game Pass Expands With Day OneAfter the studio closed, the sources disclosed that the independent co-creators, in collaboration with other teams, were working on several new features that preceded the closure. As noted by IGN, the developers had a to-do list encompassing the offline mode, whose popularity peaked after the game launch as it lacked this mode.The media strongly criticized Redfall’s painful first month upon its release in May 2023 due to the absence of action, bad NPC AI, poor performance, and a dull multiplayer experience. Having those post-launch fixes, such as 60 frames-per-second (fps) mode on consoles in its feel, doesn’t have even a little influence on the players’ opinion of it.New hope to make things amend?Above all, after the shocking end of John, Redfall may finally be able to turn all players who have passed harsh judgment on it. Besides an offline regime, a mode not yet built in the initial launch, customers could regard that as a way to resolve their fears regarding the game’s playability once it is removed from online services.The overhaul of the Neighborhood and Nest systems might be one of the main changes that would help improve the game’s open-world feature and try to address at least some of the weaknesses that have made it so harshly criticized. The game pause function proved much like out-of-the-game in single-player mode, another aspect worth mentioning.It is not yet clear whether this future patch will immediately restore the game’s reputation; however, it is a commendable effort by the developers to correct the game’s weaknesses and give players a much more polished experience.A bittersweet farewellThe launch of “Game Update 4” manifests the culmination of an epic project that is now surrendering to a bittersweet hue for both the Redfall people and their dedicated development team. Along with Alpha Dog Studios and Tango Gameworks, the developers of Hi-Fi Rush, the reduction of–AK events at Microsoft resulted in the folding of Roundhouse Games into ZeniMax Online Studios and the closure of Arkane Austin.Also Read: Microsoft’s Studio Shutdowns Spark Outrage as Hi-Fi Rush ShinesBooty added that those shutdowns were to accelerate the transition to focused resources on the high-potential games and bankroll the most-awaited games from the Bethesda franchise that fans have been awaiting for many years.Cryptopolitan reporting by James Kinoti.

Kraken Mulls Delisting Tether’s USDT From EU Market - DailyCoin


        

Tether recently confirmed that the company has no plans to comply with MiCA.



Kraken is preparing for the worst and is actively reviewing Tether’s legal status. 



The exchange shared that it plans to stay compliant with the new regulations. 




Leading crypto exchange Kraken is contemplating whether to end support for Tether’s stablecoin in the European Union as it prepares for the upcoming MiCA regulations set to take effect in July. 



While the new regulations have yet to be finalized, they could challenge USDT’s legitimacy, as regulators emphasize that many stablecoins currently in circulation in Europe have yet to be authorized and regulated. The ambiguity and uncertainty have prompted Kraken to prepare for the worst. 



Kraken Prepares For the Worst



“We’re absolutely planning for all eventualities, including situations where it’s just not tenable to list specific tokens such as USDT,” Marcus Hughes, Kraken’s global head of regulatory strategy, told Bloomberg in an interview, sharing that the exchange was bracing for the impact of the upcoming MiCA regulations.




Hughes added that Kraken is “actively reviewing” Tether’s legal status and will decide once the regulatory “position becomes clearer.”



When asked for comment, Tether assured another publication that it had no plans to delist USDT or alter its trading pairs. However, the stablecoin issuer confirmed it is continually evaluating its global strategies and operations to ensure compliance.



Although the European Banking Authority has yet to finalize the new rules, the current mandate requiring stablecoin issuers to meet increased regulatory requirements could pose significant challenges for the crypto market in the EU, especially given Tether’s stance.



Tether’s Roadblock



Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino recently confirmed that the company has no plans to comply with MiCA regulations in the medium term, expressing concerns about the potential risks and impacts of the new rules.




The stablecoin issuer’s reluctance to comply with the upcoming regulations would render USDT illegal in the EU, which is why exchanges in the bloc are preparing to delist the token. 



Ardoino revealed that Tether was still discussing its concerns with regulators. The CEO is concerned about MiCa enforcing EMIs and credit institutions to legally issue fiat stablecoins in the European Economic Area trading bloc. This means Tether would need to either become an EMI or partner with one to continue offering USDT legally in the European Economic Area.



“That would pose severe risks to stablecoins regulated in the EU,” Ardoino shared on social media, urging regulators to learn from incidents like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and its impact on a major US stablecoin. “If a bank goes bankrupt, uninsured cash goes into bankruptcy,” he added.



Ardoino asserted that stablecoins should be allowed to keep 100% of their reserves in treasury bills, avoiding exposure to potential banking failures and ensuring greater market stability.



However, until MiCA amends its current regulations or Tether announces compliance, USDT’s legal status in the EU is expected to become illegal following July. Therefore, preparing to delist the stablecoin is likely the best course for continuing to operate in the bloc.



On the Flipside




Due to USDT’s lack of interest in complying with the new MiCA rules, OKX has already removed support for the stablecoin in the EU.



MiCA is still being finalized and is expected to be fully implemented by 2025.



USDT issuer Circle is also relocating its operations from the EU to the US.




Why This Matters



Tether’s reluctance to comply with the new MiCA regulations could pose a significant barrier for exchanges and platforms in the EU bloc. As the world’s largest stablecoin with a market cap exceeding $111 billion, delisting it from major exchanges could have far-reaching implications, shaking up the market and potentially disrupting trading activities.

Crypto Influencer 'T.J. Stone' Pleads Guilty To $1M Wire Fraud Scheme | Bitcoinist.com


								In a Brooklyn federal court on Thursday, crypto personality Thomas John Sfraga, also known as “TJ Stone”, pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges for defrauding over a dozen victims out of more than $1.3 million.
Fictitious Scheme Exposed
According to the US Department of Justice, from 2019 to 2022, Sfraga “falsely” presented himself as the owner and principal of several businesses, including Vandelay Contracting Corp. and Build Strong Homes LLC. He also claimed to be a “serial entrepreneur” with experience in real estate development, media relations, podcasting, and cryptocurrencies.

In this capacity, Sfraga allegedly convinced victims, many of them located in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Long Island, to loan him money or invest in what turned out to be fraudulent schemes. 
This included promising high returns of up to 60% within three months for investments in a fictitious cryptocurrency “virtual wallet.”  US Attorney Breon Peace stated:
For years, Sfraga brazenly lied to friends, neighbors, and investors to swindle over $1.3 million of their hard-earned life savings. This Office will continue to hold fraudsters accountable and achieve justice for victims throughout the Eastern District of New York and the United States.
Crypto Schemer Faces 20 Years In Prison
On one occasion, Sfraga reportedly convinced a victim to lend him $100,000 in cash as start-up costs for a “non-existent” major construction project. In reality, the US DOJ alleges that Sfraga simply converted the funds for his expenses to pay off earlier victims and business associates.
Sfraga pleaded guilty to the wire fraud charges before Chief United States Magistrate Judge Lois Bloom. When sentenced, he faces a maximum prison term of 20 years and must pay his victims over $1.33 million in restitution.

The guilty plea was announced by US Attorney Breon Peace and James Smith, Assistant Director-in-Charge of the FBI’s New York Field Office.

Bet Solana-based Memecoin GME Goes Wrong: Trader Capitulates After $122,000 Loss in SOL | Cryptoglobe


                                
A cryptocurrency trader has sold their $GME, a memecoin that saw its price explode on the Solana blockchain after a meme stock frenzy surrounding GameStop resurfaced earlier this month, for a loss of over $122,000 after capitulating.



According to data shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the cryptocurrency trader sold their memecoin that use the same ticker symbol as GameStop – GME – after purchasing them with 1,668 SOL they withdrew from popular cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin.



The trader ended up capitulating after just one day, elling their GME tokens for 465.7 SOL worth around $75,000, to realize a loss of 1,202 SOL after the price of the tokens started plummeting.







The recent meme stock trading frenzy started after a trader central to the 2021 movement, Keith Gill, known on X as RoaringKitty and DFV on Reddit, after he returned to social media from a three-year hiatus that ended after his testimony in Congress.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The trader’s return saw the price of GameStop (NYSE: GME) surge as a wave of retail traders drove up the price of the video game retailer in a move that led to widespread media coverage. The firm’s stock price rally two years ago had a similar effect and even led to a Netflix series, a movie, and considerable financial scrutiny.



The price of GameStop’s shares jumped from little under $17.5 before the rally started to a high of over $55, before enduring a correction that saw them plunged to $27.6 at the time of writing.



AMC Entertainment (NYSE; AMC), a movie theater chain, experienced a similar uplift, as did various lesser-known cryptocurrencies associated with Roaring Kitty and GameStop.



The sharp increase in GameStop’s stock price has resulted in significant losses for short sellers, who had previously bet on a decline. Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3 Partners, told the New York Times that GameStop shorts, which had accumulated $392 million in profits earlier this year, faced losses amounting to $852 million by the end of Monday.

The Alex Labs fund has over $3.9 million frozen in assets in various centralized exchanges after getting targeted in a phishing exploit. Currently, the Alex Labs team is in the process of recovering the assets.Alex Labs recently got targeted with a phishing attack, and the attacker managed to transfer all the stolen funds to numerous centralized exchanges (CEXs). However, under the joint efforts of the exchanges, the accounts associated with the attacker got completely frozen.Also read: Crypto Hacks Drop in AprilHack Details and Alex Labs ResponseAs cybersecurity expert Jane Doe pointed out, Alex Labs’ swift response, along with the cooperation of the CEXs, played a critical role in identifying the attack early and thus reducing its harm.The attack was carried out using private keys, which the attacker obtained via a phishing attack. Right after the breach, the ALEX pool’s administrator formed a vault and gained ownership of assets worth roughly 13.7 million STX tokens. Alex Labs was quick to terminate the attack, and all the CEX accounts of the known attacker were frozen.Also read: How to Protect Your Crypto AssetsCollaboration To Strengthen Fund Recovery The Alex Labs team is closely observing all the exploiter’s wallets.

Exit Liquidity? 80% of Binance's New Tokens Lost Value Despite Market Rally | Cryptoglobe


                                
Investors purchasing the latest cryptocurrency listings on the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance over the last six months would be down by over 18% in the last six months, despite a wide cryptocurrency market rally over that period, as over 80% of these tokens saw their values drop after listing.



According to analysis conducted by cryptocurrency researcher Flow, out of 31 tokens listed on the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance only five – including a memecoin dubbed MEME, the Ordi token (ORDI), Solana-based Jupiter (JUP), Jito (JTO), and Dogwifhat (WIF) – managed to buck the trend and appreciate in value.



The memecoins seemingly managed to appreciate as there’s been an ongoing memecoin trading frenzy in the cryptocurrency space that recently saw the price of several tokens, including WIF, recently surge. Meanwhile ORDI rose as there’s “no tier 1” venture capital backing, while JUP and JTO rose over their momentum on the Solana blockchain.







Per the analyst, the tokens are being listed on Binance with sky-high valuations, with the average fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeding $4.2 billion despite a lack of established user bases, which restricts potential upside.



He added that these tokens end up often serving more as “exit liquidity” for insiders who have already acquired them to capitalize on “retail lack of access to quality early investment opportunities.”







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In simpler terms, these inflated valuations may primarily benefit those who launched the tokens, leaving retail investors holding the bag when prices inevitably drop as “all their upside potential are already taken away.”







Memecoins including PEPE have recently moved to a new all-time high after a meme stock trading frenzy started after a trader central to the 2021 movement, Keith Gill, known on X as RoaringKitty and DFV on Reddit, after he returned to social media from a three-year hiatus that ended after his testimony in Congress.



The trader’s return saw the price of GameStop (NYSE: GME) surge as a wave of retail traders drove up the price of the video game retailer in a move that led to widespread media coverage. The firm’s stock price rally two years ago had a similar effect and even led to a Netflix series, a movie, and considerable financial scrutiny.



The move was accompanied by rises in memecoins in the cryptocurrency space, with various analysts pointing to how DOGE also surged after the 2021 meme stock mania.

Optimism Network Activity Metrics Approach Record Levels, Propelling OP 9% Higher


																Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution Optimism reported a series of strong network metrics in the first quarter (Q1) 2024, with its native OP token surging 9% on the back of this bullish momentum.
Optimism Sees Higher Activity And Rising Transaction Fees
According to a recent Messari report, Optimism’s circulating market cap increased 11% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to $3.7 billion, while its fully diluted market cap rose 1% to $15.7 billion. 
Despite the broader crypto market rally, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) gaining 69% and 53% QoQ, respectively, OP’s market cap ranking slipped from 26th to 39th among all blockchain networks. However, within the Ethereum ecosystem, OP remains one of the top four rollups by market capitalization.

Driving this growth was a significant uptick in Optimism network activity. Daily active addresses reached 89,000 in Q1 2024, a 23% QoQ increase, while daily transactions surged 39% to 470,000 over the same period. These metrics approached, but did not quite reach, their all-time highs in Q3 2023.

The network’s revenue also saw a substantial 78% QoQ increase to $16 million, driven by higher activity and a 48% rise in the average transaction fee to $0.42. However, this average fee dropped significantly in the latter half of March due to the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which reduced L1 submission costs by 99%.
Total Value Locked Jumps 18% In Q1
Despite the fee reduction, Optimism’s on-chain profit for Q1 2024 increased 14% QoQ to $2 million. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) also grew by 18% to $1.2 billion, though its TVL ranking among all networks fell to 11th place.
Within Optimism’s TVL, the DeFi sector dominated, accounting for 86% of active addresses. According to Messari, non-fungible token (NFT) applications and gaming followed with 6.9% and 6.7%, respectively. 
TVL’s leading protocols included Synthetix ($307 million, +4% QoQ), Aave ($270 million, +52% QoQ), and Velodrome ($171 million, +10% QoQ).
Optimism’s stablecoin market capitalization also grew significantly, reaching $809 million (+32% QoQ) by the end of Q1 2024. Circle’s USDC stablecoin and Tether’s USDT made up most of this, with USDT seeing a 64% QoQ surge to $512 million, or 63% of the total stablecoin market cap on Optimism.

OP Rebounds Alongside Crypto Market Resurgence
Despite Optimism’s strong performance across key metrics in Q1 2024, the network’s native token, OP, did not see a corresponding price increase at the end of Q1. Instead, OP followed the broader market downtrend, hitting an annual low of $1.80 just one month after hitting an all-time high of $4.84 in March. 
However, OP has followed suit as the overall cryptocurrency market has seen a resurgence of bullish momentum in the past few days. In the past 24 hours, the token has recorded a 9% price increase and a 3% uptick in the past week, currently trading at $2.56. 
Furthermore, CoinGecko data shows a 19% increase in OP’s trading volume over the past 48 hours, reaching $290 million.

While this renewed bullish sentiment is encouraging, OP still trades 46% below its all-time high and faces significant resistance levels soon before a potential retest of this milestone. 
The first key resistance is at $2.65, followed by $2.90, which must be overcome before the token can push towards the $3.00 level. Conversely, the $2.34 support level has proven crucial and must be monitored closely in case of any bearish resurgence.

TRUMP vs BODEN - Which 'Presidential' token has the advantage now? - AMBCrypto



TRUMP token’s price declined significantly as its popularity waned
BODEN, on the other hand, hiked on the charts

Memecoin frenzy is now part of the 2024 U.S Presidential Elections, with tokens associated with both Biden and Trump seeing significant volatility over the last few days.
TRUMP holders lose money
After weeks of leading this particular chart, TRUMP’s price fell by 11% in just 24 hours. Despite the fall in price, however, the altcoin’s larger market trend has remained positive. In fact, many would see the said episode as an anomaly as outside of the last 24-28 hours, since 09 May, the crypto has hiked significantly while hitting multiple higher highs and higher lows.
That being said, TRUMP’s indicators pointed to a different story.
For instance, the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) fell significantly, indicating that money has been flowing out of its market A falling CMF also underlined the presence of high selling pressure.
Coupled with that, the OBV (On Balance Volume) for TRUMP declined too. A falling OBV indicates that the volume behind an asset’s price movements may be dominated by selling. This can be interpreted as a sign of diminishing bullish sentiment and potential weakness in the price.
Source: Trading View
One of the reasons behind TRUMP’s price falling on the charts would be its declining social volume.
In fact, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the number of social comments around TRUMP fell. Also, the weighted sentiment decreased too, indicating a surge in negativity across all social media platforms.
Source: Santiment
Some positives for TRUMP
It’s worth pointing out, however, that TRUMP’s network growth did hike on the charts. Simply said, the number of new addresses accumulating TRUMP grew.
Additionally, the velocity at which TRUMP was being traded appreciated too.
Taken together, these factors could help TRUMP see a change in its price trajectory going forward.
Source: Santiment
BODEN, on the other hand, has been doing relatively well. In the last 7 days alone, the BODEN’s price has risen by 40.40%. At press time, BODEN was trading at $0.4347.
With the actual elections still a few months away, only time will tell which of these “Presidential” tokens does best.

zkSync Fuels June Airdrop Rumors With V24 Upgrade Announcement - DailyCoin


        

zkSync is getting set for a pivotal upgrade.



The announcement of the coming upgrade has sparked speculation of a summer airdrop.



The new protocol release will bring several major changes to the network.




Airdrops are all the rage again. While the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem has already seen its fair share of these airdrops, there still appears to be more to come.




In January 2024, Manta Pacific distributed its MANTA token, and in February 2024, Starknet distributed STRK. Following these distributions, a recent upgrade announcement has sparked speculation that zkSync, the Matter Labs-developed zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup, could be next.



zkSync Set to Hand Over Governance to the Community



In an X post on Friday, May 17, the zkSync team disclosed that it was gearing up to roll out v24, its final upgrade, before handing over the network to the community. The team added that it expected the final pieces for the upgrade to fall in place by the end of June 2024.







The announcement has sparked significant talk of a potential token distribution at the end of June 2024. This is because blockchain governance typically requires network participants to delegate tokens to vote for protocol changes.



Rumors of a zkSync airdrop have been circulating since the network launched in early 2023, with the speculation often helping to drive up the network metrics.



What the zkSync V24 Release Brings to the Table



The zkSync v24 release is slated to bring eight significant changes. These changes include:




A new feature that would allow for wallets that rely on devices like Apple’s Secure Enclave and Android Keychain instead of requiring users to memorize long seed phrases.



The zkSync Bridgehub: A feature that will set the groundwork for interoperability between ZK Stack chains.



New features to set the foundation for validium ZK Stack chains with a custom data availability layer.




At the time of writing, L2Beat data suggests that zkSync Era is the eighth largest Ethereum Layer 2 by TVL with $810 million.
