Dogecoin Co-Creator, Elon Musk Join Tributes To Kabosu's Death, Ascension To Heaven To Be With Harambe: 'Will Live Forever In Our Hearts' - Benzinga

The iconic Kabosu Shiba Inu dog that inspired the Doge meme and subsequent launch of Dogecoin DOGE/USD has died at the age of 18.Tributes for the dog that inspired the community to "do only good everyday" poured in on Friday.What Happened: After recovering from being "very dangerously" ill back in 2022, the beloved Shiba Inu passed away, according to a social media account affiliated with the dog.Tributes are being posted for the dog who inspired several cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD. The dog became an internet sensation thanks to an iconic picture that evolved into one of the most recognized memes globally.Elon Musk is known for sharing his love for Dogecoin on social media from time to time. Early Friday morning he responded to a post about Kabosu's death.Later in the day, Musk shared a meme from Not the Bee that featured Kabosu and Harambe, a well-known gorilla from the Cincinnati Zoo who died in 2016."OG Doge has ascended to heaven to be with his friend Harambe," Musk tweeted.Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus shared several pictures and a video of Kabosu in a tribute."Kabosu will live on forever in our hearts," Marcus tweeted.Floki Inu FLOKI/USD, which is based on Musk's Shiba Inu, showed their support Friday."Kabosu's legacy lives on in Floki! She will be missed!" the account tweeted.The Floki account also said they will "march on" and "continue the legacy" created by Kabosu.The official Dogecoin account on X took time to share a tribute Friday."The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable. She was a being who knew only happiness and limitless love. Please keep her spirit and her family in your heart, and most importantly carry her with you as your story continues," the account tweeted.Cryptocurrency Solana SOL/USD also posted a tribute to Kabosu."RIP, Kabosu. So life, much success, such fluff," the account tweeted.Own the Doge, which is the community that owns the iconic Doge meme, paid tribute on X."Today, we come together with heavy hearts to bid farewell to an internet legend, an embodiment of joy, and a symbol of kindness – Doge, the beloved Shiba Inu known as Kabosu. The Doge who touched millions of hearts is now one amongst the stars, wagging her tail looking down at the legacy she has left," the account tweeted.The X account of WeRateDogs, which previously rated Kabosu, shared a touching tribute Friday and handed out a final rating."For her lasting legacy on internet culture, the legend Kabosu receives our highest honor, a 15/10," the account tweeted.Related Link: From Dogecoin Meme To Twitter Icon: 5 Little-Known Things About The 18-Year-Old Crypto Canine SensationWhy It's Important: The tweet by Musk of the meme of Harambe with Kabosu caused a brief spike in the price of Dogecoin.The connection between Kabosu and Harambe shouldn't be a huge surprise to any who have followed Musk for years as he's a fan of both internet legends.In 2019, Musk released a surprise rap song titled "RIP Harambe," which he joked was his finest work."RIP Harambe, sipping on some Bombay, we on our way to heaven, amen, amen," the song says in autotune.Likely not a surprise to the cryptocurrency community, someone created a Harambe and Kabosu inspired coin after Musk's tweet. The coin named KabosuwifHarambe has the ticker HEAVEN built on the Solana blockchain.Benzinga also shared that a trader who accumulated billions of the coin KABOUS throughout the year may have been "betting on the dog's death." When the coin spiked Monday, the trader sold the coin for a profit of $230,000.Kabosu was rescued by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato in November 2009. Sato took pictures of the dog in a random photoshoot and shared several online.The photos eventually made their way on Reddit and the rest is history. The meme"Never in a million years would I have imagined the impact that my photoshoot of Kabosu would have on the internet," Kabosu's owner previously wrote on Instagram.Read Next: 2021 Was The Year Of Dogecoin: A Month By Month Retrospective With Top StoriesPhoto: milan2102/Shutterstock

$3,400,000 Will Be Sent To Struggling Families As 'No Strings Attached' Income Program Launches on East Coast: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A nonprofit is preparing to hand out millions of dollars over the next two years in a new guaranteed basic income program.
New York City-based homeless shelter operator Win has launched a program that aims to assist homeless families with young children, handing out monthly cash payments for two years to help them get out of shelters faster, the Gothamist reports.










Win is the largest family shelter and supportive housing provider in New York City with 450 housing units in its portfolio. The pilot program will start in its central Brooklyn shelters.
Under the program, 100 families will be selected to receive $17,000 a year, distributed in monthly cash payments via debit cards. A family must have a child younger than two years old and be eligible for shelter to qualify.
There are no strings attached to the payments and the families can use the money in any way they see fit. Researchers from Vanderbilt University will document the program’s impact for five years.
Says Christine Quinn, CEO of Win,
“That’s really kind of like the secret sauce – you’re getting this money with no strings attached, but what is attached to it is a statement of belief in you, a statement that we know you’re the quarterback of your family, and you’re going to use this to help your family… That type of commitment, that type of sincerity is rarely bestowed upon homeless mothers.”
The program comes a year after New York was found to have the largest homeless population in the US. The New York Times reported that there were over 100,000 people in shelters in NYC, partially driven by the large influx of migrants.
Earlier this year, a controversial pilot program went live handing out pre-paid credit cards to 500 migrant families.
Each recipient is getting about $350 a month to spend on food and baby supplies, which is more money than low income residents are given through the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), reports Newsweek.
Dozens of other guaranteed income programs have launched across the US, designed to test the benefits of giving direct aid to people who are struggling to make ends meet.

Here's Why Ondo Finance's ONDO Token Soared to New ATH, Defying Market Sentiment


																Ondo Finance, a platform dedicated to tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) and backed by Pantera Capital, witnessed a surge in the value of its Ondo Finance (ONDO) token.
The coin soared nearly 20%, reaching an all-time high of $1.15 on May 24, 2024. This milestone was perhaps largely driven by Coinbase’s addition of ONDO to its perpetual market.
Performance and Future Outlook
DefiLlama data shows that the ONDO token’s increase over the past 24 hours has pushed its market capitalization beyond $1.6 billion. On May 21, Ondo Finance also achieved a peak total value locked (TVL) of $453 million, its highest level ever.
IntoTheBlock data also reveals a 52.3% rise in large transaction volumes for ONDO, with all holders currently in a profitable position. The concentration of large holders is significantly high at 92%, with around 63% of investors maintaining their tokens for periods between one and twelve months.
Since mid-March, ONDO’s price fluctuated between $0.97 and $0.69 but broke out on Friday. A 10% rally ended the consolidation, pushing ONDO to an initial record high of $1.05. Now in a price discovery phase, investors expect the bullish momentum to continue driving it upward. As of this writing, ONDO is currently oscillating around the ATH price of $1.15, and its TVL is $445 million.




Catalysts and Market Sentiment
The rally came amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Even though the green light has had a controversial impact on the rest of the market, ONDO is among the top performers on a daily scale.
Since its launch earlier this year, ONDO has seen strong demand and has rallied over 1,300% from its all-time low.
Another major catalyst behind the ONDO price rally could be related to Coinbase’s addition of the asset to its perpetual market. According to the announcement, trading has started for ONDO-PERP, PYTH-PERP, and ZETA-PERP on the perpetual markets.


The exchange’s platforms, Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced are now fully operational for trading and offer various order types, such as limit, market, stop, and stop-limit orders. Initially, the ONDO-PERP, PYTH-PERP, and ZETA-PERP markets will enter post-only mode on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced.
Following the announcement, several market traders have issued bullish calls for ONDO. One emphasized that ONDO represents a potent “ETH beta” set for attention soon.
Another predicts an upcoming surge in the “real-world-asset narrative,” highlighting ONDO’s noteworthy performance, ranking closely behind leading Layer 1 platforms and meme tokens this week. Additionally, a crypto trader suggested that investing in ONDO presents a good alternative for those unable to acquire securitized tokens, calling it the next best option.

Ethereum ETF Selloff Triggers $300 Million Crypto Long Flush


								Data shows that a lot of long liquidations have piled up on exchanges after the Ethereum ETF approval, which was a sell-the-news event.
Ethereum Price Has Been Down Since Spot ETFs Gained Approval
Yesterday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally gave the green light on all eight Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were awaiting approval.
Spot ETFs are basically investment vehicles that provide a way to gain indirect exposure to ETH’s price movements without actually owning any tokens.

ETFs are available through means that traditional investors would be familiar with, so those who don’t want to bother with cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets could decide to invest in the asset through them.
The market had been anticipating this event, just like the Bitcoin spot ETF approval back in January. In BTC’s case, the inflows through the ETFs eventually fueled a rally towards a new all-time high (ATH).
When the Bitcoin ETFs had just been approved, though, the investors initially showed a selling reaction, which resulted in the cryptocurrency registering a significant drawdown.
It would appear that the Ethereum spot ETF approval has also been met with some selling so far, as coins across the sector have been in the red over the past 24 hours. Ethereum itself is down more than 5% in the window.

Despite the decline, Ethereum investors would still be holding notable profits, as the coin at its current price of $3,700 is still up over 23% in the past week.
It would appear that the approval and the subsequent selloff may have caught the market off-guard, as the derivatives side has registered some large liquidations in the last 24 hours.
$384 Million In Cryptocurrency Contracts Found Liquidation In Past Day
According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency derivatives market has observed a mass flush during the past day. The below table shows what the numbers have looked like.

As is visible, over $384 million in cryptocurrency contracts have seen forceful closure during this period. More than $297 million of these liquidations involved the long holders alone.
This means these investors betting on a bullish outcome made up 77% of the flush. This naturally lines up, as the overall price volatility in the past day has been towards the downside.

It’s also not surprising that Ethereum, which has been the focus of attention recently, contributed the largest share to this liquidation squeeze, as the heatmap below reveals.

At more than $150 million liquidations, Ethereum has managed to significantly outdo Bitcoin, which has seen contracts worth $74 million flushed down.

JPMorgan Talks About The Approved Ethereum Spot ETFs And The Future Of Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin Sistemi

JPMorgan predicts that trading of the recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs will begin much earlier than November. The company views the approval of these ETFs and the overall cryptocurrency market as increasingly political issues, especially ahead of the 2024 US presidential election.
“We expect trading of the Spot ETH ETF to begin before November,” a team of JPMorgan analysts led by Kenneth Worthington said in a report published today.


On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved forms 19b-4 of eight spot Ethereum ETF applications. These include Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Fidelity and Franklin.
All approvals were granted in a single mass order. However, these ETFs' S-1 filings are still awaiting SEC approval before trading can begin. Many analysts predict that trading will begin in the coming weeks.





The SEC's approval of ETH ETFs comes after it reconvened with stakeholders earlier this week after months of deliberations.
The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs likely occurred because issuer companies removed staking-related language from their 19b-4 forms. Staking is a contentious issue between fund issuers and the SEC. It remains unclear whether an issuer staking ETH on behalf of an ETF investor creates an investment contract and therefore a security under the Howey test.



“Discussions around staking are likely to continue, as we understand that the focus right now is whether these issuers will be able to keep such staking rewards for themselves,” JPMorgan analysts said.
The approval of the ETH ETF coincided with the US House of Representatives passing the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, also known as the FIT 21 bill. Analysts said the following on the subject:






“But the bill has less chance of passing the Senate, and the Biden administration has said it does not support the bill, but has not yet threatened a veto.”

Bitcoin is worth $69,000 - unless you’re an FTX creditor


Unfortunately, it’s not looking good for FTX customers looking to raise the tragically low bitcoin price that the bankruptcy estate will use to calculate their repayments.
Yesterday, a US bankruptcy judge denied a victim’s request to use a higher price than $16,871. Specifically, the judge denied Australian Bitcoin miner NuGenesis Ou’s request to vacate a January 31 ruling that set the USD calculation date for crypto asset pricing to November 11, 2022.
On a separate and unrelated issue, NuGenesis also complained about FTX calculating the price of its proprietary token, NuCoin, at $0 as of November 11, 2022. More relevant to most customers who simply owned bitcoin or major altcoins, however, is that the bankruptcy judge denied NuGenesis’ request to move the USD calculation date away from November 11, 2022 for any crypto asset.
NuGenesis’ attorney argued that the company didn’t receive its legally required notice of the November 11, 2022 date. However, FTX attorneys argued — and prevailed in this argument — that the bitcoin miner was fully aware of FTX’s petition to use that date. The US Bankruptcy Court judge ruled that “there was no evidence supporting the excusable neglect,” as alleged by NuGenesis.
On January 31, Delaware’s US Bankruptcy Court ruled that FTX’s bankruptcy estate may repay customers based on bitcoin’s price on November 11, 2022: $16,871. With FTX’s bankruptcy estate still holding onto customers’ bitcoin that is now worth quadruple that figure ($68,100 as of press time), it is easy to see how FTX can claim to be repaying nearly all customers ‘in full.’

Full USD but 1/4th the bitcoin to FTX customers
Ironically, while boasting that it will repay customers ‘in full’ despite only giving them roughly one-quarter of their actual bitcoin back, FTX bankruptcy lawyers and other experts have earned over $320 million in fees over the last 15 months. 
According to this bankruptcy technicality, customers will only receive the USD equivalent value of their crypto holdings plus nominal USD interest as of the November 2022 bankruptcy petition date when one bitcoin was worth just $16,871.
The math for most other crypto assets is similarly disappointing. Ether has trebled since the bankruptcy, Dogecoin has doubled, XRP is up 50%, and Solana is up 10X. Customers holding any crypto asset will only receive repayment based on its USD value on November 11, 2022.
Although the judge admitted that other victims might have the right to challenge the $16,871 bitcoin price, this particular miner has lost its request to vacate that ruling. With several months already elapsed since the bankruptcy court set that price and no meaningful challengers able to raise it, it’s looking increasingly likely that FTX’s victims will only be receiving roughly one-quarter of their bitcoin back as of today’s much higher bitcoin price.
Somewhat embarrassingly, that is ‘full’ repayment, according to this bankruptcy proceeding.

Analysts Predict ETH Price Will Shoot to at Least $6,000 Following ETF Approval - The Defiant

Breaching the previous all-time high of $4,800 is only a matter of time, analysts say.The path has cleared for Ethereum to break its previous all-time high and climb to at least $6,000 after the U.S. securities regulator approved the spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund, analysts say.Ethereum’s native token Ether already roared upward in price in the prelude to the approval. The token is up 27% in the past 14 days, now trading for $3,716, although it dropped 3% along with the rest of the market in what seems like a “sell the news” event.Michael Van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading, said ETH is set to climb another 60% to at least $6,000 in the upcoming months.“If Ethereum runs to 0.08 BTC in the upcoming period and Bitcoin stabilizes at the current price levels or makes a slightly higher all-time high, price predictions for Ethereum could be between $5,500-6,500 per Eth,” Van de Poppe said.Institutional Investors' Inflows And after months of sluggish token appreciation–and tension regarding whether the ETF approval would be granted–Thursday’s move from the SEC is a welcome sign for Ethereum holders.Investors speculate spot ETH ETFs will drive billions of dollars of inflows from institutional investors who would rather hold an ETF, which uses traditional financial infrastructure, than hold cryptocurrency directly. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $40 billion in assets since their approval in January, according to data by The Block.QPC & Standard CharteredSingapore-based crypto investment firm QPC Capital has also touted the potential for a 60% price rally. In a Thursday Telegram broadcast, the firm said that if the Ethereum ETF were to follow Bitcoin ETF flows after it’s January approval, Ether could see a $6,000 price tag.Standard Chartered’s target is higher, predicting ETH could reach $8,000 by the end of this year and $14,000 by 2025, according to a research note published before the ETF approval, last week.“It’s unclear how much Ethereum is going to accelerate. However, a new all-time high is on the horizon after the listing has been taking place,” added Van de Poppe.Long PositionsHis views echoed those of Co-Chief Investment Officer of Transform Holdings, a digital asset firm, Wes Levitt.Levitt also told The Defiant he is also expecting a price tag likely in the $6,000 range.“The start of ETH ETFs trading (not just the rumors of it) should be enough of a catalyst to push ETH to a new all-time high,” Levitt said. “If inflows are similar to those of the BTC ETFs, which have seen enormous success among investors, then price is expected to soar.Both Van de Poppe and Levitt claimed that investors should position themselves long Ethereum for the foreseeable future. Von Poppe, in fact, unveiled that his portfolio is favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin, especially considering the former has been slower to appreciate.

Democrats Urged, But Not Forced, to Oppose Pro-Crypto Bills FIT21 and CBDC Act



                    

Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives are not mandated to vote against two upcoming pro-crypto bills, though they are strongly advised to do so.



A May 20 email from Democratic Party leaders to House members, shared by Politico, indicates the party has not insisted on a “no” vote for the Republican-led Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, known as H.R. 4763 and H.R. 5403, respectively.




Both bills are seen as favorable to the crypto industry if passed. FIT21 would clarify the classification process for cryptocurrencies as either commodities or securities, primarily placing regulatory control with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).



The U.S. crypto industry and lobbyists back this bill, with 60 companies advocating for its passage in a May 16 letter.



The CBDC act aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency.




However, the email noted that Representatives Maxine Waters and David Scott “strongly oppose” FIT21, and Waters also opposes the CBDC act. 



Politico later obtained a letter from the pair urging a vote against FIT21.



“House Democratic leaders said today they will NOT whip against House Republicans’ crypto bill, I’m told,” Politico reporter Eleanor Mueller wrote on X, referring to FIT21.



In the email, Democratic leaders expressed concerns about parts of the bill, particularly its provision for trading digital commodities in the secondary market if they were initially offered as investment contract securities under the SEC’s Howey test.

“This language undermines decades of legal precedent and case law, thereby creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market,” the email stated.



Leaders argued the bill “weakens investor protections and opens the door to fraud and market manipulation” by providing a “safe harbor” for entities to register intent, effectively shielding them from the SEC until crypto rules are finalized by both the SEC and CFTC.



Meanwhile, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC, even in pilot programs.



Democratic leaders contend that stopping CBDCs could undermine the “primacy of the U.S. dollar,” as other countries with CBDCs seek to evade sanctions.



“According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the bill’s overly broad definition of CBDC raises concerns the bill could undermine the Fed’s ability to conduct monetary policy,” the email added. “Particularly concerning as it attempts to navigate a soft landing in regard to inflation.”



Floor debate and passage of FIT21 are expected on Wednesday, May 22, according to Politico’s Mueller.

Digesting the ETH ETF decision: What it means and what comes next - Blockworks


Spot ether ETFs are not launching today — and they might not hit the market any time soon. 
But Thursday marked a win for crypto fund issuers, particularly considering how many expected the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule against such products just a week ago.
In case your internet has been down for the last 16 or so hours, the SEC approved rule changes submitted by the stock exchanges on which ether ETFs would list.  
Fund groups now with a path to approval include VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, Ark Invest, Franklin Templeton and Invesco. 
Some industry watchers also noted the apparent clarity the decision offers in terms of ether’s status as a commodity. 
The agency greenlighting the so-called 19b-4 documents is a big step toward these funds launching, but not the only one. Next up, the SEC also needs to sign off on registration statements, known as S-1s, submitted by the fund issuers. 
Some have attributed the potential delay between these two actions to the fact that the SEC’s 19b-4 approval appeared to reflect a rather sudden, politically motivated change of stance. 
Read more: Politics, amendments, staking: Making sense of the ether ETF developments 
Whereas the agency’s Division of Trading and Markets ruled on the 19b-4, its Division of Corporation Finance handles the S-1 review.
Ramped-up engagement between the SEC and fund issuers this week indicates a possible SEC about-face that could signal the Corporation Finance unit is in catch-up mode. 
Such conversations in the days leading up to the SEC’s decision deadline resulted in 19b-4 amendments on Tuesday and Wednesday clarifying that the US spot ether ETFs would not stake their holdings. 
Put simply, ether ETFs are not cleared to launch, despite what might be out there in the ether (pun intended — we try to keep it light on Friday).
But it appears just a matter of time before such products are able to trade.
The next steps and when these could launch
The S-1 approval process is set to involve comments issued by the SEC and responses from fund issuers. While the SEC has a 240-day window to consider 19b-4 proposals, there is no specific deadline associated with the S-1 review. 
A source familiar with the matter told Blockworks “it’s really hard to put odds on timing” of how it will play out, noting that the SEC’s corporation finance unit has not yet made its view clear on the ether ETF proposals. 
The SEC did not immediately return a request for comment.
Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in a Thursday X post he expects the process could take anywhere from two weeks to several months. 
“Obviously this situation is nothing like anything that’s happened historically [in my opinion],” Seyffart added.Fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas indicated he believes it could take four to six weeks before we see an SEC comment letter related to the ether ETF S-1s. 
The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance had worked with prospective spot bitcoin ETF fund issuers on their S-1s for roughly three months before clearing those in January, Seyffart explained in a Friday X Space.  
Katherine Dowling, general counsel at Bitwise Asset Management, noted in the same X Space that the SEC — when reviewing S-1s — is tasked with ensuring the proper disclosures are in place for the investing public. 
There was consistent back-and-forth between the SEC and fund issuers on the spot bitcoin ETF S-1s, which resulted in a number of amendments prior to those funds being approved. Dowling said she expects the same with the ether products.
“Even though some of that groundwork will have been accomplished already through the spot bitcoin process, there are still differences,” the Bitwise executive added. “There are a number of additional risk disclosures, polishing, et cetera that will, and should, go on.”  
While VanEck filed an amended S-1 late Thursday, it appears no other issuers have submitted one since the 19b-4 approval. 
A person familiar with the filings told Blockworks they expect amended S-1s from the other fund groups to hit late next week. The SEC’s comments on those will be telling as to how long the process could take from there, the person added.
Another question has been the order in which these funds could launch, or if the full slate of proposed spot ether ETFs would ultimately come to market at once (as the SEC allowed with spot bitcoin ETFs).
VanEck first filed for a spot ether ETF in 2021 and re-upped that bid in September around the same time as Ark Invest and 21Shares. Other fund groups later followed suit.

“The commission believes that it is appropriate to approve all of the proposals at the same time in order to foster competition by potentially providing investors with several spot ether-based ETPs from which to choose,” the SEC’s Thursday 19b-4 approval order states.
Order proves ether is a commodity?  
Some segment observers predicted that the SEC’s unclear stance on whether ETH is a security or commodity could prove a barrier to ether ETF approval.
In a 2018 speech, William Hinman — then-director of the SEC’s division of corporation finance — said “current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.”
SEC Chair Gary Gensler did not give a clear answer when asked if ETH was a security or a commodity during a House Financial Services Committee meeting in April 2023.
Read more: With ether ETF decision imminent, a timeline of how we got here
Variant Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted earlier this week that SEC approval of spot ether ETFs would likely mean the agency does not view unstaked ETH a security, calling such a scenario “a major policy move.”
While the Thursday 19b-4 order does not explicitly detail the SEC’s stance on ether’s status as a commodity or security, the products are registered as commodity-based trust shares.
“Today’s approval signals that the SEC views that ETH is a commodity and not a security — contrary to the position it continued to take prior to the events of this week,” a Consensys spokesperson said in a statement.  
Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, filed a lawsuit against the US securities regulator last month, claiming the agency seeks to regulate ETH as a security.
Despite welcoming the ether ETF 19b-4 approval, the Consensys representative pointed to the SEC’s continued “troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets.” 
“We will continue to fight for definitive regulatory clarity in our case and we are pleased to see the tremendous bipartisan Congressional effort seeking to provide clear and sensible regulation,” the spokesperson added. 
Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal also pointed to what he interpreted as regulatory clarity within the 19b-4 order.
“ETH is effectively deemed a commodity as we’ve always known it to be,” Grewal said in an X post. 
The SEC last year sued the crypto exchange — set to be a custodian for several of the planned spot ether ETFs — for allegedly engaging in unregistered securities offerings.
Coinbase noted the Thursday ether ETF 19b-4 approval in its latest request on Friday to file an interlocutory appeal.

“These approvals enshrine the SEC’s position in 2018 — ETH is not a security,” said a16z crypto general counsel Miles Jennings. “That means the SEC has formally recognized that decentralization moves tokens outside of the US securities law regime.”

Popular Trader's PEPE Bag 'Would Have Been Worth 8 Figures' Now, But He Had To Sell In 2023: 'Times Were Hard' - Benzinga

Renowned crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa shared a personal story of his experience with Pepe PEPE/USD, offering valuable insights into the challenges and lessons of crypto trading.What Happened: Sherpa reminisces about his early investment in PEPE when its market capitalization was only $10 million. Despite the bear market affecting altcoins and facing losses in other investments, he confesses that holding onto PEPE till today would have been immensely profitable. "Had I held to today without selling, it would have been worth 8 figures," he reflects.The trader reveals that he managed to sell near the peak in 2023, securing a solid profit. "I diamond-handed the majority and still had a great win," he stated. The proceeds from this trade enabled him to invest in real estate.However, he mentions that he kept a portion of PEPE, which he planned to hold long-term. Unfortunately, when the developers capitulated on the project, he decided to sell the remaining amount. "That amount would have been worth 7 figures at this point," he explains.Price Action: In the past 24 hours, Pepe is up 2.2% to trade at $0.00001407, taking its weekly gains to 38.8%.Also Read: PEPE Up 16% On The Week: It Won’t ‘Flip DOGE’ But ‘Should Go Up More Relatively,’ Trader Points OutWhy It Matters: Altcoin Sherpa emphasizes the inevitability of selling too early or too late in crypto trading. "If you’re in crypto long enough, you’re going to have absolutely stellar potential plays, where you sold too early or too late. It happens," he notes.Despite missing out on potentially larger gains, his pragmatic approach highlights the importance of being content with profitable outcomes and the need for emotional resilience. He also notes how financial stability can influence trading decisions.He stresses the importance of moving beyond past regrets and focusing on future opportunities. "The faster that you can get over the ‘what ifs', the faster you can move forward and take advantage of what you can control," he advises, offering encouragement to fellow traders.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Pepe Up 5%, Should ‘Retest All-Time Highs This Week,’ Says TraderThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

'Guild of Guardians' Review: The Perfect Ethereum Game to Play While Taking a Poo - Decrypt

Games have to find you at the right time. Well, this Ethereum game found me on the toilet.My favorite gaming experiences have come when a game is enjoyable and perfectly fits into my life. Think Bloodborne finding me cooped up inside during the pandemic, or co-op gem It Takes Two when I wanted to bond with my partner.Guild of Guardians meets you in those natural breaks in your day—as you're taking a suspiciously long toilet break at work, waiting for the bus, or cooking dinner. This mobile fantasy game has enough complexity to keep you interested, yet thankfully packs a quick enough gameplay loop to easily pick up and put down.Screenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.Fight through dungeonsGuild of Guardians is a mobile trading card game on iOS and Android that draws from the rogue-lite and auto-battler genres for an addictive and convenient gameplay experience.You'll battle your way through dungeons, completing each one up to three times for maximum experience points and loot so that you can continue upgrading your squad. Every dungeon has multiple rooms full of enemies that you need to battle in order to get the final reward. Each room likewise has a range of enemies, loot boxes, and the odd neutral ground to heal or level up your gear.You start off being able to field three guardians, gradually adding more as you level up. These range from tanks to mages and support guardians, and it's critical to make sure your squad has a balanced combination of attributes. Once you’ve picked your party of guardians, you’ll carefully select your formation, ensuring to put the tanks at the front—and then click fight.Taking inspiration from auto-battlers like Riot’s Teamfight Tactics (TFT), your guardians will fight automatically for you. In Guild of Guardians, however, you choose when each one casts their ultimate ability. This strikes a great balance between being passive enough to play in the natural lulls of your day while still being engaging—and requiring at least a little attention.Screenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.As you pass through the rooms of each dungeon, you’re asked to select a rune which will give you a slight buff going forward. Sometimes you have the misfortune of picking up a “curse of fate,” which will buff your enemy and make them more powerful. This gives enough variety to each run of a dungeon, as I adjust my strategy based on my squad and the runes I’ve picked up.This whole loop doesn’t take more than a few minutes at a time, with lots of downtime to put the phone down, continue on with real life, and then return. This is why it’s perfect for those natural pauses in your day.My only complaint when it comes to the core gameplay is that “domain synergies”—and how they interact with each other—feel hidden. Even once you search it out, it doesn’t feel wholly clear or unique. It appears that having a number of characters from the same “domain” slightly buffs your team, but the buff is fairly similar for each domain… so it feels slightly redundant.In other auto-battlers, this is often the most interesting part of the game—so I’d love to see Guild of Guardians develop out some complexity here, such as synergies that grant healing, the ability to stun, or something else unique.Pimp out your partyAfter completing a few dungeons, you’ve probably collected enough resources to start really crafting a team that works for you. Guild of Guardians has a pretty extensive character leveling and gear system that takes just as much as, if not more attention than the dungeon clearing. Each guardian has its own level going up to 30, which influences their health, attack, defense, as well as what skills they have available to unlock.On top of this, you’re able to equip each character with gear such as armor, a wizard hat, or an ax to boost certain statistics. This all feels pretty intuitive, and when it’s not, the game thankfully holds your hand through it.Screenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.Until this point, I had not interacted with any crypto or NFT elements. I’d played the game every day for almost a week, progressing through the game just fine without any Web3 components. Once you sign into your Immutable Passport wallet, however, using a simple Gmail sign-in option, new benefits come your way.Most notably, you’re able to “ascend” your guardians, which gives them a 30% boost across the board. By doing this, you’re turning the guardian into an NFT on the Ethereum scaling network Immutable zkEVM, allowing you to sell them on the secondary marketplace.You can currently purchase the resources required to ascend a guardian for $6.99 for 40 Ascension Seals, but you can also earn them by topping leaderboards. How many seals are required varies depending on how popular the guardian is—but from what I saw, 31 Ascension Seals would do the job for most purple-rarity guardians. Before doing this, Guild of Guardians game director Chris Clay encouraged me during a Zoom call to level my guardians up as much as possible. Ascending your guardians should be the last step in powering up your guardian, and a way for you to lock in the value you’ve put into the game.As someone who has put countless hours (as well as a painful amount of money) into games that give nothing back, I like the idea of being able to sell my assets when I decide I don’t want to play anymore—the Web3 element of this game enables that.Guild of Guardians has a brilliantly addictive gameplay loop. You’ll dive into dungeons attempting to get all the loot at the end. Failed to make it there? Then use any loot you can find to level up your squad, craft gear, or unlock new guardians to take you to that next level.Now when I’m sitting on the throne, I’m not doom-scrolling on Twitter. I’m leveling up my guardians, fighting skeletons in the dungeons, and grinding to one day ascend my whole party in Guild of Guardians.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

The Unintended Consequences of FIT21’s Crypto Market Structure Bill

The bill's proposed bifurcated market for restricted and unrestricted digital assets ignores fungibility as a fundamental characteristic of crypto tokens. By creating categories of restricted and unrestricted assets, the bill disrupts this principle, leading to confusion and market fragmentation. This could impair liquidity, complicate transactions and risk management mechanisms such as derivatives, reduce the overall utility of the crypto tokens and ultimately stifle innovation in a nascent industry.

Binance Announces Upcoming Support for New DeFi Altcoin on the Megadrop Token Launch Platform - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto exchange Binance just unveiled the second digital asset that will be supported on its new token launch platform.
In April, the crypto titan launched Binance Megadrop, a platform with airdrops and Web3 quests that gives users early access to assets that are not yet listed on its exchange.










The first crypto project on the token launch platform is the native Bitcoin (BTC) restaking chain BounceBit.
In a new statement, Binance says Megadrop will now feature the asset of open-source liquidity protocol Lista (LISTA).
Lista says it enables users to earn yields on collateralized crypto assets such as BNB and stablecoins and borrow the project’s Lista USD (lisUSD), a new type of asset known as “destablecoin” that uses decentralized and liquid-staked crypto assets as collateral only.
Lista’s destablecoin is not designed to achieve absolute price stability with fiat currencies, but it’s also not supposed to be a fully volatile asset.
“The intent behind Lista DAO is to propose a solution to the capital efficiency problem of overcollateralized stablecoins experience by allowing users to leverage their funds with a collateral debt position (CDP).”
Lista says it is native to the BNB Chain ecosystem but it has plans to expand to multiple chains.

London Stock Exchange Faces Staffing Crisis Amid Plans For Crypto ETPs Debut


								As the London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) prepares to list its inaugural crypto-linked products, it faces a significant hurdle: the loss of half its four-person team responsible for “overseeing’ exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Key departures include Michael Stanley, head of exchange-traded products, and Hetal Patel, head of business development, who have played pivotal roles in the ETF team.

Crypto ETPs Gaining Ground In The UK
The timing is particularly sensitive as the LSE gears up to introduce its first exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to cryptocurrencies, marking a significant milestone in integrating crypto assets into mainstream financial markets.
As Bloomberg reported, these exits could complicate the LSE’s ongoing projects. The departures have reportedly made it challenging for the exchange to provide clear feedback on technical issues to crypto ETP issuers.
The introduction of crypto ETPs on the LSE follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) recent approval of the first set of such products in the United Kingdom. Notably, WisdomTree Inc. has received authorization to list two physically backed crypto ETPs that will track Bitcoin and Ethereum.
These ETPs, set to begin trading on May 28, represent a significant development for the UK’s financial markets, which have traditionally been cautious about crypto-related investment products.
Unlike the broader accessibility in markets like the United States and Hong Kong, these UK-listed crypto ETPs will be restricted to only “professional investors.”
This cautious approach reflects ongoing regulatory efforts that appear to balance the potential benefits of innovative investment products with the need to protect less experienced investors from potential volatility and losses.
Comparative Insights From The US And Hong Kong Markets
The global landscape for crypto ETFs shows varied investor behavior. Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States have demonstrated strong performance, with a notable trend of positive net inflows. In contrast, Hong Kong’s similar products of ETFs have seen quite the opposite performance.
Particularly, data from SoSoValue shows that US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a nine-day streak of net inflows, accumulating $107.91 million as of yesterday. This marks the longest stretch of positive inflows since a ten-day streak observed in mid-March.
Conversely, the situation in Hong Kong presents a stark contrast. The region’s spot Bitcoin ETFs have faced challenges, with the three approved funds experiencing a net outflow of 25.63 BTC on the same Thursday, according to data from SosoValue.

This outflow was entirely from a fund managed by China Asset Management. Meanwhile, the spot Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong saw no new flows after recording an inflow of 62.8 ETH on the previous Wednesday.
The combined net assets of the three spot Bitcoin ETFs were $254.74 million, and the spot ETH ETFs had net assets of $50.83 million.
These divergent trends between the US and Hong Kong highlight differing investor sentiments and market dynamics in these regions, reflecting localized responses to global cryptocurrency movements.

Trader Says Top-10 Altcoin Primed To Surge 500% ‘Eventually,’ Updates Outlook on Ethereum and Pepe - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that one top-10 altcoin will eventually see a 500% rise while updating his outlook on smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) and memecoin Pepe (PEPE).
In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,200 followers on the social media platform X that meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) will eventually hit $1.










“Jeets might be selling you today but we will send DOGE to $1 eventually, Kabosu. Thank you for your services.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Dogecoin is trading for $0.168 at time of writing, a 6.9% gain during the last 24 hours.
Moving on to the top altcoin, Sherpa says he’s still bullish toward the second-leading digital asset by market cap. The trader’s chart indicates that ETH will clear the $3,980 level within a few weeks.
 “ETH: key level tapped but still expecting this level to break within a few weeks as long as everything gets cleared. Still bullish.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Ethereum is trading for $3,728 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease during the last day.
The trader concludes his analysis by saying that he believes PEPE is a good long play as far as meme assets go and should rise relatively more than DOGE.
“If you’re looking for a big cap meme to long, I think PEPE is a good one. good liquidity, strong volume, this one definitely catches up to the others a bit in my opinion. not saying it’ll flip DOGE or anything but should go up more relatively. long in the green boxes.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
PEPE is trading for $0.000014 at time of writing, a 5% decrease during the 24 hours. On February 19th, it was valued at $0.0000011.
Earlier this week, Sherpa noted that based on buyer demand and trading volume, PEPE has the potential to outperform large-cap meme assets.

U.S. Credit Unions Adopt Tokenization of Real World Assets


                        
                            U.S. Credit Unions Adopt Tokenization of Real World Assets

                        Traditional banks may still dominate the financial industry in terms of assets held, but credit unions are becoming an increasingly popular option for Americans who qualify. Recent data shows that there are roughly 4,600 credit unions in the United States. A September 2023 report from The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) further notes that nearly 139 million Americans were members of federally insured credit unions, up 20% from five years prior.In addition, the credit union market size measured by revenue totaled $126.2 billion last year.Credit Unions Are Ripe For Tokenization of Real World Assets
John Wingate, Chief Executive of financial platform BankSocial, told Cryptonews that a credit union is a member owned bank. “Unlike for profit banks that are owned by shareholders, credit unions are owned by the members, one member, one share, one vote,” said Wingate. “Given this, the credit union ethos and the decentralized fiance (DeFi) ethos are perfectly aligned.”While this may be true, credit unions face a number of challenges that may hamper future growth.Source: mx.comKyle Hauptman, Vice Chairman of the NCUA – an independent U.S. government agency that regulates federal credit unions – told Cryptonews that credit unions buy and sell pieces of loans. “This is a clunky process called ‘loan participations,” said Hauptman. A compliance blog from the National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions explained that loan participation occurs whenever the ownership interests in a loan are divided up and sold. “Under section 701.22, federally insured credit unions (FICUs) can buy participation interests in loans under certain conditions,” the blog states. Hauptman pointed out that the current loan participation process can be complex. For example, he explained that if a credit union makes a loan and another credit union buys a 20% stake in it, it gets 20% of every loan payment. Hauptman noted that the credit union that buys participation in the loan doesn’t know if the payment has actually been made, however. Additionally, that credit union is unsure if the selling credit union will pay the required 20%. “This makes it difficult for the buying credit union to plan, and it creates unnecessary uncertainty,” said Hauptman.Tokenization Use Cases
Considering the challenge, Hauptman believes that tokenizing loans that aren’t big enough to be securitized in a bond offering may be helpful. “A smart contract would automatically pay the buying credit union their 20%,” said Hauptman. “That credit union will never have to ask ‘did they make a payment?’ or ‘when do I get my piece?.’”Ravi de Silva, Managing Partner at compliance risk management firm de Risk Partners, told Cryptonews that tokenization could also help manage compliance risk by providing greater transparency, security, and efficiency.For example, de Silva believes that tokenization would be helpful for credit unions and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) use cases.“Transaction monitoring is a key control requirement in AML, which involves analyzing customer transactional data to identify potential suspicious or fraudulent activities,” de Silva said. “Tokenization can enable efficient analysis of transactional data.”For instance, de Silva remarked that tokens can be used as a unique identifier to track transactional patterns and detect anomalies. He added that credit unions can analyze token data to detect large cash transactions, structuring or unusual transaction patterns. “AML regulations also require financial institutions, including credit unions, to perform thorough customer due diligence and maintain accurate records of their customers’ identities,” de Silva mentioned. Therefore, he believes tokenization can further help securely store and reference customer identification data. Credit Unions Adopt Tokenization
Given the benefits that tokenization can bring to credit unions, it shouldn’t be surprising that some have started implementing these solutions. According to Wingate, BankSocial is working with several credit unions for use cases such as tokenizing identity.“Credit unions are using our ‘verified product’ for interoperable use between systems and fintechs, deposits for interoperability between bank accounts, other banks, and for DeFi use cases,” he said. Wingate explained that BankSocial’s verified product tokenizes transactional data through hashing. “This is done in a quantum resistant way, on-chain, to provide immutability to records and outcomes for regulators and third party audits,” he said. “We have future cases in the pipeline for merchant payments, treasury management, and lending/borrowing.”Wingate added that Great Lakes Credit Union recently implemented BankSocial’s Real Time Payment Solution. The solution uses Hedera Hashgraph’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) to tokenize payments and deposits for peer-to-peer transactions made on the Hedera network. He added that BankSocial uses the immutable ledger on Hedera as transaction resilience for traditional financial rails.Marshall Hayner, Metallicus’s Chief Operating Officer, told Cryptonews that Metallicus is also working with credit unions on blockchain solutions. “Metallicus has built the Metal blockchain, which is a layer-zero blockchain to enable banks, credit unions, financial institutions, and fintechs to create interoperable ledgers that can communicate seamlessly,” said Hayner.A recent Forbes article noted that Metallicus is working with three credit unions, Vibrant, Meritrust Credit Union, and Fairwinds, to enable blockchain-based solutions.Credit Unions Embrace Tokenization, But Concerns Remain
While it’s notable that some credit unions have begun exploring tokenization use cases, regulatory concerns are a constant challenge.According to Hauptman, the big question that credit unions face is whether or not tokens are securities. “Credit unions worry if that participation may be deemed a security,” he said. “We at NCUA have cleared the way for tokenization use, but we can’t really assuage other concerns about the tokens themselves.”Hauptman added that KYC processes, along with which platforms custody tokens, is a concern for credit unions.“And then within the platform the concern is ‘who are the node operators?’” Hauptman pointed out. “There’s already been political questions about a node being in North Korea or Iran. No one needs an OFAC investigation for breaking sanctions.”On a positive note, Hauptman shared that credit unions are moving forward with blockchain projects that enable identification.“This is where any token is clearly not something ever ‘bought or sold,’” he said. “But tokenization for real world assets remains an issue.”Yet, all things considered, Hauptman believes that U.S. credit unions are still better off implementing tokenization use cases than U.S. banks. He believes this is because NCUA has delivered guidance that provides positive clarity around regulations for credit unions. For example, Hauptman noted that in July 2021, NCUA published a “Request for Information and Comment on Digital Assets and Related Technologies” report. Later that year, NCUA released a report called “Guidance on Relationships with Third Parties that Provide Services Related to Digital Assets.” Additionally, in May 2022, NCUA released another document called “Guidance on Federally Insured Credit Union Use of Distributed Ledger Technologies.”Credit Unions Should Work With Compliance Teams 
In addition to clear guidance, de Silva believes that the regulatory challenges of implementing tokens can be solved by demonstrating how tokenization is implemented, monitored, and audited. “Credit unions need to continuously monitor their tokenization processes and conduct regular risk assessments to identify and address any vulnerabilities or emerging threats,” he said. “This includes staying updated on the evolving regulatory landscape and making necessary adjustments to ensure compliance.”Given this, de Silva pointed out that credit unions should work closely with compliance teams to adopt industry best practices for tokenization. “It is essential to establish a robust framework that aligns tokenization practices with applicable regulations, while prioritizing the security and privacy of customer data,” he said.

4 Solid Crypto Stocks to Bet on Ahead of Next Bitcoin Rally - Benzinga

The cryptocurrency rally came to a sudden halt in April after a robust 2023 and first quarter. The first quarter saw Bitcoin BTC/USD, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, hitting an all-time high of $73,750.However, Bitcoin has since retreated sharply, with its price hovering around $68,000 on May 23. In fact, Bitcoin has fallen 15% since hitting an all-time high on Mar 14.One of the major reasons behind the decline is the recently concluded halving event, which takes place once in four years. The halving event cuts the block reward by half, aiming to limit Bitcoin's total supply to 21 million coins. As a result, the reduced rate of new Bitcoin issuance typically leads to increased demand for the cryptocurrency, which in turn tends to drive up its price.Also, Wall Street suffered in April after a first-quarter rally, as concerns grew over rising inflation. This led to the optimism surrounding rate cuts fading fast as investors feared that the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for a longer period.High interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks, and cryptocurrencies.However, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential. Year to date, Bitcoin has gained 54% after increasing 207% in 2023. The halving event has also concluded.Also, the cryptocurrency has jumped more than 50% since the launch of the first Bitcoin ETFs in early January.The minutes of the Federal Reserve's Apr-30-May 1 meeting of the FOMC revealed that several officials are in favor of hiking interest rates if the need arises, as inflation is still above its 2% target.However, recent economic data showed that inflation declined in April after increasing in the first quarter. The consumer price index increased 0.3% month over month in April, which was lower than economists' expectations of a rise of 0.4%. Year over year, CPI rose 3.4%.Also, UJS GDP grew only 1.6% in the first quarter after expanding 3.4% in the final quarter of 2023. Besides, retail sales remained flat in April after increasing 0.3% in March, while manufacturing and services activity also slowed last month.These signs of a slowing economy have raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could soon start interest rate cuts, which would help the cryptocurrency market.Our ChoicesWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024.

Bitcoin Surges Past $70,000 Amid Massive Short Liquidations and ETF Speculations



                    

Bitcoin surged past $70,000 on May 21 following intense buying activity that spiked its price upwards.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed that BTC/USD was striving to maintain its newly reclaimed position near critical psychological levels.




Bitcoin’s price spike toward $72,000 was unexpected, driven by significant buy liquidity. 



This rapid increase dealt a heavy blow to short sellers, with $85 million in BTC shorts being liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass.



Statistician Willy Woo highlighted that bullish investors were confronting overhead resistance that had persisted for over a month. 




“1 month of Bitcoin short position build up just got liquidated,” he shared with followers on X. “One more layer to go in order to short squeeze past all-time highs.”



A bold forecast even suggested that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 following a breakout on weekly timeframes.

Popular trader Skew speculated that the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might have influenced the recent price movements, anticipating “important days to come” ahead of the decision on the U.S. spot.




Meanwhile, Ether (ETH/USD) traded near $3,700, marking an 18% rise in 24 hours and a 25% increase over the week.



Trader Credible Crypto maintained a cautious outlook despite the new demand, advising followers to be conservative. 



He emphasized that Bitcoin’s price was facing “major resistance” and was likely to struggle to break through it for now. 



“No change to the plan- we are at major resistance atm with perp premium positive after a month and a half and funding the highest its been since- I clearly said these are not the conditions in which a move to the highs is conducive to the next major leg up imo,” he explained in an X discussion.



CoinGlass indicated that the thickest bid liquidity below the spot price was at $70,630 at the time of writing.

Binance Exec Hospitalized in Nigeria as $35 Million Money Laundering Case Is Delayed - Decrypt

After fainting in a courtroom earlier this week, Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan has been hospitalized in Abuja, Nigeria, where his money laundering case was adjourned, per Reuters.The largest crypto exchange’s head of financial crime compliance was denied bail earlier this month after being incarcerated in the region in late February. Spending over a month in Nigeria’s Kuje Prison, the executive reportedly appeared gaunt at trial earlier this week.Gambaryan’s lawyer said in a letter to trial judge Emeka Nwite that he is “very ill and requires comprehensive medical attention." The letter went on to say that he “broke down” and had since been given “intravenous treatment for malaria,” according to the report from Reuters.In April, Gambryan pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges after he was charged alongside British-Kenyan regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla.Anjarwalla escaped custody in March and was able to fly to Kenya, but there are signs he could face extradition.Binance CEO Richard Teng demanded the release of the two employees in a blog post earlier this month and refuted the charges from the Nigerian government. In two separate lawsuits, the Nigerian government alleges that Binance has been evading taxes and allowed its exchange to be used for money laundering.Teng also said that Gambaryan, an "innocent, mid-level employee," is being held in "a dangerous prison in order to control Binance." For his part, Gambaryan has sued the Nigerian government for violating his fundamental human rights.The two Binance executives were invited to travel to Nigeria to meet with government officials to discuss the allegations there before any lawsuits were filed. But once there, they were detained in an official’s guest house for more than a month without charges. Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Marathon Digital partners with Kenya to harness underutilized renewable energy - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Marathon Digital has partnered with Kenya to harness underused energy across the country for Bitcoin mining.
The deal will see over $80 million invested in projects aimed at boosting renewable energy utilization and optimization. 

Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital has signed a major deal with the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum of Kenya.
Sealed today, May 24, 2024, the agreement provides for partnership that will see the BTC miner harness the country’s underutilized energy for Bitcoin mining.
Marathon to tap into Kenya’s underutilized renewable energy
Marathon struck the deal during Kenya’s President William Ruto’s State Visit to the US.
According to the company, the agreement will see more than $80 million invested in “green data centers to boost renewable energy utilization and optimization in the Republic of Kenya.”
“This agreement with the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum is a pivotal moment for our business as it provides us with a clear framework to pursue opportunities across the Republic of Kenya,” Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO, said in a press release.
The company will work with the Kenyan government and other stakeholders to support initiatives aimed at optimizing energy usage across the country as well as development of key technological infrastructure, Thiel added.
Today’s agreement follows an earlier consultation between Marathon and Kenya, with this deal set to boost the country’s renewable energy sector.
MOEP and Marathon are set to “exchange policy, scientific, and technical information, as well as project investment expertise, to better understand how to optimize renewable energy projects that produce surplus energy due to intermittency and seasonal variations,” the company said in the press release.
Recent data showed that Kenya’s renewable energy sources accounted for over 80% of the country’s electricity generation. Of these renewable or clean energy sources, geothermal is the largest.
But although its estimated potential is 10,000MW, it is largely unexploited. Installed capacity was about 860MW in 2022.

Bearish Unlock | Bankless


Ethereum’s spot ETFs took a major step towards trading yesterday after listing exchanges received “delegated approval” for their 19b-4 applications. Why is the ETH price now sliding?ETF experts had initially projected that we could expect to receive a spot ETH ETF decision around 4 PM EST, but when the moment this deadline arrived devoid of any updates, the price of Ether collapsed by 8%.Price managed to steadily climb higher from these lows in the hour that followed before popping nearly 4% higher after the first announcement of spot ETH ETF approval hit the news wires at 5:02 PM EST!Many Ether bulls were disappointed with the gains exhibited post-approval, believing that market participants were so underweight their chosen asset approval would result in a ferocious pump, but the probability that many would be fading ETH in either the approval or denial scenarios had been high coming into the event.In the denial scenario – which appears to have been fortuitously avoided – the SEC would likely have been forced to unveil a justification for why Ether is a crypto asset security and could not be wrapped in a commodity spot ETF, putting practically every token save BTC under the jurisdiction of the SEC wreaking havoc on broader alt markets.Alternatively, playing out the approval scenario leads to the conversion of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF, which will enable redemptions for over $10B in assets that have been held hostage at a discount for nearly three years and inevitably leading to Ether sell pressure.Both BTC and ETH only experienced a couple percentage points of upside from SEC approval, and although it is unclear when spot ETH ETFs will begin trading or the ETHE redemptions will be enabled, market participants appear to be positioning for sell pressure from the unlocks.While the ETH/BTC ratio went on a monstrous run this week, spiking to 0.057 on spot ETF approval, it has fallen 3% on the day as market participants gravitate back towards BTC, indicating that peak Ether strength has likely been achieved until ETHE redemptions are digested.ETFs can be a bullish catalyst for crypto assets, but only if they attract net new buyers. Unfortunately for Ethereum, demand is far from guaranteed, while an overwhelming supply glut looms large.Some analysts have extrapolated the 60% gains made by BTC since the approval of its spot ETFs to suggest that Ether could similarly rise to $6k and beyond, however, it's important to note that if this historical trend is to hold, ETH will be subject to a 20% drawdown in the coming weeks, retracing the entirety of this most recent move up as sell pressure from ETHE redemptions weigh on price.via TradingView

New Development on the Fate of Terra (LUNA) and its Founder Do Kwon - Bitcoin Sistemi


Once again, the Viši Sud (Supreme Court) will decide to whom Montenegro will extradite Terra (LUNA) founder Do Kwon. This decision came after the Court of Appeal overturned the decision of his colleagues in Viši Sud, upholding his and his defenders' appeal. The case was sent back to the first instance court for retrial and decision.
The first instance decision of the Viši Sud in Podgorica found that the legal prerequisites for the extradition of South Korean citizen Kwon Do Hyeong were met. This was for criminal prosecution for multiple criminal offenses at the request of South Korea and the United States.



However, the Court of Appeal council ruled that the decision significantly violated the criminal procedure provisions.
The right to a reasoned decision, which includes clearly explaining the court's views on the legal and factual issues on which the decision is based and presenting the basic justifications, was emphasized. This right is based on the principle contained in Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which is related to the protection of the individual from arbitrary punishments, that is, the protection of the principle of the rule of law.

Bitcoin Open Interest down by $1B - What traders should know - AMBCrypto



Money flowed out of BTC contracts, suggesting that the price might fall to $65,000.
Social dominance dropped to 7.07%, indicating that attention was moving to other cryptocurrencies.

The total Bitcoin [BTC] Open Interest has lost almost $1 billion in value between the 23rd and 24th of May. AMBCrypto found out after examining the metric using Santiment’s on-chain data.
On the 23rd, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) was $11.75 billion. But at press time, the figure had decreased to $10.77 billion. OI is the value of outstanding positions in a contract.
In crypto trading, there are two sides to a trade— a buyer and a seller. When OI increases, it means that there is new money coming into the market in favor of the buyers.
Decreasing attention may nuke BTC again
A trend like this suggests a bullish trend. But if the metric indicates gets too high, the OI could serve as a bearish sign. On the other hand, a decline in Open Interest suggests an increase in positions closed which favors sellers.
Therefore, the trend above indicates that most traders are not initiating new positions. For Bitcoin’s price, this was a bearish sign, and it had started to reflect on the price.
Source: Santiment
At press time, BTC changed hands at $67,123. This was a 3.52% decrease in the last 24 hours. Apart from the decline in OI, Bitcoin’s decline could be linked to recently approved Ethereum spot ETFs.
From AMBCrypto’s investigation, it seemed that traders were rotating capital into ETH and other altcoins. Should this remain the case for some time, BTC could drop further, and a move to $65,000 could be possible in the short term.
Recently, we reported that Bitcoin’s price could drop before a return to $70,000. As such, it indicates that the prediction could be playing out already.
Watch out! A bounce may be coming
Another metric assessed was social dominance. As of this writing, Bitcoin’s social dominance dropped to 7.07%. Some days ago, the metric was over 28%.
The decline in this metric implies that discussions related to the cryptocurrency had fallen, suggesting that attention from the market was moving elsewhere.
Should social dominance continue to drop, the prediction of $65,000 could come to pass. However, a further decline could indicate a bottom for BTC.
Furthermore, Bitcoin’s Funding Rate was 0.01%. Funding Rate is the cost of holding an open contract in the market. If the funding rate is positive, it means that the contract price is trading at a premium compared to the spot value.
Source: Santiment

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

When the positive rate is negative, it means the contract price is at a discount to the index price. With the funding moving lower and the price decreasing, Bitcoin could remain bearish in the short term.
However, it might not take a long while before the price rebounds.

Ethereum Foundation Officials Speak Out After Revelations That Employees Received Payments From This Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi

The Ethereum Foundation is pursuing the development of a formal policy to address potential conflicts of interest. The move comes after the foundation revealed that two of its researchers had received “significant” incentives in EigenLayer tokens.
Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi shared in her statement today that the organization's trusted neutrality is crucial to its role in the ecosystem. He addressed the ongoing discussion about potential conflicts of interest and expressed concerns shared with the community.


Miyaguchi said in his statement:

“It is clear that relying on culture and individual decisions is not enough, and we have been working on an official policy to address this issue for some time. “We will expedite this work and share an update soon.”

In response, Lefteris Karapetsas, a former Ethereum software engineer and founder of crypto portfolio tracking tool Rotki, suggested that the Ethereum Foundation should adequately pay his colleagues. This way, they would not need to look for additional compensation packages elsewhere, according to Karapetsas.






On May 19, Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, announced that he had recently received a “significant” Eigen token incentive after becoming an advisor to the Eigen Foundation.
Drake promised to “reinvest” all proceeds as investments or donations into “valuable” projects in the ETH ecosystem. He also stated that he had undertaken the advisory role only on the condition that his role was limited to investigating restaking risks.


Two days later, Dankrad Feist, another researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, also revealed that he had recently become an advisor to EigenLayer under the same circumstances as Drake.

$6 Billion Fraud and Bitcoin Money Laundering: Woman Gets Jail Sentence


A 42-year-old British-Chinese woman who pleaded guilty to converting Bitcoin into various assets, including real estate and jewelry, has been sentenced to six years and eight months behind bars, Reuters reports.  Jian Wen was initially facing up to 14 years behind bars on various charges. She was found guilty on one money laundering-related charge in March. When her house was searched back in 2018, the Metropolitan Police and a money-laundering investigator discovered a safety deposit box with 61,000 Bitcoins. cardYadi Zhang, Wen's housemate, disappeared after the search. It turned out that she was the mastermind behind a massive money laundering scheme after defrauding 130,000 Chinese investors and fleeing to the UK. Wen, a former takeaway worker, was hired by Zhang in order to use her as her "front person." The latter claimed that she was in charge of the jewelry business. Detectives discovered that Zhang, whose real name is Zhimin Qian, had crazy fantasies about becoming the queen of a small European country. She was prepared to spend at least a whopping $5 million on her crown, according to the personal diaries of the criminal mastermind. cardWen, who used to be a takeaway worker, insisted that she was not aware of the massive fraud scheme. According to Wen, Zhang told her that she was "independently wealthy." She insisted that she simply wanted a better future for her son, who started attending a private school. Zhang reportedly managed to flee with roughly $250 million. The "supervillain," who remains at large, has been slapped with an Interpol red notice.

Ethereum Foundation Preps New Policy on Conflicts of Interest | Bankless


The Ethereum Foundation is prioritizing a new formal policy to address potential conflicts of interest in light of recent debates around prominent Ethereum researchers undertaking advisory positions.What's the scoop?Aya Miyaguchi, the EF executive director, announced plans to speed up the creation of an official policy to handle conflicts of interest. The move follows rising community discussions around recent disclosures from researchers Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist about receiving significant EigenLayer token allocations for advisory roles with the restaking protocol."It is clear that relying on culture and individual judgment has not been sufficient, and we have been working on a formal policy to address this problem for a while now," Miyaguchi said. "We will be accelerating this work, and will share an update soon."Bankless take:It's vital to address and identify potential conflicts of interest to keep our best blockchain innovations uncaptured. That said, while advisorships do pose neutrality issues, both Drake and Feist have maintained they will be critical and focused on EigenLayer's risks, and these are two people whose track records show you can take them at their word. Regardless, Miyaguchi’s quick acknowledgment and prioritization of the issue signals that the Foundation is taking the matter seriously and is dedicated to upholding ethical standards and community trust. Keep an eye out for future EF updates here.

The Untold Story Behind Beeple's Historic NFT Sale: 'Token Supremacy' Excerpt

In 2007, Beeple started a project that would eventually make him famous. The "Everydays" series began as a daily drawing habit of crude little doodles that seemed to betray his more corporate, Bill Gates appearance. The drawings were the crass products of a mind feeding on internet bile (racist caricatures, nude women, penis jokes, political satire) and tutored by magical realism (family portraits, animal studies, Jesus smoking cigarettes, Hillary Clinton wearing gold teeth). A year later, Beeple switched to Cinema4D, an animation software that allowed him to manipulate three-dimensional space. For the kid who spent hours at Toys “R” Us playing a demo of Super Mario 64 on the new Nintendo console, it was a dream come true to create realistic worlds on a computer. But it wasn’t until around 2011 that he started fully utilizing the program to experiment with bright colors and blurry shapes with names like Synthetic Bubblegum Tittufux. Around the same time, Beeple started releasing music videos made with Cinema4D as free source material for creative professionals; the artist understood how popular his creations had become only when, on a family vacation to Hong Kong, he saw one of his works projected outside a Hard Rock Cafe.

Upgraded and Uncensored: Mistral Overhauls Its AI Model - Decrypt

Top open-source AI developer Mistral quietly launched a major upgrade to its large language model (LLM), which is uncensored by default and delivers several notable enhancements. Without so much as a tweet or blog post, the French AI research lab has published the Mistral 7B v0.3 model on the HuggingFace platform. As with its predecessor, it could quickly become the basis of innovative AI tools from other developers.Canadian AI developer Cohere also released an update to its Aya, touting its multilingual skills, joining Mistral and tech giant Meta in the open source arena.While Mistral runs on local hardware and will provide uncensored responses, it does include warnings when asked for potentially dangerous or illegal information. If asked how to break into a car, it responds, "To break into a car, you would need to use a variety of tools and techniques, some of which are illegal," and along with instructions, adds, "This information should not be used for any illegal activities."The latest Mistral release includes both base and instruction-tuned checkpoints. The base model, pre-trained on a large text corpus, serves as a solid foundation for fine-tuning by other developers, while the instruction-tuned ready-to-use model is designed for conversational and task-specific uses.The token context size of Mistral 7B v0.3 was expanded to 32,768 tokens, allowing the model to handle a broader range of words and phrases in its context and improving its performance on diverse texts. A new version of Mistral's tokenizer offers more efficient text processing and understanding. For comparison, Meta's Lllama has a token context size of 8K, although its vocabulary is much larger at 128K.Image: Prompt Engineering/YouTubePerhaps the most significant new feature is function calling, which allows the Mistral models to interact with external functions and APIs. This makes them highly versatile for tasks that involve creating agents or interacting with third-party tools.The ability to integrate Mistral AI into various systems and services could make the model highly appealing to consumer-facing apps and tools. Fore example, it can make it super easy for developers to set up different agents that interact with each other, search the web or specialized databases for information, write reports, or brainstorm ideas—all without sending personal data to centralized firms like Google or OpenAI.While Mistral did not provide benchmarks, the enhancements suggest improved performance over the previous version—potentially four times more capable based on vocabulary and token context capacity. Coupled with the vastly broadened capabilities function calling brings, the upgrade is a compelling release for the second most popular open-source AI LLM model on the market.Cohere releases Aya 23, a family of multilingual modelsIn addition to Mistral's release, Cohere, a Canadian AI startup, unveiled Aya 23, a family of open-source LLMs also competing with the likes of OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral. Cohere is known for its focus on multilingual applications, and as the number in its name, Aya 23, telegraphs, it was trained to be proficient on 23 different languages.This slate of languages is intended to be able to serve nearly half of the world's population, a bid toward more inclusive AI.The model outperforms its predecessor, Aya 101, and other widely used models such as Mistral 7B v2 (not the newly released v3) and Google's Gemma in both discriminative and generative tasks. For example, Cohere claims Aya 23 demonstrates a 41% improvement over the previous Aya 101 models in multilingual MMLU tasks, a synthetic benchmark that measures how good a model's general knowledge is.Aya 23 is available in two sizes: 8 billion (8B) and 35 billion (35B) parameters. The smaller model (8B) is optimized for use on consumer-grade hardware, while the larger model (35B) offers top-tier performance across various tasks but requires more powerful hardware.Cohere says Aya 23 models are fine-tuned using a diverse multilingual instruction dataset—55.7 million examples from 161 different datasets—encompassing human-annotated, translated, and synthetic sources. This comprehensive fine-tuning process ensures high-quality performance across a wide array of tasks and languages.In generative tasks like translation and summarization, Cohere claims that its Aya 23 models outperform their predecessors and competitors, citing a variety of benchmarks and metrics like spBLEU translation tasks and RougeL summarization. Some new architectural changes—rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), grouped-query attention (GQA), and SwiGLU fine-tuning functions—brought improved efficiency and effectiveness.The multilingual basis of Aya 23 ensures the models are well-equipped for various real-world applications and makes them a well-honed tool for multilingual AI projects.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

On-chain derivatives need more capital efficiency to rival centralized exchanges: SynFutures CEO - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            On-chain derivatives trading volume registered an all-time high in March when it reached nearly $317 billion. Rachel Lin, co-founder and CEO of the decentralized exchange for perpetuals trading (perp DEX) SynFutures, highlighted to Crypto Briefing that there are still capital efficiency problems hindering perp DEXs’ growth despite recent developments.Lin explained that the current AMM models struggle to compete with centralized exchanges’ order books: despite offering better transparency, they struggle to address high slippage when liquidity is low, which is a big concern for investors.“Like the previous versions, SynFutures V3 introduces an upgrade that majorly impacts liquidity providers (LPs) and traders. The new version comes with a new AMM model called Oyster AMM (or oAMM), allowing LPs to provide concentrated liquidity for any derivative pair listed on the platform. In SynFutures’ V1 & V2, LPs can already provide single-token liquidity, but with the new AMM, LPs will also be able to provide single-token concentrated liquidity, ie. liquidity that is concentrated within specific price ranges.” This new feature could improve capital efficiency for liquidity providers and get them higher returns while decreasing slippage for traders, Lin added.Increasing regulatory scrutiny is crashing volumesAlthough on-chain derivatives trading volumes showed a solid performance in March, this momentum seems to be cooling down, as trading volumes in May just surpassed $175 billion. This movement could be tied to increased scrutiny from government organizations, highlighted Lin, mentioning the SEC’s recent movements against Coinbase and Uniswap. “In early March, we saw Bitcoin break above the heights that it made more than 2 years ago. Ethereum inflows sustained that upward trend and altcoins were seeing big gains as well. All of that momentum no doubt snowballed and carried over into the on-chain derivatives market, among other sectors,” shared Lin.Blast plays a key role in on-chain tradingEthereum layer-2 (L2) blockchain Blast has been a key ecosystem for on-chain derivatives trading in the past weeks, dominating the volume for most of April and now fighting toe-to-toe with Arbitrum for such dominance.Lin is optimistic about Blast’s landscape, underscoring SynFutures’ being one of the founding projects on “what could become one of the biggest L2s.” Nevertheless, the perp DEX’s CEO stated that they plan to deploy their platform on different chains, in an effort to keep their significant share of on-chain trading volume.“New DEXs are entering the space and deploying on new chains on a biweekly if not weekly basis, so volume numbers are in constant flux. One chain will be on top one day and the other may be on top the next. SynFutures is a multichain DEX, so while V3 launched on Blast, we’re exploring deployment on other L2s in the near future.”

Pepe 69 (PEPE69) Will Rally 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe 69 (PEPE69) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe 69 (PEPE69), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe 69 presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe 69 has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe 69 could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Pepe 69 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe 69 on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe 69 by entering its contract address – EvevUFVUUFR2NZVSkVzRTj1SQ6KRKdsZqdkpWinkh8m1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPE69.

Solana Dev Who Got Burned Up in Meme Coin Stunt Is Alive-And Wants Another Dare - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Solana meme coin creator who suffered third-degree burns across a large portion of his body this week took to Twitter to confirm that he’s alive—and looking to return to the project in a week.Mikol, as he’s called, got the burns while performing livestreamed stunts to try and pump the price of his token.“We are alive, we have not given up on you,” the dev said from his ICU bed, visibly burnt after being pelted with fireworks. “I’ll probably be here for another three days, but right after that, you’re going to see me right back in Miami. You’re going to see me right back and better—more motivated and more hungry than ever.”Mikol confirmed in a voice note sent to Decrypt that he suffered second and third-degree burns across a large portion of his body, with his left hand and shoulders being the worst affected.Since being in the hospital, Mikol said that he has been pumped with oxycodone, morphine, codeine, and fentanyl to help deal with the pain. He must constantly stretch to prevent his skin from healing too tightly, and is beginning physical therapy soon. He told Decrypt that this is the least he’s been in pain since the incident.“This hospital bill is gonna rack the fuck up,” he said in a voice note. “They’re trying to keep me here for a week and a half.”In the early hours of Wednesday, Mikol doused himself in isopropyl alcohol and livestreamed fireworks being shot at him in an attempt to pump his TruthOrDare (DARE) token. This resulted in the meme coin creator being rushed to hospital with third-degree burns, after going up in flames without proper fire safety precautions.Mikol’s fiery stunt is the latest in a series of meme coin creators who are turning to livestreamed antics to draw in potential investors. Part “Jackass” shenanigans and part performance art, such streams have seen users perform sexually suggestive acts with a family member, for example, or pretend to have no hands before “rugging” the community by selling tokens.Some Telegram users speculated that the dev had died, but those close to him soon confirmed that he was in a stable condition recovering in a Miami trauma center. In the day that followed, there was mostly silence coming from his camp. Now two days later, Mikol has released a video to his community, and is communicating with his Telegram moderators.“This is what I’ve always wanted to do. You see me doing it passionately everyday,” Mikol said, his voice hoarse. “I can’t let my community down, my family down.”TruthOrDare had been running for six days prior to the incident. Mikol had been performing dares that his community put to him, including things like drinking bong water or setting his pants on fire.The token had been declining from a high reached a few days prior, so he planned to do something crazy to pump the price—and evidently, things went too far. From that previous high, the coin is now up 55%, but at the cost of a rising hospital bill.“I’ve been told you guys [the DARE community] have been putting in effortless work,” Mikol said. “I couldn’t be more happy with the people I’m doing this with.”Since this incident, core community members have banded together to support the DARE dev. People who have made profits or simply feel bad have donated money to Mikol’s wallet; at the time of writing, 12 SOL (about $2,000) has been transferred since the incident. On top of this, a passionate DARE investor known as DLuxx said he visited Mikol at the hospital to physically give him cash and send his best wishes.“I went last night to the hospital to bring him some cash, ‘cause Solana doesn’t help when you are in the hospital.” DLuxx told Decrypt, “It was late to visit and there was a lot of family there dealing with the situation, so we respected their privacy. Mikol asked me to come back, and my plan is to visit him later this afternoon.”Now, the community is attempting to push the TruthOrDare vision forward by streaming themselves. DLuxx was the first to livestream. During the Telegram livestream, he met a homeless man named Dillon, who did some skateboard tricks while DLuxx begged him to not hurt himself. Now the community claims they are working to send Dillon money and find him a place to stay.In a message forwarded to Decrypt, Mikol said he plans to live stream a series of dares in New York once he has recovered.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Top CEOs and Analysts Announce Altcoins That Could Launch ETFs After Ethereum - Bitcoin Sistemi

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has greenlit 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs from leading companies like BlackRock and Fidelity. However, approval of other spot crypto ETFs may be a more challenging journey.
Former White House Communications Director and managing partner of alternative investment firm SkyBridge, Anthony Scaramucci, expressed optimism that a Solana ETF is next. Following the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, Scaramucci confidently said, “A SOL ETF is coming, get ready.”


Brian Kelly, a host on CNBC, speculated about the chances of an ETF for Solana, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. “Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are probably the big three for this cycle,” he said, suggesting Solana could be the next big thing.

Kelly's comments echoed those of Joe McCann, a Solana investor and founder, CEO and CIO of crypto fund Asymmetric. McCann believes that if another ETF is approved, it will be Solana. However, he also acknowledged potential problems for Solana and other cryptocurrencies, noting that the Coinbase case used language that could affect future approvals.





McCann highlighted Dogecoin as another potential competitor for an ETF, given its similarities to Bitcoin's launch and its status as “definitely not a security.” Litecoin has also attracted attention for similar reasons.
However, from a regulatory perspective, while Dogecoin and Litecoin may be more suitable options, the financial obligation required to launch a Litecoin ETF may be a deterrent for issuers.

Bitcoin BTC/USD has experienced a decline from above $70,000, with the high volatility triggering an increase in liquidations. On Tuesday, Bitcoin's price briefly surpassed the $70,000 threshold; however, it quickly fell by 3.5% to around $67,000—causing a significant number of leveraged position liquidations throughout the market.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs Rake In Nine Consecutive Days of Inflows Totaling Over $1,750,000,000 - The Daily Hodl


								New data reveals that spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have brought in nine straight days of inflows totaling over $1 billion dollars.
According to data from London-based investment firm Farside Investors, BTC ETFs have seen positive inflows every day since May 14th, totaling more than $1.75 billion.










May 15th and May 21st marked the days with the largest inflows, as they saw $303 million and $305.7 million, respectively.
The data also unveils that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the only BTC ETF that saw outflows during the nine-day period. On May 14th, it saw $50.9 million worth of outflows while on May 22nd and May 23rd, it saw $16.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively.
Furthermore, according to Farside, the single biggest instance of incoming funds was on May 21st, when the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a staggering $290 million worth of inflows.
Spot market BTC ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year after years of rejection when a judge ruled that the regulatory body must reconsider its stance to remain consistent with previous rulings.
BTC ETFs give consumers exposure to the top crypto asset by market cap without them having to directly purchase it.
Earlier this month, it was found that the largest US hedge funds combined to accumulate over $2.6 billion worth of BTC ETFs.
“Twelve of the largest 25 US hedge funds collectively have over $2.6 billion Bitcoin ETF exposure. Eleven of the largest 25 Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) also have exposure. All while Bitcoin is just a $1 trillion asset class.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $68,122 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Feeling Lucky? Google AI Search Advice Could Kill You - Decrypt

Google's newly released AI-powered search results are garnering lots of attention—for the wrong reasons. After the tech behemoth announced a host of new AI-powered tools last week as part of a new “Gemini Era,” its trademark web search results changed significantly, with natural language answers to questions displayed above websites.“In the past year, we've answered billions of queries as part of the search-generated experience,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the audience. “People are using it to search in entirely new ways and asking new types of questions longer and more complex queries, even searching with photos, and getting back the best the web has to offer.”The answers, however, can be incomplete, incorrect, or even dangerous—whether wading into eugenics or failing to identify a poisonous mushroom.Image: @tkingfisher on ThreadsMany of the "AI Overview" answers are pulled from social media and even satirical sites where wrong answers were the whole point. Google users have shared countless problematic responses they received from Google’s AI.When told, “I'm feeling depressed,” Google reportedly said one of the ways to deal with depression was  “jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.”Another asked, “If I run off a cliff, can I stay in the air so long as I don’t look down?” Citing a cartoon-inspired Reddit thread, Google's "AI Overview" confirmed the gravity-defying capability.The strong representation of Reddit threads among the examples follows a deal announced earlier this year that Google would use Reddit’s data to make it easier “to discover and access the communities and conversations people are looking for.” Earlier this month, ChatGPT developer OpenAI similarly announced that it would be licensing data from Reddit.In another instance of absurd answers, a Google user asked, “How many rocks should a child eat?” to which Google’s AI responded with “at least one small rock a day,” citing a “UC Berkeley geologist.”Many of the most absurd and remarked upon examples have since been removed or corrected by Google. Google did not immediately respond to a request to comment from Decrypt.An ongoing issue with generative AI models is A penchant to make up answers, or “hallucinate.” Hallucinations are reasonably characterized as lies because the AI is making up something that is not true. However, in cases like Reddit-sourced answers, the AI didn’t lie—it simply took the information provided by its sources at face value.Thanks to a Reddit comment that's more than a decade old, Google’s AI reportedly said adding glue to cheese is a good way to keep it from sliding off a pizza.OpenAI's flagship AI model, ChatGPT, has a long history of making up facts, including wrongfully accusing law professor Jonathan Turley of sexual assault last April, citing a trip he did not take.The AI’s overconfidence has apparently declared everything on the internet as real, laid blame for the debacle at the feet of a former Google exec, and adjudicated the company's own guilt in the area of anti-trust law.The feature has certainly sparked humor and bemusement as users pepper Google with pop-culture queries.But the recommended daily allowance for rock intake by children has been updated, instead noting that “curiosity, sensory processing difficulties, or an eating disorder” could be responsible for such a diet.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Ethereum spot ETF approval is here - Everything you need to know - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Spot Ethereum ETFs have finally received the greenlight after a period of uncertainty. Thursday’s approval not only marked a milestone for Ethereum but also a positive development in the US regulatory approach to crypto. This article will provide more insights into the recent approval, its potential motivation, and implications for the industry.An overview of spot Ethereum ETF approvalOn May 23, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the 19b-4 forms associated with eight spot Ethereum ETFs. These include Blackrock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, Franklin Ethereum ETF, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.The latest approval follows the debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US in January. However, unlike Bitcoin ETFs, the Ethereum products still need S-1 form approval to fully operate, which is pending review now.As reported by Crypto Briefing, the securities watchdog recently started engaging with ETF issuers on S-1 forms. This development likewise confirmed some previous speculation that the SEC lacked interaction with the issuers during the review process.Considering previous cases, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimates that it may take the SEC up to five months to clear the spot Ethereum funds for trading. However, the analyst suggests that the timeline can be extended.Key factors influencing approvalAccording to the SEC’s approval document, the correlation between Ethereum futures and spot markets was one of the key factors influencing the decision.Notably, the SEC conducted its own analysis to verify the correlation results provided by Bitwise’s amendments and other commenters, including the Coinbase Letter and CF Benchmarks Letters. The SEC’s findings confirmed the high correlations reported, indicating a robust linkage between the CME Ethereum futures and spot Ethereum markets.Other considerations addressed in the approval document include investor protection, market integrity, volatility, and risk concerns.However, Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, claimed that the SEC might “explicitly avoid staking” in its document.There have been ongoing discussions surrounding the SEC’s stance on Ethereum’s staking feature. Analysts believe that the removal of the staking component, or the affirmation of no staking in Ethereum ETF filings is as important as other key factors influencing the decision.Major firms such as Fidelity and ARK 21Shares initially included staking provisions in their filings with the SEC. However, ahead of the SEC’s decision deadline, these firms amended their filings to eliminate any references to staking.While there have been no further comments from the ETF issuers, these removals were likely in response to the SEC’s stance that staking services could be viewed as unregistered securities offerings.Historically, the SEC has demonstrated a cautious approach to staking services.For instance, the SEC alleged that Kraken’s staking program, where users deposit crypto assets to stake and earn rewards, was an unregistered securities offering in violation of US securities laws. The lawsuit ended with Kraken’s $30 million settlement with the SEC. The firm subsequently discontinued its staking service for US retail customers.Another case is the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase in June 2023. The agency also alleged that Coinbase’s retail staking services were securities.Why does Ethereum ETF approval matter?The SEC’s green light for spot Ethereum ETFs hints at, but doesn’t definitively confirm, their stance on the underlying asset, Ethereum (ETH).Rumors have swirled that the SEC considers most cryptos, except Bitcoin, to be unregistered securities. This aligns with statements from SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the recent ETF approval offers a potential counterpoint.Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, and Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, interpret the recent approval as an implicit nod to ETH’s status as a commodity, given that the ETF shares are based on a commodity.“This week, this day, has been a rollercoaster unlike any other I’ve seen. ETH is effectively deemed a Commodity as we’ve always known it to be,” Grewal stated.“…it’s clear: “commodity-based trust shares,” Chervinsky noted.Why might delegated authority not matter?The approval of the spot Ethereum ETFs was issued via delegated authority, which eliminates the need for public commissioner votes. This arrangement raises concerns because it allows any commissioner the technical right to challenge and request a review of the decision.However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said a review request would likely not alter the outcome.According to him, the SEC commissioners would not permit the Trading and Markets division to issue such an approval unless a majority of them supported the decision. This consensus among the commissioners suggests a strong foundational agreement on the approval.In essence, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs under delegated authority indicates that the launch of these ETFs is imminent.The possibility of enforcement action against Ethereum-linked entitiesThe recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs came as a welcome surprise, especially given the SEC’s alleged legal threats against Ethereum-associated entities such as the Ethereum Foundation and Consensys.The agency had reportedly initiated a campaign to classify Ethereum (ETH) as a security—a move many believed would undermine the prospects for approving Ethereum-based ETFs.This backdrop, combined with a lack of engagement reported by insiders and a generally pessimistic outlook from ETF issuers and experts, made the favorable decision on May 23 particularly unexpected.Experts had speculated that the SEC was reluctant to approve ETFs tied to ETH because it wanted to classify the crypto as a security. However, the prevailing political climate in the US appears to have influenced the SEC to alter its stance and approve these ETFs.Nevertheless, this approval does not mean that the entities involved are completely off the hook. The SEC might still treat the sale of ETH tokens during Ethereum’s 2014 ICO as an “investment contract.”If this is the case, it likely reflects the Ripple-SEC legal lawsuit, in which the SEC alleged that the sale of XRP between 2013 and 2020 represented an “investment contract.”According to a court ruling last year, XRP sales on the secondary market did not constitute an “investment contract,” but the institutional sales were deemed unregistered offers and sales of investment contracts under the Howey test.Apart from these possibilities, in a less likely scenario, the SEC might not intend to sue the entities.The recent legal threats, including one targeting Uniswap, might be a strategy to intimidate or pressure crypto companies, rather than a genuine reflection of wrongdoing. This view was previously supported by Chervinsky.

An Upcoming Altcoin Allegedly Stole the Name of Another Popular Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


The fact that the zkSync (ZK) altcoin, which will be listed on the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit in the coming period, will receive the ZK ticker owned by another altcoin, Polyhedra Network, was not welcomed by some segments of the community.
Polyhedra Network will no longer be able to be bought and sold on Bybit with the ZK ticker.


However, Polyhedra developers accused zkSync altcoin developers of stealing their tickers in their statement. However, there are many people who think that Polyhedra does not deserve the ZK ticker anyway.

Polyhedra Network was previously known as ZKbridge and had the ticker ZKB. However, it later changed its ticker to ZK after the altcoin was listed on OKX.





Polyhedra developers criticized the situation in their statement on social media platform X:

“It is incredible that even with the approval of the ETH ETF, there are still projects in 2024 that offer advantages to various parties and take away the ticker that others deserve.
Web3 should never have been a breeding ground for bullying.
We believe the community understands the true meaning of equity and justice.
Let's see who will support such abuses and who will be the defender of justice and righteousness.
“You did a great job as a robber and thief, not as a blockchain founder.”

FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg to Resign Amid Toxic Workplace Investigation



                    

Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), will step down following a scathing investigation revealing a toxic workplace culture at the agency.



On May 20, Gruenberg announced his intention to resign from his position as chair, a role he has held since August 2005. 




He stated in an email to staff, “In light of recent events, I am prepared to step down from my responsibilities once a successor is confirmed. 



Until that time, I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Chairman of the FDIC, including the transformation of the FDIC’s workplace culture.”



The FDIC, an independent U.S. government agency, provides insurance for depositors in American commercial and savings banks.




The announcement follows a third-party investigation published on May 7, which uncovered allegations of sexual harassment and other misconduct at the FDIC, as well as the management’s inadequate response to these issues.



On May 15, Gruenberg testified before Congress regarding the widespread allegations of sexual harassment and mistreatment of subordinates. 



Both Republicans and Democrats expressed their outrage and disbelief at the severity of the issues within the FDIC, as reported by Reuters. 



Lawmakers, including Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, have called for his resignation and urged President Biden to appoint a new FDIC chair.




The White House has confirmed its intention to nominate a successor for the position.

However, Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed confidence in Gruenberg’s ability to initiate change at the agency.



Gruenberg’s impending resignation has been well-received by the crypto community. Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, celebrated the news, calling it “the best day ever.”



Meanwhile, digital asset industry lawyer John Deaton criticized Warren, saying, “It is shameful how Elizabeth Warren circled the wagons to keep one of her disgraced puppets in place. I’m so looking forward to the debates.”



Gruenberg is believed to have played a key role in Operation Choke Point 2.0, a term coined by Nic Carter in 2023. 



This refers to a coordinated effort by the FDIC to discourage banks from holding crypto deposits or providing banking services to crypto firms.



In an October 2022 speech, Gruenberg compared crypto assets to risky financial innovations like subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.

Coinbase Presses for a New Appeal Against SEC | Bankless


Crypto exchange giant Coinbase just filed a motion for an interlocutory appeal in its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), challenging the agency's authority over certain crypto transactions.What's the scoop?Coinbase has asked for a higher court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, to decide if digital asset transactions without post-sale obligations to the original issuer qualify as investment contracts under SEC regulation. The move comes on the heels of a judge's rejection of Coinbase's initial attempt to dismiss the SEC's case against it. In that ruling, Judge Katherine Failla said buying a token on a platform involves buying into that token's digital ecosystem, not just the token itself.In its new motion, Coinbase pointed to a division between lawmakers and the SEC, particularly following the recent FIT21 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives.Ultimately, Coinbase is seeking to challenge whether digital asset transactions not involving formal contracts can be regulated as "investment contracts" by the SEC.Bankless takeThe passing of FIT21 in the House certainly provides ammunition to Coinbase’s motion, which could even extend to Consensys’s ongoing SEC lawsuit as well. Given that the motion's particular issue is clarifying whether the SEC will regulate digital asset transactions as investment contracts that don’t involve anything contractual, and how the implications of this are huge, it's also hard to imagine that U.S. lawmakers won't be watching this case closely going forward. In the meantime, only time will tell if Coinbase's new appeal will be heard.

Trump Embraces Crypto Donations: Could It Alter Digital Asset Playing Field? - Benzinga

Ex-President Donald Trump made headlines when he announced that his 2024 presidential campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations. This move marks a major shift in his stance on digital currencies (he previously called Bitcoin a scam). The twice-impeached and quadruple-indicted Republican is also the first major presidential candidate to embrace crypto for fundraising purposes (although independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been accepting Bitcoin donations for months).Trump’s pivot comes as his campaign looks to draw support from voters who have grown disgruntled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Biden administration for its strict stance on cryptocurrency companies.Trump’s camp also sees cryptocurrency as a means to raise money for his legal bills. This strategy counters the anti-crypto sentiment often associated with President Joe Biden and other Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.The White House did outline a regulatory framework for the crypto industry in 2022 that stressed “commonsense efficiency standards for cryptocurrency mining.”See Also: ‘The Real Loser Here Is Melania,’ Jimmy Kimmel Pokes Fun At Trump’s Financial WoesImplications for the Crypto MarketThe campaign's announcement highlighted that contributions could be made in various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Experts are divided on the impact of Trump's move. David Hoffman, co-owner at Bankless, suggests that the former president's interest in crypto might be superficial. In contrast, Ryan Selkis, CEO of Messari Crypto, viewed the development positively, noting Trump's recent influence on the crypto market and regulatory environment. Trump has benefited significantly from cryptocurrency. He has received millions in cryptocurrency from NFT projects that bear his photoshopped likeness; sold at least 1,075 ETH for $2.4 million in proceeds; and tapped Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey on a “day 1” cryptocurrency policy.Future of Digital Assets Event in NYCThe broader implications of Trump’s decision and the evolving role of digital assets will be explored at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event in New York City on November 19. This one-day gathering will feature industry leaders, investors, and policymakers discussing digital asset trends and future directions. The event promises to offer valuable discussions and networking opportunities, bringing together over 1,000 capital markets leaders for a day of meetings, executive roundtables, and panel discussions.The event will cover various topics, including the state of digital asset adoption, risk and security in the industry, and integrating digital assets into investment portfolios. Panels will explore the unintended consequences of regulations, the future of NFTs and metaverses, and the role of digital assets in the fourth industrial revolution. Attendees will also have the chance to engage in small group discussions with executives and thought leaders, gaining deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities in the digital assets space.Now Read: Historians Compare Trump’s Usage Of  Hitler-Phrase ‘Vermin’ To Autocratic RhetoricImage: Shutterstock

Post-Ethereum ETF Analysis: ETH Price Seeks Bottom As Bulls Eye $5,000 Target


																The recent approval of the Ethereum ETF applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday has sparked speculation on the next price movements for the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency as the trading launch date approaches. 
However, significant transfers of Ethereum (ETH) to cryptocurrency exchanges have raised concerns about profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, and potential market speculation. 
Sell-Off Amidst Ethereum ETF Greenlight?
According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these developments coincide with Ethereum founder Jeffrey Wilke transferring 10,000 ETH, valued at approximately $37.38 million, to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. 
Furthermore, the surge in Ethereum balances on cryptocurrency exchanges indicates a notable increase in tokens available for sale.

This trend, coupled with Wilke’s transfer, suggests the possibility of a sell-off or an increase in profit-taking among market participants.
While industry experts like Anthony Pompliano view the Ethereum ETF approval as a positive sign for the entire industry, traders are advised to exercise caution. For Martinez, the growing number of ETH deposits to exchange wallets implies a potential market reaction characterized by profit-taking or selling pressure. 
Additionally, the analyst notes that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal on Ethereum’s daily chart, indicating the potential for a retracement or a new downward countdown phase before the upward trend resumes.
Ethereum’s Price Outlook In Focus
Diving into the price analysis, considering the IOMAP (Input-Output Model and Profitability) data, Martinez highlights that Ethereum has a strong demand zone between $3,820 and $3,700, where over 1.81 million addresses bought approximately 1.66 million ETH.

This range could provide support amid increasing selling pressure. However, if this zone fails to hold, the next key area of support lies between $3,580 and $3,462, where 3.13 million addresses acquired over 1.50 million ETH.

	Related Reading


On the upside, Ethereum’s most significant resistance barrier is between $3,940 and $4,054, with over 1.16 million addresses purchasing around 574,660 ETH. 
Martinez suggests that a daily candlestick close above $4,170 would invalidate the bearish outlook and potentially trigger a new upward countdown phase, with a target towards $5,000.

As of this writing, ETH’s price is $3,719, reflecting a 2.5% retracement over the past 24 hours. However, according to the analyst’s assessment, Ethereum remains within a crucial demand zone. 
As the market approaches the launch and commencement of trading for all eight spot Ethereum ETF applications by the world’s largest asset managers, the exact impact on price action is yet to be fully realized.

BitMEX Co-Founder: Weak Yen Could Push Bitcoin Price to $1 Million | Cryptoglobe


                                
Arthur Hayes, co-founder of popular cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform BitMEX, has recently revealed a theory on the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, and how a weakening yen could see Bitcoin’s price top the $1 million mark.



In his latest newsletter titled “The Easy Button” Hayes, currently the Chief Investment Officer of Maelstrom, argued that efforts to address the weakening of the Japanese yen could help push the price of the flagship cryptocurrency upward. He said:



Bitcoin is the best-performing asset in the face of global fiat debasement, and they know it. When something is done about the weak yen, I will mathematically guestimate how flows into the Bitcoin complex will ratchet the price to $1 million and possibly beyond.



Hayes’ theory is based on the monetary policies of Japan, China, and the US and how the dollar-yen exchange rate is crucial for the global economy, with the Federal Reserve, using Treasury orders, being able to swap dollars for yen with Japan’s central bank to manipulate the exchange rate and avoid raising interest rates, which would hurt the Bank of Japan.



The founder of BitMEX added that this allows the Bank of Japan to support its yen without having to sell U.S. Treasurys, which in turn helps the U.S. Treasury by preventing it from becoming a forced seller and maintaining low yields.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Per his words, economic competition between China and Japan, particularly when it comes to exports, often boils down to the price, and a weaker yen could see China devalue its yuan to maintain competitiveness. This would, in turn, hurt American manufacturers and potentially lead to further outsourcing.



Hayes also speculated that China could even use its abundant gold reserves – which have been growing significantly – to back the yuan and destabilize financial institutions in the West.



To counter all of this, Hayes suggested a scenario in which the Federal Reserve intervenes by printing U.S. dollars and exchanging them for yen, to provide the Bank of Japan with resources to stabilize the currency market while allowing China to continue its monetary expansion.



Such a strategy, he said, could lead to the devaluation of the US dollar and that, coupled with Bitcoin’s rise, could threaten the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. If the theory holds, then institutional investors will move to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a hedge against the decline of traditional fiat currencies.

                        Cryptocurrency markets are ending the week with solid momentum in wake of the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs and, in wake of Bitcoin (BTC)’s recovery back to the $69,000 level, traders are hunting for the best crypto to buy now for quick gains.That cryptocurrency could be Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum is up over 20% this week, but last trading in the $3,700s, remains stuck below its March highs.It also still remains well below its 2021 highs near $4,900. That’s despite the arrival of the most bullish Ethereum narrative in years.When spot Ethereum ETFs go live, that will open the door to a flood of new demand from institutional investors.ETF approval is also clears up any uncertainty regarding whether Ether is a security or not.And the market will also interpret ETF approvals as a stamp of approval on the asset from US regulators.As new ETH buyers flood in, this will inject further liquidity into its ecosystem.That should solidify Ethereum’s dominant position as the go-to blockchain for web3 project/developers.It’s very likely that Ethereum hits new record highs soon, assuming demand for spot Ethereum ETFs is good.All said, Ethereum is a candidate for best crypto to buy now.As Bitcoin progresses above $100,000 in the coming quarters, Ethereum could be a good bet to 2x from here.But some investors will be hunting for higher upside than this. For investors looking to book 5-10x upside, they will need to invest in cryptos higher up the risk curve.These will be smaller, lesser-known coins with smaller market caps. Here are some strong-performing altcoins on Friday that might pop.Best Crypto to Buy NowCore (CORE)After bouncing strongly from the $1.50 support zone, Core (CORE) is back at $1.97 and testing its 50DMA.CORE was last up 22% in 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap, making it the best performing in the top 100.“Core is a relatively new web3 blockchain that aims to be inclusive, decentralized, secure and more efficient,” Bybit says.If it can return to its April highs, that could mean a quick 2x gains in the next few weeks.Core (CORE) could see quick 2x gains, positioning it as potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewjoel frThat could make it the best crypto to buy now.Ondo Finance (ONDO)Ondo Finance (ONDO) is powering to new record highs as bets on Ethereum ecosystem growth come pouring in.ONDO was last around $1.1460, up 7% on the day.The tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is a major theme in crypto. And Ondo Finance certainly ranks as one of the best RWA coins to invest in.One of the platform’s biggest success stories is its Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG) token.The token yields 4.96% and has nearly $200 million in trade value locked, per the project’s website.Ondo Finance’s overall TVL recently hit a record high above $450 million, as per DeFi Llama.That’s up more than double versus the start of the year.It shouldn’t come as a big surprise that ONDO is up nearly 600% year to date, as per CoinMarketCap.But as inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem accelerate, ONDO’s upside could accelerate. ONDO could easily be the best crypto to buy now.Uniswap (UNI)Leading Decentralized Exchange (DEX) protocol Uniswap (UNI) is testing key resistance just above $10.Last up 11% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap, Uniswap is another beneficiary of Ethereum ETFs.Rather than that being down to Ethereum ecosystem growth bets, that’s probably more to do with the SEC softening stance.The sudden SEC approval of spot Ethereum ETFs was a big surprise to the market.The SEC had previously been campaigning to label ETH a security, as per reports.Ethereum ETF approvals clears up all doubts – ETH isn’t a security. That’s a bit policy reversal from the SEC.Uniswap bulls might be hoping for a policy reversal for them too. The SEC hit Uniswap’s creator, Uniswap Labs, with a Wells Notice earlier this year.If Uniswap can bust through $10 resistance, the door is open to a quick retest of yearly highs at $17.As Uniswap gears up to break above $10 resistance, it could be the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewThe prospect of quick 70% gains means UNI could easily be the best crypto to buy now.

Spot ETH ETFs could see 25% of the demand of BTC counterpart - Bloomberg analysts

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that spot Ethereum ETFs could see 20% to 25% of the demand experienced by spot Bitcoin ETFs.Seyffart expressed his stance in an interview hosted by Bitwise, adding that his fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, believes the new funds will see 15% to 20% of the demand.Seyffart compared both estimates to the fact that ETH has approximately 30% of Bitcoin’s $1.4 trillion market cap, calling his estimate a “discount” in that regard.He attributed the difference to certain limitations of each product. ETH ETF issuers will not engage in staking, meaning that, unlike ETH holders, ETF investors cannot earn yield. Furthermore, Ethereum has greater on-chain utility than Bitcoin, and ETF investors will not be able to access it.Seyffart declared:” … The gap between Ether as an ETF and Ether itself … is a little wider than the gap between Bitcoin and Bitcoin as an ETF wrapper.”Seyffart said that Ethereum futures ETFs, which have just 12% of the assets compared to futures ETFs in the US, do not provide a “good sample” for an estimate. ETH futures ETFs in foreign markets have 20% to 30% of assets proportionate to Bitcoin futures ETFs.Ultimately, Seyffart predicted spot ETH ETFs would have “big launches” but not as big as spot Bitcoin ETF launches. “There’s going to be demand,” he concluded.Bitwise CIO expects significant demandBitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicted “significant demand” for spot Ethereum ETFs.Hougan said that demand will likely come from two sources. First, he suggested that many investors treat diversification as a “fundamental starting point.”He predicted that “many investors” but “not a majority” would initially pursue a diversification strategy. Hougan also suggested that engagement could increase over time, with a majority of professional investors wanting diversified exposure within five years.Hougan said:“[Investors] don’t want to own one stock. They don’t want to own one bond. Why would they own just one crypto asset?”Secondly, Hougan said that Ethereum’s role as a “high growth tech investment” will appeal to investors, citing “killer apps” such as stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, DeFi, gaming, and social apps.ETH ETFs gained initial approvalThe US SEC approved several 19b-4 rule changes on May 23, which will allow exchanges to list and trade several pending spot ETH ETFs.One proposal that gained approval was NYSE Arca’s filing on behalf of Bitwise’s proposed fund.The SEC must still handle each firm’s S-1 registration statements.A launch date is unclear. Seyffart believes launches will occur in weeks or longer. JP Morgan believes the products will launch before November.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

                        Communities across the web are pausing to reflect on the life of Kabosu, the dog behind the Doge meme and Dogecoin mascot, who passed away at 17 on May 25.Kabosu’s owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the news in a post on her official blog, expressing her deep gratitude for the love and support shown to her over the years.The passing came following an announcement that Kabosu was in a “dangerous position” healthwise in 2022. However, Sata expressed the passing to be peaceful, without suffering.“Soft light streamed in through the window, amidst the beautiful morning where birds sing, she gently passed away, as if falling asleep, while being stroked by me,” she said.Sato also announced a farewell gathering in honor of “Kabo-chan,” scheduled for May 26 at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City.The news has reverberated across the internet, uniting pop culture, meme culture, and crypto culture to remember the loss. Kabosu has undoubtedly stamped her mark on internet history.Doge’s History: From Meme, to Crypto, to Legend
Kabosu first gained widespread attention in 2010 when Sato shared photos of her adopted dog on her blog. A particular image of Kabosu, capturing her skeptical and curious expression, swiftly went viral and birthed the “Doge” meme phenomenon.This single image, accompanied by phrases in broken English, became a cornerstone of early meme culture.By 2013, the popularity of the foundational meme surged after Dogecoin was created, using Kabosu’s image as its official logo.Despite initially being intended as a joke, Dogecoin became a popular cryptocurrency. It became responsible for several charitable initiatives, including clean water projects and funding for the Jamaican bobsled team.This also normalized meme coins in the crypto space, resulting in the rise of some of the most popular meme coins. Many of these coins adopted the Shiba Inu as their mascot, paying homage to the original meme that sparked the trend.The original Doge image was also minted as an NFT in 2023. It sold for 1,696 ETH, worth $4 million.Since being sold, the NFT has been divided into billions of smaller, tradable units for fractional ownership.Her influence extends to political campaigns. For example, United States President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign announced hiring a “master of memes” on May 23.The Crypto Community Commemorates Kabo
The crypto community and fans of Kabosu have expressed their condolences, sharing tributes and favorite memories of the dog that became an internet legend.The official Shiba Inu token, competitor to Dogecoin, tweeted a heartfelt tribute underscoring Kabosu’s impact on crypto.When news of her ill health was released, Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus asked his followers to send support. His call to action led to one user offering to cover “any expenses needed to make sure she gets the best treatment.”Kabosu’s legacy as the face of crypto culture will continue to symbolize community spirit and inspire future generations of meme enthusiasts.

Bitcoin Surges Above $70,000, Crushing Short Sellers with $85M in Liquidations



                    

Bitcoin surged above $70,000 on May 21 after intense buying pressure triggered a sharp price increase.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView indicated that BTC/USD was striving to maintain its newly regained ground at crucial psychological levels.




Bitcoin’s ascent towards the previous daily close was driven by significant buying liquidity, pushing the market close to $72,000.



This surge dealt a heavy blow to short sellers, with $85 million in BTC shorts liquidated in the 24 hours leading up to the report, according to data from CoinGlass.



Statistician Willy Woo commented on the situation, highlighting that bulls were confronting overhead resistance that had persisted for over a month.




“1 month of Bitcoin short position build up just got liquidated,” he told followers on X. “One more layer to go in order to short squeeze past all-time highs.”



A bold prediction even suggested that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 following a breakout on weekly timeframes.



Popular trader Skew speculated that the United States’ spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might have influenced the move, anticipating “important days to come” ahead of the decision on U.S. spot Ether ETFs.



On the same day, ETH/USD traded near $3,700, up 18% in 24 hours and 25% over the week.Despite the surge in demand, popular trader and commentator Credible Crypto maintained a cautious outlook.




He emphasized that BTC price action was at “major resistance” and was unlikely to overcome it in the near term.



“No change to the plan – we are at major resistance atm with perp premium positive after a month and a half and funding the highest it’s been since – I clearly said these are not the conditions in which a move to the highs is conducive to the next major leg up imo,” he wrote in part of an X discussion.



CoinGlass indicated that $70,630 was the area with the thickest bid liquidity below the spot price at the time of writing.

Binance Completes Another Massive LUNC Burn, Here’s How Much Was Burned | Bitcoinist.com


								Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume has executed another large-scale Terra Classic (LUNC) burn, continuing its supporting role for the Terra Classic ecosystem. Despite the substantial supply reduction, the price of LUNC and its daily trading volume have been falling significantly. 
Binance Burns LUNC Tokens
On May 23, Binance initiated another LUNC burn separate from its 21st batch of LUNC burns on May 1. According to LUNC burn tracker, Terra Finder, the crypto exchange transferred about 29,828 LUNC tokens to a dead wallet, with a transaction fee of 11.33 LUNC. 

Typically, on the first of every month, Binance executes a large-scale LUNC burn worth thousands of dollars. On May 1, the crypto exchange burnt approximately 1.4 billion LUNC tokens, valued at around $140,000, recording a total burn of more than 57 billion at the time. 
Data from Binance’s LUNC tracker, ‘LUNC metrics’ have revealed that Binance’s total LUNC burn has increased to 59.07 billion LUNC tokens, representing approximately 51.9% of the total LUNC burned by the Terra Classic community. Additionally, the crypto exchange had begun its monthly burning cycle following Terra Luna’s crash in 2022, terminating over 59 billion LUNC tokens in 2,965 transactions. 
The highest LUNC burn executed by Binance was recorded on March 2, 2023. The crypto exchange has burned a whopping 8.84 billion LUNC tokens, significantly reducing Terra Classic’s token supply. 
Collectively, the total LUNC tokens burnt by the Terra Community has reached over 113.7 billion, with Binance being the leading contributor to the burns. The crypto exchange has been a fervent supporter of the Terra Classic community, consistently aiding the community to diminish the token’s staggering supply of approximately 6.79 trillion LUNC. 
Terra Classic (LUNC) Price On A Downtrend
Despite Binance and the community’s effort to reduce LUNC’s supply, the cryptocurrency’s price has remained low, recording a 2.15% decline in the last 24 hours. Usually, when a token’s supply is diminished, it induces scarcity, fueling price increases as demand for the token grows. 
However, with LUNC’s substantial token supply coupled with a 62.49% decline in its daily trading volume, the cryptocurrency has failed to witness any significant price increases. 

At the time of writing, the price of the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.00011, according to CoinMarketCap. Additionally, its stablecoin, TerraClassic USD (USTC) is also trading at a price of $0.022, reflecting a 3.32% decrease over the past 24 hours. USTC’s daily trading volume has also recorded steep losses, falling by 56.26%.  
These unexpected declines in the Terra Classic ecosystem follow Binance’s recent LUNC token burn, displaying an opposite bearish effect from a burning process meant to decrease LUNC’s total supply and potentially trigger a price rebound.

Bitcoin Whales Are Back to Buying Up BTC, Analysis Shows - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe appetite Bitcoin whales have for more coins has returned for the first time since the price of Bitcoin reached its all-time high in March, according to blockchain data.“They are now returning with a strong buying force again, indicating that the current prices are suitable for purchasing and accumulating despite the widespread fear,” market intelligence firm CryptoQuant tweeted on Friday.Analysts cited a rise in the 30-day percentage change in whale address holdings, alongside a rising total BTC balance held by whales. In on-chain terms, a ‘whale’ is the owner of any Bitcoin address holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC, excluding those controlled by mining firms and crypto exchanges.“In general, whales buy Bitcoin at a faster pace during bull markets and decrease their buying when the market switches to a bear market,” CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno told Decrypt.Throughout March, whales had increased their BTC holdings by over 9.8%. They continued stacking in April, but their rate of accumulation slowed to just 4.2% by May 1, at which time Bitcoin’s price had cratered over 20% from its highs to under $57,000.As of May 22, the metric had returned to 5.5%, meaning whale accumulation was back on the rise after the market bottomed. In early May, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted that whales had scooped up 47,000 BTC during the drastic market dip.Bitcoin’s price has lifted to $68,760 as of this writing, up about 3% for the week.According to Moreno, the amount of money invested in Bitcoin by whales has more than doubled from $57 billion to $122 billion since the start of the year. This is measured by observing whale owners’ “realized cap”—the total value of all whale coins based on the time that each coin was bought, rather than their current market value.Lead Glassnode analyst James Check said on Wednesday that the Bitcoin network’s total realized cap has now reached an all-time high of $578 billion, “meaning the fundamentals of Bitcoin have literally never been stronger.”“In my view, we're quite far from the true euphoria phase of this bull market,” Check added. “You could argue we're on the boundary between enthusiasm and excitement, but not yet euphoric.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Solana (SOL) Plummets 10%, Here's Why, Ethereum ETF Effect: Will It Kick In? Cardano (ADA) Brand New Support Level

Solana lost around 10% of its value in an unexpected manner. The asset that looked well-positioned for the rally after the preliminary approval of the Ethereum ETF is currently looking weaker than the rest of the market, and it's not clear if it's going to recover properly.Examining the chart, Solana experienced a sharp decline, dropping from around $176 to $164. This significant drop has brought SOL down to test its support level at $160, which has previously acted as a strong support area. If this level fails to hold, the next major support lies at $150, corresponding with the 200-day moving average (orange line).SOL/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the resistance side, Solana faces immediate resistance at $176, a level it struggled to maintain before the recent drop. Above this, the next key resistance is around $190, where the 50-day moving average (blue line) currently resides. Breaking through these levels would be necessary for any substantial recovery.Several factors could be contributing to Solana's decline. First, market sentiment following the Ethereum ETF approval has been mixed, with some assets benefiting while others like Solana suffer. Additionally, technical factors such as failing to maintain key resistance levels might have triggered stop-loss orders, accelerating the sell-off.For traders and investors, the $160 support level is critical. If Solana can maintain this level, it may consolidate and attempt another upward move. However, if it breaks below $160, the next significant level to watch would be $150. This could indicate further downside potential, and investors might need to brace for more volatility.Ethereum stays composedThe expected kick in price that many attributed to Ethereum's ETF effect turned out to be a fiasco. There are quite a number of factors that could be responsible for bringing out such poor price performance, although, for the time being, the more important question remains: could there be price growth ahead, rather than talks about the failed rally?Ethereum, until this point in time, had not been able to really breach key resistance levels, even after ETF approval. Critical reasons behind this are the kind of approval — it was not the full-blown S-1 type — and, hence, the doors for further regulatory issues are still open. Besides, the Division of Trading and Markets gave this consent under delegated authority, which is subject to challenge over the next 10 days. All this amounts to some additional uncertainty that adds to the overall position of the markets. But it is not all bad over the long term. The plain fact that any acceptance of an Ethereum ETF, even partial, sets a precedent in this space and sets off further potential and larger instances of crypto adoption. Cardano's weird positionCardano is not the most noted asset in the market, does not bring much volatility and, therefore, did not form very noticeable moves in previous weeks. However, we can see some potential here because ADA is approaching a major support, which can afterwards serve as a base for a reverse.At this point, the chart is showing Cardano establishing a new level of support around $0.45. This level has been tested several times and has held up under the pressure of the downside, perhaps pointing to some real interest in that price. The volume spike on this new movement definitely strengthens the case for this to be an important level for the price. If ADA can hold onto this level, it might serve as a nice base upon which to initiate an upward move.On a daily chart, ADA has its immediate resistance located at $0.50. This is a price level at which the ticker has seen rejections in the onward price action for the last couple of days. One critical thing to note is that once breached, the current fanatical rally could see a target at $0.55, exactly where the 200-day moving average lies.

Bank Employee Steals $2,100,000 From Customers, Spawns Web of Unauthorized Transactions and Illicit Accounts: DOJ Indictment - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is accusing a bank employee of creating a web of unauthorized transactions and illegal accounts, stealing more than $2.1 million from customers.
In a 17-count indictment, the DOJ says it’s charging Yue Cao of Winfield, Illinois, with alleged bank fraud, aggravated identity theft and engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property in connection with a scheme to steal funds from identity theft victims’ accounts.










Between May 2022 and April 2023, Cao is accused of defrauding an unnamed Ohio-based bank where he worked and its customers by transferring their funds to accounts that were under his control, including accounts he had established in the customers’ names, all without their knowledge or authorization.
Cao allegedly diverted the stolen money from the customer accounts for his own personal use, according to the DOJ.
The agency says Cao was a “quantitative modeling analyst,” and was able to use his position to find customers who hadn’t yet enrolled in online banking services – mostly the elderly – and sign them up using their names with fake email addresses without their knowledge.
Once the customers were unwittingly enrolled in online banking, Cao allegedly used those accounts to make at least $2.1 million in unauthorized online transfers from the victims’ real accounts to the accounts he had opened in the victims’ names and to his own financial accounts.
The case was investigated by the FBI’s Cleveland Division, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Edward Brydle.

Hedge Funds Are Net Short On Bitcoin Futures Even As BTC Bulls Take Over Options Markets


								There is nothing for Bitcoin holders and traders to write much about prices in recent days. Although there was excitement after May 20, the coin has been printing discouraging lower lows, cooling off from the impressive $71,900 zone to less than $68,000 at press time. As BTC drops 7% from this week’s high, hedge funds appear to be exiting.
Hedge Funds Are Shorting Bitcoin Futures On CME: Are They Really Bearish?
According to Kaiko, a blockchain analytics platform, the latest data from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showing Commitment of Traders (COTs), reveals that hedge funds are net short across leading BTC futures products on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

This development could suggest that the “big boys” think the uptrend is over now that bulls failed to follow through this week, confirming gains of May 20.

Looking at price action, the uptrend remains, though bears risk peeling off all gains early this week. Technically, buyers have a chance only if there is a shift in tune among bulls, pushing prices ideally above $68,000 and later $70,000. From the daily chart, buyers must breach $72,000 if they have any chance of conquering bears and breaching all-time highs printed at around $74,000.
Hedge funds shorting BTC futures on CME | Source: Kaiko
While the United States CFTC COT report points to a net short position for hedge funds in Bitcoin futures on CME, Kaiko also thinks it might not be a straightforward bet on prices to tank. Instead, the blockchain analytics platform believes institutional investors engage in “basis trade.” This strategy exploits arbitrage trades, capitalizing on price differences on spot and future platforms. 

Being “net short” on CME means hedge funds are likely “long” on their basis trade. This means they are simultaneously shorting BTC futures contracts and doubling down on the spot BTC. The goal here is not only for profits but also to create a buffer, a hedge against volatile prices. 
BTC Bulls Dominate The Options Market
Still, confidence remains high based on the options data shared by Kaiko. As the month comes to a close, Kaiko notes that most Bitcoin options volume is heavily concentrated on contracts expiring on May 31 and June 28. Most of these options contracts are “calls,” that is, traders expected prices to rise before expiry. 
BTC options volume by expiry | Source: Kaiko
Kaiko notes that the highest volume strike price for BTC contracts expiring on May 31 is $80,000, with a notional value of nearly $910 million. Extrapolating from this, most traders expected BTC to surge above $80,000 by the end of the month.

Blockchain Gaming Altcoin Axie Infinity Flashing Signs of Potential 194% Surge, Says Crypto Trader - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								The blockchain gaming altcoin Axie Infinity (AXS) is flashing signs that it could be ready to take off on a massive surge upwards, according to a popular crypto trader.
The analyst Ali Martinez tells his 62,600 followers on the social media platform X that it looks like AXS is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on its weekly chart.










Martinez says the pattern “anticipates AXS to rise toward the neckline at $13 before a potential breakout to $22.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
An inverse head and shoulders pattern is a technical formation with bullish implications. The right shoulder suggests that bulls are willing to accumulate the asset without waiting for the price to drop to its previous low.
With AXS trading at $7.49 at time of writing, a surge to $13 would represent an increase of more than 73%, and hitting $22 would be a boost of nearly 194%.
Martinez is less bullish on Ethereum in the short term: The trader says the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator presented a sell signal on ETH’s daily chart on Thursday, suggesting the asset could suffer a 5% correction.
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles.
ETH is trading at $3,828 at time of writing.

                        As major cryptos remained stuck within recent ranges as traders digest Ethereum ETF approvals and hotter-than-expected US economic data released this week, traders are turning to the on-chain markets as they hunt for the top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading just below $69,000, up 4% this week.Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, is changing hands in the $3,700s, up over 21% this week.Both cryptos are currently trading 4-5% below earlier weekly highs.Ethereum ETF approvals are an important bullish catalyst, but macro headwinds appear to have scuppered the market’s momentum.As blue-chip cryptos struggle, traders are turning to alternative assets as they hunt volatility.And the on-chain markets are the perfect place to make quick gains or losses.Here are some top crypto gainers today on Ethereum decentralized exchanges (DEX), as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayEGOD (EGOD)A new meme coin paying respects to the death of Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog that inspired the creation of Dogecoin, called EGOD (EGOD) has sprung up on Friday and is performing well.The token was last up 15,900% since its launch, as per DEXScreener.Its market cap was last around $1.1 million, with $200,000 in liquidity.Degen Smerf (SMERF)A new shitcoin called Degen Smerf (SMERF) is up 7,800% since its launch, as per DEXScreener.Its market cap was last around $300,000, with $70,000 in locked liquidity.While the token only has one issue in its smart contract, as per a Go+ Security audit, that doesn’t mean its not a scam.Traders need to remember that nearly all newly launched coins are either scams or pump-and-dumps.

Gala Games CEO Blames Internal Controls for $23 Million GALA Token Hack



                    

Gala Games’ CEO attributes a recent security breach, which led to a hacker stealing and selling $23 million worth of its GALA token, to “messed up” internal controls.



On May 20 at 7:32 pm UTC, blockchain analysts noticed that 5 billion GALA tokens, valued at $200 million at the time, were minted. The responsible wallet sold these tokens in batches.




The breach caused GALA’s price to plummet by 20%, hitting a 24-hour low of $0.038. However, the price has since rebounded slightly to $0.041, according to CoinGecko.



“We had an incident that resulted in the unauthorized SALE of 600 million […] GALA tokens and the effective BURN of 4.4 billion tokens,” stated Gala Games co-founder and CEO Eric Schiermeyer in a May 20 post on X (formerly Twitter).



“We messed up our internal controls,” he continued. 




“This shouldn’t have happened, and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again.”



Schiermeyer revealed that Gala identified the compromise and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract. 



He reassured users that the Ethereum contract “is secure” and “was never compromised.”

Gala believes it has identified the person responsible and is collaborating with the FBI, the U.S. Justice Department, and international authorities, Schiermeyer noted.



In another post, Gala Games stated that the “security incident involving the GALA token has been contained and the impacted wallet has been frozen.”



Neither Gala Games nor Schiermeyer disclosed the identity of the individual responsible for the breach or the method used to gain access to the GALA contract.



Gala Games did not respond to a request for comment on the incident.



In a related development from August, Schiermeyer and fellow co-founder Wright Thurston filed lawsuits against each other. 



Thurston accused Schiermeyer of causing Gala to “sell off and waste millions of dollars in company assets,” while Schiermeyer claimed Thurston stole $130 million worth of GALA tokens.

Shiba Inu See Spike In Net Flows Following Listing On Solana-Focused Exchange, Is This Positive? | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) is again gaining bullish momentum, suggesting that a significant rally might be on the horizon for the meme coin. This is thanks to recent developments that have painted a positive outlook for the crypto token. 
Shiba Inu Sees Spike In Netflows
Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Shiba Inu has seen a notable increase in net flows, which have risen to as high as 379.61 billion SHIB tokens in the last 24 hours. This indicates that a lot of whale activity is currently going on in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. 

An increase in whale activity suggests that this category of investors is accumulating the meme coin ahead of a potential price surge. Moreover, these investors are also known to trigger a rally in Shiba Inu’s price with their significant purchases. Meanwhile, the rise in SHIB’s net flows could also mean a massive demand for the meme coin among retail investors. 
Crypto trading platforms like Robinhood, which also doubles as Shiba Inu whales, are known to move huge sums of the meme coin into their platforms to meet customers’ demands. Interestingly, this recent surge in net flows follows the recent listing of the meme coin by the Solana-focused crypto exchange Backpack. 
Given Solana traders’ general interest in meme coins, it will be no surprise if Backpack has witnessed a huge demand for the Shiba Inu token on its platform, which has led it to accumulate a significant amount of SHIB tokens. 
Meanwhile, some other on-chain metrics paint a bullish picture for Shiba Inu. Data from IntoTheBlock shows a 0.32% increase in Net Network Growth, meaning more users are adopting the meme coin. The Concentration metric, which tracks whales’ positions, has also turned bullish, meaning that these investors are adding to their positions. 
Could The Market See A SHIB ETF Soon?
Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, recently discussed the possibility of a SHIB ETF while congratulating the Ethereum team on the approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. He questioned if this event could pave the way for a fund that holds the meme coin. Crypto expert Anthony Pompliano seems to believe so, as he claimed before the approval order came in that approval would mean “they are approving the entire industry.”

Interestingly, earlier this year, the Shiba Inu community had petitioned asset manager Grayscale to launch a Shiba Inu ETF. With the Spot Ethereum ETFs in the bag, the community could again pick up such enthusiasm and push Grayscale or any other asset manager to apply to launch this Shiba Inu ETF. 
This process isn’t expected to be straightforward, though. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had previously suggested that any crypto token that will have its ETF needs to be first listed for futures trading on a regulated platform like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Ethereum Classic surges 17%: A shadow rally amid ETH ETF buzz? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum Classic’s price increased by more than 3% in the last 24 hours.
ETC was awaiting its fourth halving, which is scheduled for the 31st of May.

All eyes remained on the king of altcoins as the US SEC approved exchange applications to list spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs. But Ethereum Classic [ETC] silently stole the show as it registered a promising price increase in the last few days. 
Does this mean a fresh rally for ETC? 
Ethereum Classic’s response to ETF approval
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved ETH ETFs listing on 23rd May. Since then, this has been a top topic of discussion, but ETH’s price witnessed a correction soon after.
However, Ethereum Classic reacted in a different manner. According to CoinMarketCap, ETC was up by over 17% in the last seven days. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the token’s value surged by more than 3%. 
At the time of writing, ETC was trading at $32.07 with a market capitalization of over $44.7 billion. 
Thanks to the price increase, its social volume also shot up, reflecting its popularity. Additionally, its weighted sentiment remained in the positive zone. This meant that bullish sentiment continued to be dominant in the market.
Source: Santiment
Ethereum Classic awaits halving 
All this happened while Ethereum Classic was awaiting its fourth halving, which is scheduled to happen on the 31st of May. The last ETC having happened on the 11th of May 2020. 
The event can stir up bullish sentiment and allow the token to maintain its upward trajectory over the coming days.
Source: Nicehash
To see whether metrics also supported a continued bull rally, AMBCrypto analyzed Santiment’s data. We found that ETC’s trading volume surged substantially along with its price.
 This can be considered an optimistic development, as a rise in volume acts as the foundation for a bull rally. 
On top of that, its open interest also remained relatively high. This suggests that the possibility of the current price trend continuing is high. 
Source: Santiment
Apart from these metrics, Ethereum Classic’s Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a sharp uptick, hinting at a further price rise. 
However, not everything looked perfect as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved southwards. Additionally, ETC’s price also touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, which could cause trouble.

Read Ethereum Classic’s [ETC] Price Prediction 2024-25

If ETC actually turns bearish, then investors might witness the token’s price falling to $29. At that level, ETC will have an opportunity to rebound. 
A further drop in price could push the token down to $27. However, if the bull rally continues, then it is likely for ETC to first touch $34–$35 in the coming days.

Mysterious Whale Withdraws $8 Million in $PEPE Tokens Amid Memecoin Surge | Cryptoglobe


                                
A mysterious cryptocurrency whale has made a splash on the memecoin market after moving nearly $8 million worth of $PEPE from Binance, effectively withdrawing 592 billion tokens after the recent price rise.



According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, the whale likely bought the tokens as the price of PEPE surged. PEPE, it’s worth noting,  recently moved to new highs, having recently briefly surpassed the $0.000014 mark before correcting slightly. Its gains came amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally that added over $200 billion to the space’s total market capitalization.



The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.







The surge saw an early investor in the meme-inspired cryptocurrency who put in just over $460 when it was first launched cash out, realizing a gain of nearly 740,000% after their $460 appreciated to around $3.4 million.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Looking into the wallet of the trader, data shows that the trader often invests in newly launched memecoins hoping one will take off. The investor was early on several popular memecoins, but also seemingly on several memecoins that faded away soon after being launched, according to Etherscan data.



PEPE’s upward trend has attracted the attention of some cryptocurrency analyst, with popular trader Altcoin Sherpa noting that those looking for a “big cap meme to long” should consider PEPE as it has “good liquidity, strong volume.”







DonAlt, another popular analyst, warned of a potential bubble in the memecoin market, with valuations susceptible to dramatic corrections. Citing historical data, DonAlt predicted that popular memecoins, including PEPE, could experience crashes exceeding 80%.

Dogecoin ($DOGE) Price Soars 10% as Whales Dive Back In: Meme Coin Mania Returns? | Cryptoglobe


                                
The meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin ($DOGE) has recently seen its price surge by more than 10% over the last week amid growing activity from large cryptocurrency investors, colloquially known as whales, that shows growing interest in the cryptocurrency.



According to data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, DOGE whale transactions – those exceeding $100,000 worth of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency – nearly doubled in a single 24-hour period after speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds grew.







The data also reveals a rise in the volume of DOGE moved by these whales, climbing from 9.74 billion to 17.97 billion over the same period.



Adding to the intrigue, a long-dormant Dogecoin whale holding 893,303 DOGE (around $145,101) moved their funds after a decade of inactivity at about the same time, marking the whale’s first transaction since May 2014, involving the transfer of 23,338 DOGE, worth roughly $4,000, to Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While the whale retains the majority of its holdings (869,964 DOGE, valued at over $140,000), this movement has sparked concerns about potential price fluctuations.



Historically, the re-emergence of early cryptocurrency investors has often coincided with significant price swings. The recent transfer to Binance could be interpreted as a potential precursor to selling activity, further fueling speculation about DOGE’s future trajectory.



As Cryptoglobe reported, DOGE has formed a chart pattern that suggests the price of the cryptocurrency may surge over 23,000%, akin to a rise it experienced last year when the same pattern was formed on its chart.



The chart pattern was first spotted by popular cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, who noted on social media that on Dogecoin’s weekly chart a descending triangle has formed. The last time Dogecoin encountered this pattern, it catapulted with an almost unfathomable rally of 23,200%. This revelation has stoked speculation about whether Dogecoin could reproduce a similarly meteoric rise.

Bitcoin Money Launderer Sentenced To 6 Years Behind Bars In $6B Scam | Bitcoinist.com


								A recent report by the Financial Times reveals that a British-Chinese woman, Jian Wen, has been sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for her involvement in laundering Bitcoin (BTC) allegedly derived from a £5 billion fraud in China. 
Wen, aged 42, was convicted in March of one count of money laundering on behalf of her former boss, Yadi Zhang, a Chinese woman. The sentencing took place at London’s Southwark Crown Court on Friday.
London Mansion Raid Uncovers £3 Billion Bitcoin Stash
According to the report, in 2018, London’s Metropolitan Police conducted a raid on Wen and Zhang’s Hampstead mansion. During the raid, they seized devices containing a staggering 61,000 Bitcoin, currently valued at over £3 billion. Notably, this seizure marked one of the largest cryptocurrency hauls ever made by a law enforcement agency worldwide. 

Authorities had originally investigated Wen concerning an attempted purchase of a London mansion using Bitcoin. Prosecutors in the UK alleged that Wen’s former boss, Zhang, ran a £5 billion fraud scheme in China, resulting in stolen funds.
While Zhang’s lawyer has maintained her innocence, Wen was convicted of laundering a portion of the proceeds between 2017 and 2022 after two trials and acquittals on 10 other counts. It is important to note that Wen was not implicated in the original alleged fraud. 
However, Judge Sally-Ann Hales, KC, emphasized that Wen had full knowledge of dealing with the proceeds of crime and described the offense as “sophisticated with significant planning” involved. 
Wen, who allegedly assisted in converting Bitcoin into cash, jewelry, luxury items, and property, pleaded not guilty and consistently denied being aware that her employer’s funds were stolen.
Letter Urges UK-China Negotiations
Mark Harries KC, Wen’s lawyer, described her as a “fragile and desperate woman” who was deceived and manipulated. However, the judge disagreed with this characterization, stating that she did not consider Wen a victim. 
Wen admitted to controlling a Bitcoin wallet but claimed ignorance regarding the cryptocurrency’s source. The court heard that Wen had not seen her 16-year-old son for 26 months and has been in custody since March 2022.
Between 2017 and 2020, Wen enlisted the assistance of several intermediaries to convert the cryptocurrency into various assets. 
One such intermediary was Michael James Burke, a Dubai-based estate agent, who reportedly aided Wen in selling Bitcoin through his companies in the Seychelles and Switzerland and facilitated property purchases in Dubai. 

The Metropolitan Police is pursuing a civil recovery process to seize the total amount of confiscated funds and is collaborating with Chinese authorities on the matter.
“The Chinese side has already engaged in international law enforcement cooperation with the UK concerning this case,” stated the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in response to the Financial Times. 
The ministry added that law enforcement agencies from both countries are actively working together to pursue fugitives and recover assets. Victims of the alleged £5 billion scam in China have also submitted a letter to the foreign ministry in Beijing, urging negotiations with the UK government to reclaim the Bitcoin purchased with their money.

As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency on the market, BTC, is trading at $68,150 after falling to consolidate above the key $70,000 milestone.

Dogecoin Weighted Funding Rate Falls 50% In 24 Hours, What This Means For Price | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin, like the rest of the crypto market, has seen a slow down over the last day that has greatly impacted its price. However, this slowdown isn’t completely limited to the price as the open interest-weighted funding rate of the meme con has seen a significant decline over the last day.
Dogecoin OI-Weighted Funding Rate Crashes 50%
Over the last few days, as the Dogecoin price rose, so did the OI-weighted funding rate. This is normal, given that the funding rate follows market sentiment. In times when crypto traders are very bullish, the funding rate rises as long traders have to pay short traders to keep their positions open. Then, when sentiment is skewed toward bearishness, funding rates tend to drop, and short traders pay long traders to keep their positions open.

This is important as the funding rates help exchanges to keep contract prices and their underlying asset prices balanced no matter the market conditions. These fees are charged at intervals by the exchanges, but the duration between each charge varies from exchange to exchange.
Having explained that, it tells us that the drop in the Dogecoin OI-weighted funding rate is a show of bearishness among investors. When the Dogecoin price hit $0.17 on Thursday, the OI-weighted funding rate touched 0.0243%. However, as the price has dropped back down toward $0.16, the OI-weighted funding rate has now dropped to 0.0105%, according to data from Coinglass.
Source: Coinglass
This drop is a more than 50% decline from its Thursday figures and shows how fast sentiment can turn on a cryptocurrency such as Dogecoin. However, if the Dogecoin price does begin to recover once again, then the OI-weighted open interest will rise.
Open Interest Falls Alongside DOGE
Amid the decline in the Dogecoin price, the open interest has also taken a hit as well. Its recovery to almost $1 billion on Wednesday, May 22, has been rocked by a 10% crash that has sent it back down toward $900 million once more.
The majority of this decline came in the last 24 hours, where Coinglass data shows that the Dogecoin open interest saw massive losses across all major exchanges. The largest drop in open interest came from the Kraken crypto exchange, dropping 35.94%.

This was followed by dYdX with an 18.57% drop, and Coinbase with an 11.36%. Other exchanges saw varying declines between 1.25% and 7.4%, and in total, the open interest has dropped 5.31% in the last day. The total open interest is now sitting at $907.8 million.
Dogecoin’s price is currently trending at $0.1587, with a 4.59% decline in the last 24 hours. Honorable mention of Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog behind the infamous Dogecoin logo, who recently passed away.

                        The Southwark Crown Court in London, UK, sentenced a woman to jail for money laundering bitcoin tied to a billion-dollar investment fraud.Jian Wen was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison on Friday after being found guilty of money laundering in connection with a £5 billion ($6.4 billion) fraud scheme.Woman Jailed for Laundering $6.4 Billion Bitcoin Fraud Proceeds in London Court TrialAccording to Bloomberg reports, Jian Wen, a former fast-food worker, has been sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for laundering significant amounts of Bitcoin associated with a US$5.6 billion investment fraud in China. The case saw Wen convicted of money laundering linked to approximately 150 Bitcoin for a Chinese woman between 2017 and 2022. Law enforcement authorities seized over 61,000 Bitcoin valued at over US$4 billion.During Friday’s sentencing, Judge Sally-Ann Hales remarked that the offense was sophisticated and involved substantial planning, stating, “I am in no doubt that you knew what you were dealing with.”Despite holding British and Chinese citizenship, Wen consistently denied all allegations against her and is currently appealing her conviction. She portrayed herself as a victim who merely followed instructions from a woman, insisting she was unaware of the funds’ fraudulent origins. Her lawyers further portrayed Wen Jian as another victim of the mastermind behind the fraud, labeling the individual as an “expert criminal supervillain” who exploited Wen Jian’s trustworthiness before discarding her.However, the prosecution argued that Wen was motivated by greed and financial gain, asserting she played a decisive role in managing the crypto wallet linked to the laundering scheme. Prosecutors described Wen Jian as a “front person” utilized by the fraud mastermind to convert stolen funds into bitcoin, move them out of China, and convert them back into cash. Wen Jian maintained her innocence, claiming she was simply trying to provide a better life for her son, denying three counts of money laundering, and claiming she did not know Bitcoin’s criminal origins. Despite her claims, jurors found her guilty of one count in March, while two other counts resulted in a hung jury.In March, a jury found Wen guilty of one count of money laundering after a trial that spanned nearly two months, during which thousands of pieces of evidence, including WhatsApp messages between Wen and the alleged mastermind, were presented.Wen Jian Sentenced to Six Years and Eight Months for Money Laundering in High-Profile Fraud Case
Wen, 42, experienced a dramatic transformation in her lifestyle, transitioning from living in the basement of an east London Chinese takeaway to residing in a six-bedroom mansion in a leafy suburb and indulging in luxury shopping sprees at Harrods after she began working for the now-arrested female fugitive. Judge Hales noted, “I am in no doubt that you came to enjoy the better things in life.”In a separate statement, Wen’s lawyer refuted the allegations of fraud against her, asserting that she acquired substantial holdings of Bitcoin through lawful means.Judge Sally-Ann Hales emphasized that while there was no evidence of Wen Jian’s involvement in the underlying fraud but she was aware she was dealing with criminal proceeds. She sentenced Wen Jian to six years and eight months in prison for a single count of money laundering.Recently, the EU passed a new anti-money laundering regulation (AMLR) aimed at regulating crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). This regulation empowers Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) to detect and combat money laundering and terrorist financing.The legislation package, announced on Wednesday, will impact crypto exchanges and brokers operating under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). These laws introduce “enhanced due diligence measures,” requiring obligated entities such as crypto-asset managers to report suspicious activities to FIUs.Also, a new supervisory body, AMLA, will oversee implementation. This broad AML/CFT framework applies to all financial institutions, including CASPs, and is not specific to crypto.

Lido (LDO) Takes The Lead With 13% Surge Post Ethereum ETF Approval - Key Levels To Watch


																Lido (LDO), the liquid staking protocol for the Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) blockchains, has seen a significant price spike in the last 24 hours following the long-awaited approval of spot Ethereum ETF applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday.
The protocol’s native token, LDO, has successfully regained the $2.30 level and is looking to break out of its one-month downtrend structure that has been in place since the market correction in April. 
LSD Sector Set To Soar With Ethereum ETF Approval?
As reported by our sister website, Bitcoinist, the SEC’s approval of the Ethereum ETFs was detailed in an official filing, highlighting that the proposals meet the provisions of the Exchange Act and relevant regulations governing national securities exchanges. 
The Commission has determined that proposals from notable entities such as BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark Invest/21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton fulfill the requirements to prevent fraud and manipulation, protect investors, and safeguard the public interest.

	Related Reading


Crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, commenting on the Ethereum ETF approval on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out that the new index funds approval has led to two sectors emerging as clear winners. 
One of these sectors is Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) coins, with Lido at the forefront. Lido provides staking support for the Ethereum blockchain without the need to lock tokens or maintain infrastructure, allowing participants to engage in on-chain activities such as lending and farming.
Key Levels To Watch For Lido
During the early hours of Friday, LDO reached a peak of $2.49 but has since retraced to its current trading price of $2.35. Large investors are interested in the token, as Spot On Chain data reveals that six fresh wallets/whales withdrew 4.3 million LDO ($9.59 million) from crypto exchange Binance over the past 24 hours. 
This indicates a growing interest in holding the token, as sentiment suggests a potential increase in price parallel to Ethereum once the newly approved index funds for the second-largest cryptocurrency enter the market in the coming months.
Moreover, CoinGecko data shows that Lido has experienced a trading volume of $350 million within the last 24 hours, marking a 78.60% increase compared to Thursday’s. However, the token remains 68% below its all-time high (ATH) of $7.30, achieved during the 2021 bull market.

Looking ahead, bullish investors should closely observe the next resistance level on the LDO/USD daily chart, situated at $2.55. Breaking this level is crucial for breaking the downtrend structure that has persisted over the past month, potentially leading to retests at $2.70 and $2.90.
Conversely, the $2.21 zone serves as a significant support level, as it acted as a strong barrier for Lido in the past week and a half before the breakout.

FTX Co-Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Transferred To New Detention Center, Details | Bitcoinist.com


								According to a Bloomberg report, Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of the FTX crypto exchange, has been transferred to a temporary detention center in Oklahoma, contrary to a federal judge’s request to keep him in New York to assist in his appeal. 
The move comes as Bankman-Fried navigates the aftermath of his conviction for orchestrating a significant fraud at FTX.
Sam Bankman-Fried Transferred To Oklahoma 
According to the report, Sam Bankman-Fried is currently housed at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, as stated on the Bureau of Prisons website. He spent much of last year preparing for his trial while incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. 
Judge Lewis Kaplan, who sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison, recommended on Wednesday that he remain in Brooklyn “until his appeal has been fully briefed to facilitate access to appellate counsel.”

Curiously, Sam Bankman-Fried, who had publicly announced his intention to appeal the conviction, officially objected to the decision at the end of April. 
In a post-conviction interview, he voiced concerns about the fairness of his trial and specifically targeted Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing FTX’s new owners. 
The disgraced FTX co-founder accused the firm of colluding with the prosecution and impeding his access to crucial FTX documents shared with the prosecution. 
Sam Bankman-Fried asserted that this interference had a “detrimental impact” on the trial, including media coverage and the defense’s ability to present favorable evidence.
Closer To Family While Serving Sentence? 
With the appeal now officially filed, Bankman-Fried seeks a different outcome, hoping for a reduction in his sentence. He emphasized the importance of introducing vital evidence and presenting key witnesses, which he claims his defense was denied the opportunity to do during the trial. 
Mark Botnick, a spokesman for Bankman-Fried, expressed gratitude for the court’s consideration and hoped that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) would abide by the court’s recommendation to grant Bankman-Fried access to his appellate counsel.

According to the report, Sam Bankman-Fried may eventually be transferred to a prison closer to his family in California to serve the remainder of his sentence. The Oklahoma facility, classified as a transfer center by the Bureau of Prisons, is designed to hold inmates for a limited period of four to six weeks.

The native token of the exchange, FTT, is currently valued at $1.59, reflecting marginal fluctuations compared to Thursday’s price, indicating a minor decrease of 1%. Nevertheless, the token has demonstrated a noteworthy 12% price appreciation over the last month.

Ethereum Goes to Wall Street | Bankless


1️⃣ ETH ETF Approved in a Break-Neck PivotThursday marked another historic event with the SEC approving eight spot Ethereum ETFs from institutions like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and VanEck. While these approvals signal a regulatory shift, especially after the complete 180 the agency seemed to pull, trading can't commence until the S-1 registration statements are approved, which may take weeks. While the ETFs are expected to attract billions in capital, further boosting institutional interest in crypto, it seems like the next few weeks to months may be the quiet before the storm. 2️⃣ House Passes CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act and FIT21Also on Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, blocking the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency without Congressional approval. The bill, supported by 213 Republicans and 3 Democrats, aims to align any U.S. CBDC with American privacy values and free market competitiveness — essential given the potential for these tools to significantly compromise individual rights to freedom. Meanwhile, the House also passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), empowering the CFTC alongside the SEC to regulate the digital assets market. Both bills now move to the Senate, marking significant steps in shaping America's crypto regulatory landscape.3️⃣ Jupiter’s GUM Alliance Aims to Bring Everything OnchainSolana DEX aggregator Jupiter announced its Grand Unified Markets (GUM) initiative to create a “single atomic market” on Solana. Featuring partnerships with the Solana Foundation and market makers like Wintermute and DWF Labs, the GUM Alliance intends to create liquid markets for not only crypto but also real estate, forex, stocks, and bonds on Solana. In other words, tokenize everything. 4️⃣ Farcaster Raises $150M to Grow its User BaseDecentralized social network Farcaster announced a $150M fundraising round led by Paradigm, with participation from a16z, Haun Ventures, Union Square, and more. The funds will be used to grow its user base and add developer tools. Since October, Farcaster has seen a 50x increase in network activity, boasting almost 35K unique daily users. While it struggles with some spam and bot activity, as all social media does, Farcaster's growth indicates strong demand for its network and, in turn, onchain social media.5️⃣ Genesis Winning Approval to Pay Creditors, Beating DCGLast cycle’s debauchery seems to officially have come to a close with a U.S. bankruptcy court approving Genesis's Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, allowing the return of about $3B in cash and assets to creditors. A victim of 3AC and FTX, Genesis won its case over parent company DCG, who will now eat a loss due to the judge’s ruling. Gemini, a major creditor of Genesis, will start reimbursing customers 97% of their losses from its defunct Gemini Earn program by the end of the month.via Gemini

The Big SEC Surprise | Bankless


Approval Relief. Ethereum’s spot ETF was shockingly approved and the crypto market landscape will never be the same! What happened this week in markets?With the SEC’s first final decision for an active spot ETH ETF application scheduled to occur on Thursday, market participants came into the week expecting significant volatility… Although consensus overwhelmingly held that spot ETH ETFs would be denied come this deadline, rumors that the SEC was unexpectedly communicating with issuers began circulating on Monday.The prior absence of any meaningful communication had pushed market participants to prepare for denial, but the sudden reversal caused Bloomberg’s ETF analysts to increase their odds of approval threefold to 75%!Renewed confidence in renewal sent traders scrambling to long ETH, causing the ETH/BTC ratio to surge back above the key level at 0.05 and resulting in outsized Ether strength throughout the week (or at least until ETF approval).Many crypto market participants had long clung to beliefs that BTC was a special type of digital asset and would be the only one to receive regulatory clarity as a non-security, however, indications that the ETH ETF could be approved blew a hole in this narrative and confirmed that BTC will need to compete among other digital assets for TradFi’s attention.The loss in BTC’s narrative strength can be clearly observed in the charts; Bitcoin Dominance had its worst week since the arrival of spot BTC ETFs enabled redemptions for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and led to sell pressure that drove token price under.Unfortunately, the approval of the ETH ETF marked peak strength for alts. The ETH/BTC wicked as low as 7% off its Thursday approval highs and Bitcoin was one of the market’s lone gainers on Friday as traders rotated out of assets that outperformed leading up to Ether’s ETF approval.While this week’s headlines proclaimed “ETH ETFs Approved,” there remains a minute possibility the SEC could walk back its green light, as the approvals came per “delegated authority” by SEC staff, which a commissioner can challenge within 10 days. Nevertheless, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has dismissed these concerns outright. Alternatively, traders may be wary of the potential sell pressure that can be expected from the $10B AUM Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE); its conversion into a spot ETF enables redemptions and allows the instrument to trade at par for the first time in three years.The core doctrine of laser-eyed BTC maximalists may have experienced a crushing fundamental defeat now that it appears that any digital asset – no matter how it originated – can become a non-security, but leaders of this cult are holding steadfast in their beliefs that there is still no second best.

XRP Poised for Breakout? Analyst Sees Major Move After US Crypto Bill | Cryptoglobe


                                
XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, could soon see a breakout from its current level around $0.53 after the US House of Representatives passed landmark cryptocurrency legislation and ahead of the end of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



That’s according to popular pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Dark Defender, who pointed to the landmark cryptocurrency regulation bill the US House of Representatives passed this week,  Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).



The proposed legislation is poised to create a framework for the regulation of the cryptocurrency market in the US, including implementing consumer protections, designating the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the primary regulator for digital assets, and outlining explicit responsibilities for both the CFTC and the SEC. Furthermore, it aims to provide a more distinct classification of a cryptocurrency as either a security or a commodity.



The bill has garnered strong support from the cryptocurrency industry with the Crypto Council for Innovation, a consortium of entities and companies in the sector, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Digital Currency Group, along with 50 other organizations, writing a letter to the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson (R-La.), and the Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), advocating for the bill’s approval.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The analyst used technical analysis tools  like Fibonacci Time Zones and Elliott Wave Theory, to project a significant price increase for XRP before July, suggesting the recent bill, and the entrance of institutional investors in the space through spot exchange-traded funds could further bolster XRP.







The analyst also suggested that Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which started after the regulator sued the fintech firm and two of its executives alleging they “raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering,” could soon end.



Notably, the analyst has earlier this month suggested XRP’s price could soon explode to as much as $18 after identifying a bull flag pattern on the XRP/USD chart.



The bull flag, characterized by a sharp price increase followed by a period of consolidation, appears across multiple timeframes, including monthly, three-month, and six-month charts, the analyst noted. The consolidation period, marked by converging red and blue trendlines, forms a triangle – a technical indicator often interpreted as a precursor to a breakout.

VanEck's Spot Ether ETF Listed on DTCC, Awaiting SEC Approval Amid Speculation and Political Influence



                    

Amid growing anticipation regarding the approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, global investment manager VanEck’s ETF has been listed by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker symbol “ETHV” as of May 23.



The DTCC, an American financial market infrastructure provider, offers essential clearing, settlement, and transaction reporting services to financial market participants. 




Being listed on the DTCC is a significant step towards receiving final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Currently, VanEck’s ETF is marked as inactive on the DTCC website, meaning it cannot be processed until it secures the necessary regulatory approvals. 



Notably, VanEck is not the first to list an Ether ETF with the DTCC; Franklin Templeton’s spot ETH ETF was listed on the platform a month earlier.



The DTCC clarified that their ETF list includes both active ETFs ready for processing and inactive ones awaiting approval.

In a related development, there are reports that SEC officials have contacted Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the New York Stock Exchange to update and revise existing spot Ether ETF applications.



The apparent shift in the SEC’s stance over the past week is believed to be influenced by the White House.




Crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky observed on X that policy is influenced by politics, noting, “For months, crypto has been winning the political battle.” 



He also speculated that former President Donald Trump’s endorsement of cryptocurrency might have prompted the Biden administration to adjust its policy.




The SEC faces a crucial deadline on May 23 for its decision on VanEck’s spot Ether ETF application.



After months of speculation about a likely denial of spot ETH ETFs, the SEC recently took significant action. 



The Commission requested financial managers to amend and resubmit their 19b-4 filings for proposed spot Ether ETFs. 



Some analysts interpret this move as a positive sign, increasing the likelihood of approval from 25% to 75%.

China's Digital Asset Ban Remains Ignored With Recent Increase in Money Laundering Cases - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Despite China’s digital asset ban, recent police raids reveal significant illicit transactions involving digital assets.



Cryptocurrency demand persists in China, fueled by factors such as the desire for alternative investments and evasion of capital controls.



Traders employ sophisticated methods, including peer-to-peer platforms and overseas company setups.




According to Bloomberg, recent police raids in China targeting illicit foreign exchange transactions have exposed the ongoing use of cryptocurrencies despite China’s digital asset ban.





Persistence of Cryptocurrency Demand Despite China’s Digital Asset Ban



These actions highlight the persistent demand for cryptocurrencies in the country, driven by various factors including the desire for alternative investments and the circumvention of capital controls.



In May alone, several significant cases involving cryptocurrencies were flagged by municipal authorities and state media. These included an underground bank involved in illegal transfers amounting to 13.8 billion yuan ($1.9 billion), a gang implicated in about 2 billion yuan of unauthorized conversions, and illegal money changers with transactions exceeding 1 billion yuan. The busts spanned across Beijing, the northeastern province of Jilin, and Chengdu city in the southwest.



China’s digital asset ban was initially deployed in September 2021 due to concerns over money laundering, currency outflows, and the environmental impact of energy-intensive Bitcoin mining. Despite this, Chinese citizens continue to engage in significant volumes of underground crypto trading.




Sophisticated Evasion Tactics Enable Continued Crypto Trading in China



According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, approximately $86 billion worth of cryptocurrency flowed into China in the 12 months through June 2023. While this represents a decline from pre-ban levels, it remains substantial on a global scale.



The persistence of cryptocurrency trading in China is facilitated by various methods to evade detection. Traders use software to mask their locations and peer-to-peer platforms such as WeChat and Telegram for transactions. Some individuals set up companies abroad through intermediaries to meet institutional know-your-customer (KYC) requirements on crypto exchanges, further complicating enforcement efforts.

Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Expected to Launch in Q1 2025 - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Ethereum will launch the Pectra upgrade by Q1 2025, incorporating EOF, PeerDAS, and EIP-7702 to enhance performance and efficiency.



Pectra introduces new opcodes, improving staking efficiency and accelerating cryptographic operations.



The Ethereum Pectra upgrade will modify the deposit and withdrawal process and regulate capital requirements for validators.




Ethereum core developers are preparing to launch Pectra, the next major upgrade for the blockchain network, by the end of the first quarter of 2025.





Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Launch Targeted for Q1 2025



Ethereum Pectra upgrade aims to introduce several significant improvements and innovations, furthering the development and efficiency of Ethereum.



Pectra will encompass multiple Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including the EVM Object Format (EOF), PeerDAS, and EIP-7702. EOF, a set of about 11 EIPs, introduces an opt-in container for EVM code to enhance performance and efficiency. PeerDAS, or Peer-to-Peer Decentralized Autonomous System, will facilitate decentralized peer-to-peer interactions on the network.



EIP-7702, introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, is set to replace the older account abstraction EIP-3074, aiming to improve network functionality and performance. The upgrade may delay the implementation of Verkle Trees to a subsequent hard fork named Osaka.




Validator Adjustments and Enhanced Staking Efficiency with Pectra



Pectra’s name combines two simultaneous upgrades targeting different Ethereum layers: Prague, which updates the execution layer responsible for enforcing protocol rules, and Electra, which enhances the consensus layer to ensure block validation. This multifaceted approach underscores Ethereum’s commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.



Additionally, Ethereum Pectra upgrade will introduce new opcodes, improve staking efficiency, and accelerate cryptographic operations. It will also include EIPs related to the deposit and withdrawal process and adjust the capital requirements for validators, potentially reducing their number and increasing operational efficiency.

BitGo Lawsuit Against Galaxy Digital Allowed by Court to Continue - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The Delaware Supreme Court has reversed an earlier ruling, allowing BitGo lawsuit against Galaxy Digital to continue.



The court found the merger agreement’s language ambiguous, requiring extrinsic evidence to resolve the dispute regarding audited financial statements.




According to CoinDesk, BitGo has been granted a new opportunity to pursue legal action against Galaxy Digital over their aborted $1.2 billion merger agreement.





Delaware Supreme Court Revives BitGo Lawsuit Against Galaxy Digital



The development follows the Delaware Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a previous ruling that dismissed BitGo’s $100 million lawsuit against Galaxy Digital.



The Supreme Court’s May 22 decision shows the ambiguity in the merger agreement’s language and the need for extrinsic evidence to resolve the dispute. This ruling reverses the June 2023 decision by the Delaware Court of Chancery, which had ruled in favor of Galaxy Digital by their “clean termination right” due to BitGo’s delay in providing audited financial statements for 2021.



R. Brian Timmons, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, the law firm representing BitGo, expressed satisfaction with the Supreme Court’s decision, stating, “We believe justice prevails on appeal, and we are delighted to move forward with this case in the Chancery Court.”




BitGo Alleges Intentional Breach as Galaxy Defends Termination Decision



Initially, BitGo lawsuit appeared in August 2022, accusing Galaxy Digital of an “intentional breach” of the acquisition agreement. BitGo sought $100 million in damages, citing that Galaxy backed out of the deal due to financial difficulties amid the crypto bear market rather than any fault of BitGo’s. Conversely, Galaxy maintains that its decision to terminate the merger was justified by BitGo’s failure to provide necessary audited financial statements on time.



The merger, announced by Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz in May 2021, was called off in August 2022. The dissent centers on the interpretation of financial statements required under the agreement.



Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster initially ruled in favor of Galaxy, citing non-compliant financial documents provided by BitGo. However, the Supreme Court’s recent ruling identified the definition of financial statements as ambiguous, necessitating further examination and thus reviving BitGo lawsuit.

‘I Feel Super Confident About That’: Jack Mallers Says Bitcoin To Explode by up to 1,357% - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) wallet and payments application Strike, Jack Mallers, is predicting that the flagship crypto asset could hit a seven-figure price.
Mallers says in a new interview with Anthony Pompliano that Bitcoin could soar between 260% and 1,357% in the coming months.










“I think we’re still so early in the Bitcoin story. I’m publicly on record saying I think Bitcoin hits $250,000 to $1 million in this cycle. So now I’m speaking the next 10 to 18 months.”
Bitcoin is trading at $68,653 at time of writing.
Mallers predicts that the US government will be forced to turn on the money printers to pay the bills on its record-high $34.577 trillion debt. Mallers says that the ensuing currency debasement will provide the catalyst needed to send Bitcoin soaring to his astronomical price target.
“I think people would be willing to pay $250,000 for a Bitcoin based on the mess that I think… I mean, there’s a massive hole and there’s a loss that has to be realized. That loss is going to come through debasing the currency. Asset prices are going to go up and what is the best asset and the best-performing asset? What’s the best money in human history? And so I think that has to be accurately priced.”
The Strike CEO also says that he feels “super confident” about his big price target for BTC.
“People are too fixated on the cost of capital as far as rates. They need to be more fixated on the amount of capital which is they’re still printing dollars. It doesn’t matter that rates are at 5.5% – it’s still inflationary.
And so for those reasons… how am I supposed to predict the most fixed asset in the history of mankind against the biggest f***ed-up problem that central banks have ever had to try and solve? I mean, come on $250,000 to $1 million. I feel super confident about that.”

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) Will Explode 16,000%, As It Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Fuks Biden presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Fuks Biden has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe Fuks Biden could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Pepe Fuks Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Fuks Biden on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Fuks Biden by entering its contract address – 4D3CzRs6n4hPrHJsqon5oDVKRe8nhaiBL1mQGowzhPvg – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEFBID.

The importance of liquidity in the crypto market

On the crypto market, liquidity is a very important parameter. 
Indeed, among all the parameters, it is the one that individually can have the greatest impact on prices, in addition to individual events of systemic importance. 

The role of liquidity in financial markets
With the term “liquidità” we refer to those assets that can be traded on the market very easily and quickly. 
The most liquid instrument of all is money, also because it was created specifically to be easily exchangeable in an extremely rapid manner. 
There are also assets that are extremely difficult to sell, such as those that are locked until a certain date. 
The more an asset can be easily and quickly sold, the more it is considered liquid, therefore there are different degrees of liquidity. 
Money is the most liquid asset that exists, while for example physical gold is a bit less liquid. A property by its very nature is not very liquid, because it takes a while to sell it, while some assets can even be totally illiquid if they cannot be spent at all (such as seized funds).
On financial markets, in general, the assets that are traded are liquid, except for those that cannot be transferred because they are restricted. 
But even in financial markets, there are different degrees of liquidity. 
In particular, when we talk about financial markets with real liquidity, we mean money, and those assets that are nothing more than highly liquid different forms of money. 
In other terms, in financial markets, liquidity is simply constituted by the most liquid assets. Among these are cash, both in physical and digital form, and those very short-term investments considered equivalent to cash. 
Liquidity in the crypto market
Il mercato crypto è solamente una porzione del mercato finanziario generale. 
So what applies to traditional financial markets also applies to crypto markets, regarding liquidity. 
What changes, however, are precisely the assets that are considered liquid in the crypto market. 
Just like in traditional financial markets, in the crypto market an important part of the liquidity is made up of fiat money. 
Tuttavia, a differenza di quanto comunemente si pensa, sui mercati crypto il denaro fiat non è quello più facilmente e velocemente spostabile. 
For example, to withdraw or deposit fiat currency on exchanges, it takes from a few minutes to a few days, while with other assets the movement is easier and faster. 
Ecco così che sul mercato crypto la maggior parte della liquidità è composta da token che replicano le valute fiat, ovvero dalle cosiddette stablecoin. 
To tell the truth, there are also stablecoin not pegged to fiat currencies, such as tokenized gold, but nowadays the term stablecoin is often used as a synonym for tokenized fiat currencies. 
The majority of liquidity in the crypto markets is made up of tokenized fiat currencies, or stablecoin, with fiat money following in second place. In third place are algorithmic stablecoin, while any other forms of liquidity in the crypto markets are practically absent. 
How liquidity moves
On financial markets, the most important thing regarding liquidity is not the amount present, but the speed at which it is traded. 
For example, if a billion dollars were traded only once a day, it would have a lower impact than a million dollars traded more than ten times a day. 
The sudden movements of liquidity that shift from one asset to another are the true culprits of price volatility. 
In general, however, regarding long-term price trends, the overall liquidity variation matters a lot. For example, between 2020 and 2021, when the Fed injected more dollars into the financial markets in less than two years than there were in total in 2019, the result was a generic strong and sudden rise in all prices. 
In other terms, the increase in liquidity tends to generate inflation, because it actually triggers an increase in purchase demand. 
Therefore, in the medium-long term, the variations in overall liquidity matter a lot, while in the short term, how quickly it moves matters more. 
For example, cash money held idle in a bank account does not generate the slightest volatility in the financial markets, whereas if it is spent to purchase financial assets it can generate a price increase. 
The current crypto situation: market and liquidity
One data point that can help understand the current liquidity level of the crypto markets is the trading volumes in stablecoin. 
Among other things, it should be noted that practically every day the cryptocurrency that records the highest trading volumes is USDT, which is absolutely one of the most liquid. 
Tendenzialmente i volumi di scambio giornaliero di USDT sui mercati crypto (circa 100 miliardi di dollari) sono doppi rispetto a quello di Bitcoin e Ethereum (entrambi attorno ai 50 miliardi), e di circa 10 volte superiori a quelli della seconda maggiore stablecoin, USDT (10 miliardi). 
Sui mercati finanziari tradizionali il volume di scambio complessivo di USD è enormemente superiore, tanto che ad esempio il singolo titolo Nvidia sta facendo registrare volumi di scambi giornalieri non molto distanti da quelli di USDT sui mercati crypto, e quasi doppi rispetto a quelli di Bitcoin o di Ethereum. 
Taking instead as a reference the overall trading volumes in all cryptocurrencies, the crypto market in recent days is recording a daily trading volume exceeding 100 billion dollars, but at the beginning of May it was only 70. 
During the peak in mid-March, they had risen to 150, which is well below the all-time highs of 300 billion dollars traded, for example, on April 19, 2021. 
In other words, the liquidity circulating in the crypto markets actually varies from day to day, even if with not exaggerated variations, but it varies especially from period to period, with large jumps during the bullrun, and strong contractions during the bear-market. 
Note that these variations not only affect volatility but also prices, and it is precisely for this reason that when there is less liquidity, prices tend to be low, while when liquidity rises, it also tends to increase prices.

Airdrop season in arrivo a giugno: gli ultimi aggiornamenti crypto

In June, a myriad of crypto airdrops are expected: after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Ethereum spot ETFs, several projects have planned to launch their own governance token shortly, taking advantage of the current wave of optimism and enthusiasm.
First of all zkSync, Ethereum’s L2 zkrollup scaling solution, which according to some rumors would release its own token ZK in mid-June.
Are we officially in the airdrop season phase? All the details below.

The launch of the zkSync token $ZK could inaugurate the airdrop season in June
As mentioned, the most watched crypto project of the moment by airdrop hunters is the zk-rollup zkSync Era network, controlled by the blockchain development company Matter Labs.
As reported by the information site The Block, on Tuesday, May 21, as soon as the L2 developer saw the probabilities of the approval of the Ethereum spot ETF increase, they sped up the TGE process, trying to launch their governance token as soon as possible.
Even though the official confirmation from the zkSync team has not yet arrived, according to internal sources at The Block, it seems that the scheduled date for the airdrop is around June 13, or in any case before the Blast token airdrop scheduled for June 26.
the ticker chosen for the cryptocurrency of the project is ZK (while many expected ZKS), which has fueled quite a few controversies since the same ticker was chosen by the Polyhedra Network team, which, however, has never seen a listing on Binance.
The same ZK token, expected at most 30 days after the TGE, is already being traded in premarket on platforms like Aevo, after the reference price is around 0.60 dollars.
Considering that according to rumors, the zkSync coin will have a supply of 21 billion tokens, with a price per token of 0.60 dollars the FDV would reach 12.6 billion dollars.
Source: https://app.aevo.xyz/perpetual/zk
It is not the first time that speculations have been fueled regarding the long-awaited airdrop of this Ethereum L2: last week, the same zkSync team hinted at a symbolic launch and airdrop by the end of June, saying that it will soon implement an update to accelerate the decentralization of its protocol.
“The imminent release of v24 is the final planned protocol upgrade necessary before handing over network governance to the community,” stated zkSync last week. “The remaining missing pieces should be in place by the end of June.”
Il lancio di ZK potrebbe inaugurare ufficialmente l’airdrop season di giugno.
With a TVL of 872 million dollars according to L2Beat and several hundred million dollars in VC funding obtained from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Dragonfly Capital, Blockchain Capital, Crypto.com Capital, Placeholder Capital, and 1kx, the zkSync airdrop could offer significant rewards to its early adopters.
Some might, however, be left out given the large participation of the farmers: in total there are over 3.4 million active addresses, 8.1 million transactions, 15 billion dollars in bridged value, and almost 3 million bridgers.
Source: https://dune.com/gm365/L2
In any case, according to some users on X, that of zkSync could be the largest airdrop of all time in terms of value given to the community, potentially even better than that of Arbitrum.
Noi del team di The Cryptonomist, have been talking about it since May 2023.
We remain waiting to receive more information directly from the project team. Probably as early as next week, the checker will arrive to check which addresses are eleggibili to claim the reward.

All the upcoming crypto airdrops: which projects can you still qualify for?
Besides zkSync, many other projects are about to launch their own crypto on the market by initiating an airdrop to their respective communities, taking advantage of the positive wave in the crypto market.
One of the most anticipated launches concerns the interoperability protocol LayerZero, which has already announced snapshot n°1 on May 1st, indicating that ZRO will soon be officially listed within the crypto markets.
Here too the large participation of airdrop hunters, of which a large portion is verosimilmente a large slice sybil, has forced the project to identify criteria that will discard a significant portion of the users of the omni chain technology.
Tuttavia, considerando i prezzi in pre-market, ci si aspetta una FDV del token ZRO almeno a 15-20 miliardi di dollari al lancio, tale da riuscire a fare arricchire diversi utenti che si sono posizionati già diversi mesi fa.

Il mercato delle criptovalute è noto per i suoi cicli di bull e bear. Durante un mercato bull, i prezzi tendono a salire rapidamente, mentre in un mercato bear, i prezzi scendono. Gli investitori devono essere preparati a navigare attraverso entrambi i tipi di mercati.
Anche il protocollo di restaking Swell is about to launch the airdrop of its namesake token SWELL, with the TGE that would be imminent according to the project’s team.
While other competitors like Etherfi and Renzo have already played their cards, with the tokens ETHFI and REZ already present on the crypto exchanges, Swell has waited for the most opportune moment to introduce its asset on the crypto exchanges.
With a recent tweet, the protocol announced that it has increased the allocation planned for the airdrop from 7% to 8%, aiming to increase public engagement during a moment of euphoria for the entire EVM sector.
The SWELL coin has been tradable in pre-market for about a month, and an FDV of approximately 1.34 billion dollars is hypothesized at launch. The “pearls” points should be valued at around 0.5 dollars.

Worth noting is also what was revealed this week by Taiko, a based-rollup sequenced by Ethereum, which announced the arrival of its own token TKO with the launch of the airdrop checker. 
Eligible users have until May 29 to check their eligibility and 30 days to execute the claim once it is open to the public.
Click on this link to check the eligibility of your addresses.
TKO is already trading in pre-market at a price of about 2 dollars, bringing the FDV valuation around 2 billion dollars.
In this case, some users reported a positive allocation for the airdrop of Taiko, with rewards worth at least 1500 dollars while others reported poor allocations compared to the time and fees spent to grow the project.

Il mercato delle criptovalute è noto per i suoi cicli di bull e bear. Durante un mercato bull, i prezzi tendono a salire rapidamente, mentre in un mercato bear, i prezzi scendono.
There are then a wide range of secondary projects that could take advantage of the positive momentum of the airdrop season by launching their own cryptographic coins.
Among these, the most likely for an airdrop in June are: DeBridge, Debank, BItget Wallet, Syncswap, Blast, Orbiter, and others.
Instead, the next big projects on which it is still possible to take actions to qualify for the airdrop are Linea and Scroll, both l2 of Ethereum that could launch a token by the end of the year.

The power of Quantum Computing


One of the exponential technologies that is not yet getting its fair share of love from the general public and media is Quantum computing. In the past few years, I had the privilege of spending time discussing it with people from CERN and the Fermi Lab, but my conversation with Scott Crowder, Vice President IBM Quantum Adoption and Business Development, had the right mix of theory and real-life examples, which will make anyone understand the potential of this field of research and its business applications. AI will keep its hype for a good while, as we see from its pervasive presence in every corner of the internet. Quantum can be the next big thing. This is our dialogue. 
Who are you and what do you do for a living?
My name is Scott Crowder, and I run IBM’s Quantum efforts to boost its adoption, together with our partners and industry clients. Our goal is to build a useful Quantum computing infrastructure and to help the world make a Quantum-safe transition, in the next ten years or so. I am an engineer by training and had worked on semi-conductors in the past, before taking on the role of CTO for IBM Systems. With Quantum, it’s the first time where we have a ‘use first’ attitude, where we try things with partners, we teach and learn with our clients, before we scale-up projects. It’s interesting and it’s fun.  
What are the three ‘killer’ use cases for Quantum, for what we know now?
Firstly, simulating nature, like materials’ science – new materials, or chemistry, for example better battery chemistry, to mention something that is very ‘hot’ right now. We do physics simulations or try to understand how complex proteins would behave. These are operations that entail higher computing power than what we could do with today’s computers. 
Secondly, we try to find patterns out of complex data. For example, a classification of a piece of data as fraud or not. If there is some structure in the data before us, Quantum computing is much better than classical computers to give meaning to it and even pick up things like false positives. This is extremely useful, if we want to make sense of the world.  
Lastly, I would say, portfolio optimization, finding efficiencies, and distribution optimization. There are direct and huge applications here, for multiple industries. Think of the mobility or logistics markets, for example. This third use case is slightly farther out from us, in terms of time to market, when compared to the first two. 
Where are we really, when it comes to Quantum adoption in the real world?
To simplify it: Quantum is better at doing what it does best, namely simulations. For sure, to do it at scale, larger systems are needed. So, we are looking at 2030 and beyond. What we are doing now is, let’s say, algorithmic explorations. We work with a mix of partners: heavy industry conglomerates, banking, pharma, transportation, and startups. And, obviously, universities and research institutions. 
Big Tech is also into Quantum, even though the talk of the town is AI. Intel, Microsoft, Google, AWS: all have investments and programs in Quantum, with different approaches to it.
What is the future business model of Quantum? How are you going to sell it?
It’s hard to say right now. We must make some assumptions. It’s probably going to continue to be, in the medium term, a cloud service, where partners have access to the Quantum capabilities we have built, via API calls, and they can interact with our experts, who help with the prototyping and the training. Basically, it’s going to be the same as a standard cloud business model. There will be ad hoc projects for sure, where the stakes are high, and we can unlock tremendous economic value. In a way, the approach is more like how we weave CPUs and GPUs into a compute fabric, and not via a single application per se, like a Chat GPT for Quantum. 
What would you say is the number one risk associated with Quantum?
Cybersecurity is for sure the number one risk. Future, more powerful Quantum computers will crack at some point the current asymmetric cryptography, which protects public and private information, for example (mobile data, payments, medical records, etc…). The math for that already exists. There are Quantum-safe cryptography solutions, but a full ecosystem of security providers and coding will need to change, to account for the Quantum shift, and to make sure we have a Quantum safe era.
Where can we find you and learn more about Quantum?
A simple search for anything related to IBM Quantum will do. I am also active on social media, like LinkedIn. IBM writes a lot of articles on Quantum. We need to talk about it publicly, and have people understand this is real, and it has great potential to bring tremendous value to society and business, across all industries. You may think this is science fiction, as it’s going to hit us in our next decade, but it is a new way of approaching complex problems. It could help other applications and use cases, as well, like AI, and this is why it’s the right moment to talk Quantum.

NFT fest + TECH fest + WUF: 3 festivals in a single weekend on art and new technologies in Lugano in the Canton Ticino (Switzerland)


This year Lugano triples the offer of festivals linked to new technologies. After the experiences of past years, the time had come to provide some vertical content for the different communities and the different interests linked to the world of digital avant-garde.
On 14 and 15 June 2024 in Lugano there will be:
NFT fest: dedicated to Web3 communities, and to fans of NFTs in all its multifaceted forms;
TECH fest: focused on the world of start-ups, investors and the latest technological innovations;
WUF: acronym for “We Understand the Future”, a vertical format on new art forms linked to the latest technologies.
All of which forms the Lugano Digital Weekend, which will spread across the entire city and the Canton Ticino.
Thanks to the collaboration between FFS and Lugano Living Lab (the city’s digital laboratory), entry tickets to events will also be valid as transport tickets on public transport within the entire Arcobaleno fare community for the duration of their validity. Tickets can be booked at www.nft-fest.com. Participants will thus have the opportunity to easily reach Lugano from all over Ticino using the public transport network for FREE.
The epicenter of the various festivals will be the town hall and its Piazza della Riforma (main city square). Inside the courtyard of the municipal building there will be keynotes and podcasts from industry representatives and major influencers. And like last year, it will also be an opportunity to discuss and “clash” on the various sensitive and important, and sometimes divisive, topics that concern technological innovation.
Above all, there will be space for innovations and the city will anticipate some strategic activities undertaken to facilitate the re-location of technological start-ups in the area.
Dozens of side-events in those days, in a city that stands out for its vibrant activity in the month of June. At the gates of summer, on the lake, with a Mediterranean climate, schools just finished and lots of people around the city.
Michele Foletti, mayor of Lugano declares:

“The courage demonstrated several times by the city of Lugano inspires new initiatives on technological innovation and artistic avant-garde in the digital world. We are proud to involve more and more people in our territory, which today is talked about in the world”.

Roberto Gorini, organizer of NFT fest and TECH fest reiterates that:

“Lugano demonstrates once again that it firmly believes in new technologies, and in the ecosystem that this industry brings. In fact, we remember that Lugano was the first city in the world to equip itself with its own cryptocurrency for payments, its own wallet, its own confederated and institutional blockchain, several incubators for startups and various training courses dedicated to companies, individuals and to the world of business”.

LayerZero Sybil Bounty Reopened On May 28 With Deposit Requirement For Report - Coincu



	

Key Points:




LayerZero Labs introduces deposit requirements for LayerZero Sybil Bounty submissions.



The process will prioritize GitHub reports and bound addresses.



LayerZero aims to fight Sybil activity with over 3,000 bounty reports received following the latest airdrop phase.




LayerZero Labs, the entity behind LayerZero, a blockchain interoperability protocol, has announced plans to reopen submissions for the LayerZero Sybil Bounty, introducing a deposit requirement. The mechanism aims to ensure the integrity of submissions and deter fraud activity.





LayerZero Labs Implements Deposit Requirement for LayerZero Sybil Bounty Submissions



Effective immediately, all LayerZero Sybil Bounty hunters must deposit 0.5 ETH from their reward address to a specified account to be considered eligible for submitting reports. The deposit will be refunded after the Token Generation Event (TGE) if the report is considered honest and successful. However, failure to adhere to submission guidelines, including any form of fraud or plagiarism, will result in forfeiture of the deposit.



The deposit process opens on May 25th at 2:00 UTC, with submission reopening on May 28th at 00:00 UTC for a 48-hour window on Commonwealth. Submissions close on May 30th at 00:00 UTC. 



LayerZero’s Battle Against Sybil Activity



Priority will be given to LayerZero Sybil Bounty reports submitted on GitHub and bound addresses, with new reports evaluated on a “first-come, first-serve basis.” Successful reporters stand to receive a 10% bonus at TGE.




LayerZero Labs is taking proactive steps to combat Sybil activity, a practice where users manipulate multiple wallets to exploit airdrop rewards unfairly. Following the latest phase of LayerZero’s airdrop, which targets Sybils who failed to self-report, CEO Bryan Pellegrino revealed the receipt of over 3,000 bounty reports and 30,000 appeals. Additionally, some users resorted to reporting accusers’ accounts on GitHub to eliminate competition.

Marathon Digital Exploring Opportunities With Kenya Minis...


                                Marathon Digital Tie-Up with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum                                Marathon Digital is a Bitcoin mining company that has recently entered into a partnership with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum (MOEP). This collaboration is expected to profoundly transform the Kenyan renewable energy industry with Marathon Digital’s assistance for the development of energy solutions and strategies.What's the News?Marathon Digital has struck a deal with the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum of Kenya to enhance the nation’s renewable power endeavors. The cooperation will be based on sharing technical expertise, policies, investments, and building of the necessary energy assets. This is considered the major strategic move for Marathon Digital as it opens up a clear roadmap of how the company can expand and invest in opportunities in Kenya. Fred Thiel, the Marathon Digital CEO mentioned that this partnership indicates the innovative approach taken in Kenya to improve the utilization of energy and the enhancement of technological systems.Kenya’s Renewable Energy PracticesCurrently, Kenya is among the leading countries in the utilization of renewable energy sources, as more than 80% of electricity is produced using renewables, as noted by the ITA. The renewable energy sources in the country include wind, solar, hydropower, and geothermal, and out of all these the largest source is geothermal. Kenya has been identified as one of the cheapest producers of geothermal power in the world, and it is endowed with excellent solar resources.Why Kenya Banned WorldcoinAlthough Kenya is among the African countries with progressive policies on renewable energy, the government has not yet been very receptive to digital currencies and blockchain solutions. In September 2023, the Kenyan authorities decided to ban the activities of Worldcoin for one year. Worldcoin is a cryptocurrency project that aims to create a digital asset company that desires to ensure fairness without any fraud. This ban on Worldcoin by Kenya’s Ministry stemmed from the opinions of different governmental bodies and authorities due to privacy, transparency, and security issues connected with the collection of biometric data by Worldcoin. The government insisted that Worldcoin had to seek authorization from the Capital Markets Authority of Kenya and conduct a DPIA and a state-led data security workshop before it could resume operations in the country.ConclusionWhat CoinGabbar has piled up with this finding is that the Marathon Digital has signed a deal with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, marking a new chapter in the relationship between renewable energy and digital technology. Although Kenya is one of the leading countries in the generation of renewable energy, this new partnership demonstrates Kenya’s interest in innovative methods in energy management as well as in technology. Nevertheless, the critical attitude towards digital assets, such as the temporary ban on Worldcoin proves that the government prioritizes the citizens’ privacy and security. This ensures that Kenya encourages new technologies but citizens’ data and privacy are protected.Also Read: Elon Musk Revealing Dangers Of Politically Correct AI

Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Equal March Record as BTC Price Heads for $69K


																Spot Bitcoin ETFs had some hard times at the end of April and especially on May 1, but the trend has changed now with 10 consecutive days of positive flows.
This comes as BTC’s price went on a rollercoaster propelled by the news surrounding the Ethereum ETFs, but the asset now heads toward $69,000.
The cryptocurrency industry saw a massive milestone in January when the US Securities and Exchange Commission finally greenlighted nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs after a decade of rejecting or delaying every application.
The effects were immediate as these products started attracting billions of dollars in the first few months. Then came April, though, when the trend changed, and there were numerous days in the red.
May 1 was the most painful in terms of outflows, as the total amount withdrawn on that date was north of $560 million.
The tides turned once again in the following weeks, especially after the favorable data from the US CPI numbers for April. In fact, May 10 was the last date when the largest ETFs saw negative numbers.
The financial products have been on an impressive streak since then, equalling the 10 consecutive day record from March of inflows. May 15 and 21 saw inflows of more than $300 million, while May 24’s numbers exceeded $250 million.
BlackRock’s IBIT leads the pack once again in terms of inflows and has attracted over $16,350 billion. Grayscale is still the leader with $20 billion, according to SoSovalue, but the outflows there suggest that BlackRock will surpass it in the near future.
Overall, the total inflows in all ETFs are close to $13.7 billion. Meanwhile, Ethereum fans also saw some positive developments this week as the US SEC greenlighted eight spot ETH ETFs. However, it’s still uncertain when they will launch.
BTC responded with lots of volatility to the Ethereum news, skyrocketing from $67,000 to $72,000 before dumping to under $66,000 this week. The past 24 hours have been more positive, perhaps driven by the impressive inflows, and BTC now stands close to $69,000.

Bitcoin Purchased By ETFs Surpass 12,000 Mark This Week With Optimism - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Spot market Bitcoin ETFs attracted over $1.68 billion in inflows over ten days, with $252 million on May 24 alone.



Currently, the total amount of Bitcoin purchased by ETFs constitutes 4.36% of the total Bitcoin supply.



The SEC’s approval of ETFs coincides with a surge in speculation and the establishment of new venture capital and hedge funds.




New HODL15Capital data has revealed a significant surge in spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), reporting ten consecutive days of inflows totaling over $1.68 billion.

Bitcoin Purchased By ETFs Hit Impressive Milestone This Week



On May 24 alone, the total net inflow reached $252 million, marking a consistent upward trend over the past week. Notable contributors to this influx include BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, with an inflow of $182 million, and Fidelity’s FBTC ETF, with $43.7083 million. Combined, Bitcoin purchased by ETFs on May 24, reaching 3,654, and over 12,000 throughout the week.



These ETFs offer investors exposure to Bitcoin, allowing them to tap into the crypto asset’s market potential without directly purchasing it. Currently, Bitcoin purchased by ETFs constitutes 4.36% of the total Bitcoin supply, valued at $59.07 billion, as shown by SoSo Value.




SEC Approves Ethereum ETFs Amid Growing Investor Interest



Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a widening acceptance of cryptocurrency investment vehicles. Following the success of Bitcoin ETFs, the market has witnessed a surge in speculation, with new funds emerging at an accelerated pace.



The cryptocurrency investment landscape witnessed a significant surge in activity, with 25 new venture capital and hedge funds established, according to Crypto Fund Research. This marks the highest number of fund launches since the second quarter of 2021, highlighting a growing interest in digital assets among investors.



Comparatively, the number of newly established funds has doubled from those closed during the same period, indicating a bullish sentiment prevailing in the market. Moreover, the figure represents nearly three times the number of funds introduced in the first quarter of 2023.

Santiment Announced: This Altcoin Diverged Positively from Others - "For Every Transaction at a Loss, There Are 11 Transactions in Profit" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment, in its latest analysis, found that one altcoin differs quite positively compared to others.
According to the analysis company's report, Chainlink (LINK) showed a much higher performance than the rise of other cryptocurrencies and exceeded the $ 17.50 level for the first time in 6 weeks.


According to analysts, onchain data showed that for every 1 LINK transaction made at a loss, 11 LINK transactions made at a profit were detected. Santiment reported that this rate is the highest rate since December 8, 2022.
LINK, the world's 14th largest cryptocurrency, has been well-received by the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the SEC. The price of the altcoin increased by nearly 8% in the last week. At the time of writing this article, the price of the altcoin is trading at $17.36.






However, LINK price is still far from its all-time high price level. During the big bull of 2021, the LINK price briefly climbed to $52.88. This shows that the current price is 67% lower than the all-time high price level.
In terms of market value, LINK is approximately 50% lower than the ATH level in 2021.

Cat-Themed v. Dog-Themed Meme Coins: ChatGPT Analyzes Which Will Perform Better in 2024


																TL;DR

Dog-themed meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) dominate due to strong communities and endorsements, while cat-themed ones like Popcat (POPCAT) are gaining interest but remain less popular.
Pepe (PEPE) has recently surged and could also become a top meme coin this year with continued community support and strategic developments, though investors should be cautious due to market volatility.


What Are the Expectations?
The meme coin realm has made great strides in the past several months, with its total market capitalization surpassing the $60 billion mark. Dog-themed sector leaders such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and many others have charted substantial price increases, capturing the attention of industry participants.
However, recently emerged cat-themed meme coins, including Popcat (POPCAT), Cat in a Dogs World (MEW), and Mog Coin (MOG), have also made the headlines thanks to their rising value and increased investor interest. As such, we decided to ask ChatGPT which niche will perform better in the remaining months of 2024.
The AI-powered chatbot stated that such a prediction is “highly speculative” due to the asset class’s infamous volatility. It also claimed that meme coins thrive on community enthusiasm and social media trends, suggesting that the popularity of cat-themed versus dog-themed coins can shift rapidly based on viral trends and influencer endorsements.
Other essential factors that can tip the scales are technological developments, regulatory environment, strategic partnerships, and marketing efforts.




ChatGPT noted that dog-themed meme coins, such as DOGE and SHIB, currently have the edge due to their well-established communities, substantial market caps, and support from popular figures. A recent study estimated that Shiba Inu has the strongest community base in the cohort, followed by Dogecoin. 
For its part, DOGE is the favorite cryptocurrency of Tesla’s CEO – Elon Musk. The billionaire often praises its merits, while the EV giant officially integrated it as a payment option on its website recently.
Cat-themed memes are less popular, but according to ChatGPT, they can benefit from specific marketing moves:
“A viral trend or major endorsement could propel a cat-themed coin to prominence, especially if it taps into a currently underserved niche. Strong marketing campaigns and community engagement could help a cat-themed coin gain ground on its dog-themed counterparts.”
Currently, the gap in terms of market capitalization between the top cat-themed meme coin POPCAT and the leading dog-themed DOGE is over $22 billion. However, the ever-evolving meme coin sector is capable of offering surprises, so it will be interesting to follow what will happen in the following months.
Meanwhile, if you are about to enter the ecosystem as an investor, please check our dedicated video to protect yourself from some common mistakes:
VIDEO
How About Another Scenario?
One meme coin that has been crypto’s rock star in the past few days due to reaching a new all-time high price is the frog-themed Pepe (PEPE). As such, we conducted a separate ChatGPT query asking about its chances of emerging as the sector’s leader before the end of 2024.
The chatbot noted PEPE’s recent strong market momentum, claiming that “sustained community support and engagement” are crucial for reaching the top. 
Additionally, ChatGPT estimated that the asset’s price and market capitalization could take off if the team behind the project implements technological advancements or developments that add utility and thus attract more investors. 
“If PEPE continues to capture the interest of the crypto community, it could indeed rise to the top of the meme coin rankings. However, given the speculative nature of meme coins, investors should approach with caution and stay informed about market developments,” the chatbot concluded.

                        Bitcoin whales, large holders of the cryptocurrency, have shown an increased appetite for accumulating more coins, signaling a return of confidence in the bull market, as per blockchain data.The resurgence in whale activity comes after the price of Bitcoin reached its all-time high in March and subsequently experienced a significant market correction.Market intelligence firm CryptoQuant highlighted the strong buying force exhibited by whales, indicating their belief that current prices are favorable for purchasing and accumulating Bitcoin, despite prevailing fear and market uncertainty.Analysts pointed to the rise in the 30-day percentage change in whale address holdings, along with an increase in the total BTC balance held by whales.Whales Buy Bitcoin Aggressively During Bull Markets
Whales, defined as owners of Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC (excluding mining firms and crypto exchanges), tend to buy Bitcoin more aggressively during bull markets and reduce their buying activity during bear markets.Throughout March, whales had increased their BTC holdings by over 9.8%. Although their accumulation rate slowed in April to 4.2% by May 1, coinciding with Bitcoin’s price decline of over 20% to under $57,000, the metric has now rebounded to 5.5% as of May 22.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju previously noted that whales had acquired 47,000 BTC during the sharp market dip in early May, further indicating their confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects.The amount of money invested by whales in Bitcoin has significantly grown from $57 billion to $122 billion since the beginning of the year, as observed through the “realized cap” metric, which considers the total value of all whale-held coins based on their purchase time rather than the current market value.Bitcoin’s price has recently risen to $68,760, marking a 3% increase over the week and reflecting the renewed optimism in the market.Lead Glassnode analyst James Check emphasized that the Bitcoin network’s total realized cap has reached a record high of $578 billion, underscoring the robust fundamentals of the cryptocurrency.However, Check believes that the market is still far from entering the true euphoria phase of the bull market, suggesting that the current sentiment falls somewhere between enthusiasm and excitement.Institutional Investors Increase Crypto Exposure
Nearly 40% of institutional investors had some exposure to crypto assets in 2023, a notable rise from the 31% recorded in 2021.According to a recent survey, a third of respondents reported having at least 10% of their portfolio allocated to crypto assets, compared to only a fifth of respondents two years ago.As reported, Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x Research, previously predicted that a breakthrough above $67,500 could potentially lead to new all-time highs. Currently, BTC is trading at $68,700, less than $5,000 away from reaching a new all-time high in U.S. dollars.Aside from 10x Research, some other analysts have also turned bullish on Bitcoin following weeks-long consolidation.Leading trading firm QCP Capital has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s price momentum, forecasting a potential return to the highs of $74,000.

Warren Buffett Disciple Pabrai Retains His Mentor's Stance On Bitcoin Despite Rally: 'Going To End Badly' - Benzinga

This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.Amid the volatile waves of the cryptocurrency market, Mohnish Pabrai, an investment fund manager often likened to Warren Buffett, has cast a shadow of doubt over the future of Bitcoin.What Happened: Pabrai, in a recent appearance on the My First Million podcast, shared his critical perspective on Bitcoin, hinting at a bleak future for the digital currency. He admitted that Bitcoin BTC/USD is beyond his expertise and bluntly stated, “If you put a gun to my head, I would say it’s going to end badly.” His skepticism is rooted in the absence of intrinsic value in Bitcoin, which he believes is essential for investment.Drawing a parallel between Bitcoin and the US dollar, “The Dhando Investor” author pointed out that despite the dollar’s lack of intrinsic value, it is underpinned by “the full faith and credit of the US government,” bolstered by the trust of the American people. This kind of support, he argues, is starkly missing for Bitcoin.If you’d like to stay ahead of the curve on the Indian market, sign up for our Ring The Bell newsletter by clicking here.Pabrai also cautioned that most individuals should steer clear of investing in Bitcoin, as many are unable to justify its value or foresee its future trajectory. His views mirror the approach of many value investors who question the cryptocurrency’s foundational support and its prospects for longevity.Why It Matters: Pabrai’s apprehension towards Bitcoin resonates with the sentiments of other prominent figures in the investment world. Charlie Munger and Buffett, two of the most respected investors globally, have also expressed their disdain for Bitcoin, albeit for different reasons. Buffett once famously referred to Bitcoin as “probably rat poison squared,” underscoring his skepticism about its value.Moreover, the call for a crackdown on Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry by the JPMorgan CEO has added to the negative sentiment, although this stance was met with ridicule on social media. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies are hitting new highs with Bitcoin trading above ₹56.2 lakh and Ethereum at ₹3.16 lakh.The latest surge is coming after the U.S. markets regulator, the SEC, approved eight Ethereum spot ETFs after giving similar approval for Bitcoin offerings months prior.Image Via ShutterstockRead Next: Sundar Pichai Echoes '3 Idiots' In Chat With Varun Mayya: 'Real Success Comes From...'

Investors Pile Into Bitcoin: Spot ETFs On A Tear For 8 Straight Days


								The floodgates have opened for Bitcoin in the US, with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experiencing a record-breaking eight days of consecutive net inflows. This surge in investor appetite, totaling more than $150 million on a single day, signifies a new era for cryptocurrency accessibility and traditional market acceptance.

Ethereum Enters The Arena
The positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin ETFs extends to its Ethereum counterpart. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently requested amendments and refilings of applications for spot Ether ETFs.
This move, often seen as a precursor to approval, has sent ripples of excitement through the cryptocurrency community. Cboe BZX submitted revised forms for five spot Ether ETFs, while Nasdaq filed the amended form for BlackRock’s offering.
The potential approval of spot Ether ETFs could further fuel the digital asset market. Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, boasts a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Investor interest in gaining exposure to this rapidly evolving space is undeniable.

Bitcoin: Regulation Paves The Way, BlackRock Leads The Charge
This bullish run coincides with the recent passing of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the U.S. House of Representatives. The act aims to establish a long-awaited legal framework for the digital asset industry, empowering the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with greater oversight of crypto assets as “digital commodities.”
While the FIT21 Act marks a significant step towards crypto regulation, it’s not without its critics. Concerns surround the lack of robust consumer protection measures in the current version of the bill. However, the act’s passage signifies a willingness from lawmakers to embrace the future of finance, and further refinements are expected to address consumer safety concerns.


BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner in this gold rush, attracting a staggering $92 million in inflows. This move by the world’s largest asset manager validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class and is likely influencing other institutional investors to follow suit. Fidelity Digital Assets’ Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF is another major player, raking in $75 million, further solidifying the trend.

While Grayscale’s industry-leading Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) witnessed a minor setback with net outflows, the overall sentiment remains overwhelmingly optimistic. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively garnered a staggering $13.33 billion since their launch in January, reflecting a massive vote of confidence from investors.
Additionally, the cumulative trading volume surpasses $267 billion, highlighting a highly liquid market eager to absorb new investments.
A New Era For Digital Assets
The confluence of surging investor interest, regulatory progress, and the potential arrival of spot Ether ETFs paints a bright picture for the future of digital assets in the US.

As traditional finance embraces Bitcoin and potentially Ethereum, a new era of accessibility and legitimacy dawns for the cryptocurrency market. However, regulatory hurdles remain, and ensuring investor protection will be crucial for sustained growth. With careful navigation, the US has the potential to become a global leader in the burgeoning world of digital finance.

Senate Hopeful John Deaton Rebukes Elizabeth Warren's Crypto Policies


							

John Deaton proclaims his fight against the crypto critic Senator Elizabeth Warren.



Deaton calls it a fight against the government overreach, reflecting on his war against the SEC.



The XRP lawyer addresses himself as a pro-freedom rather than a pro-crypto candidate.




John Deaton, an XRP attorney and U.S. Senate candidate, has intensified his battle against crypto-critic Senator Elizabeth Warren. Positioning himself as a “pro-freedom candidate,” the XRP lawyer proclaimed his fight against what he terms “government overreach.”







Deaton is well-known among crypto enthusiasts as an XRP attorney who joined the community to challenge the SEC’s regulatory actions. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which seeks to classify XRP as a security, remains unresolved and has been a focal point of Deaton’s advocacy.



As an opponent of Warren, who recently reiterated her anti-crypto stance and formed the “anti-crypto army,” Deaton does not consider himself a pro-crypto candidate but rather a pro-freedom candidate. Criticizing Warren’s strong opposition to cryptocurrencies, Deaton asserted it is “anti-American.”



In his recent post on X, he drew parallels between his prolonged conflict with the SEC and his opposition to Warren. He highlighted his disagreement with both the SEC and Senator Warren over their anti-crypto measures and regulatory overreach. He stated, “It’s the most important AND most difficult fight against government overreach.”



Ahead of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, President Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump have clarified their stances on crypto. Trump announced his support for crypto and has even begun accepting crypto donations, while Biden has sworn to combat cryptocurrencies, forming an anti-crypto coalition.









Referring to the political divide between Republicans and Democrats on crypto, Deaton emphasized Warren’s significant role in exacerbating this divide. He remarked, “It’s fueled by my opponent, Elizabeth Warren, who just fuels the division.”



Recently, when Warren demanded stricter crypto regulations, including oversight of crypto and stablecoin users, Deaton criticized her, accusing her of “misleading the American people.” Deaton advocated a balanced approach to crypto regulation that fosters innovation while addressing risks.

Uniswap price jumps 20% as UNI hints at massive breakout - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Uniswap price reached highs of $10.99 on May 25, rising more than 20% in 24 hours.
UNI gained amid whale activity, Ethereum ecosystem developments and Uniswap Labs’ response to SEC’s Wells Notice.
The technical picture also hints at a breakout that could push UNI price to $15.40 and towards $2.

Uniswap price jumped more than 20% in 24 hours to trade at $10.99, its highest level since early April.
A bullish outlook suggests increased buying pressure could push UNI towards highs of $15.40 reached in March.
Uniswap price and the ETH ecosystem
UNI is the native token of the leading DEX platform, likely one of the top beta plays around the spot Ethereum ETF approval.
On Friday, Uniswap price defied marketwide consolidation, with the price of Ethereum (ETH) hovering above $3,700. As most altcoins looked to bounce off key support levels, UNI price rose more than 20% to touch a multi-week peak of $10.95.
This comes as whales increasingly withdraw UNI from exchanges. According to on-chain details shared by Lookonchain on X, one such whale withdrew $1.96 million in UNI from Binance as price rose.
Uniswap’s upside momentum has also strengthened amid the unveiling of ERC-7683. This new token standard is a collaboration between Uniswap Labs and Across Protocol and aims at streamlining cross-chain trading via a “unified framework for cross-chain intents systems.”
UNI surges after Uniswap response to SEC
Breaching the critical $10 mark also came amid a rising bullish sentiment around Uniswap’s regulatory outlook.
Earlier this week, Uniswap Labs’ reiterated its readiness to fight the SEC’s potential lawsuit following a recent Wells Notice.
According to Uniswap, the SEC is “wrong” in its assertions that the DEX platform is an unregistered securities exchange and broker-dealer. The allegation that UNI is a security is also wrong, with SEC’s theories around it “weak” Uniswap wrote in a response to the regulator.
Uniswap price chart
Uniswap’s surge in the past 24 hours sees UNI breakout of a consolidation phase that had prices capped below the $8 level.
Increased whale activity and the current projections for the ETH ecosystem favour UNI bulls.

The technical picture also supports an upside continuation. In this case, the RSI and MACD indicators on the daily chart suggest bulls are in control.
If this outlook holds, UNI price could eye the key resistance levels at $12.96 and $15.40. An important short term target lies at $2

This Week in Coins: Ethereum ETFs Get the Green Light, Dogecoin Jumps on Elon Musk Tweet - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIt’s been a wild week for crypto, with what many see as a complete 180-degree turn from the Securities and Exchange Commission when the regulator on Thursday approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC said yes to the likes of Grayscale, VanEck, Fidelity, and BlackRock after industry observers said for months that the products would not get approved.Despite the funds now making their way to the market, the price of the coin didn't move much on the news. It still had a great week since rumors of incoming approvals dropped on Monday: ETH is now trading for $3,747, a more than 20% seven-day jump.The ETFs won't be available until applicants sort their S-1 forms out with the SEC. But the approval is a big win for the space. Soon, traditional investors will be able to buy shares that track the price of the second-biggest digital asset—and if the eventual launch of the products is anything like the Bitcoin ETF one, capital will flood the space.Bitcoin rode off the back of the ETH approval rumors on Monday and passed the $70,000 mark for the first time in more than a month.The price of the biggest digital asset has since dipped and is now at $68,757 per coin, per data from CoinGecko, a 2.8% increase over the week.Other coins and tokens have risen over the past week, with Chainlink, Avalanche, and Bitcoin Cash making gains of 4.8%, 3.1%, and 3% respectively.But Dogecoin is the best-performer out of the top assets, having jumped by 7% in one week.It's now priced at $0.1656 after Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted a picture on Twitter expressing his condolences for Kabosu, the Shiba Inu behind the Doge meme, who died Friday.Dogecoin, the original meme coin, was created as a joke by developers wanting to poke fun at the seriousness of Bitcoin. But it gained near-mainstream traction in 2021 when Elon Musk—currently the third richest person on the planet—started pumping the coin on Twitter, the platform he now owns.Its market cap has since grown and it's the ninth biggest cryptocurrency as a result.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.

Farewell, Doge: Kabosu, the Shiba Inu Behind the Iconic Meme, Dies at 18


																Kabosu, the Shiba Inu who became a global internet sensation as the face of the “Doge” meme, passed away on May 24 at the age of 18, her owner, Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato, confirmed on Instagram.
The beloved dog, known for her iconic expression and the humorous captions that accompanied her photos, captured the hearts of millions worldwide and became a symbol of the whimsical and endearing nature of internet culture. “Kabosu is at rest now,” Sato wrote in a heartfelt blog post.
Confirming the news, Dogecoin’s official X handle tweeted,
“Today Kabosu, our community’s shared friend and inspiration, peacefully passed in the arms of her person. The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable. She was a being who knew only happiness and limitless love.
Please keep her spirit and her family in your heart, and most importantly carry her with you as your story continues – we are all fortunate for hers to have touched and shaped ours.”
In 2008, Sato adopted Kabosu, naming her after the citrus fruit “kabosu” because she thought the dog had a round face resembling the fruit.
The viral meme of Kabosu led to the creation of Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2013, which began as a joke currency and is currently the world’s largest meme coin by market cap.




DOGE’s success opened the floodgates for the creation of numerous other dog-themed tokens, including Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI), which have since gained tremendous traction in the cryptocurrency industry.
In late December 2022, Kabosu was reported to be seriously ill with leukemia, though Sato later mentioned that her health had improved soon after the diagnosis.

Uniswap Shoots Past $10 On 17% Price Explosion - Here's The Trigger


																In a week marked by consolidation across the cryptocurrency market, the native token of Uniswap, UNI, has defied the trend, surging over 15%, and surpassing the $10 mark. This bullish run comes amid positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem and Uniswap’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

	Related Reading


Riding The Ethereum Wave
Beyond the legal battle, the current momentum within the Ethereum ecosystem is also propelling UNI’s price upwards. On-chain data reveals significant whale withdrawals from crypto exchanges following news of a potential spot Ethereum ETF.

This flight to safety, coupled with the overall bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, is creating a ripple effect that benefits UNI, a key player within the Ethereum DeFi landscape.
From a technical standpoint, UNI’s breakout from a monthly consolidation phase paints a promising picture. Both technical indicators and on-chain data suggest a potential 25% price increase for UNI.
Source: Lookonchain
The token’s recent surge indicates a potential bull run, with analysts eyeing a price target of $12.80 if the current momentum continues.
Adding fuel to the fire is Santiment’s Age Consumed index, which measures the movement of dormant tokens. Spikes in this index often precede price rallies, and the latest uptick by the latter part of April seems to have foreshadowed UNI’s current uptrend.
This on-chain metric reinforces the bullish outlook for UNI, suggesting that investors are awakening to its potential.
Short Sellers Get Burned As Bulls Take Charge
The recent price rally has also been accompanied by a significant rise in trading activity. Data from Coinalyze reveals over $1 million in Uniswap liquidations in the last day.
The majority of these liquidations (over $750,000) were short positions, indicating that traders betting against UNI are feeling the heat. This surge in open interest, with more traders going long on UNI, further strengthens the bullish control over the token’s price.
UNI is currently trading at $10,8. Chart: TradingView
Uniswap Takes A Stand Against The SEC
This display of defiance has instilled confidence among investors, who view it as a positive sign for Uniswap’s future. The popular decentralized exchange (DEX) recently received a Wells notice from the regulatory body, alleging that UNI is a security. However, Uniswap has vowed to challenge this claim, asserting that the SEC’s case is weak.

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) to Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because WIZPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Wizard Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Wizard Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



Wizard Pepe launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Wizard Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Wizard Pepe by entering its contract address – AJM9tnhfGz9xezv1rTjspoTug3YVpcmrp3gJ9FMDEEYj – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WIZPEPE.

What is a Bitcoin Futures ETF? How Does it Work? List of 16 Top Bitcoin Futures ETF

Bitcoin Futures ETF allows investors to invest their money in leveraged Bitcoin instruments such as Futures and Options. Leverage provides them with a way to reap greater returns than the average investors. 
However, there are ample risks involved too. Risks such as capital risk, and regulatory risk pose a great challenge. Yet, with diligence, these ETFs prove a great investment.
This article explores Bitcoin Futures ETF and tries to explain their working, benefits and disadvantages. At the end, there is a list of 16 top Bitcoin Futures ETFs with a brief explanation on how they make money for their investors.
What are Bitcoin Futures?
Bitcoin Futures refers to the derivative contracts which trade with a certain amount of leverage. These contracts do not trade actual bitcoin but place a kind of bet on the future price of Bitcoin (hence the name). The bets are usually directional (bullish or bearish) and provide multifold return to the investor who has accurately predicted the price movement.
Usually a derivative contract is between two parties, one among whom assumes that the price will go higher and the other assumes the price would go lower. These parties remain anonymous to each other and meet via a crypto derivative exchange such as Binance, Coinbase or Derebit.
Futures trading has been beneficial for both institutional as well as retain traders. Institutions can take market positions (bearish or bullish) against a certain event (say elections) and protect their holdings from volatility. Whereas for retail users, it is a quick way to make a lot of money, although with a huge risk.
How Bitcoin Futures and Future ETFs Work?
Let us understand how future trading works with an example.
Suppose Bitcoin is at $60,000 and you run a Bitcoin ETF with 100k Bitcoins. Now imagine, if there is any negative news, for example, if the US Fed raises interest rates by 1%, it would definitely result in a market crash. But you won’t be able to sell all your 100k Bitcoins before the crash takes place, simply because of the fund size.
For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that Bitcoin would rise or fall just $1,000 in any case.
If you would have sold your Bitcoins at $60k, there is no surety that it would have fetched you the same price i.e.$60k, because selling such a large holding takes time. Plus, if you try to sell such a huge number of Bitcoins, it could have resulted in a market crash. Also, you would have been banned from trading in any crypto exchange.
Now here comes a person, who says that if Bitcoin falls from $60k to $59k, I will give you $1000 cash and if the reverse happens, say a rally from $60k to $61k, you will have to pay me $1000.
Now, think, why would someone enter into such an agreement with you. The reason is with Bitcoin futures, the person would have to pay a very small price($10 with a leverage of 100) as investment(margin) and gain $1000 if they are right. This contract is called a leveraged futures contract.
NOTE: Leverage is a form of trader where a person invests a small amount (margin), say $10 and is allowed to trade at a much bigger nominal value, say $100. The trader is liquidated (stopped) if their losses go above $10. This is how leverage works in its simplest form.
For more details on how leverage works, see the relevant section below.
If the institution/Bitcoin ETF fails (i.e., the market goes higher), they just lose $1000 and but their entire fund is still protected and also as price goes up by $1000, they make more gains. If they are right (market goes down) they still get $1000 from the individual trader.
On the trader’s side, they gain $1000 if the market goes up but lose $10 if the market goes down.
Why Are Bitcoin Future ETFs Popular?
Bitcoin ETFs provide a safe yet rewarding way for retailers to earn from Bitcoin derivatives.
Futures trading is greatly rewarding for individual retail traders, however, there is a catch. Retail traders often lack the sophisticated knowledge of trading strategies. For retail individual traders, this results in a loss most of the time they trade.
However, there is a better way for them to benefit. Traders and investors who want to benefit from Futures trading, but do not want to do it on their own, can take the benefit of Bitcoin Futures ETF.
Bitcoin Futures ETF are the shares of the companies that trade Bitcoin Futures with expert knowledge and years of experience. These traders have quantitative models, risk-reward ratio calculations and several times even insider knowledge that helps them secure a profit most of the times they trade. Even their losses are capped with the diligent usage of risk management strategies.



These ETFs charge a small amount of money to manage customer funds, often in the range of 0.1% to 2%.
There are several Bitcoin Futures all over the world and they have been present since October 2021.

Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and the first one to solve the double spending problem. Previously, all other cryptocurrencies could be just copied and pasted several times to create multiple yet identical copies. Bitcoin used a unique method called proof of work to make sure that a certain user could only spend their crypto once.
Futures
Futures and Options, together called derivatives, allows users to place intelligent bets on the future price of a certain asset, here Bitcoin. A future trade is composed of two traders who have different and opposing views on the price of Bitcoin at a future date, say 1 month ahead.
ETF
An Exchange Traded Fund or ETF is a share of a trust fund that trades solely in Bitcoin Futures. Whatever proceeds are obtained as a result, are shared between the subscribers of the ETF based on their percentage of ownership.
Margin
Margin is the minimum amount you have to put forward in order to trade a Future contract. For example, if you are trading a 10x Futures contract with a nominal value of $100, you would need a margin of $10.



Derivative
Futures and Options are collectively called as derivatives because they derive their value from a separate independent financial asset such as stocks, crypto or commodities. For this article, a financial asset refers to Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency.
Leverage
Leverage is the ratio of the nominal amount of your trade and the margin you put forward. In the above example of Margin, the leverage is 10x since it allows you to trade a contract that has a nominal value of 100 with a margin of $10.
Liquidation/Liquidated
Liquidation, in the scope of this article, is the act of terminating a futures contract because its losses have either exceeded the amount of margin put forward or simply because the exchange cannot settle this trade beyond a certain level. This acts as a safety mechanism and prevents a sell-off or shoot-off in a crypto’s price.
Advantages of Bitcoin Future ETFs
There are several advantages of investing in a Bitcoin Futures ETF.

Your funds are managed by seasoned experts.
The funds are easily invested and redeemed without any lock-in period.
Bitcoin futures ETFs allow investing with leverage which allows investors to reap multi-fold benefits.
ETFs are regulated by government bodies which ensure consumer protection.
The ETFs also benefit from Bitcoin fundamentals such as growing adoption and scarcity introduced due to Bitcoin halving.
Despite their high appeal, Futures Bitcoin ETFs barely hold just 12% of the market share among all Bitcoin ETFs. 

Market Share of Spot Bitcoin ETF vs Futures ETF
Disadvantages of Bitcoin Future ETFs

The risk factor is higher than spot Bitcoin ETFs due to the use of leverage trading in Bitcoin Futures.
The ETFs are not suited for all investor types, especially the risk averse investors.
A wrong time of entry would mean that you would lose a great portion of your invested money.
Crypto is still a sparsely regulated sector and there are serious regulatory risks with any investment.
Bitcoin’s price often reduced to one-fifth of its cycle high during the bear markets.

Cardano's price loss - Is it time to scoop more ADA? - AMBCrypto



Most ADA transactions ended in a loss, prompting speculation that the price might drop again
Price-DAA was below 0.50, indicating that it could be time to buy the token

Losing 5.42% of its value in the last 7 days is something that has allowed Cardano [ADA] to emerge as one of the market’s worst performers the top 20. Now, while the token might not be new to this tag, some market participants believe that it could be a good time to buy the token.
To lend further insight into this, AMBCrypto considered an in-depth on-chain analysis. At press time, ADA’s price was $0.45. Its latest bout of depreciation has affected its transactions in profit and loss on the Cardano network.
Cardano stops giving and keeps taking
According to Santiment, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions volume in profit to loss was 0.827 at press time. If this ratio is over 1, it means that there are more participants realizing gains than losses.
In this case, ADA’s trend would have been bullish. However, the reading above indicated that only 0.827 transactions ended in profits, when compared to every on-chain transaction that realized a loss.
Historically, this metric seems to correlate with the price. For instance, the ratio hit 0.722 in February. At the time, ADA’s price was $0.57. A few weeks later, the price jumped to $0.73 on the charts.

A similar scenario transpired on 13 April. At that time, the decline in the ratio triggered ADA’s bounce from $0.43 to $0.52. Considering its past performances, there is a chance Cardano might drop further.
If this is the case, the value of the cryptocurrency might drop to $0.42. However, there is a high chance that ADA might produce a 20% hike too, meaning a rise to $0.50 within a few days.
An entry level has appeared
Additionally, the price-DAA divergence is an indicator that can predict ADA’s valuation. DAA is an acronym for Daily Active Addresses, used to measure the overall level of network activity.
When combined with the price, the metric can identify potential exit and entry points. At press time, the price-DAA was -38.88%. From a trading perspective, a buy signal appears when the metric is less than 0.50.
On the other hand, a sell signal appears when the divergence is at 0.90 or above. Since the ratio was 0.388, it seemed to be a sign that it could be time to start Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) Cardano’s native token before the price pumps.

However, it is important to note that this metric alone cannot dictate where Cardano might be heading.
Assessing the same using the volume, on-chain data revealed that the metric hiked on the charts. This is an indication of more buying and selling. However, a look at the price action would suggest that there have been more sales than accumulation.

As long as this remains the case, ADA might face another decline as mentioned above. However, if the decline gets too intense, the token could rally back to its yearly peak.

China's Crypto Crackdown Failing? Billions in Illegal Transactions Exposed


							

Chinese authorities uncover billions in illicit crypto despite a nationwide ban.



Underground banks and illegal exchanges flourish as China’s crypto crackdown falters.



About $86 billion of crypto flowed into China in the 12 months through June 2023.




Recent developments in China suggest the continued use of cryptocurrencies despite an existing ban by the government. Multiple raids by the Chinese police uncovered the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit transactions totaling billions of dollars.



A Bloomberg report revealed that in May, the police in China discovered an underground bank linked to 13.8 billion yuan, or $1.9 billion worth, of illegal transfers. They uncovered a gang implicated in the unauthorized conversion of about 2 billion yuan, and multiple unlawful money exchanges involving transactions worth over 1 billion yuan.



The outcome of these discoveries suggests a significant presence of Chinese traders actively participating in the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, the police located the suspects around Beijing, the northeastern province of Jilin, and Chengdu City in the southwest, raising the possibility of a widespread practice across the entire country.



It is worth noting that it has been two years since the Chinese authorities imposed a ban on cryptocurrency transactions within the country’s borders. The government cited money laundering, currency outflows, and environmental harm from energy-intensive Bitcoin mining as the reasons behind its crypto ban.









However, there is a belief that Chinese citizens are still involved with digital assets. While many use it as an alternative investment amid falling property prices, others utilize crypto as a channel for circumventing overseas transfer limits.



In a statement, Chengyi Ong, APAC policy head at Chainalysis Inc., noted that a significant amount of crypto activity remains in China. According to Ong, this may be a result of the lack of strict enforcement of the ban. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the decentralized and peer-to-peer nature of crypto activities could be contributing factors.



As reported by Chainalysis, about $86 billion of crypto flowed into China in the 12 months through June 2023. The blockchain firm acknowledged the volume to be substantial, despite being significantly down from pre-ban levels.

This Ethereum Rival Could Skyrocket by Nearly 2x Over the Short to Medium-Term, Says Coin Bureau’s Guy Turner - The Daily Hodl


								The host of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel, Guy Turner, is expressing bullish sentiment on one Ethereum (ETH) competitor.
Turner tells the 2.47 million subscribers of the Coin Bureau channel that the layer-1 blockchain Fantom (FTM) possesses more upside potential based on technical analysis.










“The weekly chart appears to be painting a wonky head and shoulders pattern that looks eerily similar to the topping pattern FTM saw in late 2021. Notably, this pattern implies that there could be one more leg higher.”
Source: Coin Bureau/YouTube
According to Turner, Fantom could go up by approximately 98%, nearing double its current price.
“Zooming out on the weekly chart suggests that FTM could rally as high as $1.60 in the short to medium term where it will likely stall out due to resistance, also known as bag holders, from the previous bull market. After that, it’s anyone’s guess.”
Fantom is trading at $0.810 at time of writing.
On the reasons supporting his bullish thesis for Fantom, the Coin Bureau host says,
“FTM has some solid ‘pump-a-mentals,’ so to speak. It has a low price tag and a market cap that isn’t so large as to prohibit an epic pump. 
The fact that FTM’s supply has already vested to investors and the team suggests there will be minimal sell pressure from their side, particularly when you factor in the Fantom Foundation’s apparently enormous runway… 
The only thing that FTM is missing is a narrative that retail investors can understand. And more retail accessibility. Specifically, FTM is not currently listed on Coinbase though it’s possible this could change if regulations in the US change.”

US and Hong Kong Spot Crypto ETFs Diverge Post-SEC Approval


The recent development of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has significantly influenced the crypto investment environment.
Following the SEC’s preliminary approval for spot Ethereum ETFs, Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts continue to record positive inflows.
US Spot Crypto ETFs Surge Amid Renewed Optimism

SoSo Value data reveals that as of May 24, US spot Bitcoin ETFs had a total net inflow of $251.94 million. This marks ten consecutive days of inflows. On the same day, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) received inflows of $182 million and $44 million, respectively.
Meanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) received no flows on the same day. This is noteworthy considering the negative flow streak for US spot Bitcoin ETFs from late April until early May.

Indeed, the spot Ethereum ETFs have infused the crypto market with renewed optimism. BeInCrypto reported that Ethereum and some tokens in its ecosystem have shown impressive performance since Monday.
However, it is important to note that the spot Ethereum ETFs have yet to be officially launched, and SEC approval for the S-1 filings is awaiting. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, expects that the spot Ethereum ETFs will ” take a couple of weeks but could take longer” to trade in the market.

“Typically, this process takes months. Like up to 5 months in some examples, but Eric Balchunas and I think this will be at least somewhat accelerated. Bitcoin ETFs were at least 90 days. Will know more soon,” he explained.


Nonetheless, experts remain optimistic. Another ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, predicts that spot Ethereum ETFs could acquire “10% to 15% of the assets of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.”
Despite renewed interest in the US market, spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong saw a relatively muted performance. Data shows that from May 20 to May 23, Hong Kong’s spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded no flows for two consecutive days. Meanwhile, their Ethereum counterparts only recorded an inflow of 62.80 ETH on May 22.

However, a recent report mentioned that Hong Kong’s regulator is considering including staking for spot Ethereum ETFs. This is particularly interesting since potential issuers in the US have removed staking from their filings. By including staking rewards, Hong Kong’s spot Ethereum ETFs could provide a competitive edge, offering extra yield for investors.

Will Bitcoin Rise and Outshine Nvidia's AI Boom? Experts Weigh In


							

Nvidia stock soars, but doubtful of outpace Bitcoin for the next decade.



Crypto experts predict Bitcoin’s resurgence due to rising institutional interest.



Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals have set the stage for a Bitcoin bull run.




Cryptocurrency experts contend that despite NVIDIA stocks’ outperforming the Bitcoin the past decade, the feat is highly unlikely to repeat itself over the next decade. Swan CEO Cory Klippsten highlighted this in a recent X post, responding to data shared by Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.







Alden’s post illustrated that while Bitcoin’s market capitalization grew by 19,920% over the past decade, NVIDIA’s stock gained an impressive 24,840%, exceeding Bitcoin’s performance by roughly 5,000%.



TradingView’s data revealed that NVIDIA’s stock traded for less than $4 in 2014 and experienced gradual growth until 2020 before a breakout to the upside. This breakout coincided with a boom in the AI sector, leading to numerous innovations and the development of AI-related solutions.



Notably, after the 2020-’21 rally, NVIDIA’s stock price slumped in the 2022 bear market, only to rebound in Q4 of the same year. Since then, the chipmaker’s stock has surged by an impressive 905.58%. Its most notable performance occurred this month, following the release of sales and earnings figures that surpassed expectations.



Despite NVIDIA’s impressive run, analysts believe Bitcoin will surpass it in the coming years, with the flagship cryptocurrency entering a new phase that could witness an influx of institutional investors. The January approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC bolstered Bitcoin’s prospects for mainstream adoption and opened a new frontier for Bitcoin.









As anticipated, Bitcoin responded to this development by surging to a new all-time high. However, many users believe Bitcoin’s rally is only beginning and expect the fund’s influx to continue in the coming years. Analysts predict that Bitcoin’s price could reach $200,000 within the next two years, with the potential to climb even higher over the long term.



The contrasting trajectories of NVIDIA and Bitcoin highlight the intricate landscape of investment. While NVIDIA’s recent success is undeniable, Bitcoin’s potential to outpace it in the coming years, fueled by growing institutional interest and favorable regulatory shifts, underscores the allure of this evolving asset class. As both technologies continue to reshape their respective domains, investors are awaiting the next big-ticket for the next decade.

The History of Binance: A Multi Billion Dollar Crypto Empire

Despite all the legal and illegal blows that it got, no one can deny that Binance is still the largest crypto exchange in the world. Everyday millions of customers transfer billions of dollars of crypto despite all regulatory sanctions which makes us think there must be something unique about the exchange. 
In this article, we will take a look at the journey of the largest exchange that went from a nearly failed startup to the ruler of the crypto world. A company which has been through good, bad and everything in between, led by a humble and visionary leader.
So, let’s begin the journey.
Origins
Prior to founding Binance, Changpeng Zhao was an entrepreneur and a tech professional. He founded Fusion Systems in 2005 in Shanghai which built a high speed trading system for stock market brokers.
In 2013, he joined Blockchain.info as the third member of the crypto wallet’s team.
Zhao started Binance in 2017 after leaving OKCoin as its CTO. He founded the company in China. However, soon he had to move out of the country because of the Chinese ban on crypto.
Binance launched its ICO which helped it attract $15 million in coin sales. This gave birth to the BNB cryptocurrency. It was initially conceived as a cryptocurrency to pay trading fee on Binance. By mid-2024, BNB commanded over $87 billion.

The cryptocurrency now has an autoburn mechanism which helps greatly in price appreciation.
Expansion
By Jan 2018, Binance became the largest crypto exchange with over $1.3 billion in valuation.
Throughout the year, Binance opened three offices in Malta, Bermuda and Jersey.
In June 2018, Binance acquired Trust Wallet, which has been one of the most popular crypto wallets.
In May 2019, Binance revealed that it became a victim of a large-scale security breach and had lost over 7000 Bitcoins valued then at $6 million.

In September 2019, Binance launched BUSD in collaboration with Paxos, a well known developer of stablecoins. Within a few years, it rose to become the third largest stablecoin after USDT and USDC. At its peak, it commanded over $23.5 billion  in market cap (November 2022). However, it had to shut down the stablecoin as its issuer Paxos was ordered by New York authorities to shut minting in early 2023.
Mature Phase
In February 2020, Binance had a brief spat with the Malta Financial Services Authority(MFSA) over regulation. The authority issued a press release stating that despite being a Maltese company, Binance was not registered with MFSA and thereby was not under its regulatory oversight.
In October 2020, the Forbes Magazine did a story on Binance which claimed that Zhao and other Binance executives designed the corporate structure in a way that would profit from the country but would avoid compliance with US regulations.
By May 2021, there were unconfirmed reports that Binance was under legal scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service as well as by the US Department of Justice. However, it would take almost a year before US regulators finally charge Binance on paper.
In a Post-COVID World
Binance was perhaps the greatest benefactor of the COVID induced crypto bull run from 2020-2022. With lockdowns and travel restrictions all over the world, users had almost nothing to spend their money. A rising crypto trend in such times, prompted users to invest in crypto. Investments from all over the world made crypto rally faster than ever.
By the end of  2023, Binance had dominated at least 50% of the crypto market in terms of trading volumes.
Growth of Binance in 2022. Shown in Light Green
This alerted several regulators all over the world and around the same time, we saw the initial troubles of the exchange.
Controversial Stand on Russia Ukraine War
The troubles of Binance might have taken concrete shape in 2022 when after a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Binance decided not to ban Russian users from its platform. In doing so, it might have irked US authorities. However, later Binance softened their approach and donated $10 million in support of Ukraine.
In 2024, the exchange pleaded guilty to having allowed billions of dollars to flow without restriction through its exchange. It also was found guilty of having  helped users bypass the US sanctions against Russia.
The Regulatory Troubles Begin
Binance vs US SEC
On June 05, 2023, the US SEC registered a case against Binance and its 13 companies that includes Binance.com, Binance.us, BAM trading services, and the group’s co-founder Changpeng Zhao. The charges include operating unregistered exchanges, unregistered broker, dealer and clearing services, misrepresenting trader controls over Binance.us and finally the offering and sale of unregistered securities.

Binance vs US Department of Justice
The case registered against Binance by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the company and its CEO of committing a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. As per the act, it was charged with transferring money without registration. The exchange was also charged with violating US Sanctions against Russia.
Binance agreed to pay the biggest fine ever paid in corporate history. The company settled the case by the US Department of Justice after paying the latter, a sum of $4.3 billion.

Further, Changpeng Zhao, co-founder of Binance had to agree to step down as the CEO and from the Board of the US arm. 
The prosecutors had also demanded a three year sentencing. However, Zhao only received a light four month sentence due to his cooperation, clean image and clear track record.
This was possible because of several reasons. Changpeng Zhao had been a very ethical entrepreneur in his past. When the US DOJ registered the case against Binance, he had Canadian citizenship and could have easily lived a life on the run. His wealth was enough for him to sustain any lifestyle. Still, he decided to cooperate with the US DOJ and even was present physically prior to sentencing.
Another factor that greatly helped in reducing the sentencing was the letters of support that poured in the court prior to his sentencing. Several well known corporate houses, industry professionals, friends and family had vouched for Zhao being a good and ethical person. Even Zhao himself penned a letter of apology to the court, asking for forgiveness.
All of these helped him not only to clarify his own image, but also secured him a less harsh prison sentence.
Binance vs Nigeria
The case of Binance was quite unique. It was summoned by the Nigerian SEC as well as multiple agencies under the government.
It was charged by the Nigerian government to work in the country without legal registrations, facilitate illicit transactions and also engage in tax evasion.
Between late February and early March 2024, the Nigerian authorities levied a $10 billion fine on Binance for involvement in money laundering. However, the notice was soon withdrawn and the government went into denial as claims of the government strong-arming Binance surfaced. The fine was later changed to $35 million by 30th March 2024.
Further, on multiple occasions, the Nigerian house of representatives had summoned Binance executives including its CEO Richard Teng. However, the CEO did not comply with any summons yet.
Binance vs French Authorities
Binance received regulatory clearance way back in 2022. The license allowed the company to provide digital asset services in France. However, by mid-2023, the Paris prosecutor’s office had charged the exchange with money laundering in the country.
Then Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had clarified that despite unannounced inspections, the exchange fully cooperated with the French authorities.

Later the case seems to have receded into oblivion with no further updates after June 2023.
Binance and Netherlands
In 2022, Dutch authorities put a fine on Binance for operating in the country without a proper license.
However, by June 2023, due to failure to secure the correct licenses, it had to exit the country. All its users were transferred to its rival Coinmerce.
Despite everything, the exchange had said during its exit that in the future, it would reintroduce its services in the country after obtaining proper licenses and documents.
Binance in India
Binance’s troubles were unique in India. Due to the presence of strong AML laws, and the focus on increasing compliance, the exchange was initially seen as a non-complying entity. However, that soon changed with Binance’s decision to comply.
Perhaps it was the only incident where both parties, the regulator and the company, mutually understood and agreed to each other’s needs without any collateral damage.
In India, there exists a powerful but less known regulator called the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). It was established to detect money laundering, financial crimes and also provide intelligence inputs to the government of India.
The FIU asked crypto exchanges operating in India, both native and international, to register with the regulator, share transactions data with it and also comply with Indian money laundering laws. However, due to a lack of response, the regulator decided to put a shadow ban on Binance.com on 27th December 2023. The URL of Binance.com was blocked for Indian users and its mobile apps were taken down from Apple and Google stores.
Binance quickly responded that it was ready to comply with Indian laws. Soon the negotiations began and by May 10, 2024, Binance finalized its initial registrations with India along with KuCoin. Within a few days, both the companies got approval and a nod to resume their operations in India. Binance also reportedly agreed to pay a $2 million fine.

Binance in the UAE
UAE is perhaps the few countries where Binance actually had ease to do business. The vision of the UAE government to make the country a crypto hub has greatly helped Binance and several other crypto businesses.  The country has been hosting several successful crypto events lately.
In June 2023, Binance received a VASP license which acted as a MVP license in Dubai and allowed Binance to establish operations. Later, on 18th April 2024, Binance received full operational license in Dubai.
The Illegality of the Legal Troubles
It’s well known that the troubles of all crypto-native companies would have been far less if countries had crypto regulations in place. Till date only a few countries have crossed the policy stage.
When the US charged Binance, it did not even have a draft policy for crypto, let alone having a concrete set of regulations. The SEC had repeatedly tried to impose its authority to regulate crypto even when it had lost a case against Ripple. That case also made it clear that any retail sales of XRP never amounted to their classification as securities.
Similarly, the prosecution of Binance under the Nigerian laws never took any concrete stand because crypto as a whole was for tax evasion, money laundering and several other crimes. Such services were provided by several other companies including those native to the country.
Countries at Various Stages of Crypto Legislation/Regulation, Source IMF
Data by WEF shows that even as late as Jan 2024, most countries are still unable to regulate crypto in its entirety. Only a few economies such as the EU, UAE, Switzerland and Japan seem to have comprehensive regulations.
Choosing a Way Forward
Battling with authorities had always proven fatal even if someone was right. The Ripple vs SEC case dragged on for years and despite a win by Ripple (in relation to the retail sales), it had to spend a huge sum, estimated at $1.3 billion, on just legal fees. Yet, the case is far from being a complete resolution.

It won’t be an overstatement to assume that Binance decided to skip all those legal headaches and went directly into resolution. Not only was it an apt decision with respect to cost, but also it helped Binance skip all the negative media attention. Further, compliance also strengthened its position in the eye of the regulators and lawmakers.

Bitcoin Whales Buy $1.34 Billion In BTC In One Day - Is Return To $70,000 Imminent? | Bitcoinist.com


								Following rumors of a potential Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, the Bitcoin price made a run at its current all-time high of $73,737. While the momentum was not sufficient to push the premier cryptocurrency to a new record price, BTC still managed to cross the $70,000 level for the first time in over a month.
Bitcoin’s price soon experienced a correction and currently sits below $70,000 despite the SEC’s eventual approval of the ETH ETF. However, the latest on-chain revelation suggests that the BTC price might resume its upward movement sooner rather than later.
Can Whale Activity Drive BTC’s Price Recovery?
In a recent post on the X platform, popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez shared that there has been significant buying activity amongst a certain class of large investors in recent days. This on-chain revelation is based on Santiment’s Balance of Whales, which tracks the total number of coins owned by whales holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC.

According to data from Santiment, this class of large Bitcoin holders have bought more than 20,000 BTC (equivalent to a massive $1.34 billion) in the past day. This recent acquisition brings the balance of this class of whales to a whopping total of 4.96 million BTC.

The timing of this purchase is interesting, considering its occurrence after the Bitcoin price dropped back to $67,000. Notably, Martinez said in his post that these whales are “buying the dip,” a term used to describe purchasing activity after an asset experiences a fall in price. 
What’s more, this recent purchase by the whales might be a signal that the large holders and big players might know something about the BTC future price trajectory. As such, investors might want to keep an eye out for further movements, as they can lead to speculations and potential market shifts.
Moreover, whales are often perceived as key players in the crypto market, as their buying and selling activities can impact the price of digital assets. Considering its magnitude, the recent purchase might be a bullish proponent for the price of the premier cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin Price At A Glance
As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands around $68,917, reflecting a mere 1% increase in the past day. On the weekly timeframe, though, the premier cryptocurrency holds a better position and is up by 3%.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionAs Bitcoin tumbles following the SEC’s approval of ether ETFs, market analysts are closely monitoring the next key levels. Bitcoin’s price prediction indicates a potential bullish trend, with BTC/USD currently trading at $69,042.This update explores the pivotal support and resistance levels, providing insights into the future movements of Bitcoin amidst the shifting regulatory landscape.SEC Approves Rule Change for Ether ETFs
The SEC has approved a rule change to allow the creation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in ether, one of the largest cryptocurrencies. This decision follows the recent success of bitcoin ETFs, which have seen net inflows surpassing $12 billion. The approval comes just in time, aligning with the SEC’s deadline for the VanEck Ethereum ETF decision.Companies that sponsor bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRock, Bitwise, and Galaxy Digital, are also starting the process to launch ether ETFs. However, the SEC’s rule change does not guarantee immediate launches, as it only approves the applications from exchanges to list eight different ether funds. The actual launch dates remain uncertain.Key Points:
Ether prices rose 2% following the SEC’s decision, after a 20% surge earlier in the week.
The SEC’s order approves the listing of eight ether funds but does not set launch dates.
Initial ether ETFs are expected to be smaller than bitcoin ETFs, with the Grayscale Ethereum Trust holding about $11 billion in assets.
The approval suggests a potential easing of the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies, particularly following the agency’s loss in a lawsuit against Grayscale in 2023. This legal outcome paved the way for the approval of bitcoin ETFs and now ether ETFs. Despite this progress, the SEC’s regulatory approach to crypto remains under political scrutiny.Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, underpins the Ethereum network, which facilitates decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), and asset tokenization. However, the new ether ETFs in the U.S. may exclude staking, as the SEC views staking-as-a-service offerings as unregistered securities. This exclusion could reduce the attractiveness of ether ETFs compared to bitcoin ETFs.Richard Kerr from K&L Gates highlighted that the approval does not apply to other crypto projects on the Ethereum network. Steven Lubka from Swan Bitcoin pointed out that ether ETFs might experience lower demand due to structural differences, such as the lack of staking options.The approval of ether ETFs marks a notable development in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, signifying the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial products.

Starknet Token Activity Dives as 3AC Liquidator Makes Major Binance Transfer


							

Three Arrows Capital liquidator Teneo transfers $2.63 million in STRK to Binance, retaining a significant $157 million worth.



Teneo emerges as a major player in the Starknet (STRK) token ecosystem, holding the second-largest non-team/CEX wallet.



STRK Price Up, Trading Volume Down: What’s Next for Starknet?




Hedge Fund Three Arrows Capital’s liquidator, Teneo, has reportedly transferred 2.18 million STRK tokens, valued at approximately $2.63 million, to Binance over the past three days. According to an X post by the blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain, Teneo currently retains 130 million STRK, estimated to be worth $157 million.







Chinese crypto reporter Colin Wu offered further insights into Teneo’s strategic maneuver with STRK tokens. Notably, Teneo, holding a substantial portion of 3AC’s STRK tokens, has emerged as the second-largest non-team/CEX STRK-holding wallet.







As of the latest data, the Starknet token (STRK) is trading at $1.23, reflecting a slight decrease of 2.27% over the past 24 hours. However, the token has demonstrated positive momentum over the past week and month, surging by 6.10% and 3.88%, respectively.



The token currently holds the 68th position on CoinMarketCap, boasting a market capitalization of $1,408,958,143. A significant decline of nearly 50% in its 24-hour trading volume, currently at $157,940,550, suggests decreased activity within the ecosystem.



According to a previous report released in February 2024, an address identified as “Teneo: 3AC Liquidation” holds more than $602 million in crypto assets. The report revealed that the wallet was dominated by a vast collection of 75 million WLD tokens, valued at $567 million, constituting 94% of the total assets.









Other assets in the Teneo wallet included 8.437 million DYDX, valued at around $26.91 million, 160,000 AXS, worth more than $1.3 million, and 5.75 million USDC. The report also noted that 3AC creditors are among the largest holders of Worldcoin tokens (WLD).



Moving STRK tokens to Binance piques curiosity upon Teneo’s intentions. It could be a step to liquidate the tokens to pay off creditors or it could be a strategy, in part, to maximize the value of the remaining assets.

Suspicious Transaction Ahead of Elon Musk's Dogecoin Tweet! He Bought the Other Memecoin He Mentioned, How Did He Know? - Bitcoin Sistemi


There has been an interesting development in the cryptocurrency market, this time involving Elon Musk.
A cryptocurrency user created a new wallet about 1 day ago and withdrew 661 SOL worth 116 thousand dollars to this wallet via Binance. Immediately afterwards, he used all of these to buy 1.94 million memecoins called HARAMBE.


This wallet has currently made a profit of approximately 18 thousand dollars.

Although the amount of profit generated is low, it is noteworthy that this large purchase took place very shortly before Elon Musk tweeted about HARAMBE.





As it is known, Dogecoin's mascot dog Kabosu passed away at the age of 18. After this incident, Elon Musk published a message and said that Harambe, a famous gorilla who had previously passed away, and Kabosu went to heaven.
Following the development, the price of memecoin named HARAMBE increased by approximately 30%.

Bitcoin whales show ‘strong buying force’ signaling bullish bias


    Bitcoin (BTC) is currently experiencing renewed momentum, with notable buying activity from Bitcoin whales signaling a resurgence of bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. 



Despite a minor 3% retreat over the past week, these major investors have shown a strong buying force, reflecting their confidence in Bitcoin’s future prospects.



Whales, defined as entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC and excluding those owned by mining companies and exchanges, play a crucial role in the dynamics of cryptocurrencies.







Following a period of relative inactivity, these significant players have once again started to increase their Bitcoin stakes significantly. 



As of May 22, there has been a 5.5% increase in their holdings, marking a notable contrast to the more cautious 4.2% growth observed in April. 



This shift underscores a change in strategy among whales, influenced by their perception of favorable current prices for purchasing and accumulating Bitcoin, as highlighted by market intelligence firm CryptoQuant.



Market reactions and analysts insights



The behavior of whales often serves as a bellwether for broader market trends. Crypto analyst Axel Adler used on-chain data to shed light on the momentum building within the Bitcoin market. 



His analysis, shared on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out that the price gradient oscillator, which measures how quickly the market cap grows compared to the realized cap, is approaching a critical level.



Realized cap considers the total value of all whale-held coins based on their purchase time rather than the current market value.

Surpassing a value of 3.0 with this oscillator could indicate a sustainable bullish trend, steering clear of the downturns witnessed in the 2021 cycle.



CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju emphasized the significant rise in the 30-day percentage change in whale address holdings and the overall BTC balance held by whales.



According to him, during a sharp market dip in early May, whales acquired an additional 47,000 BTC, demonstrating their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value.

The exchange whale ratio, which tracks large Bitcoin holders’ activity, increased in April and May, suggesting heightened activity from these major investors. This is unusual, as typically, whale activity decreases during sustained bullish market periods.



Analyst Willy Woo observed that over the past two months, there was significant buying of Bitcoin even though its price didn’t show a clear upward trend.



Even though this caused some panic among individual investors, the demand for Bitcoin at its current market price remained strong.



Bitcoin price analysis



The market’s response to these developments has been overwhelmingly positive, with Bitcoin prices rebounding to $69,300—an increase of about 3% over the past week. The total realized cap of the Bitcoin network has reached a record high, reflecting robust market fundamentals.



However, despite this optimism, analysts like James Check from Glassnode caution that the market has not yet entered the euphoria phase typical of bull runs, suggesting there is still room for substantial growth.

The increased activity and aggressive buying patterns of Bitcoin whales are critical indicators of broader market trends.



Their continued accumulation of Bitcoin suggests a bullish outlook for the future of cryptocurrency, potentially paving the way for new market highs.

Bitcoin Is Currently out of the ‘Danger Zone,’ According to Crypto Analyst - But There’s a Catch - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) is no longer in the “danger zone,” when there is a likelihood of a dip below its range low.
Pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital tells his 472,200 followers on the social media platform X that while the “danger zone” has passed, Bitcoin could still dip about 13% from its current value.










Based on past cycles, Bitcoin enters the “danger zone” after a halving event, when miners’ rewards are halved, and declines significantly, according to the analyst. After the “danger zone,” Bitcoin historically enters a “post-halving reaccumulation” phase when it trades sideways within a range.
“Since the Bitcoin post-halving ‘danger zone’ ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71,500. However, ~$71,500 is where the range high resistance of the macro re-accumulation range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from. The consolidation continues and history suggests it will continue for several more weeks between $60,000 and $70,000.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
The analyst also says that based on historical precedence, Bitcoin may not break out of the range high of $70,000 until September.
“Historically, Bitcoin has always rejected from the range high on the first attempt at a breakout after the halving. Moreover, history suggests this re-accumulation should last much longer. Bitcoin tends to break out from these re-accumulation ranges only up to 160 days after the halving. That would translate to a Bitcoin breakout from the re-accumulation range only in September 2024.”

Bitcoin is trading for $69,012 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

3 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading this week


    Finbold identified three cryptocurrencies that speculators should avoid trading due to the upcoming substantial token unlocks. These unlocks have the potential to flood the market, leading to increased selling pressure and significant price fluctuations.



Experienced cryptocurrency market participants closely monitor factors like token supply and demand to optimize their trading strategies and mitigate potential losses. By taking these dynamics into account, they can make well-informed decisions that maximize profitability while effectively managing associated risks.



In particular, data from TokenUnlocksApp shows $373.11 million in potential sell-offs for the next seven days from May 25. The top 3 highest unlocks will happen on May 31 and June 1, releasing $219.67 million worth of tokens.

Avoid trading Optimism (OP)



First, investors should avoid trading Optimism (OP), the popular second layer for Ethereum (ETH), amid a potential sell-off incoming. On May 31, the protocol will unlock 31.34 million OP tokens currently worth $80.23 million.



Optimism’s unlock represents a nearly 3% supply inflation that repeats every month with slight variations, as previously reported by Finbold. Core contributors to the protocol will receive 16.54 million OP worth $42.35 million, while private investors will get $37.89 million to realize their monthly profits over retail buyers.

dYdX Protocol (DYDX)



The decentralized exchange protocol DYDX is again featured among cryptocurrencies to avoid trading due to its unlocks. Finbold reported a similar warning for April 27 and, previously, for March 31, with 33.34 million tokens unlocked – worth $70.33 million and $117.33 million, respectively.



On February 29, we also reported the unlock of the same amount, worth $130 million. The gradual loss of purchasing power evidence the nefarious effects of supply inflation on cryptocurrencies and the “avoid trading” alert.



Now, the protocol will put the same amount of DYDX in circulation on June 1, currently worth $70 million. This represents a nearly 12% monthly inflation likely to affect DYDX investors. As of this writing, the token trades at $2.10.

Sui Network (SUI)



Another cryptocurrency to avoid trading due to recurrent monthly token unlocks is Sui Network (SUI). The competing layer-1 blockchain developed by former Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) engineers will inflate its supply by 2.8% this month.



On June 1, the protocol will unlock 65.08 million SUI for private investors, the development team, and the Mysten Labs treasury. Notably, private investors will receive 39.16 million SUI for over 60% of the total $70 million worth of unlocks.

However, crypto traders will try to speculate on the economic effects these unlocks may have on price, which could bring increased volatility and worsen the potential risk-reward ratio. The market is uncertain and influenced by multiple factors, requiring proper risk management and learning when to avoid trading specific cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin attack mode: BTC set for $150k after post-halving consolidation


    After weeks of appearing to consolidate, Bitcoin (BTC) aims to establish its price above the crucial resistance level of $70,000.



Indeed, if the crypto manages to sustain the current bullish momentum, the market anticipates that it will rally to a new record high, possibly above $100,000.



Consequently, crypto trading expert TradingShot noted in a TradingView post on May 23 that Bitcoin is forecasted to enter a new rally phase following a period of consolidation post-halving. This development aligns with historical patterns in previous Bitcoin cycles, signaling a potential surge towards $150,000. 







For instance, TradingShot noted the consistent occurrence of a two-month consolidation phase before and after the halving event, a pattern observed in past Bitcoin cycles. This consolidation phase typically precedes a significant rally in Bitcoin’s price.

Moreover, the expert also reviewed the impact of technical indicators such as the Mayer Multiple Band (MMB) and the Bollinger Bands Width (BBW). TradingShot suggested that trading above the MMB of 1 Standard Deviation (SD) indicates a bullish trend, particularly after the BBW bottoms out.  A surge has historically followed this pattern in Bitcoin’s price towards the MMB 3SD level. 



Bitcoin’s next price target 



The Vortex Indicator (VI) and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) in the two-month time frame also highlight the symmetry in Bitcoin’s cycles. TradingShot’s analysis indicated that VI tops coincide with CCI’s first higher low after a bottom, suggesting a predictable pattern in Bitcoin’s price movements.




“As a result, we can expect the price to top by the week of March 17 2025 the earliest. <…> The most important part perhaps is that after each consolidation after the BBW bottom. Bitcoin’s immediate target was the MMB 3SD, which is the orange trend-line. That is currently at $125k but by the time the rally reaches it, it could be closer to $150k,” the analyst said. 




It’s worth noting that Bitcoin has exhibited bullish sentiments in the short term, with the crypto hitting the $71,000 mark on May 21. The rally coincided with a significant surge in spot buying and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) purchasing.



As things stand, the market seems to be on edge regarding the implications of the current price movement. Some believe the recent bull run has peaked, while others suggest that a new bull run consistent with the Bitcoin post-halving price movement has begun. 



Bitcoin price analysis



By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $69,103 with daily gains of almost 2.5%. On the weekly chart, BTC is up 2.67%.



Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold



Elsewhere, Bitcoin’s technical analysis is dominated by bullish sentiments. According to data retrieved from TradingView, a summary of Bitcoin’s one-day gauges indicates a ‘buy’ at 15, while moving averages are at ‘strong buy’ at 14. Oscillators, on the other hand, are ‘neutral’ at 9.

Overall, most of the market anticipates that Bitcoin will sustain its current momentum, but a continuation of the rally significantly hinges on breaching the $70,000 resistance zone.

How Sportsbetting Giants Are Embracing Cryptocurrency: Let's Examine HugeWin



                    

Recently, the sports betting scene has shifted quite a bit. The surge in cryptocurrency isn’t just a fleeting thing—it’s reshaping the iGaming industry and now making its mark on sports betting. As more cryptocurrencies gain popularity, top sports betting platforms are catching on and embracing this innovative payment method.



The current gambling scene, in general, is starting to shift towards prioritizing player safety. With even such infrastructure like multi-factor authentication, advanced encryption systems, and more put in place to safeguard players’ assets. Cryptocurrency can accomplish just that. As the most widespread decentralized finance option, cryptocurrency is the most secure payment method out there.




Why Do Cryptocurrencies Land Themselves So Well To Betting?



Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology at large has been disruptive to a variety of industries across the free market. The next on its list is sports betting. The easy adoption of such technology can be summed up to a few main features of all crypto shares.




A Focus on Player DefensesSince cryptocurrencies are built on a decentralized, encoded mechanism like blockchain, they provide one of the safest and most secure methods of payment out there. Bettors especially like to prioritize privacy. Hence, crypto lends itself perfectly to the betting scene.



Lightning-quick TransactionsTraditional banking methods just do not cut it anymore. Especially in the field of betting, where a split-second decision can spell either glorious victory or tremendous defeat. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, enable instant transactions, making deposits and withdrawals swift and hassle-free.



Miniscule Transaction Fees & Universal AvailabilityAnother aspect in which traditional banking straight up loses to cryptocurrency. When it comes to transaction fees, cryptocurrencies have a major advantage over traditional methods—they’re significantly lower.

This means that even in regions with strict gambling regulations, bettors can still participate in sports betting activities hassle-free.

Polishing Up The Experience

Lightning speed transaction fees, lowest fees of any financial option, and unparalleled security – all of these features provided by cryptocurrencies make the sports betting experience on the website seamless and incredibly responsive.



While crypto adoption is a significant step in Hugewin’s safety, it’s not the only thing contributing to it. Hugewin boasts that it is legislated under the Curaçao eGaming license. Being a licensed sports betting service is a big achievement for any platform in the industry. On top of that, Hugewin’s unmatched 24/7 user support is helpful and instills a much-needed feeling of trustworthiness and safety, which is not often felt in the industry.

While improving user experience, Hugewin’s adoption of cryptocurrency also plays a role in attracting a new type of bettor to their platform. Hugewin is perfectly poised to reel in a newly emerging type of demographic – tech-savvy individuals from the mainstream.

Ether.Fi price breaks above key resistance, is $10 next? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Ether.Fi price rose 10% as altcoins looked to rebound, hitting highs of $5.35 amid latest upside momentum.
ETHFI could target $10 if bullish sentiment prevails.

Ether.Fi price rose 10% to reach highs of $5.35, a seven-week peak for the Ethereum liquid restaking platform’s native token ETHFI.
Importantly, Ether.Fi price at current levels sees it trade above a crucial support-turned resistance area.
With prices up 47% this past week, can bulls strengthen to push to $10? The last breakout above $5 saw ETHFI rally to its all-time high of $8.53 on March 27.
Ether.Fi introduces ether.fi Cash
On May 24, the Ether.Fi team announced the launch of ether.fi Cash, a mobile wallet and Visa credit card that allows users to save, spend or invest with their ether.fi assets.
Cash allows users to borrow or settle everyday transactions with USDC. Users can also pay off balances using their stake and liquid rewards.
“Cash is the third in our Trilogy of products — ether.fi Stake, ether.fi Liquid, and ether.fi Cash. Combined these integrated products help users save, invest and spend their crypto, making it so that users never have to offramp again,” the protocol noted in an announcement.
ETHFI price surges past $5
Data from CoinGecko shows that ETHFI price soared alongside major altcoins as Ethereum spiked earlier in the week. The ETH price reacted sharply to news of an impending spot ETF approval, reaching highs of $3,900.
The upside momentum also impacted ecosystem tokens, with ETHFI bouncing from lows of $3.23.

Although price faced an initial rejection at the horizontal resistance line, a retest of the area saw bulls break higher to hit $5.35 on May 23.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is at 66 to suggest the upper hand is with the buyers. Also, the MACD indicator is strengthening above the signal line to reflect an overall bullish outlook for ETHFI.
If bulls flip the key resistance zone into a robust support area, a surge to $6.14 could see them aim for the ATH.

Crypto Casino as a New Trend: Let's Examine on the Example of Hugewin



                    

Cryptocurrencies have been popular and in demand ever since the creation asset was created. However, community members recently experienced an unprecedented surge in demand for this technical innovation. The surge permeated various sectors, from finance to retail, but its impact is perhaps most pronounced in the iGaming industry.



A recent study by Grand View Research revealed that the worldwide online gambling market, which stood at $66.72 billion in 2020, is predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2021 through 2028. A key driver of this growth is the adoption of cryptocurrencies, which provide a fast, secure, and efficient means of transaction that appeals to modern gamers.




Additionally, findings from a CryptoGamblingNews survey indicated that over 60% of respondents prefer using cryptocurrencies for online gambling due to their quick transaction times and the anonymity they offer.



Why cryptocurrency is perfect for iGaming



The inherent features of cryptocurrency make it a suitable and successful pairing. Here’s why:




Comprehensive security measures. Since crypto utilizes blockchain technology, which is renowned worldwide for its secure but transparent way of storing data, the risks of fraud (which were quite common within the online casino industry of the past) are virtually zero.



Enhanced transaction speeds. Cryptocurrencies are transforming various industries due to their rapid transaction speeds surpassing traditional banking systems. This makes it an ideal fit for the iGaming industry, where fast, seamless transactions are crucial.



Global accessibility. Cryptocurrencies transcend geographical boundaries, making them accessible worldwide. Players from different countries can participate easily without the hassle of currency conversion or international banking restrictions.



Anonymity and privacy. Using cryptocurrencies allows players to maintain a higher level of anonymity since they don’t need to provide sensitive personal information. This privacy is especially appealing in the iGaming sector, where discretion is often valued.



Lower fees. Cryptocurrency transactions typically have lower fees than traditional banking methods. This cost-efficiency benefits players and gaming platforms, making it a more attractive option for financial transactions.



Enhanced credibility. The decentralized framework of cryptocurrencies, along with the permanent recordkeeping of blockchain transactions, fosters user trust. This allows players to confirm transactions and verify game fairness, which is essential for upholding integrity in the iGaming landscape, especially for a cryptogames casino and crypto slot games.




These features collectively make cryptocurrencies an ideal choice for the iGaming industry, providing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience for both players and operators.

Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of Bitrue Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KIMCRYPT will be listed on Bitrue, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kim Jong Crypto.



Currently, Kim Jong Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KIMCRYPT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kim Jong Crypto by entering its contract address – DY225ypZiG3aYkZnzaXJYDGtUz76uNuQiJLMzs6qGAZ5 – in the receiving field.




KIMCRYPT currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Ether Poised to Surge Past $5,000 as Key Indicators Flash Bullish Signals



                    

Ether (ETH) could potentially retest the $5,000 price mark it narrowly missed in 2021 if three long-term indicators continue their current trends, according to one crypto trader.



“The dominance chart suggests we’re entering an ‘ETH Season’ where Ethereum is likely to outperform other cryptocurrencies,” said pseudonymous crypto trader Blockchain Mane in an interview with Cointelegraph.




This optimism follows the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) initial approval of eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on May 23.



Data from TradingView reveals that ETH’s market dominance surged by 19.56% over the past week after reports suggested the SEC was shifting its stance on ETF approvals.



Blockchain Mane highlighted another key long-term indicator: the Fibonacci retracement. 




This indicator predicts potential price levels where Ether might rebound, based on mathematical patterns from the Fibonacci sequence.



According to Mane, ETH is showing “resistance targets at $5,080.60 and $6,231.83.” 



These levels are significantly higher than its all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021, as reported by CoinMarketCap.



At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $3,802.

The third indicator noted by Blockchain Mane is the parabolic curve, which identifies potential trend changes by placing dots above or below Ether’s price movements.



Mane observed that ETH is following a “bullish trend” along the curve, with three distinct phases: base one, base two, and base three.



“The parabolic curve indicates continued upward movement, especially after the falling wedge breakout,” Mane said.



Meanwhile, other crypto traders are focusing on shorter-term price actions amid the spot Ether ETF approvals.



“ETH is up more this week than the S&P 500 typically gives you in a year,” crypto commentator Benjamin Cowen said in a May 23 X post.



Crypto trader Matthew Hyland emphasized the importance of Ether holding support around $3,800 for continued momentum.



The price of Ether has remained relatively stable following the ETF approvals, likely because the news was already priced in and ETF trading has not yet begun.

Ethereum's Pectra Upgrade: Stakes Raised for Validators, Smart Contracts Get Smarter


							

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is expected by Q1 2025 amid complex feature integration.



EVM Object Format and EIP-7702 by Vitalik Buterin are included in Pectra.



The Pectra upgrade will raise the staking cap for Ethereum validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.




Ethereum core developers are targeting the launch of the Pectra upgrade by the end of the first quarter of 2025. This upgrade encompasses the EVM Object Format (EOF), a suite of approximately 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which will introduce an optional container for EVM code.



Notably, Pectra, the next phase of the Ethereum network upgrade after Dencun, was initially expected to go live later this year. However, the shift from the previously projected late 2024 timeline is attributed to the inclusion of the EOF.



The Pectra upgrade is poised to raise the staking cap for Ethereum validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, as proposed in EIP 7251. This 64-fold increase would benefit major staking services like Coinbase and Lido by allowing them to consolidate their validators.



This change would streamline operations by reducing the need to create new validators for every additional 32 ETH staked, thus saving resources and effort in the staking and validation processes.



Another notable feature of the Pectra upgrade is PeerDAS, a data availability sampling solution that leverages the existing peer-to-peer components within the Ethereum ecosystem. This is expected to enhance the network’s scalability and efficiency.









Moreover, Ethereum developers have agreed to replace the account abstraction proposal EIP-3074 with the newly introduced EIP-7702, authored by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 is designed to allow externally owned accounts (EOAs) to operate as smart contract wallets within a transaction, potentially enhancing flexibility and security for users.



Following the Dencun update, Pectra merges the “Prague” and “Electra” upgrades for execution and consensus layers, respectively. While the final details of the upgrade are still being debated, there is a possibility of deferring certain features, such as the Verkle tree implementation, to a later hard fork, namely the Osaka hard fork.

With the broader digital currency ecosystem tilting toward tokenization, Ripple CTO David Schwartz has hinted at some of the important benefits of this technological advancement.Benefits of tokenizationThe concept of tokenization has been flying around, however, only a few understand or know what it really means. Taking to the Ripple Labs’ new X series of explaining a blockchain concept in 60 seconds, the Ripple CTO used real estate to explain the tokenization concept.He said, with a lot of paperwork involved in buying an asset, it becomes fairly difficult to prove ownership of such properties. He believes tokenization eliminates this challenge by solidifying the process of asset transfer and ownership. He said, with distributed ledger technologies, real estate sales recording, payment for properties and taking away all fraud factors becomes possible. He went on to point out how this ledger simplifies the process of borrowing against an asset. With tokenization, the person’s collateral can be registered on-chain and the lender can easily verify the ownership of the collateral. Depending on the key designs of the tokenization features, the lender may also gain insight that will show whether or not the person is borrowing from a number of lenders at the same time.Many financial giants are already trialing tokenization features, with BlackRock also joining the trend. Protocols like Chainlink are specifically helping to fuel this tokenization agenda with its CCIP solution among others.Ripple Labs positioningWhile Ripple Labs has not categorically stated the road map in its own tokenization agenda, the firm has immediate plans to launch a stablecoin later this summer. In its latest push, Ripple Labs has filed a trademark for its stablecoin, showing it hopes to use the ticker symbol "RLUSD."The stablecoin ecosystem is growing, and Ripple is optimistic to tap into the market in a dominant way.

Ethereum to Launch Next Network Upgrade in Q1 2025


Ethereum core developers are gearing up for the highly anticipated “Pectra” upgrade, set to launch by the end of the first quarter of 2025. 
This significant update will introduce the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), incorporating approximately 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). EOF aims to enhance the EVM code through an opt-in container system, marking a pivotal development in Ethereum’s evolution.

Ethereum’s Next Big Upgrade Coming Q1 2025
One of the standout features of the Pectra upgrade is PeerDAS, a data availability sampling solution. PeerDAS leverages existing peer-to-peer components within Ethereum to ensure efficient data distribution and availability. This innovation aims to bolster the network’s resilience and performance, addressing current scalability challenges.
Interestingly, developers will replace the account abstraction EIP-3074 with a more advanced proposal, EIP-7702, introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 allows Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to function as smart contract wallets during transactions. Subsequently streamlining the user experience and enhancing security.

“This EIP is designed to be very forward-compatible with endgame account abstraction, without over-enshrining any fine-grained details of ERC-4337 or RIP-7560,” the proposal stated.

Pectra’s architecture includes two critical components. First, the Prague upgrade on the Execution Layer, and second, the Electra upgrade on the Consensus Layer. These updates collectively aim to optimize transaction processing and network consensus mechanisms, ensuring a more robust and efficient blockchain.

Howey Test Ignored by SEC, Alleges Coinbase


Coinbase leveraged current political movements in the US Congress to bolster its interlocutory appeal against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In a May 24 court filing, Coinbase argued that the SEC tried to “side-step” the Howey test, which is a legal framework used to determine assets that qualify as securities. Over the years, the crypto industry and the SEC have battled over applying this standard to digital assets.
Coinbase Accuses SEC of Ignoring Howey Test

Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, explained the exchange’s position. According to him, the core question was whether the SEC can regulate cryptocurrency transactions as “investment contracts” when no contractual obligations exist. 
Grewal noted the SEC’s inconsistency and highlighted its similar appeal in the Ripple case. He stressed the importance of this unresolved legal issue for the crypto industry. The executive also contended that the SEC has an extensive history of being uncooperative with industry leaders.

“From the beginning, we came to the SEC with good-faith efforts to have a conversation about a workable and balanced regulatory framework for crypto innovation within the US. Instead, we – like much of the industry – have been met with slammed doors, changing positions, and litigation,” Grewal said.

Remarkably, Coinbase also pointed out recent legislative developments that could impact the SEC’s jurisdiction on the emerging industry. During the past week, the US House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which could shift more regulatory power to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 
This bill, staunchly opposed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, aims to oversee the crypto markets and enjoys strong support from industry stakeholders.

“Legislators’ disagreement with the SEC’s position meanwhile has deepened: just this week, the U.S. House of Representatives approved on a bipartisan basis comprehensive digital asset legislation that would deny the SEC the expansive jurisdiction it claims,” Coinbase wrote.

Grewal highlighted this development as a positive shift in the political landscape and a step toward better regulatory oversight. He also reiterated Coinbase’s commitment to obtaining clarity for the industry and resisting overreach by regulators.

“Earlier this week, the House recognized the need for clear rules, and we’re seeking clarity in the Courts as well. But regardless of the timeline, we’re committed to seeing this through â€“ no matter how long it takes to get clarity for the entire industry and push back against overzealous regulators. It’s what the 52 million Americans who own crypto deserve,” Grewal remarked.

ETH vs. ADA: Is Cardano or Ethereum a Better Investment in 2024?


																Markets got a big spike in Ethereum price this week on crypto exchanges. What’s behind it and what factors can investors take into consideration to determine whether Ether or its friend Cardano is the better buy?
Ethereum has a birthday coming up on July 30. It was launched in 2015 to create a “world computer” with the same Web3 blockchain properties as Bitcoin has for storing cash and making payments.
Cardano was launched on September 23, 2017 by initial coin offering (ICO) and founded by an Ethereum co-founder, Charles Hoskinson. Today it’s the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
Ethereum Market Cap (May 22): $451.8 billion
Cardano Market Cap (May 22): $17.2 billion
Certain differences between the two cryptocurrencies are an advantage for one or the other and a good reason to be bullish or bearish for ETH or ADA tokens.




But some of the two networks’ differences are tradeoffs that are more complex to evaluate as yielding an advantage for either crypto. Here are 7 key factors at play in the future Ethereum price against Cardano:
1. ETH vs. ADA – Technical Analysis (a tie)
Ethereum price is nearly all the way back to its ATH (all time high) after spiking this week on Ethereum spot ETF buzz. Cardano has a long way to go. That might actually be more bullish for ADA, with more upside left in its price.
The recent Ethereum ETF approval will shake up the entire meta for investing in Ether. If bulls take the price past $4,000, another 12.5% increase would pump ETH to $4,500— within striking range of the previous Ethereum ATH of $4,721 in Nov. 2021.
Forbes recently mentioned an Ethereum price prediction of $5,000 by the end of 2024. Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck predicts $11,800 by 2030. An even more bullish outlook forecasts $10,000 ETH by the end of the year.
Over the short term, Cardano technical indicators and moving averages over the weekly span recommended “Sell” on Thursday. Meanwhile, Ethereum technical indicators for the seven-day span recommended “Strong Buy,” according to data from Investing.com.
2. Ether Spot ETF – Regulatory Analysis (bullish ETH)
There’s no denying it. Charles Hoskinson would certainly agree: U.S. regulators seem to favor Bitcoin and Ethereum over Cardano and other DeFi networks.
The SEC said okay to Ethereum futures ETFs in October, revealing it didn’t seem to think of Ether as an unregistered security. However, the U.S. regulator has classified Cardano and other cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities in lawsuits against multiple blockchain companies, while ignoring Bitcoin and Ether.
As Fortune Magazine reported on May 1, “Furthermore, despite launching a number of lawsuits against crypto companies since April 2023, the agency has never named Ether to be a security in its complaints.”
The SEC lawsuit against Ripple has taken years (since Dec. 2020) and still has not yet been resolved. It is costly and leaves the future unsure for the currencies under the government’s crosshairs.
Markets abhor uncertainty.
It may not be fair, but it’s a bullish factor for ETH and bearish for ADA.
3. ADA vs. ETH – Fundamental Analysis (a wash)
Fundamental analysis is the preferred method of investors who are not total degenerates. Instead of chart technical analysis or meme currency voodoo economics, the fundamentalist looks at an investment prospect and asks what would “The Intelligent Investor” author Benjamin Graham do if he were here?
Graham says:
“The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists. In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”
If a business’s expected future revenues discounted to the present day exceed its current market value, then it may be a good investment. If they match or fall short of the business’s market cap, then it may be a poor investment.
ADA: $263.8 million TVL (3% annual reward rate + 121% annual growth rate) / Market Cap: $16.4 Billion
ETH $64.9 Billion TVL (5.5% annual reward rate + 145% annual growth rate) / Market Cap: $453 Billion
Going by the data above without any further context, it appears Cardano would be the winner, because its inflows make up a much smaller portion of its market cap than Ethereum (0.019 to 0.22), but only if we expect it to grow at the same rate as Ethereum in the future.
The lopsided institutional adoption between the two will make that difficult for Cardano unless it finds a use case, a feature/benefit, and a narrative that shakes up the retail Internet markets for cryptocurrency.
4. Cardano vs. Ethereum – Gas Fees (cat’s game)
There are lower and more predictable fees on Cardano, but higher fees on Ethereum are also a feature, not necessarily a bug. They make it more expensive to misuse the network for cybercrime that doesn’t pay, so it’s more secure. Big institutions like that.
That’s one reason why the industry leader, Bitcoin’s slow, expensive network, with a low transaction bandwidth holds its capital so well. In many ways these built-in costs qualify participants better than Know Your Customer policies and automatically and without discriminating on any basis other than ability and willingness to pay the network’s fees.
Still for newcomers, enterpreneurs, startups, and investors starting out with a smaller cash pile, smart contract blockchain networks with lower fees like Cardano have an advantage. Transaction fees on both networks are highly variable and spike during periods of high network use.
5. Ease Of Use – Cardano (another tie)
Some people in Web3 feel Ethereum has an ease-of-use problem. It’s become too overgrown with complicated, byzantine layers on top of layers, creating a steeper learning curve and potential security threats.
Blockchain advocate Daniel Cawrey wrote in a recent opinion article on Blockworks:
“Ethereum is becoming a multilayered lasagna-like system whereby complexity and fees are pushing people to the margins, causing interoperability and security concerns.”
While true, much like Ethereum’s higher transactions fees— the complexity of Ethereum may be a reason to be bullish for ETH. It could simply be proof of the network’s success. As Cawrey acknowledges in the piece, the network is beginning to achieve its “world computer” concept.
Any computer architecture expert would be hard-pressed to explain how a Turing-complete global computer that anyone can use on a peer-to-peer network would become anything but a flying spaghetti monster of complexity.
6. Ether vs. Cardano Whales (bullish ADA)
A massive 15,000 ETH whale deposit to Kraken on May 18 spotted by Whale Alert suggested a bear run on Ether by whales could be incoming, but after the SEC approved the spot Ethereum ETF a surge in whale-sized transactions has been net positive for the network, according to IntoTheBlock data.
Meanwhile, Cardano whales have been extremely bullish for ADA in May. They boosted holdings in Cardano tokens by 11% in a month. Whales tend to be smart money with some of the most advanced analytics and market outlooks to know what they’re doing, so that’s positively bullish for Cardano.
https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1790774801277042863
7. Ethereum vs. Cardano Memes (bullish ETH)
Meme coins are a definite advantage for Ethereum. While Cardano does have meme coins, none of them are notable and they have not topped the market cap charts like Ethereum’s SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI.
Cardano has succeeded in making a simpler, lower-fee Ethereum, but crypto markets tend to reward projects that leaven their technology with some meme karma. Maybe an Orange Pill Moon Boys NFT collection or something with a dog on it would do the trick.

'Severely undervalued,' says influencer on PEPE, but activity suggests otherwise


    In the vast and still experimental cryptocurrency market, influencers and enthusiasts often share insights into their favorite cryptocurrencies. Usually, they will hold these assets as personal investments—a normal behavior expected from someone enthusiastic about an asset.



However, influencers can use their influence to lure exit liquidity for tokens they hold but do not plan to keep in the long term. This is what recent on-chain and social activities suggest could have happened to a known meme coin trader.



Notably, Lookonchain spotted a possible divergence between words and on-chain activity from James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) on X on May 25.







Influencer James Wynn’s PEPE dilemma



As the on-chain analyst reported, Wynn recently deposited $7.54 million worth of 491 billion PEPE to a Binance account. Etherscan data shows the deposit occurred at 07:31 a.m. +UTC under the transaction ID ‘0xb46…3afd5c.’



0xb46b036c6ed411d86bdab8fc0990af9a681b5e1d2635efd8f539fd6c573afd5c. Source: Etherscan



Interestingly, the influencer then posted that “PEPE is still severely undervalued” one hour after the deposit. According to screenshots taken and shared by Lookonchain, James Wynn continued with two other bullish-biased posts related to PEPE.







These posts are currently inaccessible because the trader locked his account on X.



James Wynn’s “these posts are protected” warning. Source: X / Finbold



Depositing from a self-custody wallet to crypto exchanges usually means an intention to sell and is a commonly used indicator.



Previously, Wynn spent $8,524 to buy 2.83 trillion PEPE, which equals $44.4 million at current prices. The influencer has been partially selling this amount over time. Now, his most recent activity dumped nearly half of the remaining reserves held at jwynn.eth.



As of this writing, the account still holds 476.8 billion PEPE, worth approximately $7.48 million.



PEPE, meme coins, and the Greater Fool Theory



Meme coins, such as PEPE, often lack fundamental value and are driven by hype and social media buzz. Traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.



This mentality aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a “greater fool.” 



Moreover, this theory highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down and demand dwindles, traders can be left holding worthless cryptocurrencies, leading to substantial financial losses.



In closing, this recent activity demonstrates the importance of not blindly following crypto influencers to make investment decisions.

Coinbase Strengthens Case For Interlocutory Appeal In Latest Petition


								The long-drawn legal battle between Coinbase and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to provide more twists and turns in what may be a pivotal case in crypto regulatory history. In a recent development, the American crypto exchange has now filed a response to the commission’s petition against an initial motion for an interlocutory appeal in this contentious legal case.


Coinbase Sends Fiery Response To SEC As Appeal Saga Thickens
On April 12, Coinbase approached the US court seeking clarification on whether an investment contract can be formed with no post-sale obligations. The crypto exchanges consider this issue as a “controlling question of law” critical to its ongoing case with the SEC. 
In response, the SEC argued that there was no need for the court to certify such an interlocutory appeal as the existing securities regulations, especially the Howey Test, have proven sufficient for decades. In particular, the Commission stated that no court had ever requested a post-sale contract following the use of the test in the past. 
However, in a fresh Memorandum of Law submitted on Friday, May 24, Coinbase addresses this statement saying that the interlocutory appeal revolves around a novel issue in that “no appellate court has addressed whether a digital asset transaction carrying no post-sale obligations can be an ‘investment contract’ under Howey”. 
In addition, the exchange accuses the SEC of avoiding the “controlling question of law” in its counter-motion by diverting attention to the controversy with the application of the Howey Test to cryptocurrency transactions rather than Coinbase’s petition which seeks guidance on Howey’s application to digital assets.


Coinbase Seeking For ‘Stylish’ Court Victory
Finally, in Coinbase’s latest petition, the exchange reiterated the potential importance of this interlocutory appeal on the outcome of its legal case with the SEC. The defendant’s lawyers stressed that with a favorable outcome, over 70% of the SEC complaints could be rendered invalid. 
A statement from the petition read: 
Most of the SEC’s 116 recently-served document requests and all of its 32 requests for admission, 10 third-party subpoenas, and 9 requests for inspection are about Coinbase’s platform and Prime services rather than the unrelated staking program. This portends a discovery process, motion practice, and a trial skewed heavily toward claims centering on the “ecosystems” of 12 distinct tokens—claims that are destined to consume substantial judicial and party resources but that, with interlocutory review, could be out of the case.

On June 6, 2023, the SEC charged Coinbase with accusations of operating as an unlicensed securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. Considering Coinbase’s status as the largest US exchange, the result of this is tipped by many to have massive effects on regulations in the country’s burgeoning crypto industry.

Bitcoin rises, Ether gets an ETF boost, and Donald Trump takes crypto

Illustration: Craig Hastings (Getty Images)The U.S. House of Representatives passed a crypto market structure bill on Wednesday evening that aims to regulate the industry at large.The bill, “The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act” (FIT21), would effectively classify cryptocurrency as a commodity, not a security, and therefore exempt from securities regulations. It would also determine oversight of cryptocurrencies, whether they should be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Read More

Will 'Coinbase effect' have a role to play in FLOKI's price targets? - AMBCrypto



FLOKI’s price appreciated by over 3.5% in the last 24 hours 
Market indicators hinted at a sustained price hike on the charts 

FLOKI bulls continue to dominate the market as the memecoin’s weekly and daily price charts remained green, at press time. Things can get even better for the altcoin, however, especially since a major exchange has now announced FLOKI’s listing – An update that can propel further growth in the coming days. 
Coinbase lists FLOKI
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that FLOKI has been enjoying a comfortable weekly rally as its value surged by more than 8.8% in the last 7 days. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the memecoin’s price spiked by 3.5%. 
At the time of writing, the memecoin was trading at $0.0002264 with a market capitalization of over $2.16 billion. However, it was surprising to note that despite the bullish price action, FLOKI’s weighted sentiment dropped. Simply put, bearish sentiment retained its dominance in the altcoin’s market.
Additionally, its social volume declined over the last few days as well. 
Source: Santiment
However, this might change after Coinbase announced that it has listed FLOKI perpetual futures. The memecoin’s official X handle mentioned in a tweet that its fresh Coinbase listing will significantly enhance FLOKI’s market liquidity.
 Coinbase listings often have a bullish impact on the listed token’s price, which is commonly referred to as the “Coinbase effect.” If such an episode happens on this occasion, then FLOKI’s bull rally might get a further push and help spur the memecoin’s fainting momentum. 
FLOKI bulls to dominate more?
AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data to find out whether metrics supported the possibility of further growth. We found that FLOKI’s MVRV ratio remained relatively high, which can be inferred as a bullish signal. 
However, the memecoin’s trading volume dropped last week after spiking on 22 May. On top of that, the crypto’s network growth also declined, meaning that fewer new addresses were created to transfer the token. 
Source: Santiment
Nonetheless, market indicators continued to remain bullish. For example, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also went north, indicating that the chances of FLOKI continuing its rally were high.

If the bull rally continues, then the first target for FLOKI would be $0.00024 as liquidation would rise, which can result in a short-term price correction.
A successful breakout above this level would allow the memecoin to hit $0.00026–$0.00027. However, if the trend changes and the memecoin goes down, then FLOKI might drop to its support level near $0.000226.

Shibarium, the Shiba Inu-backed Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, is showcasing a mixed growth outlook, however, with the tendency to hit a major milestone soon. Per data from its dedicated explorer Shibariumscan, the L2 protocol is eyeing hitting the 5,000,000 total block production milestone.Shibarium's erratic statisticsSince its inception, Shibarium has maintained a steady growth pace in all key metrics, except for its erratic daily transaction count. Despite powering one of the most vibrant Web3 ecosystems, its average daily transaction count has slumped from at least 1 million in Q4, 2023, to just 5,150 today.Despite this epic slump, block production remains steady. At the time of writing, a total of 4,900,607 blocks have been produced on Shibarium, leaving just 99,393 blocks to hit the 5 million milestone. At its current pace, chances are that it might hit this record before the end of this second quarter.Another crucial data insight on Shibarium is the total transactions and wallet address features. While total transactions come in at 417,549,926, the wallet address count is pegged at 1,803,996. This data shows that Shibarium is thriving within its own ecosystem of dApps.Boosting Shibarium with ShibaSwapSince its inception in August 2023, Shibarium has charted its growth course in a majorly organic manner. This is about to change as the protocol has welcomed ShibaSwap, its dominant decentralized exchange (DEX).As an exchange with many unique visitors, the expectation is that in the long run, ShibaSwap can help drive the transaction rebound as well as attract new users into the Shibarium ecosystem.With the Ethereum L2 ecosystem recording intense competition, Shibarium is looking at competing following its latest hard fork event on the mainnet. With faster speed, predictable gas cost and transaction throughput, hitting the anticipated milestone appears inevitable.

Ethereum’s Muted Response to ETF Approval: A Calm Before the Storm?


							

Ethereum price increases slightly after long-awaited SEC approval of spot ETFs.



Ethereum traders have lost $23.33 million to liquidation in the last 24 hours.



Analysts expect the spot ETFs to bring more demand to the Ethereum market.




The market value of Ethereum (ETH) registered only a modest uptick over the last 24 hours despite the SEC approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs.



At the last check, Ethereum traded at $3,742, representing a 2.76% increase from the previous day, although its weekly performance reflects a more substantial gain. In comparison, Bitcoin surged 4%, setting a daily high of $69,222, with a similar percentage growth over its weekly performance.



Notably, in the build-up to the ETF approvals, Ethereum experienced heightened optimism. The asset soared by 40% to reclaim the $3,943 price point on Thursday, having traded at as low as $2,815 on May 1.



Meanwhile, the positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum waned after ETF approvals. Data from market tracker Coinglass indicated that following the SEC’s approval of Ethereum spot ETF listings on May 23, ETH traders witnessed $80.3 million in long liquidations.



For context, a long position involves purchasing an asset with the expectation of selling it at a higher price in the future. As of the latest figures, traders betting against the Ethereum uptrend are now the ones mostly in losses. In particular, Ethereum shorts have lost $23.33 million in the last 24 hours, amid ETH’s 2.76% uptick.



Source | Coinglass



While Ethereum has yet to see substantial gains since the ETH approvals, industry experts remain confident that it will soon set new all-time highs.



Chris Donovan, COO of the NEAR Protocol, expressed optimism for the crypto industry in the wake of the Ethereum spot ETF approval. Donovan believes that the approval is a strong endorsement for the entire crypto sector and could lead to significant and improved demand entering the market.









The approval of Ethereum spot ETFs marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, signaling growing acceptance among institutional investors. Even as the market adjusts to the surprise SEC approval, the optimism expressed by industry figures like Chris Donovan suggests that this could be just the beginning of Ethereum’s next bull run.

Private stablecoins will be the bedrock of on-chain commerce - Blockworks


One of the most common misconceptions about blockchain technology is that it’s synonymous with privacy. Instead, the reality is that public blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are more of an open book than a lockbox of user information. They are transparent by default, and every single transaction that takes place on them is visible to anyone using a block explorer.
While this has numerous benefits — including fulfilling the dream of a more accountable financial system — it also has its drawbacks. When it comes to commerce and other use cases, some variations in how these blockchains are implemented might be appreciated by end users and enterprise projects alike. Private stablecoins, in particular, are key to this type of adoption.
Parity with TradFi is the least we can do
As crypto and digital assets become more widely adopted, the transparency that exists in public blockchains becomes more problematic. The perils of doxxing that now exist in terms of personally identifiable information will start to extend to personal financial information as well, leaving many vulnerable to bad actors.
Despite this, recent developments like Google’s decision to index ENS balances and transactions have made personal financial information on Web3 more public than ever before. And while these balances are generally held in pseudonymous accounts, their IRL identities are usually traceable by sufficiently interested parties, as some controversial Web3 projects have demonstrated.
What happens then, if we assume that the Web3 community’s ambition to bring more and more financial activity on-chain, becomes reality? 
On one hand, we’ve solved the primary problem of adoption thanks to stablecoins, albeit sans privacy. Today, we use robust stablecoins that let us work around crypto’s volatility for many kinds of on-chain commerce activities, including popular DeFi applications. 
Read more from our opinion section: Stablecoins bots are a feature, not a bug
On the other hand, on-chain commerce will never fully take off without the same level of privacy that exists in traditional finance because most users expect the same level of privacy and ease that they get with their banking app on their smartphone — and reasonably so. 
It’s not hard to see why the current open book nature of public blockchains is a cause for concern for many would-be users and enterprise adopters. 
Private stablecoins are the absolute bedrock of any Web3 analogue for commerce use cases. We can’t achieve parity with traditional finance without getting this right.
Taking on-chain commerce a step further than TradFi
We’re already starting to reap the benefits of all the great research and advances in zk technology that took place during the bear market. This is enabling new features that protect users’ financial information by allowing them to prove necessary information without revealing balances or transactions publicly. 
The ongoing integration of this technology with stablecoins will pave the way for on-chain commerce to thrive. Moreso, it will add security and privacy benefits that did not exist in traditional finance and Web2 environments.
The first example of where these features can have an impact goes back to personal security. Private stablecoins based on zk technology (and current work on cost reductions for proof verifications) eliminate the need for expensive custodians through built-in security and anonymization features.
Then, we can look at the implications for enterprise adopters. Private stablecoins can provide competitive security and protection against espionage by obscuring transaction trails for stablecoins and securing sensitive business operations.
Enhanced privacy features using zk technology can also mask financial details of employees to prevent reverse-engineering of payroll data when salaries are distributed using stablecoins. This kind of non-custodial security solution could reduce vulnerabilities even further by decentralizing payroll management with employees controlling their own transactions.
Finally, we can look at the need for private stablecoins from a compliance perspective. We can program regulatory compliance into stablecoins in such a way that they’re tailored to meet legal standards, maximizing privacy and security at the same time. 
In these cases, compliance can be proven to relevant authorities via zk proofs that don’t disclose any additional information publicly. This would create a healthier balance between transparency and privacy for stablecoin users in on-chain commerce.
A slow but steady path towards private on-chain commerce
The need for private stablecoins for on-chain commerce is part of a broad, important and ongoing conversation around the need for financial privacy in Web3. The decentralized and open source nature of Web3 means innovation is happening quickly, but the right implementation by Web3 projects can be somewhat slower. 
Many of the features that are being made possible by the integration of zk technology into stablecoins are a work in progress. It’s absolutely crucial that we move forward with private stablecoins as soon as possible. Otherwise, a truly on-chain economy will be a permanent pipedream.

Attention: Giant Bankruptcy Firm Starts Sales in This Altcoin - Holding 10 Percent of Total Supply - Bitcoin Sistemi


Teneo, the liquidator of the bankrupt cryptocurrency company Three Arrows Capital (3AC), has made some interesting transactions, according to onchain data.
According to the data, the organization moved 2.18 million Starknet (STRK) tokens, worth approximately $2.63 million, to Binance in the last three days. These appear to be STRK tokens that Teneo recovered from 3AC and sold to pay its buyers.


Notably, Teneo currently owns another 130 million STRK in Three Arrows Capital's bankruptcy assets. This corresponds to approximately 157 million dollars.
With $157 million in assets, Teneo is the second largest holder of STRK tokens, excluding developer and exchange wallets.






Starknet has a total market cap of $1.4 billion, meaning Teneo owns approximately 10% of the total STRK supply in assets.
However, almost 90% of STRK tokens are still uncirculated, bringing the token's fully diluted market value to approximately $12 billion.


After Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin claimed $1.07 million worth of STRK tokens yesterday, the STRK price dropped approximately 6%.

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) Will Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced



                    

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because WIZPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Wizard Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Wizard Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



Wizard Pepe launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Wizard Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Wizard Pepe by entering its contract address – AJM9tnhfGz9xezv1rTjspoTug3YVpcmrp3gJ9FMDEEYj – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WIZPEPE.

$2.7 Billion in Bitcoin and Ether Options Set to Expire, Revealing Market Sentiment



                    

Approximately $2.7 billion in Bitcoin and Ether options are set to expire on May 24, offering key insights into market sentiment.



According to Greeks.live on X, 21,000 Bitcoin options are expiring, with a put/call ratio of 0.88. 




This shows a near-even balance between buyers and sellers, with a slight lean towards call options. 



The maximum pain point, or the price at which most option buyers would incur losses, is $67,000, totaling a nominal value of $1.4 billion.



While the upcoming 21,000 contract expiry is significant, it is overshadowed by a larger event on May 31, when $4.3 billion worth of options are set to expire, according to Deribit. 



Deribit data shows that long positions dominate open interest (OI), with $830 million tied to the $70,000 strike price. 



Higher strike prices also show significant OI, notably $843 million at the $100,000 mark, indicating a bullish sentiment among traders. 



The $60,000 strike price stands out with $388 million in open interest, the most notable for put contracts.



This substantial OI suggests many contracts remain unsettled, showing that bulls are confident in much higher Bitcoin prices.

OI represents the unresolved value of contracts awaiting settlement.




The options expiry event also impacts Ether, with 350,000 contracts expiring, representing a notional value of $1.3 billion. 



The put/call ratio of 0.58 and a max pain point of $3,200 suggest a slightly bullish tone, with more call options expiring than put options.



Greeks.live reports that Ethereum recently led the crypto rally, driven by ETF progress, with a one-day 20% rise. 



The short-term options implied volatility (IV) reached 150%, much higher than Bitcoin’s current IV for the same period.



However, a divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum is evident. 



While Ethereum’s bullish sentiment remains strong, maintaining high IV levels for each major term is challenging from a market trading and structure perspective. 



This suggests that calendar spreads might be a better choice. In contrast, Bitcoin appears more balanced between long and short positions, with stronger forces selling calls.

Terra LUNA’s LUNC Set To Jump 13x, Analyst Reveals The Drivers


																Crypto analyst Javon Marks has laid out a bullish narrative for Terra Classic (LUNC). Based on his analysis, the crypto token could eventually see a 13x increase from its current price levels. The analyst alluded to LUNC’s historical pattern as what could drive such parabolic price surge.

	Related Reading


How LUNC’s Price Could Jump By 1,300% 
Marks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that LUNC has confirmed a “major bullish pattern,” signaling a continuation of its bullish run to the first price target at $0.00058046. He noted that this move of over 400% was likely to be attained with the crypto token holding above levels that it had earlier broken out from. 

The crypto analyst then raised the possibility of LUNC making a 1,300% move instead. He claimed that LUNC’s previous breakout and run pattern suggests that three targets could be broken above, meaning that the crypto token rising to the price target of $0.00139122 from here is “possible.”
Marks has remained bullish on LUNC for a while now and has suggested that LUNC’s parabolic rally is a question of when and not if. However, he has failed to provide any specific timeframe for when this move will likely occur. LUNC’s fundamentals are also expected to contribute to this upward trend and push its price to such heights. 
One way that is likely to happen is through the LUNC’s burns, which are carried out regularly. The Terra community has burnt over 113 billion LUNC tokens since the burning initiative came into place following Terra LUNA’s crash in 2022. This has helped reduce the crypto tokens’s circulating supply and could be significant as demand for the token picks up. 
It is worth noting that LUNC is well below its all-time high of $119. However, this suggests that the crypto token has enough room to move significantly to the upside. 
LUNC is now trading at $0.0001. Chart: TradingView
Recent Developments In The Terra Classic Ecosystem
Genuine Labs, a Terra Classic developer group, recently announced that the latest version of SDK 47 was ready. The proposed upgrade is expected to be put up for governance voting. The upgrade will introduce significant changes to the Terra network, including a fix to the dyncomm decorator. 
Furthermore, the upgrade will handle peer-to-peer (p2p) storms on the network and add new features to the Terrad client, which connects developers to the Terra blockchain. It is uncertain when the proposal will go live, but it should be soon enough. 

	Related Reading


Meanwhile, the Terra community also recently passed a proposal to make Allnodes an official organization for the community. Allnodes will be the official source for information regarding the circulating supply of LUNC, USTC, and other native tokens. 
At the time of writing, LUNC is trading at around $0.0001151, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Here's Ethereum's Next Major Upgrade's Date and What It Will Bring - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethereum main developers are targeting the release of Pectra, the next major update for the Ethereum network, by the end of the first quarter of 2025.
The Pectra update is expected to include the EVM Object Format (EOF), a collection of approximately 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that provide an optional container for EVM code. This key component is one of the main reasons for the projected 2025 timeline for the update.


Another key feature of the update is PeerDAS, a data availability sampling solution that leverages existing peer-to-peer (P2P) components in Ethereum.

In a notable development, the developers have agreed to replace the EIP-3074 account abstraction feature with EIP-7702, a newer offering from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 will increase the flexibility and functionality of the network by allowing Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) to function as smart contract wallets during a transaction.





The Pectra update includes the Prague update in the Execution Layer and the Electra update in the Consensus Layer. However, the final scope of the upgrade is still being debated and there are potential changes on the horizon. One of these changes may be to postpone the transition to the Verkle tree until the next Osaka hardfork.

XRP's unusual token activity - Assessing its potential market impact - AMBCrypto



Many long-term XRP holders changed addresses, but it may not be in a bid to sell.
Short-term participants made mild gains, however, the token remained undervalued

In less than two weeks, XRP’s Age Consumed metric has resurrected from major lows three times. The first time was on 16 May when the metric spiked to 214.86 billion.
On 20 May, it went overboard and hit 539.79 billion, and on 24 May, the metric rose again, indicating significant movement of tokens by long-term holders.
For those unfamiliar, Age Consumed tracks the amount of tokens changing addresses within a certain period. When the metric spikes, it means that a large number of previously idle tokens are on the move.
On the other hand, a low reading suggests that long-term holders have kept most of their assets in the same wallet. On the back of the recent market surge, participants might assume that holders are planning to sell their XRP.
Source: Santiment
XRP to trade between $0.50 and $0.55
However, making conclusions without proof from other metrics might sound too hasty. As such, AMBCrypto evaluated the exchange inflows and outflows on the XRP Ledger.
According to data obtained from Santiment, XRP’s exchange inflows were 211,00. Exchange inflows measure the number of tokens sent from external wallets to exchange addresses.
A surge in the inflows suggests that most tokens might be up for sale. Furthermore, the exchange outflows at press time were 208,000. This metric is the number of tokens sent out to non-custodial wallets. On most occasions, this action implies that the participants involved do not plan to sell soon.
The mild difference in the flows indicates that XRP’s price might not be significantly affected by the spike in the movement of idle coins.
Source: Santiment
Holders should prepare for fireworks
At the time of writing, XRP’s price was $0.53. This value represented a 2.67% hike in the last 7 days. Going by the indications on-chain, XRP might not register a notable uptick in the coming days.
However, if the market condition gets too bearish, the price might slide to the $0.50 underlying support. Conversely, in a highly bullish scenario, XRP might hit $0.55 on the charts.
All in all, the short-term forecast seemed to indicate that the token might remain in a tight trading range. In the meantime, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio showed that more XRP holders have become profitable of late.
At press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio was 2.696%. This means that the average token holder who accumulated in the last 30 days might get positive returns if they sold.
Source: Santiment
In addition, the metric measures if an asset is undervalued or overvalued. By the look of things, XRP seemed to be undervalued, compared to its performance in March.

Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2024-2025

Hence, the token’s price might climb toward $0.60 in the mid-term. However, the short-term outlook does not exactly look bullish as XRP might swing sideways as mentioned previously.

South Korea Busts Crypto Scam: 19 Arrested In 'Reading Room' Fraud


								South Korean law enforcement has struck a blow against social media-fueled crypto scam with the arrest of 19 individuals linked to a deceptive “crypto reading room.” The Daegu Police Agency’s raid, which unfolded on May 21st, exposed a manipulative scheme that preyed on more than 300 unsuspecting investors, swindling them out of a staggering $19 million.

Crypto Scam: Deceptive Chats, Illusory Profits
Authorities allege the international gang operated an “open chat room,” likely on platforms like Telegram or KakaoTalk, masquerading as a legitimate hub for cryptocurrency trading advice.
Police describe the room as a meticulously crafted stage. Gang members, posing as seasoned crypto experts, dispensed seemingly valuable tips and boasted about substantial returns.
Others, acting as ordinary investors, chimed in with enthusiastic endorsements, weaving a web of trust to lure victims into the trap.
Logo of the Daegu Police Agency.
Bogus Exchanges, Brutal Betrayal
The meticulously crafted facade unraveled when victims were steered towards downloading apps connected to bogus crypto exchanges. These fake platforms, say officers, housed unlisted coins, further fueling the illusion of exclusivity and potential profit.

As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com
To solidify trust, the crypto scam gang allowed victims to make small, initial gains, emboldening them to invest larger sums. The true horror unfolded when victims attempted to withdraw their funds. They were met with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle – fabricated “withdrawal fees.”

ChatGPT-4o predicts XRP's price if the token's ETF is approved


    Following the approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Standard Chartered Bank has projected that several other cryptocurrencies could follow suit.



Among the cryptocurrencies is Ripple’s XRP, which is currently embroiled in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs suggests that the regulatory agency does not classify ETH as a security.



Therefore, this implies that other coins previously under scrutiny may also not be considered securities, paving the way for more spot crypto ETF approvals. 







Drawing from historical performance, the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF led to the cryptocurrency rallying to a new record high. Monitoring whether the same can be replicated for XRP will be a matter of interest.



To gather insights regarding the price impact of a possible ETF on XRP, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s latest and most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o.



Implication of XRP spot ETF



The tool identified several factors around an ETF that could impact the price of XRP. First, ChatGPT-4o drew parallels from the past, noting that the approval of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs significantly influenced the maiden cryptocurrency’s value. This surge has been attributed to heightened accessibility and institutional interest. Similarly, should an XRP ETF gain approval, a comparable uptrend could be anticipated.



The tool also noted that the regulatory move could positively impact XRP. It pointed out that if an XRP ETF receives the green light, heightened interest and investment from retail and institutional sectors could be witnessed, further bolstering XRP’s market position.



Additionally, the AI platform highlighted that the impact of the ETF approval could complement XRP’s existing fundamentals. It noted that XRP’s utility in cross-border payments and established partnerships with financial institutions underpin its intrinsic value.



XRP price prediction post-ETF approval



Regarding the token’s price, ChatGPT-4o suggested that XRP could experience a substantial price escalation if the ETF is approved. The tool offered a conservative estimate, stating that if ETF approval leads to moderate increases in investment and interest, XRP might see a price increase of 2x to 3x over the next year from the current valuation. This would place XRP in the range of $1.08 to $1.62.



In a more optimistic scenario, where market conditions are favorable and investor interest surges, XRP could see a 5x to 7x increase, leading to a price range of $2.70 to $3.78.



Elsewhere, in the event of a highly bullish market with significant institutional adoption and broader market rallies, the tool projected that XRP might experience a 10x increase, pushing the price to around $5.40 or higher.

It will be interesting to monitor how the SEC approaches a possible XRP ETF, considering the regulatory agency has been in a long-term legal battle with XRP’s parent company, Ripple. 



Overall, an approval would be considered bullish for the United States cryptocurrency landscape over the ability to attract institutional investor capital into the sector.



At the moment, there are expectations that the legal matter will be resolved soon. Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Garlinghouse, continues criticizing the SEC over its “regulation by enforcement” approach.



XRP price analysis



By press time, XRP was trading at $0.53, having rallied about 0.3% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, XRP is up almost 3%.

Meanwhile, XRP’s main hurdle is reclaiming the $1 mark, which is pivotal for competing with assets such as Bitcoin. In the short term, investors will be monitoring the price as it aims to breach the $0.60 resistance.

Telegram's Explosive Gaming Trend Spurs Cryptocurrency Adoption with Viral Hits like Notcoin



                    

Telegram‘s vast user base is becoming fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption, with viral games like Notcoin surging in popularity.



In less than two months, Notcoin attracted over 30 million users on Telegram and established The Open Network (TON)-based cryptocurrency wallets. 




This “idle game,” where users tap their screens to earn NOT tokens, has integrated 3% of Telegram users into the Web3 space. 



Listing NOT tokens on major cryptocurrency exchanges has also provided financial benefits for casual gamers.



Inal Kardan, gaming lead at TON Foundation, discussed with Cointelegraph the unique ability of blockchain gaming to draw new users into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 




“Gaining 35 million users in five months, Notcoin showed us how games can work on Telegram and how easy it can be to onboard users,” Kardan said at the Next Block Expo in Warsaw.



Kardan noted that several Telegram-based games are quickly attracting significant user numbers and revenues by leveraging marketing mechanics like sharing and mining within Telegram. 



He described Telegram as an accessible and “somewhat untapped distribution channel” that integrates Web2 technologies with web page extensions and blockchain functionality.



Kardan also mentioned a shift from the “play-to-earn” models of popular Web3 games like Axie Infinity. 




Games like Notcoin are adopting newer approaches, including traditional monetization tactics like advertising.



Yat Siu, co-founder of blockchain gaming venture capital firm Animoca Brands, explained that the success of Web3 games on Telegram and TON is due to viral growth mechanics previously used on platforms like Facebook or the Apple App Store. 



“Neither Apple nor Google have been as flexible on Web3 games on their platforms the way TON and Telegram have been. It’s a competitive builder/growth advantage that TON is getting here too,” Siu said.



Siu emphasized that idle clicker games have always been popular, but the user engagement approach of games like Notcoin is a key differentiator.

“The Notcoin approach has far better value for end-users and is more aligned with growth incentives versus the adversarial nature of Web2 advertising business models,” he added.



Siu cited Gamee, a Web3 gaming firm using hyper-casual games on TON and Telegram, as an example. 



Gamee’s average daily active user count has increased to around one million due to staking and idle game mechanics.



Michał Dąbrowski, CEO and founder of blockchain game infrastructure provider Elympics, believes Web3 games are set to attract new cryptocurrency users. 



Dąbrowski told Cointelegraph that blockchain infrastructure bridges the gap for game developers struggling with monetization mechanics, allowing them to use cryptocurrency wallets to incentivize and engage players.



Elympics sees immense potential in the TON ecosystem, which is closely linked to Telegram’s large user base. “Notcoin is a prime example. 



It tapped into the viral aspect of a social platform like Telegram. Sharing is an important part of the mechanics,” Dąbrowski said. 



He added that Web3 functionality is revitalizing the idle gaming genre, giving users ownership and value from their gameplay through monetized soft currencies.

Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Could Send ETH to a New Record High, Says Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan - The Daily Hodl


								The chief investment officer of crypto fund manager Bitwise is predicting new all-time highs for Ethereum (ETH) if spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are ultimately approved.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a rule change that sets the stage for the potential green lighting of spot market Ethereum ETFs.










In a new interview on the Bankless podcast, Matt Hougan predicts investor inflows into ETH ETFs would total billions of dollars and drive ETH beyond its all-time high of about $4,900, which it hit back in November 2021.
“I don’t think Ethereum ETFs will match Bitcoin ETFs. But I do think it will be measured in terms of many billions of dollars… 
Will it be enough to drive Ethereum to new all-time highs? I definitely think that’s possible as well. If Bitcoin ETFs did $12 billion in their first four months, I think Ethereum ETFs will do less than half of that but more than a quarter of that. And that’s going to be pretty significant. Remember, that’s against a market with no net new supply. So I think there is real demand.” 
Hougan believes that ETFs with exposure to multiple digital assets will also launch in the future and investor demand will exist for the different types.
“I think if you think about the ETF investor market if I had to put numbers on it a year from now, I think you’ll have 30% of the market that’s Bitcoin only, you’ll have like 50% of the market that’s a mix, you’ll have 20% of the market that’s ETH only… 
Many professional investors looking at the crypto market are looking for sort of tech alpha. They’re looking for that high-returning asset. Ethereum fits nicely into that dialogue. So I think you’ll see all three. And I think the market as a whole will benefit from there being multiple crypto asset ETFs if that’s what we get. It makes the market feel more robust, more real. There’s more to talk about. I think it’ll be a net positive. These are going to be significant.” 
Ethereum is trading for $3,736 at time of writing, down more than 1% in the last 24 hours.

Long squeeze alert: This cryptocurrency could crash 30% soon


    The meme coin mania is back in the cryptocurrency market, and cryptocurrencies like PEPE show signals of being overvalued. This could foreshadow a long squeeze, as suggested by increased open interest (OI), high funding rates, and accumulated liquidations downwards.



Previously, the meme coin boom marked a local top, followed by a market crash and significant long-position liquidations. Should a similar pattern play out, this asset class is at the peril of suffering another hit despite positive social activity from influencers.



As of this writing, PEPE has $736.69 million in open interest, ranking fifth on CoinGlass. This value represents 11% of the meme coin’s $6.39 billion market cap, trading at $0.0000151. Notably, PEPE’s OI is larger than the open interest on XRP, which has a $29.73 billion market cap.







Despite a drop of 37.82% in the $3.07 billion 24-hour volume, the market’s open interest is surging by 8.85% on the meme coin.

PEPE funding rates and potential long squeeze



In particular, the consolidated exchanges’ funding rates for PEPE indicate an open interest weighted to long positions. Currently, long-position traders pay an APR of 52.66% to PEPE short-sellers as a mechanism to remedy derivatives imbalances.



This high funding rate could accelerate a long squeeze to the meme coin or, at least, incentivize traders to close these bullish positions.

Moreover, the one-week liquidation heatmap shows a likely liquidation price target of $0.0000107 per token to leveraged PEPE traders. Therefore, the meme coin could be set for a long-squeeze crash if sentiment shifts from bullish to bearish.

A price drop to this target would result in 30% losses to traders buying PEPE at current levels.



Still, the meme coin could continue upward if enough capital flows into it in the following days. Cryptocurrency traders and speculators must understand the volatile nature of these digital assets and act cautiously moving forward.

Nvidia has 'near zero chance' of outperforming Bitcoin this decade, say experts


    In light of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) impressive performance over the past decade, financial and cryptocurrency experts now anticipate a significant shift, predicting that the tech giant has “near zero chance” of outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the upcoming decade. 



This forecast is part of a wider discussion on the evolving dynamics between traditional high-growth tech stocks like Nvidia and growing digital currencies such as Bitcoin.



Nvidia, a leader in the semiconductor industry, recently celebrated a remarkable milestone with its stock price soaring following the latest earnings report. 







This surge contributed to an overall return of 21,558% from May 2014 to May 2024, a growth significantly fueled by the company’s pioneering efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming technologies. 



An X post from The Kobeissi Letter on May 25 highlighted this extraordinary performance: 




“$NVDA has officially joined the exclusive club of 250,000%+ in all-time returns. $10,000 invested in Nvidia in 1999 is worth $25.3 million today.”




Despite these impressive gains, Bitcoin has emerged as a formidable competitor. It has returned 13,048% over the same period, with recent trends suggesting even greater potential.  



Notably, the 90-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index rose to 0.46 last week, marking the highest level since late August. 



This reflects Bitcoin’s increasing alignment with mainstream financial markets, a trend further evidenced by its comparison with high-growth tech stocks.

Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, and Lyn Alden, a noted investment strategist, have expressed skepticism about Nvidia’s capacity to replicate its past decade’s success. 



They highlight Bitcoin’s advantages, such as its integration into mainstream financial products, including the recently approved Bitcoin ETFs, and its potential to outpace traditional assets due to its decentralized nature and extensive network effects.







Recent performance and market trends



The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10 was a significant milestone that further legitimized Bitcoin as a mainstream investment option, boosting its returns to 31.7% since then. 



This slight edge over Nvidia’s 30.2% in the same period underscores growing investor confidence in Bitcoin, aligning it with the growth trajectories typically associated with high-growth tech stocks.



Daniel Sempere Pico and Sina from 21st.capital have commented on the potential for Bitcoin’s financial networks and widespread adoption to drive more sustainable long-term growth compared to Nvidia’s AI-driven advancements. 



They argue that while Nvidia’s innovations in AI are impactful, the broader applications of Bitcoin in global financial systems present a more compelling investment narrative, suggesting that the future of investment may tilt increasingly towards digital currencies over traditional tech giants.



Nvidia and BTC analysis: A comparative look at market performance



BTC and NVDA comparison. Source: TradingView



From January 1, 2024, to May 25, 2024, BTC-USD and NVIDIA demonstrated distinct trading patterns and growth trajectories, reflecting their unique market positions and investor sentiments.



Bitcoin exhibited significant volatility, with prices ranging from approximately $39,450 to $73,750, leading to a 63% YTD increase. 



This volatility, highlighted by frequent relative strength index (RSI) signals of overvaluation and undervaluation, underscores the speculative nature of Bitcoin, influenced by diverse investor behaviors and market dynamics.



In contrast, NVIDIA displayed strong growth, with its stock price increasing from $475 to $1,064, marking a YTD rise of about 115%. 



The stability in NVIDIA’s RSI suggests consistent market sentiment and fewer fluctuations attributed to its ongoing advancements in AI and the semiconductor sectors, which are vital for technological innovation and impact across various industries.



As Bitcoin increasingly competes with major tech stocks, its transformative role in the investment landscape is becoming more pronounced. 



With broader adoption and alignment with financial markets, digital currencies are poised to dominate future growth, potentially overshadowing even the most established tech giants

Ethereum ETFs Could Trigger ETH Supply Crisis


The newly approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could trigger a supply crunch for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
Ethereum’s supply on centralized exchanges has hit an eight-year low, with only 12.78 million ETH available. This amount constitutes roughly 11% of the total supply.
Ethereum Demand Shock Expected

Analysts have noted that investors are withdrawing their ETH from exchanges just as the asset is poised to experience a surge in institutional demand. Such a decline in exchange balances is usually a bullish sign. It indicates that investors expect price growth and have no plans to sell their holdings in the short term.
This week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved several Ethereum ETFs, which many believe could boost demand for the cryptocurrency. 
Mara Schmiedt, CEO of Alluvial, points to the significant institutional interest generated by spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January. These ETFs now hold 800,000 BTC, demonstrating a growing institutional appetite. Consequently, she predicts Ethereum could see similar demand, potentially leading to a significant demand shock.

“What happens if there is $20 billion taken out of the market? It could be a tipping point in terms of supply and demand. We haven’t really seen this kind of rapid demand shock in the market before,” Schmiedt said.

Notably, ETH is already experiencing a surge in institutional activity. Blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock reported that anticipation around Ethereum ETF approval pushed the on-chain trading volume to a two-year high of $15.98 billion, largely driven by crypto whales.

Of the $15.98 billion, $14.33 billion came from transactions exceeding $100,000, typically conducted by whales. This accounts for 90% of the total traded volume on that day.

IntoTheBlock explained that the approval of ETH ETFs marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency acceptance. It continued that this move would likely increase ETH whales’ activity, as seen in recent large-volume transactions.

“The shifting landscape, underscored by substantial on-chain trading volumes, suggests a growing institutional and investor confidence in Ethereum. This trend is poised to gain momentum, potentially leading to even greater market movements,” IntoTheBlock added.

Here’s when Solana (SOL) could hit $1000


    Amid recent market volatility, Solana (SOL) demonstrates significant resilience and potential for growth, with predictions suggesting a path towards the $1,000 milestone. Despite a slight dip, innovative developments within its ecosystem and positive analyst forecasts signal a robust future.



Currently, SOL is trading at $168.24, having increased by 0.17% over the last day and an impressive 13% over the past month. Ranked as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of about $75.71 billion, Solana is attracting significant interest from investors.



This is reflected in a notable increase in trading volume, suggesting that Solana is on a path to recovery and poised for further growth in a fluctuating market.







Analyst perspectives



Prominent crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has identified bullish trends in Solana’s technical patterns, suggesting the price could soar to $1000. 







His optimism is fueled by the growth of SocialFi applications like SolChat within Solana’s ecosystem, which enable blockchain-based social interactions. This innovation not only revolutionizes communication but also significantly boosts Solana’s intrinsic value.



Adding depth to this optimistic forecast, Daniel Yan from Matrixport draws parallels between Solana and Ethereum (ETH)



He notes that Ethereum previously benefited from the approval of a Bitcoin ETF and suggests that Solana could experience similar gains if Ethereum ETFs are approved. 



Yan prefers Solana over Ethereum due to its less crowded market and higher potential for profits, making it an attractive option for investors seeking substantial returns. He emphasizes Solana’s unique attributes and strategic market position, arguing that these factors distinguish it in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and ETF landscape.



Altcoin Sherpa complements these views, highlighting the technical strengths of Solana and its strategic market positioning.



He points out that the recent price dip might set the stage for a short-term rally. According to Sherpa, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Solana, which had previously dipped, is now rebounding, indicating an increase in buying interest.



The anticipated introduction of Solana and XRP ETFs by 2025, as hinted at by Standard Chartered, adds another layer of optimism. 



This forecast not only suggests a growing institutional interest in Solana but also marks it as a candidate for widespread adoption and significant price appreciation



SOL price analysis



Solana is currently trading at $168.74, with RSI  at 50.31 indicating a neutral market stance. However, the RSI also suggests a weakening momentum, hinting at increasing selling pressure.

Despite these challenges, Solana’s strong market position, backed by innovative technological developments and positive forecasts from analysts, sets the stage for significant growth



As the cryptocurrency sector evolves, the strategic advancements and trends emerging within the market are likely to propel Solana toward new heights.

Dogecoin Price Pops And Drops Following Elon Musk’s Tribute To Meme Legend Kabosu ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) spiked today after the meme coin’s most prominent evangelist, Elon Musk, tweeted about the passing of Kabosu — the Shiba Inu pup whose quizzical expression became synonymous with Dogecoin and the wider meme culture.



Elon Musk Mourns Internet Sensation Kabosu



As ZyCrypto reported earlier, Kabosu passed away on May 24 at age 18. Her owner, Atsuko Sato, revealed in a blog post that the internet-famous Shiba Inu dog had “crossed the rainbow bridge” peacefully. The Shiba Inu dog not only served as a mascot for Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and countless other dog-themed cryptocurrencies but also became a symbol of the fun and cheerful spirit of the cryptoverse.



Tesla/SpaceX CEO Elon Musk paid tribute to Kabosu in a post on his X social media platform. The eccentric technopreneur shared a picture showing the Harambe gorilla with angel wings hugging the beloved dog among clouds that radiate an ethereal radiance, as can be seen here.







Harambe, the lowland gorilla, was killed in 2016 at the Cincinnati Zoo after he grabbed and dragged a little boy who climbed into his enclosure. Harambe also quickly inspired memes and an online movement after his death.



Bullish DOGE Reaction



DOGE rocketed as much as 7.7% to an intraday high of $0.17 in the span of minutes after Musk’s tribute post. The OG meme coin had pared some of its gains at press time, to change hands at $0.1649.

&nbsp



The rollercoaster price action spotlights the market-moving power Musk has over DOGE. In March, for instance, the DOGE price surged after the self-proclaimed Dogefather suggested that Tesla would, in the future, allow customers to purchase its electric vehicles with the leading meme coin. DOGE fans have also speculated on the possibility of Musk incorporating the token into an X payment system following his positive comments on various occasions.



Launched in December 2013 as a mere joke, Dogecoin remains the oldest and largest meme coin, with a market capitalization of $24.2 billion. But despite the latest price gains, Dogecoin remains down 77.5% from its historic peak of $0.73 set in May 2021.

ETH, SHIB, & USDT Among Most Common Altcoins Held By Mollars Presale Investors


                        
                            ETH, SHIB, & USDT Among Most Common Altcoins Held By Mollars Presale Investors                        
                        

                        The team behind the Mollars token presale & project have just released an interesting report via their official X profile. It had already been reported that the “MOLLARS” brand is seeing search volumes from crypto traders that are rivaling Bonk Inu (BONK) and Pepe (PEPE) tokens. Now data from an investor of the new store-of-value token is offering a look into what type of crypto traders are buying into Mollars presale.“Mollars ICO appears to be gaining the most momentum from these 10 cryptocurrency holders,” reads the tweet.Most Common Cryptocurrencies Held by Mollars Investors
The notice of analytical data was followed by the following list in descending order of rankings of which cryptocurrency holders have been seen buying Mollars. The common altcoins held include: 
Ethereum (ETH) 
Shiba Inu (SHIB) 
Tether (USDT) 
Bitcoin (BTC) 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
Bonk Inu (BONK) 
Pepe Token (PEPE) 
Floki Inu (FLOKI)
DogWifHat (WIF)
Polygon (MATIC)
Though this data has not yet been verified, the transaction wallets of the Mollars token presale are visible to the general public (1, 2, and the prior ETH address 3).In a brief review of the latest Ethereum transaction address, it’s clear that many of these tokens are held by traders along with Wrapped Ethereum (wETH).With Mollars becoming such a popular cryptocurrency brand amongst other majors, this data could further strengthen the case that the new store-of-value asset will have an explosive ride to the 9 figure market capitalization milestone.Cryptocurrency Brand ValueGoogle Trends also shows that the “Mollars” keyword has enough search volume to be picked up as a popular inquiry. Using the comparison tool, traders can view that “Mollars” is searched for 50% as much as ‘Pepe token’ on some days and 90% as much as ‘Bonk Inu.’ BONK token holders are also credited with being the mob of new investors that invested in Mollars presale from the previous week. The migratory horde possibly invested nearly 6 figures into the ICO event cumulatively.Mollars Initial Coin Offering will end on June 2nd. With it currently pre-selling at a price of $0.55-cents, this may be the last time it’s available to investors at a price that’s under what it’s listed to debut at on cryptocurrency exchanges — $0.62.Also, Ethereum-Blockchain’s new store-of-value asset will have less than half of the total token supply Bitcoin. The $BTC is the top rival of $MOLLARS, but the original cryptocurrency has outdated and what some consider an unscalable blockchain technology. With the Ethereum Spot ETF approval just passing, some believe that ERC-20 tokens could possibly see a bigger increase in value than Bitcoin this year.To date, the Mollars ICO has raised over $1.4-million dollars and continues to generate 5-figures (USD) daily in token presales.

Vitalik Buterin Backs Private Likes and Proposes Zero-Knowledge Technology for Social Media



                    

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed his support for X engineer Haofei’s announcement on the decentralized social media platform Farcaster, where Haofei revealed that X will make “Likes” private.



On May 20, Buterin expanded on this idea, suggesting that Farcaster should implement zero-knowledge (ZK) likes to address preference falsification—misrepresenting true preferences due to social pressure or fear.




Zero-knowledge technology is a privacy-preserving cryptography method that enables one party to prove a statement’s truth to another without revealing confidential information. 



Applied to likes, it would allow someone to prove they liked a post without revealing their identity.



Buterin proposed borrowing ZK technology from Zupoll, a tool used within the pop-up city concept he initiated, Zuzalu. Zupoll, focused on decentralization and cryptography, is utilized for anonymous voting and poll decision-making.




Buterin’s suggestion to use ZK technology aligns with Farcaster’s principles: user privacy, censorship resistance, autonomy, and differentiation from centralized social media platforms.



In response to rumors that X might hide users’ likes by default, Haofei confirmed that the platform would make likes private, explaining:

“Public likes are incentivizing the wrong behavior. For example, many people feel discouraged from liking content that might be ‘edgy’ in fear of retaliation from trolls, or to protect their public image.” 




Haofei added that users would soon be able to like posts “without worrying who might see it,” and emphasized that “the more posts you like, the better for you the algorithm will become.”



Community reactions were mixed. Some users suggested extending the idea to other features, stating, “Why stop at likes? Following is the same.” 



In contrast, high-profile accounts like Wall Street Silver offered differing opinions.



Beyond ZK cryptography, Buterin has proposed solutions to mitigate the miner extracted value (MEV) issue. 



MEV strategies allow validators to profit by arranging transactions within a block to exploit arbitrage opportunities. 



However, this practice congests the network, increases trader slippage, and raises gas fees. 



To address this, Buterin recommended MEV minimization quarantine techniques, the use of inclusion lists, and reduced requirements to run a node.

New Solana Memecoin Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because JUNKCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Junkyard Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Junkyard Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Junkyard Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Junkyard Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Junkyard Cat by entering its contract address – 6AdCuXXoxVMzPnczLjgqC9nQSBtcXnffVvRs8JsQvHhM – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like JUNKCAT.

Prosecutors Seek Up to 7 Years for Former FTX Executive Ryan Salame in Crypto Fraud Case



                    

U.S. prosecutors are seeking a five to seven-year prison sentence for former FTX executive Ryan Salame, who was allegedly a key accomplice to FTX co-founder Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried, in connection with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange.



On May 21, federal prosecutors submitted a sentencing memo to a Manhattan federal court, calling for a strict sentence for Salame, who has pleaded guilty to serious crimes related to the misuse of FTX investors’ funds.




According to a court filing viewed by Bloomberg, the prosecutors are advocating for a “just punishment” that reflects the severity of Salame’s crimes, contrary to his lawyers’ recommendation of no more than 18 months in prison.



“The campaign finance offense is one of the largest-ever in American history, and the unlicensed money transmitting business exchanged more than $1 billion without proper supervision,” said the prosecutors.



Salame’s sentencing, for aiding SBF in misappropriating $10 billion of users’ funds, is scheduled for May 28.




The prosecutors emphasized, “Only a meaningful period of incarceration could adequately deter the defendant and others and promote respect for the law.”



READ MORE: Bitcoin Hovers Near $67,000 as Traders Eye Key Resistance and Support Levels



On April 1, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York sentenced SBF to 25 years in prison after he was convicted on seven felony charges. 



Salame is set to be the first of SBF’s accomplices to be sentenced.




Salame joined Alameda Research in Hong Kong in 2019 and eventually became the CEO of FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamas-based subsidiary of FTX.



Other notable figures involved in the FTX scheme, including Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh, and Gary Wang, have yet to be sentenced.



Meanwhile, several U.S. lawmakers are backing a bill intended to clarify the roles of financial regulators in the oversight of digital assets, aiming to prevent future incidents similar to FTX. 



North Carolina Representative Wiley Nickel has called for the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act, which would define how the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulate cryptocurrencies.

FTX Paid More Than $25,000,000 in Hush Money to Whistleblowers, According to Court Examiner - The Daily Hodl


								The bankrupt crypto exchange FTX paid more than $25 million worth of hush money to whistleblowers before collapsing in November 2022, according to a new report from a court-appointed examiner.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) tapped Robert J. Cleary, a lawyer who served as the lead prosecutor on the Unabomber case, to probe FTX as part of the exchange’s ongoing bankruptcy case.










In a report filed on Thursday, Cleary references an investigation conducted by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a white-shoe law firm hired by FTX chief executive John J. Ray III, who took over for disgraced former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
Quinn Emanuel probed how FTX handled several whistleblower complaints that alleged systemic misconduct at the company.
The law firm concluded that FTX failed to properly investigate the substance of the whistleblowers’ complaints but did pay out more than $25 million to seven people who raised issues. Bankman-Fried’s father, Stanford Law School professor Joseph Bankman, reportedly helped resolve some of the complaints.
The whistleblowers alleged that FTX and its associated entities misled investors, commingled customer funds, violated commodity regulations, committed market manipulation and insider trading and failed to install appropriate anti-money laundering controls and compliance measures, among other issues.
FTX imploded and filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 amid accusations that Bankman-Fried mishandled the exchange’s funds by loaning out billions of dollars worth of customer deposits to Alameda Research, the firm’s trading arm.
The exchange’s multi-billion dollar collapse led to a sharp downtick in crypto prices, and US federal authorities arrested Bankman-Fried the following month.
Last November, a US jury found the former FTX chief executive guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud against FTX’s customers, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Alameda’s lenders, conspiracy to commit securities fraud against FTX’s investors, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud against FTX’s customers and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
In March, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison and three years of supervised release. He also ordered the 32-year-old to pay $11 billion in forfeiture. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.

This Solana Presale Has Raised Over $2.5M - Could it be the Next BOME?


This article was paid for*
The Solana meme coin circuit is deeply entrenched within 2024’s crypto bull rally, and a new presale is vying for the center stage after raising over $2.5 million so far.
Following the blueprint by Solana sensation Book of Meme, the newly launched Sealana is set to take the market by storm.
BOME made millionaires, but Sealana has exceeded its presale success
For those interested in meme coin culture, Book of Meme is one of 2024’s most iconic cryptocurrencies.
After rising from nothingness, the presale shocked the market by becoming the fastest cryptocurrency to reach a $1 billion market cap.

Initially launching as a presale, investors had the chance to buy in before the token launched on exchanges. 
The biggest BOME presale investor spent $72K, and many others made 4- and 5-figure purchases.
However, nobody was expecting the life-changing returns that followed.
While BOME began as an unassuming meme coin presale, its exchange launch ignited astronomical success. BOME exploded and became the fastest cryptocurrency to reach a $1 billion market cap.
The project also secured a Binance listing within two days of launching.
And those presale investors? Well, they made generational wealth.
Blockchain analytics account LookOnChain reported how the biggest BOME presale investor, sundayfunday.sol, turned $72K into over $30 million in just three days.

Indeed, this was not the only investor to garner absurd gains from the Book of Meme presale. The presale raised over $2 million, so it is apparent that many traders got rich from BOME.
However, with BOME market cap at a tidy $873 million today, the time to make outsized gains has passed, and traders are scouring for the next big Solana meme coin.
Enter Sealana. 
Not only has Sealana outperformed Book of Meme’s presale total raise, with over $2.5 million already in the bag, but the project is being embraced for its cultural references and relatability to Solana meme coin degens.
Sealana’s South Park-esque chronicles make it unlike any other meme coin
Inspired by South Park, Sealana features a hilarious backstory and unapologetic social media content, causing a buzz among degen Solana traders.
With the Solana blockchain known as crypto’s Wild West, Sealana’s foul-mouthed antics fit right in.

Meanwhile, its website provides some background on Sealana, explaining that he is a seal who lives in his mom’s basement, trading meme coins and living off canned tuna and chips. He is pursuing meme coin riches and hopes to buy a new Lambo one day.
Solana traders live and breathe this rags-to-riches mentality, so it is no wonder that the presale is so popular.
The project’s witty narrative has also caught the eye of leading analysts, with Jacob Bury speculating it could 10x after launching on exchanges.

Adding to the excitement, the broader Solana ecosystem is gearing for a massive boost, with TradFi players set to move in.
The potential Solana ETFs is good news for Sealana  
After the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to Ethereum spot ETFs this week, the forward-looking market immediately began speculating on the next big crypto narrative.
The launch of ETH ETFs opens the floodgates to new altcoin ETFs, and analysts from CNBC suggest that Solana could be next in line.
Market commentator Symbiote commented that Solana ecosystem plays could skyrocket as a result.

Given Sealana’s accelerating momentum, this could prove massively beneficial for the seal-themed meme coin.
But while the future looks bright for Sealana, the team has not announced a hard cap, so the presale could end anytime.
As such, potential investors should act fast to avoid missing out.

This Altcoin Ignored the SEC's Warning: Voting Begins to Distribute Fees to Token Holders - Bitcoin Sistemi


Despite receiving a warning from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Uniswap Foundation is continuing with its plans. The foundation announced on May 31 that it will conduct on-chain voting and prepare the infrastructure for autonomous fee collection and distribution.
The on-chain voting, which will go live next Friday, is part of a proposal that would require additional voting to activate fees on Uniswap V3 pools. UNI token holders who wish to participate in this voting are advised to delegate their cryptocurrencies before the specified date.



Authored by Uniswap Foundation leader Erin Koen, the proposal proposes an upgrade that would reward UNI token holders who stake their tokens and delegate their staked tokens. These people will be able to receive some of the fee income of the protocol. According to data, the protocol has collected a staggering $3.3 billion in fees since its inception.
The foundation also proposes a new mechanism for future voting. This mechanism aims to make fee adjustments more dynamic, reduce the burden on Uniswap Management and maintain the reliable neutrality of the protocol.

YouTube Sleuth Coffeezilla Exposes Rabbit AI's Alleged $6M NFT Scam and Overhyped Products



                    

YouTube investigator Stephen Findeisen, better known as “Coffeezilla,” has accused the AI company Rabbit of orchestrating an NFT scam and attempting to cover it up.



On May 21, Findeisen published a video on his Coffeezilla channel, revealing Rabbit AI’s involvement in NFTs. 




He pointed out that the company, previously called Cyber Manufacture Co., had raised $6 million for an NFT project called Gama.



Years later, Rabbit AI’s founder and CEO, Jesse Lyu, tried to distance the company from its crypto past. 



Findeisen highlighted Lyu’s statements on Discord, where Lyu asserted that the company would “never touch crypto” again.




Cointelegraph has reached out to Rabbit for comments.



Lyu explained that Gama was just a “fun little project” he participated in during the COVID-19 pandemic and that he left the project once the game was open-sourced. 



However, Findeisen unveiled recordings of Lyu discussing ambitious plans for the NFT project. In these recordings, Lyu talked about investing millions to make Gama “a next-level experience.”

He stated:“NFTs are only just the beginning […] After NFTs, we have these huge groundbreaking ideas about Gamaverse, and then after that, we have these again, huge, groundbreaking ideas about clean energy versus Gama Coin.”



Findeisen questioned where the $6 million raised for the Gama project went, given Lyu’s grand promises. 



According to Coffeezilla, the company claimed that the funds were solely used for the NFT project.



Despite this, Coffeezilla argued that Rabbit should still be scrutinized, as it is built on the remnants of the Gama project. He also criticized the company’s viral R1 product, stating:



“So many of the promises of Gama didn’t happen. 



“This is relevant to the R1 not just because this project is built on the skeleton of that scam project, it’s also because the R1 is overhyped in a similar way.”



In addition to Findeisen, others have criticized Rabbit’s R1 product as an “AI grift.” 



On January 14, WeGPT founder and CEO Josh Olin claimed on X that Rabbit’s project was a “scam.” 



Olin described the company’s product as a quick cash grab aimed at deceiving investors.

Bitcoin To Hit $1 Million In Next 10 To 18 Months, Says Crypto Analyst: 'We're Still So Early In The Bitcoin Story' - Benzinga

Jack Mallers, CEO of the Bitcoin wallet and payments app Strike, forecasts that Bitcoin BTC/USD could achieve a seven-figure valuation, potentially reaching up to $1 million.What Happened: In an interview with "The Pomp Podcast" host Anthony Pompliano, Mallers stated that Bitcoin's price could increase between 260% and 1,357% within the next 10 to 18 months.“I think we’re still so early in the Bitcoin story. I’m publicly on record saying I think Bitcoin will hit $250,000 to $1 million in this cycle. So now I’m speaking the next 10 to 18 months,” he said. Mallers believes the current price of Bitcoin, $68,653, is just the beginning. Mallers attributes this potential surge to the U.S. government's need to print more money to manage its $34.577 trillion debt.“I think people would be willing to pay $250,000 for a Bitcoin based on the mess that I think … I mean, there’s a massive hole and a loss that must be realized. That loss is going to come through debasing the currency. Asset prices are going to go up. What is the best asset and the best-performing asset? What’s the best money in human history? And so I think that has to be accurately priced,” Mallers added. Also Read: Crypto Analyst Foresees Upswing In Bitcoin's Value Before Major PlungeHe argued that this currency debasement will drive Bitcoin's value up significantly.Mallers also mentioned that the focus should not be on the cost of capital but on the amount of capital being printed despite interest rates being 5.5%. “People are too fixated on the cost of capital regarding rates. They need to be more fixated on the amount of capital, which is they’re still printing dollars. It doesn’t matter that rates are at 5.5% — it’s still inflationary," he said. Why It Matters: The prediction by Jack Mallers comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is already experiencing significant bullish sentiments.Earlier this year, a crypto analyst predicted a 119% surge in Bitcoin, citing the promise of a spot ETF and the upcoming halving event. This analyst emphasized the increased visible demand for Bitcoin, which could further bolster its price.Additionally, another forecast projected a monumental Bitcoin rally by 2026. This long-term outlook aligns with Mallers' short-term prediction, suggesting a sustained upward trend for Bitcoin. Now Read: Latest Bitcoin Halving Could Cost Miners Billions Of Dollars In Revenue: ReportThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock

Solana Vs. XRP ETF: Expert Predicts Which One Will Be Approved First | Bitcoinist.com


								Recent developments with the Spot Ethereum ETFs have led to discussions about which crypto token could have its own ETF next. Solana (SOL) and XRP ETFs have taken center stage, with experts deliberating which one will come first. 
Expert Says A Solana ETF Is Next
Brian Kelly, founder of digital assets investment firm BKCM, mentioned during an interview on CNBC that Solana is probably the next crypto token to get its own ETF. He explained that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are the ‘Big 3’ for this cycle, making it likely that Solana is next since the two foremost crypto tokens already have their respective funds.

Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also seemed to agree with Kelly, stating that he believes a SOL ETF see more demand than other digital assets besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, he claimed a SOL ETF would launch within a few years of getting a CFTC-regulated futures market. 
Seyffart added that Congress and market structure bills like the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) bill will speed up a SOL ETF launch. Congress’ intervention is necessary, considering the Commission has outrightly labeled Solana security in the lawsuit against Coinbase and Kraken. 
Seyffart noted that this security label could make the potential approval of a SOL ETF a “very rocky road.” This issue could be a stumbling block to several other crypto tokens since Bitcoin and Ethereum appear to be the only tokens the SEC doesn’t consider securities.
This seems to be why Ark Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood once predicted that there will only likely be Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs in the US. She added that it would be surprising to see “anything but Bitcoin and Ether being approved by the SEC,”
The Likelihood Of An XRP ETF
Market experts have also discussed the likelihood of an XRP launching soon. CoinShares’ head of product, Townsend Lansing, previously mentioned that the SEC must agree that XRP isn’t a security before an XRP ETF can launch. Van Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson remarked that the likelihood of the Commission approving this fund was “very slim.”

Seyffart has also discussed the possibility of an XRP ETF launching soon. Like what he said about a SOL ETF, he mentioned that XRP futures must be traded on a regulated exchange like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Meanwhile, he believes that the SEC’s case against Ripple is another reason why XRP ETF cannot happen this year. 
The SEC’s case against Ripple seems to be another reason a SOL ETF could launch before an XRP ETF. However, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse is confident that XRP will be among the crypto assets that will have its ETF when the SEC is ready to approve other crypto funds, noting that XRP and Bitcoin are the only crypto tokens with regulatory clarity.

Buy signal for 2 oversold cryptocurrencies this week


    As the cryptocurrency market begins to recover from a steep downturn, there is a noticeable shift in sentiment, with increasing momentum signaling a potential upswing.



Following a period marked by fear and significant sell-offs, the market is gradually trending upward, unveiling new opportunities for investors.



According to CoinGlass, the average Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 54.56. This level indicates more balanced trading conditions, suggesting that the market is neither overly bullish nor bearish.







Such stability provides fertile ground for identifying potential buying opportunities, particularly in assets that have recently dipped into oversold territories.



Utilizing the 24-hour RSI heatmap from CoinGlass’s momentum indicator, Finbold has identified these opportunities, highlighting assets that are now poised for recovery after hitting recent lows. 



TRON (TRX)



In this context, TRON (TRX) emerges as a noteworthy candidate for investment. Currently priced at $0.11349, TRX has recently experienced a slight decline of 0.97%. Its RSI readings across different time frames indicate that it has been significantly oversold.



Crypto market RSI heatmap, TRX. Source: CoinGlass



Specifically, the RSI is at 29.54 for the 4-hour chart, 27.16 for the 12-hour, and 34.73 for the 24-hour. These indicators hint at a potential bottoming out, making TRX a prime candidate for a “buy the dip” strategy as the market sentiment begins to improve.



Bluzelle (BLZ) 



Similarly, Bluzelle (BLZ) presents an intriguing opportunity. Currently priced at $0.267 with a recent increase of 3.9%, BLZ is showing early signs of recovery. 



Crypto market RSI heatmap, BLZ. Source: CoinGlass



The RSI values for BLZ—39.01 for 4 hours, 33.1 for 12 hours, and 30.03 for 24 hours—suggest that it, too, is emerging from oversold conditions. This positioning indicates that BLZ might be starting to align with the broader market’s tentative recovery, potentially leading to substantial price corrections upward.



Nevertheless, having an oversold RSI status does not guarantee price recovery. Understanding this extreme-weakness indicator is vital for investors looking for buy signals. 



Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets, and everything can change in the blink of an eye.

Worldcoin Ordered to Halt Operations in Hong Kong After Privacy Law Violation



                    

Hong Kong’s Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) has concluded that the Worldcoin project violated the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) in Hong Kong.



On May 22, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung Lai-ling issued an enforcement notice to Worldcoin, ordering an immediate halt to all operations in Hong Kong involving the scanning and collecting of iris and facial images using iris scanning devices.




The PCPD launched its investigation into Worldcoin in January 2024 to assess whether its identity verification methods posed significant risks to personal data privacy and contravened the PDPO. 



Between December 2023 and January 2024, the PCPD conducted ten covert visits to six premises involved in the Worldcoin project.



The PCPD found that collecting face images was unnecessary for verifying the humanness of participants since operators could perform this verification in person at the locations.




Thus, the collection of face images was deemed an unnecessary step.



Moreover, the PCPD highlighted that Worldcoin failed to provide adequate information, preventing participants from making informed decisions and giving genuine consent. 



The privacy notice was not available in Chinese, leaving non-English speaking participants unaware of the project’s policies, practices, terms, and conditions.

The PCPD stated:



“[…] the iris scanning device operators at the operating locations also did not offer any explanation or confirmed the participants’ understanding of the aforesaid documents.



They also did not inform the participants the possible risks pertaining to their disclosure of biometric data, nor answered their questions.”



The PCPD determined that under these conditions, the collection of face and iris images was unfair and unlawful, violating data protection principles. 



Furthermore, Worldcoin’s retention of sensitive biometric data for up to 10 years solely for AI model training, including face and iris images, was deemed unjustified.



Worldcoin confirmed that 8,302 individuals had their faces and irises scanned for verification during its operation in Hong Kong.



The project, announced in 2021, saw over two million people sign up before its official launch in July 2023. 



Worldcoin has faced regulatory scrutiny in many countries over privacy concerns, leading to the suspension of services in Kenya and the halting of iris scans in India.

China Sells $48,900,000,000 in US Treasuries in One Quarter, Analyst Says 'Clear Intention' To Dump US Dollar Holdings on Display - The Daily Hodl


								The world’s second-largest economy is steadily unloading billions of dollars in US Treasuries.
New data from the US Treasury Department shows China pared its Treasury holdings from $816.3 billion in December of last year to $767.4 billion in March.










That’s a quarterly decrease of $48.90 billion.
The chief Asia foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Stephen Chiu, says a clear trend is underway.
“As China is selling both despite the fact that we are closer to a Fed rate-cut cycle, there should be a clear intention of diversifying away from US dollar holdings.”
The drop in China’s ownership of US bonds comes as former International Monetary Fund (IMF) deputy director Desmond Lachman warns that a fresh trade war between the two largest economies is brewing.
In a post on the Washington-based think tank American Enterprise Institute, Lachman says that both President Biden and former President Trump are drumming up “punitive import tariffs” against China.
“In addition to a 100% import tariff on Chinese electrical vehicles, Biden announced that the U.S. will triple import tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, and double import tariffs on Chinese semiconductors and solar cells.
Not to be outdone, former President Donald Trump is indicating that if he is elected again as president, he will increase tariffs on Chinese electrical vehicles to 200% and will impose a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports.”
According to Lachman, the increased import tariffs will likely prompt China to retaliate, leading to an escalation that would hurt both nations. Should a full-blown trade war materialize, Lachman warns that it will add inflationary pressure in the US as Chinese companies increase prices to cover the additional costs of entering the US market.
“The Federal Reserve is already finding inflation unexpectedly resistant to its interest-rate increases. A new trade war would only further delay the start of a Fed rate-cutting cycle, depriving the country of a boost to growth.”

Fake Satoshi Nakamoto Defeated - Bitcoin Whitepaper is Back on the Website - Bitcoin Sistemi


The Bitcoin whitepaper has made a successful return to the Bitcoin.org website, marking the end of the legal process previously involving Craig Wright, who claimed to be BTC founder Satoshi Nakamoto.
In 2021, Wright's website was forced to remove the PDF version of the whitepaper after a lawsuit was filed against Cøbra, the anonymous group that runs the site, for copyright infringement. But Wright's victory was undermined by the complete debunking of his claims that he was Satoshi and, by extension, that he wrote the white paper.


The return of the Bitcoin whitepaper was announced by Bitcoin.org administrator Hennadii Stepanov, who shared a link to the PDF in question on the X platform.

Legal proceedings initiated by Wright required Cøbra to appear in court hearings threatening to expose his anonymity. As a result of Cøbra choosing not to attend these hearings, Wright won the case by default and Cøbra was ordered to pay £35,000 ($40,100) towards Wright's legal costs.





As a result of the case, Bitcoin.org was forced to stop making the Bitcoin whitepaper available to users in the UK. Despite these issues, numerous publishers have come together to share the Bitcoin whitepaper in a collective act of protest. The cryptocurrency division of Square, Jack Dorsey's company, and various governments, including the United States, Estonia and Colombia, published the document on their platforms.

Suspected Insider Whale Bought More Than Half Of This Altcoin's Total Supply - Bitcoin Sistemi


Data shared by cryptocurrency analysis company Lookonchain shows that an inside whale made a large purchase in a newly launched memecoin.
According to the data, the insider in question created a completely new cryptocurrency wallet and used the $230,000 Solana coin to purchase 63.2% of the total supply of the memecoin called CAT as soon as it was released.


Then, after the price of the token increased extremely rapidly, he sold some of his CAT tokens for $5 million.

On the other hand, another whale seems to have purchased a large amount of this token. A cryptocurrency wallet thought to belong to the market-making company Wintermute used $301,000 worth of Solana tokens to buy CAT tokens, and at the time of this writing, they have an unrealized profit of $886,000.





At the time of writing this article, CAT's total market value has reached up to 25 million dollars. However, memecoins are known to be extremely volatile and risky assets and do not have any intrinsic value other than the expectation of price growth.

TON's road to $10 - Toncoin holders should hope these updates pan out - AMBCrypto



Failure of TON holders to exit the market at $6.39 could spur a hike to $7.50
Network activity dropped, but external developments pointed to possible double-digit gains

21% of Toncoin’s [TON] holders are sitting at the same price where they purchased the token, indicating that they are at make or mark point right now. Additionally, further assessment of IntoTheBlock’s data revealed that 29% of all holders have accumulated TON over the last 30 days.
This ratio was more than those who bought the cryptocurrency one year ago. In the last 30 days, TON’s price has risen by 22.09%, meaning that some addresses that bought the token recently are now in profit.
However, the last seven days have not been palatable for Toncoin. This, because the price dropped by 1.91%. In light of the token’s performance this year, holders at the breakeven point might decide not to sell though.
The reason is that a chunk of them might be part of the 29% who purchased the token over the past month. Especially since as AMBCrypto has preciously reported, TON’s price has been on a good run this year.
Source: IntoTheBlock
Things are working in TON’s favor
As such, it is expected that the price could rise higher on the charts. With this forecast, it is possible that the $6.39-level, which was Toncoin’s price at press time, could act as support for the token.
If this is the case, and bears fail to neutralize the defense, TON could hike to $7.50. However, AMBCrypto is not the only party expecting this move.
Shiveen Moodley, a tokenomics researcher, also shared this projection. For Moodley, the focus was on the long-term prospect of the project using TON’s performance against other top cryptocurrencies.
Source: CryptoQuant
His opinion and the aforementioned aligned with AMBCrypto’s report about Toncoin’s correlation with Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH].
Will the price hit $10?
According to him, Toncoin’s supply, active userbase, and links with Telegram could help the token hit more upside. He noted in his analysis via CryptoQuant that,
“Currently, with a supply of 5 billion coins and an inflation rate of 2 percent, leading to an estimated 10 billion coins in 35 years steady price increases are likely in the long run.”
On 23 May, Telegram disclosed that it would release a digital currency for payments on its platform. Considering the social media platform’s links with Toncoin, there are speculations that the token might be involved.
If so, activity on the network, as well as demand for the token, might skyrocket. Should this be the case, it might only take a short period for TON to hit $10.
However, data from Santiment showed that activity on the Toncoin network had instead fallen. At press time, the 24-hour active addresses were down to 356 too.

This was around the same spot the metric was at before the price ran to $7.45 in May. While the token might not replicate the same move, a hike in network activity could set the stage for TON’s rally.
Before that, however, the price might swing between $5.90 and $6.40 on the charts.

Crypto Exchange Giant OKX To Pull Trading Services From Hong Kong at the End of the Month - The Daily Hodl


								The crypto exchange giant OKX will shutter its digital asset trading services in Hong Kong at the end of the month.
OKX says it decided to pull its application for a virtual asset trading platform license in Hong Kong “after careful consideration of the business development prospects.”










The exchange will stop providing trading services on May 31st, though its customers will still be able to make withdrawals. OKX’s web3 self-hosted wallet will also continue to provide services to customers.
OKX is one of ten crypto exchanges that have withdrawn their trading platform license applications in the special administrative region.
The Justin Sun-affiliated trading giant HTX also pulled its application in late February. The Seychelles-headquartered exchange reapplied shortly afterward but withdrew its application again earlier this month, according to a report from the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The special administrative region’s financial regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), has so far licensed only two crypto trading platforms, though 18 other exchanges are awaiting decisions on their applications.
Hong Kong launched new crypto exchange regulations last June. Some digital asset stakeholders have argued they are a burden for trading platforms, according to an SCMP report.
OKX, which is also headquartered in the Seychelles, is currently the third-largest crypto exchange by 24-hour trading volume, behind only Binance and Bybit, according to CoinGecko.

Ethereum price prediction for June 1 as whales move $118 million ETH


    Ethereum (ETH) is looking to reclaim the $4,000 mark after receiving a major boost from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Excitingly, Ethereum investors are anticipating a potential surge in the cryptocurrency’s value following the U.S. regulator’s approval of a series of first-spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 



Notably, there is a buzz of speculation about the possibility of Ethereum mirroring the price movement of Bitcoin (BTC), which experienced a significant rally after the approval of a similar product. 







Amid the rollout of the ETFs, Ethereum is witnessing significant whale activity. According to data shared by Whale Alert, three major transfers were observed from unknown wallets to the crypto exchange OKEx on May 25. 



The transactions involved 9,019 ETH (approximately $33,776,166), 22,429 ETH (valued at around $83,993,750), and 26,925 ETH (worth about $100,832,790), all moving to the exchange.

These transfers, totaling 58,373 ETH and equating to $118,602,706, have led to speculation regarding the impact on the valuation of the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap.



ETH price prediction 



Overall, significant movement of such large sums into exchanges could suggest an anticipation of heightened trading activity. Historically, large transfers to exchanges have sometimes preceded major price actions, either due to impending sell-offs or strategic positioning for significant market events.



To gather insights into how Ethereum is likely to trade in the coming days, Finbold turned to CoinCodex, leveraging its AI-powered machine-learning algorithms. According to CoinCodex’s projections, Ethereum is expected to trade at $3,813 on June 1, representing an increase of almost 2% from the current price.

Notably, the price projection could set the stage for Ethereum to target new highs following the ETF approval. 



For instance, crypto analyst RLinda suggested in a TradingView post on May 24 that the approval could act as a bullish catalyst. According to RLinda, if Ethereum consolidates above $3,827 and surpasses $4,095, it will likely target a new record high.



However, RLinda also cautioned that history might repeat itself, similar to the pattern observed with Bitcoin after the approval of BTC ETFs. Market makers could create a trap by causing a quick drop in price before an upward movement.



Ethereum price analysis



By press time, Ethereum was trading at $3,741. On the weekly chart, ETH has rallied by over 20%.

Meanwhile, the ETF approval acting as a catalyst for attracting institutional investors should encourage ETH bulls to work harder to sustain the price above $3,500.

Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) Will Rally 14,000% Ahead of Bitrue Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KIMCRYPT will be listed on Bitrue, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kim Jong Crypto.



Currently, Kim Jong Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KIMCRYPT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kim Jong Crypto by entering its contract address – DY225ypZiG3aYkZnzaXJYDGtUz76uNuQiJLMzs6qGAZ5 – in the receiving field.




KIMCRYPT currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Uniswap (UNI) Jumps 20% After Fee Proposal


The Uniswap Foundation announced that on-chain voting for a proposal to establish its new fee mechanism will occur by May 31.
This announcement has boosted the value of the network’s native token, UNI, by over 20%.
Uniswap’s New Fee Mechanism and Its Implications

The Uniswap Foundation outlined a crucial step towards implementing autonomous fee collection and distribution in Uniswap V3 pools.

“If passed, this proposal would transfer ownership of the mainnet UniswapV3Factory to a newly deployed instance of V3FactoryOwner. This vote will not turn on fees; that will be accomplished in a future proposal,” the Foundation explained.

In February, the Uniswap Foundation proposed a fee reward mechanism for UNI token holders to boost governance participation. Initial responses showed strong support for the proposal despite potential legal challenges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the DeFi protocol.
Traditionally, all fees generated by Uniswap went to liquidity providers (LPs) who supplied assets to the platform. The new proposal plans to distribute protocol fees among staked and delegated UNI token holders. Therefore incentivizing active participation within its ecosystem.
According to CryptoFees, Uniswap earned approximately $3.2 million in fees in the past 24 hours, averaging $3.4 million over the last week. The protocol handles roughly 30% of total trades in the decentralized finance sector.

In a parallel development, the Uniswap Foundation disclosed holding $41.41 million in fiat and stablecoins and 730,000 UNI tokens as of the end of the first quarter. During this period, the Foundation committed $4.34 million in new grants and disbursed $2.79 million in previously committed grants.

“The fiat (USD) cash and stables are to be used for grant making and operating activities and the UNI for employee token awards,” the Foundation remarked.

Marathon Digital to Use Kenya's Green Energy for Bitcoin Mining


Marathon Digital, a Bitcoin mining firm, signed an $80 million agreement with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum to boost the country’s renewable energy infrastructure.
Market observers explained that the partnership supports Marathon’s strategy to diversify its operations as mining difficulty increases.
Marathon to Build Green Data Centers in Kenya

Marathon Digital plans to invest over $80 million in developing renewable energy data centers. Kenya’s energy grid is approximately 80% renewable, leveraging wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal sources, with geothermal energy being the largest contributor.
Furthermore, the initiative is expected to kickstart Marathon’s mining operations in Kenya, marking a significant step in its global expansion. Crypto environmentalist Daniel Batten praised the partnership, suggesting it points to the future of Bitcoin mining.

“Bitcoin mining’s future entails the development of more renewable energy that otherwise would have been unprofitable to monetize (geothermal in Kenya’s case). [This would] economically benefit entire nation-state [and ensure] geographic diversity of hashrate,” Batten noted.

Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel emphasized the strategic benefits of partnering with Kenya, highlighting the country’s pivotal role in the digital currency evolution.

“Kenya has a special spot in the history of digital currencies as it is the home of M-PESA, which in 2007 was one of the first ways for people in Kenya and now across Africa to transmit value digitally by using mobile phone credits. Today tens of millions of people across Africa use M-PESA for branchless money transfers,” Thiel stated.

The initiative comes amid rising energy costs and increasing network mining difficulty. This week, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty rose 1.48% at block height 844,704, reaching 84.38 trillion. The increasing difficulty shows that more miners are joining the network, coinciding with a spike hash rate.

How Solana's NFT market surpassed Ethereum's - A 30-day snapshot - AMBCrypto



Solana’s NFT buyers and sellers remained higher than those of Ethereum
SOL’s price gained bullish momentum, but the trend might change

Solana [SOL] has once again dominated its competitors like Ethereum [ETH] in the NFT space over the past month. Now, while this seems optimistic at first glance, there might just be more to the story. Let’s have a look at how both of these NFT giants fared against each other.
Solana beats Ethereum
Coin98 recently shared a tweet underlining the latest datasets from the NFT ecosystem. According to the same, Solana is now ranked #1 on the list of blockchains in terms of the most NFTs created in the last 30 days. Apart from Solana, Polygon and Base also made it to the top three on the same list. 
Here, what is also worth mentioning is that Ethereum took the 10th spot on the list. While 32 million NFTs were created on Solana, only 1 million NFTs were created on Ethereum. This gave SOL a whopping lead of 31 million. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of DappRadar’s data revealed that STEPN, SMB Gen2, and Mad Lads were the top NFT collections on Solana last month. Oddly enough, y00ts and DeGods, two projects that recently migrated to Solana, couldn’t make it to the top 5. 
While the aforementioned datasets imply one thing, a look at the bigger picture might imply something different entirely. For instance, AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoSlam’s data revealed that while Solana’s monthly NFT sales volume was merely $99 million, Ethereum’s sales volume stood at $193 million. 
Nonetheless, Solana’s number of NFT buyers and sellers remained significantly higher than that of Ethereum.

SOL turns bullish 
While Solana’s performance in the NFT space remained positive, SOL’s price action once again turned bullish. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL’s price surged by over 2.5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $169.30 with a market capitalization of over $76 billion. 
Thanks to the latest price uptick, the token’s weighted sentiment hiked too. This meant that bullish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market. Additionally, its social volume also appreciated on the charts, highlighting SOL’s popularity.

However, this trend might not last as a key derivatives market indicator flashed bearish signals at press time. Coinglass’ data revealed that Solana’s long/short ratio fell over the last 24 hours.

Ethereum’s Balance on Exchanges Spikes Amid Possible Sell-the-News Event, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum’s (ETH) balance on crypto exchange platforms is spiking amid a possible sell-the-news event.
In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 62,700 followers on the social media platform X that over the last two weeks, hundreds of thousands of ETH have been transferred to wallets linked to crypto exchanges.










“Looking at Ethereum’s balance on exchanges reveals a spike in the tokens available to sell. Over the last two weeks, over 242,000 ETH have moved to cryptocurrency exchange wallets. This indicates increased trading activity on exchanges that can contribute to price volatility.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
According to Martinez, the massive ETH transfers are happening as a key signal – the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator – is flashing a sell signal on the leading smart contract platform’s daily chart, hinting at the possibility of a sell-the-news event.
 “The increasing ETH deposits to cryptocurrency exchange wallets hint at the possibility of a sell-off or a spike in profit-taking. Meanwhile, the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator presents a sell signal on Ethereum’s daily chart. 
The current green nine candlesticks on the daily chart suggests that a spike in selling pressure could see ETH retrace for one to four daily candlesticks or even start a new downward countdown phase before the uptrend resumes.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
The TD Sequential Indicator is generally used to predict potential trend reversals for assets based on their previous closings.
Martinez concludes by saying that Ethereum has a path toward the $5,000 price level if it prints a daily close above $4,170.
“The most important resistance barrier for Ethereum is between $3,940 and $4,054. Here, over 1.16 million addresses had previously purchased around 574,660 ETH. 
If ETH overcomes this hurdle and prints a daily candlestick close above $4,170, the bearish outlook will be invalidated. This could result in a new upward countdown phase toward $5,000.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Earlier this week, proposals to create ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) cleared a key regulatory hurdle, causing the Ethereum ecosystem to rise.
Ethereum is trading for $3,732 at time of writing, a 2.31% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) Will Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Other Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because WIZPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Wizard Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Wizard Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



Wizard Pepe launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Wizard Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Wizard Pepe by entering its contract address – AJM9tnhfGz9xezv1rTjspoTug3YVpcmrp3gJ9FMDEEYj – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WIZPEPE.

Shiba Inu on the Verge of 600% Rally? Analyst Weighs In


																Shiba Inu, known as the “Dogecoin Killer,” is eagerly anticipating a significant price leap. Market analyst Ashish has sparked excitement with a bold prediction: a 600% surge that could catapult the meme coin to an impressive $0.000075.

	Related Reading


This bullish forecast comes after what Ashish describes as a nearly two-year-long slumber within a consolidation pattern. December 2023 saw Shiba Inu finally break free from this price purgatory, breaching a crucial resistance trendline. The breakout ignited a rally that culminated in a 370% surge, reaching a 2024 high of $0.000045 in early March.
However, the party wasn’t meant to last. A correction ensued, prompting Ashish to establish strategic buying zones between $0.000022 and $0.000025.

Shiba Inu: Enter The Flag Pattern
Ashish’s crystal ball sees a bullish flag pattern emerging on the 1-hour chart, hinting at a potential “second leg up.” This technical indicator suggests a period of consolidation following a sharp price increase, often acting as a precursor to another upward movement.
Despite a slight price dip today, Shiba Inu appears to have room for growth. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at nearly 48, indicating that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. This neutral territory suggests potential for upward movement, aligning with Ashish’s prediction of a second leg up.

SHIB Price Forecast
Meanwhile, CoinCodex’s current Shiba Inu price prediction forecasts a rise of 220%, potentially reaching $0.00008089 by June 24, 2024. CoinCodex’s technical indicators currently show a Neutral sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 76, indicating Extreme Greed. Over the past 30 days, Shiba Inu has seen 12 out of 30 green days (40%) with a price volatility of 4.40%.
Given these metrics, it’s clear that Shiba Inu’s market behavior is capturing significant investor interest. The Extreme Greed reading on the Fear & Greed Index suggests a high level of enthusiasm, which, while positive for potential price gains, also warrants caution due to the possibility of rapid sentiment shifts.

The coin’s moderate volatility and the occurrence of green days indicate a steady, albeit unpredictable, upward momentum. This combination of factors makes Shiba Inu a fascinating asset to watch in the coming months.

	Related Reading


As of today, the overall sentiment for the Shiba Inu price prediction is neutral. This assessment is supported by technical analysis indicators, where 20 indicators are showing bullish signals, while eight are signaling bearish trends.
This balanced sentiment reflects the inherent volatility and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. The fact that a significant number of indicators are bullish suggests there is optimism about Shiba Inu’s short-term potential, possibly driven by recent market activities or positive news.

BNB Forms Bullish Flag Pattern On 1-Day Chart - What's Next? | Bitcoinist.com


								After a rally to create an all-time high, the price of Binance Coin (BNB) has been in a consolidation zone. During this consolidation, BNB’s price has managed to form a bullish triangle flag above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 1-day timeframe.
Currently, the price of Binance coin is moving between the $647 resistance level and the $498 support level building momentum for a bullish breakout with a total capitalization of $89,412,113,586, which is about 1.70% up in the last 24 hours, and a trading volume of $1,535,069,940, over 37% down in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, BNB’s price was trading around $604 above the 100-day simple moving average, about 0.65% up in the last 24 hours.
BNB Technical Analysis Using Key Indicators
Technically looking at the digital asset’s price chart in the 1-day timeframe, it can observed that the price is trading above the 100-day moving average. This could be an indication that BNB might move upward, therefore, suggesting that it could break above the upper base of the bullish triangle for an upward movement.

The signal line of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) having moved above and below the zero line is currently trending above the zero line. This formation of the RSI indicator suggests that the price might go bullish and break above the upper base of the bullish triangle.
The Williams alligator indicator also suggests that the price might move upward as both the alligator teeth and jaw are above the alligator lip, while the price is above the indicator. With this formation, it can be suggested that BNB’s price might rally above the bullish triangle.

Potential Price Results 
Finally, if the price of BNB breaks above the bullish triangle, it might move to break the previous high of $647, and if it breaks this level, the price might move even higher to create a new all-time high.
If the crypto asset fails to break above the bullish triangle, it might move downward and break below the bullish triangle and might even move further toward the $498 support level. Should it break this level it might undergo a deeper correction to test the $384 support level.

US Bitcoin spot ETFs attract $2 billion in net inflows over two weeks - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Investors have poured around $2 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the past two weeks, according to data from Farside. These funds also recorded a tenth consecutive day of net inflows.This week alone, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $1 billion in inflows, with Thursday recording the largest daily inflow of around $305 million.BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), led the pack with nearly $720 million in weekly inflows. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) took the second spot with around $227 million.US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows – May 13-24 – FarsideThe order was different last week when FBTC surpassed IBIT in terms of weekly inflows. Data shows that FBTC recorded around $344 million in inflows from May 13 to 17 while IBIT saw approximately $132 million.With over 284,525 BTC in its holdings, IBIT is just $300 million away from surpassing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which currently holds 289 BTC, valued at $19.9 billion. This calculation is based on Bitcoin (BTC) being worth $69,100 as of the writing, according to CoinGecko. IBIT is well on track to become the largest Bitcoin ETF.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price moved in the same direction with strong ETF inflows in the last two weeks.On May 24, this week’s final trading day, the price soared to $69,000, up around 13% over the past two weeks. Bitcoin is now only 6% away from its record high of $73,700, established in March.Bitcoin had stagnated after the fourth halving, which analyst Rekt Capital pointed out as the post-halving “danger zone” characterized by heightened volatility. He noted last week, however, that the selling pressure was weakening; Bitcoin was entering a phase of accumulation.In addition to Bitcoin ETFs, the week’s spotlight was on the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETF filings. These ETFs still need S-1 form approval to begin trading, which ETF experts believe will take weeks to months. However, in essence, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs indicates that the launch of these funds is imminent.Positive developments prior to the approval had factored into the surge in Ethereum’s price (ETH). On Monday, ETH jumped 8% on news that approval odds were raised to 75%. Rally extended during the day with a broader market upswing. At press time, ETH is trading at around $3,700, up over 20% over the past seven days.

Apple Denies Monopoly Claims, Asserts Strong Competition in Response to U.S. Antitrust Lawsuit



                    

Apple has denied being a “monopolist” and insisted it faces “fierce competition” in the tech industry, according to a letter previewing its defense against a U.S. antitrust lawsuit.



In a letter dated May 21 to New Jersey federal judge Julien Neals, Apple’s attorneys requested a conference before filing a motion to dismiss the case. 




They refuted U.S. allegations that Apple engaged in anticompetitive practices by restricting third-party access to its platform and designing products to “lock in” users to purchasing iPhones.



The company argued that its purported anticompetitive behavior merely involved making independent decisions regarding the terms and conditions for third-party access to its proprietary platform.



In March, the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the firm of holding a smartphone monopoly. 




The suit claimed Apple restricted features of digital wallets and payments and enforced App Store rules that stifled competition.



Apple’s restrictions on fiat-only payments have also impacted the use of cryptocurrencies in iOS apps, making it financially unfeasible for crypto apps to offer in-app purchases due to a 30% fee known as the “Apple Tax.”



“Apple has opted to offer users a curated, secure, and reliable experience, in contrast to its competitors’ more open platforms,” the company stated.



Apple contended that the government did not “properly define the relevant market or establish that Apple has monopoly power in it,” and any alleged anticompetitive behavior occurred in different markets, such as digital wallets.

“These products all exist in their own separate markets with their own competitive dynamics, and the Government’s failure to define the proper market for those products is fatal,” Apple asserted.



Apple further argued that the U.S. claims were invalid, citing the Supreme Court’s stance that a company’s decisions regarding third-party dealings do not constitute exclusionary conduct.



The company also countered the DOJ’s claim of a smartphone monopoly, asserting it faces strong competition from Google and Samsung, noting Google has the most-used mobile OS and Samsung leads in global smartphone sales.



The U.S. failed to provide a factual link demonstrating that Apple’s design decisions corner smartphone buyers, Apple claimed.



“Someone unhappy with Apple’s limitations has every incentive to switch to competitor platforms that ostensibly do not have those limitations,” the company stated.



Following the DOJ’s March filing, an Apple spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the lawsuit could “set a dangerous precedent” and potentially allow the government to heavily influence the design of technology.

Historical Cycle Data Suggests Bitcoin Is Out Of The Danger Zone - Is Return To $73,000 Imminent? ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Bitcoin has officially left the post-halving “danger zone” where there is a possibility of a drop below its range low, and is now headed for reaccumulation, according to a popular crypto strategist citing historical data. 



The Bitcoin price recently experienced a retracement and currently hovers around $69,000 despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) eventual approval of several spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With Bitcoin escaping the danger zone, will the preeminent crypto resume its upward movement soon, or is a deeper correction still likely?



Bitcoin’s Sideways Trading To Continue For Several More Weeks: Analyst



On May 24, crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital posted an update on X, noting that the classic Bitcoin “danger zone” when the asset corrects after the quadrennial halving event is now behind us.



The post-halving danger zone has happened in prior market cycles when the asset corrects after a block subsidy halving, as per Rekt Capital. After the danger zone is over, Bitcoin historically enters a reaccumulation phase when it moves sideways within a tight range. This suggests that further pullbacks during the period of sideways chop that often follows the halving could still be on the cards.



“Since the Bitcoin post-halving ‘danger zone’ ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71,500. However, ~$71,500 is where the range high resistance of the macro re-accumulation range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from,” Rekt Capital wrote. “The consolidation continues and history suggests it will continue for several more weeks between $60,000 and $70,000.”

&nbsp



Rekt Capital further observed that based on historical behavior, Bitcoin is likely to remain range-bound below $70,000 until September.



“Historically, Bitcoin has always rejected from the range high on the first attempt at a breakout after the halving. Moreover, history suggests this re-accumulation should last much longer. Bitcoin tends to break out from these re-accumulation ranges only up to 160 days after the halving. That would translate to a Bitcoin breakout from the re-accumulation range only in September 2024.” 



Bitcoin Price At A Glance



In this cycle, Bitcoin dipped by over 20% from its $73,737 all-time high in mid-March to around $56,780 on May 1, marking the potential bottom of the post-halving danger zone period. 



On May 21, Bitcoin’s price briefly topped the psychologically important $70K mark; however, it swiftly dropped to around $67,000. BTC has now recovered and is trading back to $69,176 at press time, bolstering the return to the reaccumulation zone analysis.



Although the flagship crypto appears stuck in sideways price action, industry pundits remain uber-bullish. For instance, veteran crypto market commentator Tom Lee said his base case for Bitcoin by the end of the year is $150,000.

AVAX price prediction - Identifying the altcoin's targets for 2024 - AMBCrypto



AVAX seemed to be consolidating around $38, despite mixed market signals
Bullish sentiment on Binance and resistances at $50 and $55 could drive the price to $100

With the cryptocurrency market on fire over recent developments, Avalanche (AVAX) has caught the eye of many investors. Historically, AVAX has shown resilience, even when caught in the toughest bear markets. 
At press time, AVAX was valued at $38.49 after appreciating by 2.5% in just 24 hours. While this didn’t amount to significant gains, AVAX seemed to be doing much better than many of the market’s other altcoin. What does this mean for AVAX’s price performance through the rest of the year?
For starters, the current state of the AVAX market is marked by neutral sentiment, with a 42% rating on the Fear and Greed Index – A sign of balanced views among investors. 
Source: CFGI
While social sentiment was very positive at press time, other indicators like volatility, volume, and whale activity were negative – A sign of market uncertainty and reduced trading activity. Additionally, the dominance and search interest for AVAX has been fairly negative too, highlighting a lack of market control and lower general interest.
In fact, Coinglass’ data revealed a massive fall in trading volume by 61.37%, with the same recording figures of $341.19 million at the time of writing. On the trading side, the long/short ratio seemed relatively balanced across different platforms. This means traders aren’t sure what to do with AVAX right now. 
Source: Coinglass
Interestingly, however, the long/short ratio on Binance seemed to be considerably high at 2.8805. This could indicate a more bullish sentiment among individual traders on this one exchange.
It’s also worth noting that the six-month Avalanche chart highlighted a volatile trading pattern with several peaks and troughs. Simply put, a market responsive to broader market trends and specific ecosystem developments.
Over the past few months, AVAX has noted many price spikes followed by sharp corrections on the charts. Right now, the altcoin seems to be consolidating around the $38-level after a recent downtrend from higher levels seen in April.
Source: TradingView
If AVAX maintains support around the $35-level, there could be potential for northbound movement, especially when the bull run starts. Key resistance levels to watch would be around $50 and $55, levels that AVAX has tested multiple times in the past few months. 
A sustained break above these levels could signal strong bullish momentum, possibly driving the price towards the $80-mark or even $100 in the year’s third quarter.

Bitcoin and Ether Dip 3.5% Amid Institutional ETF Approval and Market Uncertainty



                    

Bitcoin and Ether both experienced a 3.5% drop on May 24, disappointing many who anticipated a market boost from a significant institutional development.



According to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, BTC hovered near $67,000, while ETH was priced at $3,670. 




The expected market reaction to the U.S. regulators’ approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) did not materialize. 



This landmark decision for the crypto industry marks a significant policy reversal by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 



However, the ETFs are not yet ready for trading, as additional preparations are required, which analysts suggest could take several weeks, pushing the potential launch to mid-June.




James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, ETF analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, discussed the possibility of a mid-June launch for the ETFs. 



Consequently, BTC/USD and ETH/USD did not see a significant upward movement, instead retracting from local highs as the daily trading session closed.



Market participants were particularly interested in the interplay between Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies.

Daan Crypto Trades, a well-known trader, highlighted the impact of Ethereum’s recent rally on Bitcoin’s market dominance.



“With the recent $ETH rally, we’ve seen #Bitcoin Dominance head back down,” he stated on X. 



“This has been in an up trend for about 1.5 years and if there’s anything that could reverse this trend it would be ETH leading on the back of an ETF being approved. 52% and 48% are the main levels.”



Other traders echoed this sentiment, suggesting that a shift in dominance could signal the beginning of an “altseason.” 



Bitcoin’s dominance reached 57% in mid-April, its highest in over two years, just before the block subsidy halving event.



Popular trader Skew analyzed potential support levels for BTC, identifying a key zone around $66,000. In his May 23 analysis, he noted significant bid liquidity on Binance, the largest global exchange.



“Seeing some initial spot demand around $66K – $65K, reaction is key as well to gauge absorption of sellers. Spot supply remains around current high $72K – $76K,” he confirmed.



Skew emphasized that the recent price movements were primarily driven by spot exchanges, particularly highlighting Binance and Coinbase, the largest U.S. trading platform.

$1,800,000,000,000 Bank Says Customers' Personal Information Has Been Exposed and Accessed in Mysterious Data Breach - The Daily Hodl


								One of the largest banks in the world says a data breach has exposed information on both its customers and employees.
In a statement, Santander says it’s aware of “unauthorized access” to a third-party database containing information on an undisclosed number of customers and employees.










The bank, which has $1.8 trillion in total assets and operates in ten markets across Europe and the Americas, says customers of Santander Chile, Spain and Uruguay are affected.
“Following an investigation, we have now confirmed that certain information relating to customers of Santander Chile, Spain and Uruguay, as well as all current and some former Santander employees of the group had been accessed. Customer data in all other Santander markets and businesses are not affected.”
So far, the bank has not disclosed which types of data have been exposed, noting only that “transactional data” and “credentials” are not in the open.
“No transactional data, nor any credentials that would allow transactions to take place on accounts are contained in the database, including online banking details and passwords. The bank’s operations and systems are not affected, so customers can continue to transact securely.
We apologise for the concern this will understandably cause and are proactively contacting affected customers and employees directly. We have also notified regulators and law enforcement and will continue to work closely with them.”
The bank says it has implemented measures to contain the incident, including “blocking the compromised access to the database and establishing additional fraud prevention controls to protect affected customers.”
Santander’s data breach comes weeks after JPMorgan Chase revealed a breach affecting 451,809 customers’ retirement records, which contain names, addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account numbers.
In that instance, Chase says there’s currently no indication that the data has been misused.

Incognito Market Owner Arrested After FBI Tracked Crypto Transactions


																A Taiwanese national has been charged with running Incognito Market, a darknet drug bazaar, and arrested after authorities tracked the platform’s transactions.
The platform has transacted more than $100 million in crypto through selling illegal narcotics such as fentanyl.
Incognito Market Founder Arrested and Charged
On May 18, U.S. authorities arrested Rui-Siang Lin, 23, operating under the pseudonym “Pharoah,” at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport. According to FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith, Lin ran Incognito Market for about four years, was in charge of its operations, including vendors, employees, and customers, and was the primary decision maker.
During this time, Lin gathered millions of dollars in personal profit, and Incognito Market grew to become one of the biggest online narcotics sales platforms. The platform facilitated the buying and selling of drugs such as prescription amphetamines like Adderall, MDMA, LSD, and cocaine using Monero and Bitcoin. In turn, Lin took a 5% cut of every sale as users channeled funds through the platform.
Lin is facing charges including one count of money laundering, one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, one count of narcotics conspiracy, and one count of conspiracy to sell misbranded and adulterated medication.




According to the FBI, they identified the Incognito Market owner by tracking crypto from the marketplace to an exchange account in his name. FBI task force officer Mark Rubens said the exchange provided Lin’s driver’s license, email, and phone number.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams stated on Monday, when Lin appeared in court, that the so-called “dark web” is not a sanctuary for individuals attempting to engage in unlawful activities.
Lin Faces Life Sentence
Incognito Market ceased operations in March after an exit scam left users unable to access their funds. Administrators then reportedly began demanding vendors to pay fees ranging from $100 to $20,000 based on their size to prevent their customer data from being publicly leaked.
Despite the allegations, Lin, who identifies as a crypto developer and enthusiast of privacy coin Monero, disclosed on X that he conducted a four-day workshop on cybercrime and cryptocurrency for 30 police officers at the Saint Lucia Police Academy in early April.
If convicted, Lin is looking at a mandatory life sentence on a criminal enterprise charge. Meanwhile, Ross Ulbricht, the individual behind the Silk Road darknet drug marketplace, faced similar charges and was convicted of the same crime. He received a life sentence in prison.
Notably, the narcotics conspiracy charge Lin faces carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum potential sentence of life imprisonment. The other two charges carry a combined maximum sentence of 25 years in prison.

Decentralized Education Altcoin Surges by 117% This Week Amid Node Sale and Purchase Announcement From Web3 Firm - The Daily Hodl


								The native altcoin of a decentralized education platform surged by over 117% this week amid news that a web3 firm has plans to purchase the token.
Open Campus’ governance and utility asset, EDU, is trading at $1.10 at time of writing, up from its seven-day low of $0.505.










The 252nd-ranked crypto asset is also up more than 12% in the past 24 hours.
Open Campus aims to foster an ecosystem that “connects learners, educators, content creators and educational institutions,” according to the project’s whitepaper. The EDU Chain bills itself as the “first layer-3 blockchain built for education.”
EDU’s price surge materialized as Animoca Brands, a web3 and blockchain gaming firm, announced a plan to acquire more EDU tokens on the open market.
Explains Animoca,
“Animoca Brands firmly supports the work of Open Campus and the EDU Foundation, including in particular the upcoming EDU Chain, the first layer-3 (L3) blockchain specifically designed to serve the global education industry, which is estimated to grow to $8 trillion in value by 2030.”
Open Campus also announced the upcoming sale of principal nodes for the EDU Chain. Principal node operators earn rewards by validating transactions on the EDU Chain.
The sales dates will be revealed next month, according to the project.
Despite its price gains this week, EDU remains more than 34% down from its all-time high of $1.67, which it hit in April 2023, according to CoinGecko.

Shiba Inu, BONK, And Floki Score Major Listing On The Coinbase Exchange | Bitcoinist.com


								America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase will list another round of cryptocurrencies for its perpetual futures contract, opting for meme coins this time around and featuring prominent tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Floki (FLOKI). 
Coinbase Perpetuals To List New Meme Coins
On May 24, Coinbase International Exchange announced that it will start offering perpetual futures contracts for three doggy-themed meme coins, Shiba Inu, Bonk and Floki. The crypto exchange made the official statement in an X (formerly Twitter) post, highlighting that the above cryptocurrencies will commence trading officially on Thursday, May 30, on or after 9:30 am. 

This move will signify the integration of Shiba Inu, Bonk and Floki into Coinbase’s derivatives market, opening up trading for these popular coins to the crypto exchange’s extensive user base. Given that Coinbase limits perpetual futures trading to non-US customers, this strategic move is poised to expand more trading opportunities for global crypto enthusiasts. 
Additionally, the crypto exchange has disclosed that trades will be conducted on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced, a subsidiary trading platform designed specifically for more experienced traders. 
Coinbase has also revealed the upcoming launch of 1000BONK-PERP, 1000FLOKI-PERP, and 1000SHIB-PERP. This implies that the new listing will feature smart contracts multiplied by 1,000 for derivatives traders on the exchange. 
Earlier last month, the crypto exchange introduced two other meme coins, Pepe (PEPE and Dogecon (DOGE) in its derivatives contracts. Following the launch, 1000PEPE-PERP became one of the most traded meme coins in Coinbase’s derivatives market. 
Coinbase most likely anticipates a similar surge in demand for its newly listed meme coins, given that Shiba Inu, Bonk and Floki are highly sought-after cryptocurrencies in the market, ranking in the top 10 by market capitalization among meme coins. 
Moreover, since the beginning of the month, Coinbase International Exchange has expanded its support for numerous popular cryptocurrencies for its perpetual futures contracts. A day before SHIB, BONK and FLOKI’s listing announcement, the exchange unveiled the commencement of trading for Ondo Finance (ONDO), Pyth Network (PYTH) and ZetaChain (ZETA) perpetual futures. 
Shiba Inu, BONK And FLOKI Gain Momentum
Following Coinbase’s listing declaration, Shiba Inu, Bonk and Floki witnessed new gains. Despite experiencing marginal declines over the past week, SHIB’s price has slightly rebounded by 4.55% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $0.000024.
BONK, which saw the highest gains between SHIB and FLOKI, rose significantly by 12.73%, pushing its price to $0.000036 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Floki experienced a notable 7.75% increase, driving its price up to $0.00023.

While Coinbase’s new derivatives listing may have potentially bolstered the prices of these cryptocurrencies, their daily trading volume has recorded a significant decline. According to CoinMarketCap, Shiba Inu’s 24-hour trading volume plummeted by 54.93%, Floki witnessed a decline of 40.44%, and Bonk experienced a substantial 47.56% drop. 
Although this decline in trading activity underscores pessimistic investor sentiment, SHIB, BONK, and FLOKI have been steadily gaining momentum despite market volatility and prevailing conditions.

New Memecoin Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Junkyard Cat (JUNKCAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because JUNKCAT has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Junkyard Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Junkyard Cat could become the next viral memecoin.



Junkyard Cat launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Junkyard Cat on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Junkyard Cat by entering its contract address – 6AdCuXXoxVMzPnczLjgqC9nQSBtcXnffVvRs8JsQvHhM – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like JUNKCAT.

Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) Will Rally 14,000% Before Bitrue Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KIMCRYPT will be listed on Bitrue, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kim Jong Crypto.



Currently, Kim Jong Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KIMCRYPT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kim Jong Crypto by entering its contract address – DY225ypZiG3aYkZnzaXJYDGtUz76uNuQiJLMzs6qGAZ5 – in the receiving field.



KIMCRYPT currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.

Trump Pledges to Free Silk Road Creator Ross Ulbricht If Re-Elected

Before Trump’s presidency ended in January 2021, he granted clemency to 143 individuals – pardoning 73, including Ripple board member Ken Kurson, and commuting the sentences of 70 others. He did not offer clemency to Ulbricht, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, who released details about a U.S. surveillance program to American journalist Glenn Greenwald.

Dogecoin Price Prediction: A 30% Crash Before A 1,300% Rally? Analyst Tells All | Bitcoinist.com


								The Dogecoin (DOGE) future trajectory continues to be heavily discussed, with crypto analysts weighing where the foremost meme coin is headed. Crypto analyst Capt Toblerone’s analysis comes under the spotlight, given how the foremost meme coin’s price action has continued to align with his prediction. 
DOGE’s 30% Crash Still In Play
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Capt Toblerone mentioned that Dogecoin will experience a 30% price drawdown from its current price level. He further claimed that the next reload area is at $0.108. He predicted that Dogecoin would make a 1,300% rally from that level, stating that one should get 13x from the reload area. 

Source: X
A 1,300% move for Dogecoin means the meme coin will rise to as high as $1.5. This prediction aligns with others made by crypto analysts like Ali Martinez, who predict that the meme coin could reach $1 in this cycle. This also looks feasible given that crypto analyst Kevin (formerly OG Yomi) once alluded to Dogecoin’s move in previous bull markets as why the meme coin could rally above $3. 
However, while Dogecoin looks primed to make such a parabolic move, Pav Hundal, lead analyst for Australian exchange Swyftx, has explained what could hinder the meme coin from reaching $1. He alluded to the fact that some Dogecoin holders bought the meme coin at its market peak in the last bull run. 
He believes that these holders will look to take profits once DOGE hits a new all-time high (ATH) in this bull cycle. Therefore, depending on the magnitude, such selling pressure could derail the meme coin from reaching $1. He also suggested that DOGE might see enough liquidity to push it to such a level since many more meme coins are in the market now. 
However, crypto analyst Rekt Capital disagrees with Hundal. He labeled Dogecoin “one of the most cyclical altcoins in the space.” Therefore, he expects the meme coin to make a parabolic move, as it has in previous cycles. 
Dogecoin Could Indeed Drop To $0.10
Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has also predicted that Dogecoin could drop to as low as $0.10. However, the analyst expects the meme coin to first experience a relief pump and rise to as high as $0.18. He revealed that he will be looking to short the meme coin at the $0.18 price level as it descends to $0.10. 

However, Dogecoin isn’t the only meme coin CrediBULL Crypto expects to drop significantly. He predicts that other foremost meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) will experience a price dropdown given the kind of rally they have enjoyed this year. 
At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.16, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

LDO's potential 250% uptick - Thank you, Ethereum? - AMBCrypto



Buying pressure on Lido remained high throughout the past week
Most indicators and market sentiment looked bullish on LDO’s charts

The hype around Ethereum ETFs had a positive impact on Lido DAO [LDO] as the token pushed its price up considerably. Such was the scale of price appreciation that in the last 24 hours alone, the crypto registered double-digit gains on its charts. 
Lido’s bull rally
Lido was one of the tokens that benefited the most from the Ethereum ETF approval episode, as its price rallied by more than 40% in the last 7 days. According to CoinMarketCap, in the last 24 hours, the token’s value hiked by over 11%. At press time, it was trading at $2.53 with a market capitalization of over $2.25 billion. 
However, the interesting bit here is that while Lido grew by double digits, ETH’s value only hiked by 1% over the aforementioned period. In fact, LDO’s price might do even better since a bullish pattern is now expected to emerge on its price chart. 
World of Charts, a popular crypto-analyst, recently posted a tweet revealing a bullish flag pattern. The latest price uptick pushed LDO’s price towards the upper limit of the pattern. A breakout above the same could propel further growth of nearly 250% in the coming weeks. 
Will LDO grow further?
To see whether LDO would manage to break above the bull pattern, AMBCrypto analyzed Santiment’s data. As per our analysis, LDO’s exchange outflows increased sharply last week. This pointed to a hike in buying pressure. The fact that investors have been buying LDO was further proven by its exchange data. 
The token’s supply on exchanges plummeted sharply, while its supply outside of exchanges rose. A hike in buying pressure often results in price hikes, increasing the chances of a bullish breakout. However, the token’s supply held by top addresses dropped on 24 May – A sign that whales sold their holdings to earn profits.

We then analyzed its daily chart to better understand whether LDO would continue its bull rally. The technical indicator MACD displayed a clear bullish upper hand in the market. 
Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered a sharp uptick, hinting at a sustained price hike. Nonetheless, the token’s price did touch the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, which often results in price corrections.

How to Add Solana to Metamask | Cryptoglobe


                                
Blockchains have diverse architectures, leading to interoperability challenges. Fortunately, various third-party solutions like bridges, extensions, wrapped assets, and cross-chain protocols enable asset utilization across different ecosystems and wallets. While it’s not possible to manage SOL and SLP tokens directly on MetaMask, we can still use a third-party to manage our Solana-based funds, all while remaining connected to MetaMask.



MetaMask Snaps, developed by Consensys engineers, allows users to manage their funds on various networks, such as Solana, within MetaMask via an extension. 



Solflare, the protocol behind the popular wallet of the same name, developed the Solana Snap function, allowing users to manage their Metamask wallets through a Solflare interface. 



In this article, you’ll learn how to add the Solana Snap to your Metamask wallet. Just follow these steps below.



How to Add Solana Snap to MetaMask



Go to the MetaMask Snap Directory either from your MetaMask wallet or Solflare MetaMask landing page.



Search for ‘Solana’ and click on ‘Solana Wallet’ by Solflare.



Click “Add to MetaMask” and confirm the link request, accepting terms and conditions.







Continue to Solflare’s website and click “Get Started” to initiate installation.







Connect to MetaMask when prompted. Wait for the process to finish and confirm the connection request.



Once completed, your Solflare Solana Wallet is ready for use.



You can bookmark the dashboard page for easy access, that way you don’t have to insert your password phrase.



Also read: How to Use Uniswap With MetaMask



Bridging SOL to MetaMask



Now that you have successfully installed the Solana Snap extension, you can bridge assets from other networks directly from your Snap wallet. 



Solflare’s Snap wallet allows users to bridge assets from other networks, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Polygon. Users can bridge stablecoins and reverse the process at any time. To bridge assets:



Access the Solflare interface and click on the Bridge tabSelect the relevant chains, enter the desired amount, and click “Review.”The MetaMask wallet is automatically chosen as the recipient account.Confirm the transaction to complete the bridging process.







Note: Solana assets can’t be managed directly on MetaMask; you’ll need to use the Solflare interface. Disabling or deleting the Solana wallet Snap interrupts its interaction with Metamask but doesn’t delete your portfolio; it’s restored upon reinstallation. And though a new wallet is created, it shares the same private keys as your Metamask wallet.



Benefits Of MetaMask Snaps



The integration of Solana blockchain into MetaMask expands its functionality, enabling users to engage with Solana’s high throughput and low transaction costs alongside their existing EVM-compatible assets. 



This integration promotes greater interoperability within the crypto ecosystem, simplifying asset management across different blockchains through a unified wallet interface.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Here’s what you can do with Solana Snap in MetaMask:



Manage Solana-Based Tokens and NFTs: Hold SOL and manage Solana tokens and NFTs within the MetaMask environment.



Swap and Stake: Participate in swapping and staking activities directly from your MetaMask wallet.



Bridge Assets: Seamlessly bridge your assets from EVM to SOL.



Connect to Solana Apps: Access Solana’s vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) without the need to install a separate Solana wallet.



View and Manage Assets: Although you can’t directly view and manage your Solana assets stored in MetaMask within the wallet’s interface, you can utilize the Solflare interface or a widget embedded within each Solana app you connect with.



Connecting MetaMask to Solana dApps



Now that you have your wallet ready to go, you can connect to multiple dApps on the Solana ecosystem, like Jupiter, Jito, or Solend. For this particular example, we’ll use Jito, a MEV staking platform. 



Follow the steps below:



Begin by connecting your Solana Snap wallet. Click on “Connect Wallet” and choose MetaMask. Then, click “Continue.”







The app will automatically choose the Snap wallet for you. Make sure you keep the second popup window open, as it is required for every application where you intend to use your Solana Snap wallet.



Click on Connect.







Done, now you can use Snap wallet on Jito.







The process is quite similar for other dApps on Solana. We just need to make sure we choose Metamask, and follow the previous steps. For example, we can integrate Metamask to Solend by clicking on Connect Wallet and choosing Metamask, and repeat the process.







Frequently Asked Questions



Here is a FAQ about the Solana Wallet Snap:



Is the Snap Wallet Custodial? 



No, the Solflare wallet runs with the associated MetaMask wallet, so it does not issue new private keys for the Solana Snap wallet.



What Happens if I Delete/Reinstall My of Solana Snap 



Deleting or deactivating your Solana Wallet Snap halts its interaction with your MetaMask wallet. However, upon reinstallation of the Solana Wallet Snap, your previous portfolio remains intact.



Can I Manage Solana Assets Directly On MetaMask



No. You can only do it through the Solflare interface.



What is MetaMask Snaps?



MetaMask Snaps enable developers to create external applications that utilize the MetaMask infrastructure. These include interoperability Snaps like the Solana Wallet Snap and transaction insights Snaps aimed at enhancing security.

Binance Doubles Down on Low Float, High FDV: Calls for Action


																There has been a growing concern regarding the increased traction of tokens with high valuations but low initial circulating supply, which has sparked discussions about the sustainability of upside potential for traders following the token generation event (TGE).
Binance Research’s latest findings have confirmed this trend, depicting an increasing number of tokens being launched with limited circulating supply and inflated valuations.
High Valuation, Low Liquidity Crisis
An influx of private market capital, coupled with aggressive valuations and an upbeat market outlook, has stimulated the practice of cryptocurrency tokens launching at steeply high, fully diluted valuation (FDV) points.
The report estimates that around $155 billion worth of tokens will be unlocked from 2024 to 2030. This significant influx of tokens into the market, without a proportional increase in buy-side demand and capital flows, could exert substantial selling pressure, as per the report, which, in turn, would challenge the market’s ability to absorb these tokens without negatively impacting prices.
“Under bullish market conditions, these tokens can experience rapid price appreciation due to limited liquidity available for trading at launch. However, it is apparent that this kind of price growth is unsustainable when a wave of token supply hits the market upon unlocking.”
The analysis further highlights a widening gap between market caps and fully diluted valuations (FDVs) for tokens launched over the past three years, with 2024’s FDVs already approaching 2023’s totals. Tokens launched in 2024 have an average MC/FDV ratio of just 12.3%, implying around $80 billion in new demand would be needed to match future supply increases and maintain current prices.




This appears to be primarily driven by recent token launches with extremely low circulating supplies, often under 20% of the total supply. With the majority of tokens locked, their FDVs are inflated compared to actual market caps.
Addressing The Trend
As reported earlier, well over 80% of the newly listed cryptocurrencies have experienced a decline in their worth on Binance.
It was also found that most tokens newly gracing Binance’s listing boards are backed by top-tier VC firms which are launched at inflated valuations, with the average fully diluted valuation exceeding $4.2 billion at listing and some tokens even surpassing the $11 billion mark. These projects were observed to lack an established user base or proper community support potentially.
To address the trend of tokens launching at high valuations with low initial circulating supplies, Binance has called for fostering a healthy and sustainable market environment. The plan involves Binance taking the lead in engaging small to medium projects and inviting high-quality teams and projects to apply for the exchange’s listing programs, such as direct listing, Launchpools, Megadrops, etc.

US Crypto ETFs Expected to Soar Next Year Following Ethereum ETF Approval - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The U.S. SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs, following earlier approval of Bitcoin ETFs.



Experts predict the introduction of ETFs with a basket of US crypto ETFs, potentially including Bitcoin and Ether, within a year.



Despite the approvals, the SEC Chair emphasized continued strict regulation.




The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, surprising many with the swiftness of the decision.





Experts Predict Broader US Crypto ETF Offerings Within a Year



The approval follows closely on the heels of Bitcoin ETFs, which were given the nod earlier this year. According to TD Cowen’s research group, this rapid approval was somewhat unexpected but ultimately seen as inevitable once US crypto ETFs received the green light, The Block reported.



Jaret Seiberg of TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group noted that this approval arrived about six months earlier than anticipated. He speculated that the next development could be the introduction of ETFs containing a basket of U.S. crypto assets, likely featuring Bitcoin and Ether, within the next year.



Despite the approval, it is important to note that only the 19b-4 listing requests for Ethereum ETFs have been approved, not the critical S-1 registration statements. The distinction was highlighted by British multinational bank Standard Chartered. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s head of crypto research, believes that it is only a matter of time before other US crypto ETFs, such as XRP and SOL, are approved.




SEC Maintains Tough Stance on Crypto Regulation and Enforcement



However, the approval of Ethereum ETFs does not signify a broader change in the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, speaking at the Investment Company Institute 2024 Leadership Summit in Washington DC on May 23, reaffirmed the SEC’s commitment to strict legal adherence regarding crypto ETF applications.



Gensler also highlighted the agency’s robust performance in court cases involving crypto players, including enforcement actions against majors like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for alleged securities law violations.



Despite potential challenges, TD Cowen forecasts that the SEC will maintain its Democratic majority through 2026. They predict continued litigation against crypto trading platforms that the SEC deems to be trading unregistered securities.

Donald Trump's Crypto Support Shows Strong With Latest Statements - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Donald Trump’s crypto support is showing strong opposition to President Biden’s stance.



Trump’s campaign is accepting crypto donations, and he pledged to commute Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s sentence if re-elected.




Former President Donald Trump made his strongest endorsement of cryptocurrency to date in a post on Truth Social today.





Donald Trump’s Crypto Support Confirmed During Presidential Campaign



Trump declared, “I am very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry,” indicating a strategic move to garner support from pro-crypto voters.



In his post, Trump contrasted his stance with that of President Joe Biden, asserting that Biden aims to “die a slow and painful death” for the crypto industry. Trump‘s remarks mark a significant shift from his earlier skepticism about cryptocurrencies. In a 2021 interview with Fox Business, he expressed a preference for the U.S. dollar over Bitcoin and called for strict regulation of digital currencies.



Donald Trump’s crypto support has been evident in his recent actions and statements. Earlier this month, he voiced pro-crypto sentiments at a Mar-a-Lago dinner and subsequently announced that his presidential campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations, becoming the first major party candidate to do so.




This pro-crypto rhetoric appears to be influencing the broader political landscape. The Biden administration, historically opposed to cryptocurrency, has shown signs of softening its stance. Last week, the White House did not threaten to veto a crypto market structure bill passed by the House of Representatives. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key regulatory filings for ether exchange-traded funds, a move considered improbable just a month ago.



Trump Pledges Support for Silk Road Founder



In another significant announcement, Trump pledged to commute the life sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht if re-elected. “If you vote for me, on Day 1, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht to a sentence of time served,” Trump stated during his remarks at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C.



Donald Trump’s crypto support and his pledges to reform regulations are expected to garner a lot of interest and support from the cryptocurrency community as the 2024 election draws near.

Stronger and More Sustainable Uptrend Now in Play for Bitcoin (BTC), Says Crypto Analyst - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto strategist thinks that Bitcoin (BTC) is in a position to ignite a breakout rally on the way to fresh all-time highs over the next few days.
In a new video update, pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 53,200 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may have just started a five-wave rally that could send BTC above $100,000.










Credible relies on the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset often witnesses a five-wave surge where waves one, three and five are upside moves and waves two and four are corrective periods.
According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s recent move from $60,000 to above $70,000 may have been the first wave of the rally with the correction down to $66,000 serving as the wave-two correction.
“Now that we can confirm that this first leg is done, what we’re seeing now is the wave-two correction. What follows the wave-two correction, regardless of how deep it goes, is a much larger wave three, four and a five. 
If our first wave up went from $60,000 to $70,000, that’s a $10,000 move, the third [wave] is typically larger than that and the fifth is equivalent…
Bottom line though is wherever this wave two ends, we can expect at least $20,000 of further upside from wherever this correction ends. If this correction ends at $66,000, then we’re looking at a minimum of $86,000 for this next completed impulse to the upside.
More likely that’s going to push into the $90,000s, potentially the $100,000 level.”

Credible also believes that the rally will be a “much more sustainable and stronger uptrend” for BTC.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $69,204, a fractional increase in the past day.

Donald Trump's CBDC Stance Now Reaffirmed Though Crypto Support Strengthens - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Former US President Donald Trump vows to block the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).



Donald Trump’s CBDC stance aligns himself with critics, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, amidst growing political discourse on the issue.



Despite past skepticism, Trump pledges support for the US’s dominance in cryptocurrency.




Former US President Donald Trump made a bold assertion during a recent electoral event, declaring his staunch opposition to establishing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). 





Donald Trump’s CBDC Stance: Promises to Halt Release



Trump expressed concerns about the potential infringement on individual freedoms posed by CBDCs, aligning himself with other critics of this emerging financial technology.



In a public speech, Trump emphasized his determination to prevent the creation of a CBDC, stating, “I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your Bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).” Donald Trump’s CBDC stance echoes the sentiments of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and adds Trump’s voice to the growing chorus of CBDC skeptics in the political arena.



Along with Donald Trump’s CBDC stance, a report from Bank of America in November expressed skepticism about the short-term issuance of a digital US dollar by the Federal Reserve. During his campaign speech in Laconia, New Hampshire, in January, Trump also voiced opposition to digital currencies issued by individual central banks.




Former President Pledges Crypto Support



Additionally, he pledged to support the US’s dominance in the crypto space, stating, “I will ensure that the future of crypto and Bitcoin will be made in the USA…I will support the right to self custody to the nation’s 50 million crypto holders. “



It’s worth noting that despite his previous criticisms of cryptocurrencies, Trump disclosed ownership of over $2.5 million in Ether in August 2023. Moreover, his presidential campaign announced plans to accept cryptocurrency donations to mobilize a “crypto army” leading up to Election Day.

Why Polygon [MATIC] is on track for a price rise - AMBCrypto



Increased Invested Age and other metrics suggested that most MATIC holders were opting to HODL.
High areas of liquidity existed between $0.75 and $0.78, indicating that the price could move towards these zones.

Contrary to what was happening with other groups, Polygon [MATIC] addresses holding 100 million to 1 billion tokens have been added to their balance.
This was according to data provided by Santiment. According to the on-chain analytic platform, the supply held by this cohort was 16.17% on the 23rd of May.
But as of this writing, the percentage had increased to 17.30%.
Skeptics are no longer in town
This increase denotes increasing confidence in the long-term potential of the token. However, it could also impact MATIC’s price action in the short term.
For instance, if whales (the term for the group mentioned) decide to distribute a large part of their holdings, the token involved could experience a price decrease.
Therefore, the increase in balance has the potential to drive Polygon’s price higher. At press time, the price of the token was $0.72. This was a 25.48% decline in the last 90 days.
Source: Santiment
However, MATIC has been trying to trade higher within the last month. But every attempt to reach and surpass the $0.80 resistance, has been met with rejection.
But with the recent accumulation, it could be possible for the Polygon native token to climb. Concerning this potential, AMBCrypto evaluated other metrics and indicators to see if they agreed.
One of the indicators we looked at was the liquidation levels. This indicator shows the price levels a cryptocurrency can reach by highlighting high areas of liquidity.
As of this writing, high liquidity on the Polygon chart existed between $0.75 and $0.78. This magnetic zone indicated that the token might soon start moving in that direction.
The season of respite is coming
On the same plot, the Cumulative Liquidation Levels Delta (CLLD) validated the prediction. For context, the CLLD shows the difference between long and short liquidations.
Positive readings of the indicator suggest more long liquidations than shorts. On the other hand, a negative reading of the CLLD means that there are more short liquidations than longs.
Source: Hyblock
Apart from this, the indicator influences the price action. At press time, it was negative. For Polygon’s price, this indicated that a sharp recovery could be close, and late shorts trying to catch the dip might get punished.
Furthermore, the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) indicated that most participants had leaned toward HODLing MATIC. The metric shows the average time all current Polygon addresses have held their tokens.

Read Polygon’s [MATIC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

If the reading of the MDIA decreases it indicates increasing transaction activity. Sometimes, this could fuel selling pressure. At press time, the 90-day MDIA increased.
Source: Santiment
The last time, the metric made such a consistent move, MATIC went from $0.71 to $1.27. While this might not be the same case this time, the price of the token might close in or surpass $1 in the midterm.

Ethereum and Bitcoin Correlation: Will Ether Price Pick Up Pace?

After the SEC approved Ethereum ETFs on Thursday, March 23, Ether has yet to show signs of growth. For Bitcoin, it took almost a month after the ETF approval before the price could set on a massive bull run, reaching an all-time-high of $73,738.00 on March 14.In September 2022, Ethereum moved to proof of stake (PoS), a set of interconnected upgrades that made Ethereum more secure and sustainable. Proof of stake substitutes computational power with staking (making it less energy-intensive) and replaces miners with validators, who stake their cryptocurrency holdings to activate the ability to create new blocks.The growing popularity of Ether dApps prompts traders to diversify their portfolios. A closer look at the BTC/ETH correlation could hint the possibility of the Ethereum price finally picking up the pace.BTC/ETH correlation coefficientThe BTC/ETH correlation refers to the price relationship between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), typically expressed in terms of BTC. For example, if Bitcoin is priced at $60,000 and Ethereum at $3,000, the ratio is 0.05, meaning it costs 0.05 BTC to buy one ETH. If ETH's price increases faster than BTC's, the ratio rises, indicating it costs more BTC to buy ETH.Source: IntoTheBlockAnother measure of this relationship is the correlation coefficient, ranging from -1 to 1. A coefficient of 1 indicates that BTC and ETH move in the same direction, -1 indicates they move in opposite directions, and 0 signifies no correlation. For instance, during periods of negative correlation, if BTC's price rises, ETH's price would fall, and vice versa.Thus, the BTC/ETH correlation shows the price relationship between the two assets, while the correlation coefficient measures how their prices move relative to each other. Both metrics are crucial for efficiently trading the BTC/ETH correlation.Historic correlationHistorical data shows that Ethereum tends to be priced higher during bull markets. For instance, ETH was priced above 0.05 BTC during the bull runs of 2018 and 2021. After 2021, the 0.05 BTC level has consistently served as a strong support region. Conversely, the 0.08 BTC level has acted as significant resistance on three separate occasions.During the BTC bull run, the correlation had been steadily growing, peaking on March 14, when the BTC price reached an ATH.Source: IntoTheBlockThe graph indicates that Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin in bull markets and underperforms in bear markets. While past performance does not guarantee future results, it provides valuable insights for making more informed decisions.A recent Coinbase report shows that the correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has been declining since early 2023, particularly after Ethereum's Shanghai (Shapella) hard fork on April 12, which enabled staked ether withdrawals. This change has reduced the 40-day rolling correlation from 0.95 to 0.82.Historically, BTC and ETH have moved together, but factors such as the rising adoption of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps), the popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Ethereum's shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism are driving the divergence.Ethereum ETFs expectationsAccording to IntoTheBlock's research, 95% of current ETH positions are now profitable, with its price increasing by 30% over the past seven days. This level of profitability has not been observed since November 2021, when ETH prices soared to an all-time high.There is minimal resistance to the volume of ETH purchased at prices higher than current levels. Specifically, 3.57 million ETH were bought in the price range of $3,800 to $4,800, compared to 53.54 million ETH purchased between $2,160 and $2,650.ETH whales have also begun to make significant moves, following the increased odds of ETF approval. On Tuesday the 21st, ETH recorded an on-chain trading volume of $15.98 billion, marking the highest volume recorded since June 13, 2022.Of the $15.98 billion in trading volume recorded, $14.33 billion came from transactions exceeding $100,000, typically conducted by whales. This represents 90% of the total traded volume for this day. This trend could be expected to accelerate now that the ETFs have indeed been approved.The approval of the ETH ETFs marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency acceptance, likely influencing increased activity among ETH whales as reflected by recent large-volume transactions. The shifting landscape, underscored by substantial on-chain trading volumes, suggests a growing institutional and investor confidence in Ethereum.

Bitcoin Evangelist Saylor Warms Up to Ethereum


During a recent appearance on the "What Bitcoin Did" podcast, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor spoke positively about Ethereum exchange-traded funds, predicting that they will help accelerate institutional adoption. Mainstream investors might be willing to allocate a higher percentage of their portfolios (from 5% to 10%) instead of just 1% now that view crypto as a broader asset class. Saylor is convinced that Bitcoin is going to account for up to 70% of that allocation as the leader of the crypto asset class. "In fact, it might be better for Bitcoin because we are politically much more powerful…supported by the entire cryptocurrency industry…They obviously have a lot of political power, a lot of users, and they serve as another line of defense for Bitcoin," he said. In a stunning U-turn, several 19b-4s listing requests filed by Ethereum ETF issuers were approved earlier this week. Just days before that, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was predicted to reject them due to the lack of engagement, political pressure, and the uncertainty surrounding the legal status of the underlying Ether token. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart believes that Ethereum ETFs will be able to reach roughly 25% of the demand for the Bitcoin ETFs that went live in January. For now, it is unclear when these Ethereum ETFs will actually start trading since the SEC also has to approve corresponding S-1 registration statements.Saylor has now changed his tune after previously predicting that Ethereum would never be accepted by Wall Street since it is very "clear" that the flagship altcoin is a security. He claimed that Bitcoin was the only "institutional grade crypto asset."

Bloomberg Analyst Predicts Ethereum Spot ETFs To Attract 25% Of BTC Demand - Here’s Why


																Following the sudden approval of the Ethereum Spot ETF last week, speculations continue to roll in on the potential performance of these funds ahead of their debut trading session. Most recently, renowned Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart has weighed in on the subject giving his thoughts on the possible level of investments the Ethereum spot ETFs could pull in relation to their Bitcoin-based equivalents.

ETH Spot ETF Limited By Ethereum’s Utility And Other Factors – Analyst
In an interview session on X on May 24 hosted by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, Seyffart stated that the Ether spot ETFs would likely experience a maximum of 25% of the demand seen by the Bitcoin spot ETFs.
Seyffart based his predictions on multiple elements starting with enormous differences in market caps between both assets. According to data from CoinMarket, Ethereum’s total market shares are valued at $449.25 billion which is roughly equal to 30% of BTC’s 1.35 trillion market cap.
Furthermore, the analyst also highlighted the large disparities in the difference between both ETFs and their base assets. According to Seyffart, there is a bigger gap between Ethereum as an ETF and as a cryptocurrency than Bitcoin as an ETF and as itself. 
The ETF analyst believes that the ETH spot ETFs will limit investors from native ETF features such as staking, a prominent source of passive income, and other on-chain use cases in terms of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc. Thus, certain investors might prefer to invest directly in the altcoin. 
With all these factors in consideration, Seyffart predicts these novel investment funds will produce “big launches” but not at the level of the Bitcoin spot ETFs.  He predicts the Ethereum Spot ETFs will record between 20-25% of investments in their Bitcoin-based peers once trading commences. Meanwhile, fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas appears less optimistic with a projection of 15-20%.
Undoubtedly, the performance of the Ethereum spot ETFs will be influential on other crypto spot ETFs that may gain approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Currently, the XRP ETF is tipped by many enthusiasts as the next debutant in the market but this is still subject to many factors, most especially regulatory clarity on the institutional sales of XRP.
Ethereum Price Overview
In other news, Ethereum is trading at $3,766 with a 0.51% gain in the last day. This slight positive performance underscores Ethereum’s form all week with a combined 20.47% gain recorded in the last seven days. Meanwhile, ETH’s daily trading volume is down by 51.27% and is valued at $10.03 billion.

Donald Trump Promises Total Support For Bitcoin and Crypto If Re-elected - Coin Edition


							

Donald Trump has promised to support Bitcoin and cryptocurrency if re-elected.
Trump said he would not allow the U.S. to create a CBDC.
The former president promised to commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence to time served.
﻿




Former U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to support Bitcoin and cryptocurrency if re-elected in the forthcoming presidential election. According to Trump, “Bitcoin will be made in the USA, not driven overseas.”







Continuing his campaign speech, Trump promised to support the right to self-custody and keep the well-known anti-crypto senator, Elizabeth Warren, away from the nation’s 50 million crypto holders. Trump further promised never to allow the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).









Meanwhile, the recent campaign speech is not Trump’s first Bitcoin-appeal campaign move. The former president is renowned for repeatedly promising to support the cryptocurrency industry if re-elected. In one of his posts on Truth Social, an alternative social media platform, Trump expressed positivity and open-mindedness to cryptocurrency companies. 



The former president claimed to support “all things related to the new and burgeoning industry,” noting that the U.S. must be the leader in the cryptocurrency field. He accused the current president, Joe Biden, of wanting cryptocurrency to die a slow and painful death, describing him as the worst president in the country’s history.



Trump also made another landmark pledge to the crypto community by promising to free the Silk Road creator, Ross Ulbricht, if re-elected. The court sentenced Ulbricht to two life sentences plus 40 years for creating the darknet marketplace. 



In his campaign speech, Trump pledged to commute Ulbricht’s sentence to the time served, as the audience, many of whom held up signs reading “Free Ross” cheered along. The court sentenced Ulbricht in 2015 after determining that the darknet he created anonymously used to buy and sell illegal goods, including drugs. He has served 11 years of his lifetime sentence as of filing this report.

Donald Trump Declares Support For Cryptocurrency Companies - Details


								



Former US President and Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has pledged to support cryptocurrency companies if re-elected. This announcement comes as the American billionaire challenges incumbent President Joe Biden, whose administration seems to be reversing its stance on crypto policy. With the US Presidential elections nearing later this year, the contrasting approaches to cryptocurrency regulation are becoming a significant point of contention.





US Should Lead Global Crypto Space – Donald Trump
In a post on self-owned social media platform Truth Social, Donald Trump made a personal declaration in support of the digital asset industry. The former US president expressed his openness to the potential of cryptocurrency while also advocating leadership in this nascent industry. 
Statements from Trump’s post shared on X by Founder of blockchain research firm Messari, Ryan Selkis, read: 
I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field. There is no second place.
Donald Trump also took a swipe at incumbent President Joe Biden who he accused of being against the crypto industry. He also suggested that his administration would engage the industry differently to ensure its development. 
Trump said: 
Crooked Joe Biden, on the other hand, the worst president in the history of our country, wants it (crypto industry) to die a slow and painful death. That will never happen with me.  
These statements by Donald Trump are largely unsurprising as the Republican has always been a subtle supporter of the novel digital asset industry which is stuck in a regulatory tussle with the current US government.
A month after declaring his presidential ambition in 2022, Trump announced a limited edition of 44,000 non-fungible tokens which depicted him in multiple figures including a sheriff, an astronaut, etc. The NFT collection sold out in less than a day for a combined value of about $4.4 million. 
Most recently, Donald Trump’s campaign also started receiving donations in multiple cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and the US Dollar Coin (USDC). These actions coupled with the billionaire’s recent statement indicate a glaring support for digital assets which may prove pivotal in the forthcoming elections.


Is Biden Seeking ‘Crypto Votes’?
According to data from Triple-A, The US is home to 46 million active adult crypto users who will be looking to have a say at the polls, especially with the lack of clear regulations and consistent crackdowns targeted at US crypto space. 
In light of this situation, it appears the current US government could be implementing a change in policy on cryptocurrency following the sudden approval of the Ethereum ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against general market sentiment. 
Furthermore, the US House of Representatives has also passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT),  which faced opposition from the White House but with no threats of a veto. So far, these actions have been widely interpreted as political acts by the current administration targeted at winning favors in the upcoming elections.

SEC Approves Spot Ether ETFs: A Different Path from Bitcoin ETFs



                    

On May 23, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a notable difference from the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. 



Unlike the Bitcoin ETFs, which were approved via voting by a five-member committee including SEC chief Gary Gensler, the spot Ether ETFs were approved by the SEC’s Trading and Markets Division.




The SEC greenlit the 19b-4 filings from several firms including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. 



The Commission did not provide additional comments beyond the official decision. 



The official filing stated: “For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, pursuant to delegated authority.”




While the crypto community questioned the differing approval processes, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart explained it as a routine procedure. 



He noted that many approvals are typically handled in this manner and requiring an official vote for every decision would be impractical. Seyffart added, “It would have been nice to see where the political lines were drawn.”

However, some individuals remain skeptical of Seyffart’s assessment. 




One user on X pointed out that a commissioner could still challenge the decision within the next 10 days, suggesting that delegated authority might be used to obscure potentially politically charged votes.



Another user on X speculated that the SEC’s decision was influenced by various factors, including political pressure, upcoming elections, and the implementation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rules.



A significant difference between the approval processes for the two crypto ETFs is the timeline for trading. 



All 11 Bitcoin ETFs began trading the day after their approval, as they also received S-1 form clearance. 



In contrast, spot Ether ETFs might take weeks or months to debut on exchanges since the ETF filers have not yet received the S-1 SEC registration.



Overall, the approval of spot Ether ETFs marks another step forward in the crypto market, albeit with procedural differences and potential political undercurrents.

Bitcoin Whitepaper Re-Uploaded After Craig Wright Loses Satoshi Nakamoto Claims - Coin Edition


							

Cobra has re-uploaded the Bitcoin whitepaper on Bitcoin.org.
The anonymous team pulled down the whitepaper in 2021 following Craig Wright’s lawsuit.
The UK High Court has determined that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.




Cobra, the anonymous team behind the Bitcoin.org website, has re-uploaded the Bitcoin whitepaper on its platform following Craig Wright’s failure to prove to the court that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the flagship crypto. In March, a High Court in the UK ruled Wright is not Satoshi, with one judge concluding that he lied extensively, engaged in technobabble, and isn’t as clever as he thinks.









Bitcoin.org pulled down the PDF copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper on its platform in 2021, following a court order after Wright successfully sued Cobra for copyright infringement. Wright won the 2021 lawsuit after the anonymous group failed to appear in court not to jeopardize their anonymity. Hence, Wright’s victory was by default, with Cobra having to refund his legal fees worth $41,000.



Last Thursday, Bitcoin.org’s maintainer, Hennadii Stepanov, shared a link to the Bitcoin whitepaper PDF on X, marking a return of the document on the platform. Stepanov’s action followed a reversal of Wright’s temporary victory and a series of protests from several sectors of the Bitcoin community.







In a significant turn of events, several publishers shared the Bitcoin whitepaper on their platforms after Bitcoin.org pulled it down. The publishers protested despite Wright’s threat to sue anyone who published the document. A Bitcoin community member shared a list of over 100 websites that published the document.  





Three years after the Wright’s victory, the court determined his inability to prove that he was Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, putting to rest an argument that has lasted several years. Hence, Cobra re-uploaded the novel technology’s whitepaper to the original platform where it was first published.

These Are This Week's Top Performers as Bitcoin (BTC) Price Maintains $69K (Weekend Watch)


																Bitcoin, alongside the rest of the market, had a highly beneficial week driven by the hype and the actual approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States.
The weekly scale shows that UNI, PEPE, LDO, and ETH are among the leaders in terms of gains from the larger-cap alts.
BTC’s Weekly Surge
It was last Sunday when the primary cryptocurrency struggled to remain above $66,000 and slipped beneath that level on a few occasions. Monday started on a similar note but its end was nothing short than spectacular.
Amid reports that the US SEC might approve eight spot Ethereum ETFs that week, BTC skyrocketed by over five grand and neared $72,000 for the first time in six weeks. Nevertheless, the asset failed to maintain its run and started losing value in the following days.
The worst price drop came just hours before the US securities regulator indeed greenlighted those financial products on Thursday and BTC decreased to $66,400. Yet, it bounced off and soared to $69,000 by Friday.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


The weekend has gone quite calmly but bitcoin has managed to defend the $69,000 level. Its market cap stands close to $1.370 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 50.3%.

PEPE’s Week
Somewhat expected, the news mentioned above impacted Ethereum’s native token a lot. ETH went on a roll and shot up from $3,100 to over $3,900, which became its highest price tag since the start of April. The second-largest crypto also went on a volatile ride amid the SEC’s approval but now stands close to $3,800 after gaining 22% in the past week.
DOGE, LINK, and APT have also jumped impressively on a weekly scale, but Uniswap and PEPE lead the charts. UNI has skyrocketed by 44% and stands above $11, while PEPE painted several all-time highs this week.
In contrast, SOL, TRX, TON, and ADA are in the red on a weekly scale. Still, the total crypto market cap gained more than $200 billion within this timeframe and is now above $2.7 trillion.

NY AG Issues Warning for Crypto Companies


New York Attorney General Letitia James has warned the cryptocurrency industry that she will go after those companies that refuse to play by the same rules as everyone else.Earlier this week, James announced a $2 billion settlement with embattled cryptocurrency lender Genesis. She decried the lack of oversight that had led to massive losses for victims.Gemini, Genesis and the Digital Currency Group were sued by the NYAG back in October 2023 over the controversial Gemini Earn cryptocurrency investment program. The fraud loss claim against Barry Silvert's crypto giant was then tripled in February in an amended complaint.As part of the settlement, Genesis has been prohibited from operating in New York.In 2018, James was elected as the state's attorney general with overwhelming support, breaking gender and racial barriers.Since her historic election, James has cracked down on various cryptocurrency companies.In April 2019, New York's top law enforcement official kicked off a long-running legal battle with stablecoin issuer Tether and cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. In February 2021, it eventually reached an agreement with James with a $18.5 million fine.Since then, the NYAG has also taken action against such cryptocurrency firms as Coinseed.In December 2023, cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin agreed to shell out a total of $22 million.Crypto lobbying boomWith growing regulatory scrutiny, cryptocurrency firms have also intensified their lobbying efforts. Over the past four years, cryptocurrency firms have spent $149 million to elect potential allies in Congress, according to a recent report by the Washington Post.

Ethereum Spot ETF: Experts Weigh In On ETH Selling Point Post-ETF Approval | Bitcoinist.com


								In an interesting turn of events, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the pending Ethereum spot ETF applications last week. This landmark development has led to commentary on the value and acceptability of the Ether token, especially amongst a specific demographic.
If Bitcoin Is Digital Gold, What Is Ethereum?
Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, took to the X platform to discuss the chances of success of the Ethereum spot ETF market following the recent approval. The analyst highlighted how the acceptability of the Ethereum token, especially amongst investors in the 60 to 80-year-old age group (baby boomers), might pose a challenge to how well the investment products will perform.

According to Balchunas, one way ETF issuers might be able to penetrate the “baby boomer” market is by distilling the value or purpose of the ETH ETFs into an “easy-to-understand sound bite.” The Bloomberg analyst questioned if Ethereum has a simple selling point while citing “Bitcoin is digital gold” as an exemplary marketing one-liner that the older generation can resonate with.
Balchunas then asked in his post:
Does a simple one-liner like that exist for Ether? If so, what is it?
There were several interesting answers from notable personalities in the cryptocurrency space. Notably, crypto journalist Colin Wu called Ethereum the “Web 3.0 internet.” 
Prominent crypto investor and partner at venture capital firm Cinneamhain Ventures Adam Cochran also responded, saying “Ethereum is like digital oil.” Cochran explained further that Ethereum is the gas that powers decentralized protocols. 


Meanwhile, James Check (popularly known as CheckMatey), a lead analyst at Glassnode, suggested that Ether doesn’t have a selling point. “Ethereum still has no elevator pitch, despite years of attempts,” the crypto pundit said in a post on X.
ETH ETF To Clear The Path For More Funds: TD Cowen
While it is unclear whether the Ethereum spot ETFs will be successful, these newly approved funds are expected to usher in even newer crypto products in the coming year. According to investment bank TD Cowen’s research team, a product containing a “basket of crypto tokens,” possibly just Bitcoin and Ether or other tokens might be next in line.

However, the research group noted in its report that the recent approval of Ethereum spot ETF doesn’t indicate a shift in the SEC’s overall stance towards crypto. This was highlighted in chairman Gary Gensler’s recent statement against the passage of crypto legislation.


“We expect the agency will continue to litigate against crypto trading platforms that trade tokens that the agency believes are unregistered securities,” the TD Cowen researchers said about the SEC keeping its Democratic majority through 2026.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Just Beat Ethereum, Shiba Inu and Others in 24 Hours: Details

Dogecoin has regained some major amount of power and successfully moved toward the $0.17 price level, now showing the strongest performance across the market, even beating Ethereum and Shiba Inu. Over the past 24 hours, DOGE's impressive rally has caught the attention of many investors, making it one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the market.Some of the reasons for the recent surge of Dogecoin are new retail interest and buying volumes. This resultantly increases the buying activity on the asset, hence creating high volatility in the price of DOGE.Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewDogecoin has now first broken above the 50 EMA, indicating a bullish trend. The relative strength indicator also points to the current wave on the bull side, therefore further gains being expected in the short term. In addition, the increased volume has reflected high buying pressure.On the other hand, Ethereum and Shiba Inu have not done nearly as well. Ethereum has been pretty stable in gaining a bit, while Shiba Inu has been struggling with an attempt to break out of its current price range. It was all the more interesting with the fact that Dogecoin continued outperforming even these two big digital coins.Another fueling factor for the surge in Dogecoin is positivity in the entire crypto market. With Bitcoin and other major cryptos showing signs of recovery, investors seem to be more ready to take risks on alternative coins like DOGE, and this restored confidence has really hyped its price.There will be room to stretch closer to the key resistance levels if the current momentum persists and bulls stay on Dogecoin's side. One way or another, any kind of meme coin is volatile, not excluding Dogecoin. Stay cautious and try avoiding overleveraging and poor risk management.

Altcoins Entering ‘Textbook Markup’ Period Witnessed During 2016 and 2021 Market Cycles, Says Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								An analyst known for making macro crypto calls thinks the altcoin market is poised to spark steep rallies similar to the ones witnessed in 2016 and 2021.
Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 451,900 followers on the social media platform X that he’s watching the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market cap of crypto excluding the 10-largest digital assets and stablecoins.










According to the crypto strategist, OTHERS appears to be following a “textbook” bullish formation after breaking out from a rounding bottom pattern.
“Alts are entering textbook markup.” 
Source: TechDev/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, OTHERS seems to have printed the exact same pattern seen during the 2016 bull market cycle. The TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the total market cap of crypto excluding Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins, also generated the same pattern in 2021 before launching a big burst to the upside.
Based on the chart, TechDev predicts that OTHERS will rally to as high as $1 trillion during its markup phase. At time of writing, OTHERS is hovering at $291.35 billion, suggesting an upside potential of more than 243% if it hits TechDev’s target.
The analyst is also looking at other relevant charts to support his bullish stance on altcoins. According to TechDev, both the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) and Tether dominance (USDT.D) charts are flashing bearish signals.
Bitcoin dominance tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC while Tether dominance measures how much of the crypto market cap belongs to USDT. If both charts are bearish, it suggests that traders are moving their capital to altcoins.
“Bitcoin dominance is breaking down from a massive distribution. Tether dominance is marking down in the acceleration phase of its distribution. Alts haven’t expanded from this level of macro compression since Dec 2020. The next narrative is around the corner.” 
TechDev says the narrative that could ignite an altcoin surge is the launch of spot market Ethereum exchange-traded funds.
“Cue the next alt narrative right on time. ETH ETF.”

Solana is preparing for its bounce back as the asset hits the gas pedal near the $170 level, possibly changing the trajectory. Hopefully, the price level mentioned in the heading of this post turns out to be prophetic shortly. Recent price action does seem to suggest that Solana might be preparing for a significant breakout as it tests the $180 level in the near future.Now, turning the light on to technical indicators, there are plenty of buy signals in the price of Solana on the daily chart. The price has held properly on top of the 50-day moving average, which stands as a significant support in an uptrend rally. RSI pointing upward still has room to go until it reaches 70 and currently is above the 50 level, indicating rising buying pressure.SOL/USDT Chart by TradingViewMeanwhile, volume has risen aggressively over the last few days, an indication of growing demand and investor confidence in the future of Solana. The MACD indicator also holds that the bullish signals stay intact as the MACD line travels above the signal line. Of course, the road to $180 will be extremely thorny for Solana, with the first critical resistance lying around $175, where the price has met resistance in the past.If Solana manages to cross this, then the next target becomes the $180 level. If Solana further manages to break this level, then the bull rally might push even even higher to eye the $200 level. Investors have a positive outlook before the Ethereum ETF. The analysts believe that the next in line for an ETF is Solana. But it should be wiser to wait when the confirmation of the Ethereum ETF is here.

US Presidential Candidate Donald Trump's Historic Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Statements - Hard to Believe Promises, What's Going On? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Former President Donald Trump surprisingly declared his support for the cryptocurrency industry and promised to make the United States a global leader in this field if re-elected.
“The future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be in the United States. I will support the right of self-custody for the country's 50 million crypto holders,” Trump said. He also vowed to keep Senator Elizabeth Warren, a well-known critic of cryptocurrencies, away from Bitcoin.


Directly challenging the current administration's stance on digital currencies, Trump said, “I will never authorize Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and will put an end to President Joe Biden's fight to crush crypto.”
In a move that could have significant implications for the crypto world, Trump also said that he would consider the life sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Bitcoin-using Silk Road marketplace, served if he returns to the White House. Ulbricht's case had become iconic in the crypto community, which saw him as the victim of harsh punishment for crimes related to the establishment of an online marketplace that used Bitcoin for transactions.






Trump expressed his optimism about the potential of the crypto industry with the following words:

“I am very positive and open-minded towards cryptocurrency companies and everything related to this new and developing industry. Our country should be a leader in this field. There is no second place.”

He finished his statement by directly attacking President Biden, saying, “Biden wants the cryptocurrency industry to die a slow and painful death. That will never happen with me!” said.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rally Stalls: Details

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



Shiba Inu (SHIB) price action has gained attention in recent days as it battled a much-watched key resistance.However, the latest developments indicate a stall in the SHIB rally, prompting a closer examination of market trends, on-chain data and technical indicators.The crux of the SHIB price action is a key price range between $0.000024 and $0.000026, where 58.91 trillion SHIB were bought by 63,840 addresses at an average price of $0.000025, according to IntoTheBlock data.As SHIB approached the 58 trillion token threshold, the momentum that had propelled its price began to wane. This level has become a critical point of resistance, where bullish sentiment started to falter.Shiba Inu steadily declined for three days after reaching highs of $0.00002684 on May 22. Price rebounded before selling resumed with SHIB battling to stay above the daily SMA 50 at $0.0000245 in today's trading session.SHIB/USD Daily Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewAt the time of writing, SHIB was relinquishing its prior day gains, down 0.08% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002482.Although the exact reason for the SHIB price slowdown remains unknown, market dynamics and other factors might have come into play.The slowing at this point might suggest that the market is taking a moment to consolidate gains and consider the next move. Traders may be taking profits, while others could be waiting for a clearer signal to take action. Additionally, the overall sentiment in the crypto market plays a crucial role, as broader market trends often influence the performance of individual tokens.For SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it might likely need to overcome the 58 trillion SHIB threshold with renewed buying interest. The broader market movements may also need to be monitored to determine the SHIB price's next move.If the market regains momentum, a break past the $0.00002684 level might be needed to ascertain the start of a SHIB upside move. If this happens, SHIB might target the $0.00003285 level. In this scenario, SHIB might need to sustain above the daily SMA 50 at $0.0000245 to prevent further declines.If SHIB drops below the daily SMA 50 level, support is envisaged at $0.00002334 and $0.00002155.

Trump: ‘I Will Never Allow the Creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
On Saturday, former U.S. president Donald J. Trump made several pro-crypto comments on his social media platform Truth Social — which is part of the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and aims to provide an alternative to established social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook — and at a convention.



In this post, Trump Trump expressed strong support for the cryptocurrency industry, declaring himself open-minded and enthusiastic about its potential. He emphasized the importance of the United States leading in this emerging field, dismissing any notion of a secondary position. Contrasting his stance with that of President Joe Biden, whom he harshly criticized as the worst president in the country’s history, Trump accused Biden of attempting to stifle the industry. Trump assured his followers that under his leadership, the crypto sector would thrive and not face the slow demise he attributes to Biden’s policies.







Also, according to a report by CoinDesk, at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C., Trump criticized Biden’s approach to cryptocurrency and promised to protect the future of crypto and Bitcoin in the U.S. He assured the audience that he would oppose the establishment of a central bank digital currency and support the right to self-custody of digital assets: 



“I will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of bitcoin will be made in the USA, not driven overseas. I will support the right to self custody … To the nation’s fifty million crypto holders, I say this: I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.“







Trump’s recent comments indicate a shift towards a more pro-crypto stance.



Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s campaign introduced a fundraising page allowing donors to contribute using cryptocurrency through the Coinbase Commerce platform. This initiative marks a significant milestone as the first instance of a major party presidential nominee accepting cryptocurrency donations, thereby broadening the campaign’s digital fundraising strategies.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The campaign assures that all contributions will adhere to Federal Election Commission regulations, including limits and disclosure requirements. Supporters can now make compliant cryptocurrency donations at Trump Campaign Crypto Donations. Accepted cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, USD Coin, Solana, and 0x.



In a blog post, the campaign highlighted Trump’s efforts to reduce regulations and promote innovation in financial technology during his presidency, contrasting these policies with those of Democratic leaders like Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who are depicted as favoring increased government control over financial systems.



The campaign positions this move as part of a broader effort to enhance individual financial freedom and reduce governmental oversight. They assert that this announcement demonstrates Trump’s commitment to prioritizing personal liberty over “government control.”



Elizabeth Warren has been vocal about her concerns regarding cryptocurrency, reportedly aiming to build an “anti-crypto army” to impose stricter regulations. In contrast, Trump’s campaign is rallying supporters to form a “crypto army” to support the campaign leading up to the election on 5 November 2024.



According to CNBC, this strategy could provide a new stream of funds for Trump’s campaign, which, despite raising more money than Biden’s in April, still has less cash on hand. The report notes that Biden’s campaign remains skeptical of cryptocurrency, reflecting the administration’s cautious stance. Just before Trump’s campaign started appealing to crypto donors, Biden’s team issued a fundraising message warning that “cryptocurrency executives and oil barons are coming out of the woodwork for Trump.”



While Trump’s campaign claims he is the first major party nominee to embrace crypto donations, CNBC points out that he is not yet the official nominee. Additionally, Trump is not the first presidential candidate to accept cryptocurrency; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running as an independent, began accepting bitcoin donations in May 2023, and Senator Rand Paul accepted bitcoin during his 2015 presidential bid.

XRP’s behavior reflects the keenness with which crypto users observe developments in the SEC vs Ripple case, with an eventual outcome that could determine the altcoin’s long-term trend. For context, the SEC is seeking severe punishment for Ripple, with plans to appeal an initial judgment that partially exonerated the fintech firm from breaking the commission’s rules.









In a March 2024 remedies-related opening brief, the SEC filed that Ripple continued to breach U.S. securities laws after a December 2020 complaint. Following the claim, the commission sought the court to condemn Ripple to a $2 billion penalty and an injunction stopping the firm from selling XRP to institutional investors.



Meanwhile, Ripple responded to the SEC’s filing, claiming not to have breached the laws of the land. Ripple claimed it sold XRP to accredited investors or through ODL contract-based sales. The blockchain firm seeks to convince Judge Torres to rule in its favor to avoid a potential $2 billion penalty and an injunction.



The crypto community appears to be keenly observing how the case will unfold, especially with the SEC’s recent Ethereum ETF approval that surprised many users. A favorable judgment for Ripple could inject an upside momentum for XRP, setting the altcoin up for a significant bull run.



Despite low volatility, XRP has experienced three days of continued upside momentum. The embattled altcoin closed above its opening price for the past three days, reflecting a positive outlook among community members. The embattled altcoin traded for $0.53910 as of the time of writing, following a 0.42% pullback from the previous day’s 1.43% gain, according to data from TradingView.

Will US Crypto Foe Gary Gensler Remain SEC Chair? When is the Change? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Investment bank TD Cowen's research group noted that the latest approval of Ethereum ETFs is an expected development following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.
The approval, which came nearly six months earlier than expected, was seen as inevitable after the SEC approved Ethereum Futures ETFs.


“After the SEC approved crypto futures ETFs, this decision was inevitable,” Jaret Seiberg, a member of TD Cowen's Washington Research Group, said in a note Thursday. He also predicted that the next product could be a “basket of crypto tokens” within a year, possibly consisting of just Bitcoin and Ethereum, but potentially more.

Gensler said:

“The crypto industry's track record of failures, scams, and bankruptcies is not because we don't have rules, or because the rules are unclear.
“This is because many investors in the crypto industry do not play by the rules.”

This Week on Crypto Twitter: Six Days That Changed the Industry Forever? - Decrypt

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for DecryptIt's always difficult to overstate the level of chaos and madness typically present on Crypto Twitter, and within the digital assets industry, on any given day. But it’s equally hard to think of a single week that brought such monumental—and unexpected—plot twists and developments as this one. Things got to a slow start on Monday—until the afternoon brought declarations from Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, two Bloomberg ETF analysts that have emerged as main characters of the Crypto Twittersphere this year, suddenly announced that they were radically adjusting their previous probabilities that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve spot Ethereum ETFs by a Thursday deadline.Twitter—and ETH’s price—immediately exploded. For weeks, the prospect of spot ETH ETF approval in May had been written off as fanciful, for multiple reasons. Now, with 72 hours to go before the SEC's May 23 decision cutoff, the game was back on? ETH soared over 20% on the news overnight. Potential ETH ETF issuers kicked from business as usual into overdrive as the industry's prevailing mood accelerated into frantic excitement. In real-time, Twitter users attempted to piece together the narrative. How could this have even happened? Experts pointed to seeds planted last week, when a string of surprising shifts in the political winds may have transformed crypto from divisive, niche wedge issue into a matter of bipartisan consensus.The narrative appeared validated on Thursday, when—right at the buzzer—the SEC quietly approved all pending spot ETH ETF applications. Crypto Twitter exploded in a cacophony of celebration. Industry leaders, including Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal, hailed the week’s events as unlike any he’d previously witnessed.As if that wasn’t enough: amidst the entire mind-boggling ETH ETF saga, the U.S. House of Representatives handily passed a bill aimed at creating a crypto regulatory framework, FIT21.The narrative of a historic, overnight realignment of crypto’s long-tenuous relationship with the American government had solidified. Just a week ago, such a state of play would have been dismissed as unthinkable by many.Some cautioned that said narrative might also be too good to be true, however. Certain aspects of FIT21, for example, might be more hostile to crypto than many realize, crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro wrote.  As Crypto Twitter was largely jubilant—for good reason—history may just show a battle won in a longer war. “We have to stay vigilant,” Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin told Decrypt. “We can't assume that we’re not going to be attacked again.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

2 Trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in Last 24 Hours: Are Whales Coming Back?

Shiba Inu whales are on the verge of waking up as transactional activity on large wallets seems to be surging and reaching almost 2 trillion. However, the lack of momentum in the market suggests that it is too early to celebrate, and those transfers might simply be tied to funds redistribution rather than anything significant for the price.Fresh data has emerged that more transactions are happening within the Shiba Inu network. For the last 24 hours, 147 large transactions have occurred, whose cumulative volume is valued at 1.9 trillion SHIB. The activity bounces off a seven-day low of 82 transactions that took place on May 19, 2024.Analyzing surgeA sudden spike in big transactions could mean numerous things. For one, it's a good probability that large holders in the market are just redistributing their assets. This movement of funds might be related to internal wallet reorganizations, with preparations for future market moves, or simple asset redistribution for liquidity purposes.Source: IntoTheBlockAll of this fueled the volume of transactions, but the general feeling around SHIB remained pretty neutral. Price showed no actual upward motion and was still close to $0.000024. The relative strength index confirmed a lack of buying power as well by staying above the 50-point neutral level.Potential implicationsStill, the fact that actions from such whales are visible gives no clear indicator that the price also necessarily increases. The dynamics of the market suggest that these large moves might actually amount to no new investment but circulating capital from existing holders. In that regard, the small price effect was affected at best, and SHIB remains within a tight horizontal range.This would require sustained buying pressure and overall market optimism for SHIB to really experience a bull run. Indicators are showing signs of a bullish breakout, but not just yet. Investors watch support and resistance zones at $0.000022 and $0.000026, respectively, with a keen interest in the level market movement.

Top Trader Predicts Ethereum Will Massively Outperform Bitcoin, Says One ‘Golden Child’ Memecoin Set To Go Higher - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed trader says that Ethereum (ETH) is about to vastly outrun Bitcoin (BTC) and is predicting one memecoin will rally hard.
Pseudonymous trader Bluntz tells his 259,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s got his eye on the two-week chart of the Ethereum versus Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair.










The trader says that ETH/BTC is just days away from printing a rare bullish divergence, hinting at an outperformance of Ethereum over Bitcoin. A bullish divergence may indicate reversal areas amid rising momentum even though the price moves down or sideways.
Bluntz targets the 0.1 BTC level ($6,907), which is nearly 95% above current levels of ETH/BTC.
“Only eight days to go until ETH/BTC prints the first two-week bullish divergence since *checks notes*…. never.
0.1 [BTC] is obviously the target but we either undershoot or overshoot the f..k out of that.”
Source: Bluntz/X
Outside of Ethereum, Bluntz is also bullish on the frog-themed memecoin Pepe (PEPE) – which he says is the best-looking major coin of its sector.
He says Pepe will be the “golden child” of memecoins while ETH/BTC bottoms out and regains traction.
“Look like PEPE was the best-looking meme of the majors after all.
With ETH/BTC likely bottomed (in my opinion), I think it will continue to be the golden child meme moving forward and likely goes higher than many are expecting possible but at the end of the day we’re all speculating here.”
Source: Bluntz/X
At time of writing, PEPE is worth $0.000015.

Donald Trump declares support for crypto, insists US must not settle for ‘second place’


    Former President and leading 2024 Republican candidate Donald Trump has voiced his strongest support for cryptocurrency to date. 



Not long after endorsing the cryptocurrency sector as a cornerstone of his presidential bid, Trump reiterated his strong support for digital assets.



In a May 25 post on Truth Social, a social media platform owned by Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), he stated:”Our country must be the leader in the field, there is no second place.” 











This pro-crypto stance, shared just before his appearance at the Libertarian National Convention, marks a significant shift in his views as he prepares for the 2024 presidential race.



Cryptocurrency donations and campaign strategy



Trump’s campaign began accepting cryptocurrency donations on May 21 via Coinbase Commerce. 




“I am very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry,” -Trump stated, contrasting his approach with that of President Joe Biden’s administration.




In recent years, Trump expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies compared to the U.S. dollar and supported stringent regulations on digital currencies. 



However, after a successful venture into Trump-branded NFT trading cards and with crypto policy emerging as a significant campaign issue, Trump now appears poised to position himself as the pro-crypto candidate.



Following Trump’s pro-crypto announcements, sentiment appears to be shifting. The U.S. House of Representatives passed its first comprehensive crypto market structure bill, aiming to regulate the industry broadly. The measure now heads to the Senate. 



Additionally, the S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved key regulatory filings for ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking significant progress toward their availability in the U.S.



Pledge to pardon Ross Ulbricht



In a related development, Trump has pledged to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road darknet market, if re-elected. 



Ulbricht, convicted in 2015, is currently serving two life terms plus forty years without parole. 



“If you vote for me, on day one I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht,” Trump promised at the Libertarian Party’s National Convention, signaling his commitment to the crypto community.



Trump’s evolving stance on cryptocurrency, from accepting donations to advocating for pro-crypto policies, marks a notable shift.



As the 2024 election approaches, his position on crypto could influence regulatory perspectives and voter support, potentially reshaping the landscape of digital asset regulation in the United States.

Ethereum devs set Pectra upgrade for Q1 2025 - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Ethereum’s anticipated Pectra upgrade is now scheduled for release by the end of Q1 2025, according to recent updates from Ethereum developers. Pectra is the next major milestone on Ethereum’s development roadmap, following the Dencun upgrade which was successfully deployed in March.The decision comes after Ethereum developers evaluated multiple timeline scenarios. The team has opted against a rushed release before Devcon in November 2024, favoring a more cautious approach that allows for the inclusion of additional, impactful user features.“We are observing that this is also what happened with Cancun, so being realistic, my vote would be to aim to ship Prague in Q1 2025. With today’s scope, delaying Prague seems to have marginal impact on users and allows us to consider expanding the scope to include more impactful features for users,” Ethereum developers noted in a document.Devcon is the largest developer summit in the Asia Pacific region. This year, the event will take place in Bangkok, Thailand, from November 12-15, aiming to bring together developers, technology leaders, and dev-tool companies to learn, discuss, and debate the key opportunities and challenges in the developer ecosystem.Avoiding releasing the Pectra upgrade before/during Devcon will allow the developer team to effectively monitor the execution of Pectra.During the deployment of Dencun on the Goerli testnet in January, Ethereum developers encountered difficulties achieving consensus within the expected timeframe. The issue was then resolved, allowing the Goerli testnet to finally reach consensus.In addition to the upgrade timeline, the focus is on improvements in the consensus layer scope and execution layer scope. Developers aim to integrate PeerDAS into Pectra to enhance Ethereum’s Data Availability capacity ahead of the Osaka upgrade, as noted in the document.Ethereum’s Osaka upgrade is a future hard fork that is expected to include features that were previously considered for the Pectra upgrade but have been postponed. Specifically, the Osaka upgrade is likely to include the implementation of Verkle Tree, a new data structure designed to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and decentralization.Developers also considered the inclusion of EOF to improve smart contract security and developer experience, as well as other enhancements like replacing EIP-3074 with EIP-7702 for better account abstraction compatibility, and patching EIP-2935.“We need to decide on EIP7702 on ACDE, and if so, implement it as a replacement for EIP-3074. We think it makes sense to do so as it’s a more native-AA compatible solution because of the new transaction type vs an opcode,” Ethereum developers wrote.EIP-7702 is a new transaction type proposed by a group of prominent Ethereum developers, including Vitalik Buterin, earlier this month. The proposal is expected to bring similar benefits to EIP-3074 while addressing its potential risks.

Cardano (ADA) Triumphs: 10 Million Tokens Milestone Achieved

The Cardano network has reached a significant milestone, surpassing 10 million native tokens. This achievement underscores Cardano's increasing adoption within the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.Native tokens allow the transacting of multi-assets on Cardano. Cardano uniquely allows users to transact with ADA, as well as an unlimited number of user-defined (custom) tokens natively.Native support has specific advantages for developers: There is no need to create smart contracts to handle custom tokens, for example, which eliminates an additional layer of complexity and the possibility of manual errors because the ledger manages all token-related functionality.According to the most recent IOG weekly report, native tokens have reached 10 million with 120,576 token policies. Currently, network transactions have reached 90.8 million, while Plutus scripts are at 46,698.Looking ahead, the Cardano network is poised for further growth and expansion. The continued development of its smart contract capabilities and the upcoming upgrades such as the Chang network upgrade are expected to attract even more users to the platform.ADA price actionCardano's ADA recent price rise appears to have stalled under the pressure of its daily moving averages.ADA began to rise gradually and reached highs of $0.51 on May 21 before running into resistance. After that, ADA decreased for four days in a row before rising again. Selling has continued, with ADA down 0.33% to $0.4611 at the time of writing, during the last 24 hours.The 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) have posed significant barriers to the rising trend of ADA since the beginning of April. Further conjecture over the short-term price trajectory of ADA is raised by a recent crossing that showed a death cross. The 50-day EMA serves as an immediate resistance level for ADA in the short term, which it must surpass to indicate a possible rally.Following the approval of Ethereum ETFs, traders, and analysts will continue to watch the indicators and market signals closely, ready to adjust their strategies in response to ADA's next significant move. The coming days and weeks will be crucial in determining the direction of ADA's price.

Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BUTSUCKS will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Buterin Sucks.



Currently, Buterin Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BUTSUCKS on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Buterin Sucks by entering its contract address – jr8okimfHEWaJpDmiZenkGWHzEr5bb53bDZf4kQvF7w – in the receiving field.



BUTSUCKS currently has a market cap of just under $12,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Donald Trump Promises Big Changes for Crypto Industry


Former US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his support for the cryptocurrency industry, expressing a strong commitment to its growth.
On May 25, the former president made several pro-crypto statements before the November election.
Donald Trump’s Latest Pledges to the Crypto Industry

Donald Trump strongly supported the cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing that the United States must strive to be a global leader in this growing sector.

“I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field. There is no second place,” Trump stated.

He further contrasted his stance with that of President Joe Biden, whom he accused of wanting to stifle the crypto industry. “That will never happen with me,” Trump asserted. Later, at the Libertarian Party’s National Convention in Washington, Trump told attendees that he would protect their right to self-custody crypto assets and prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). 

“I will support the right to self-custody. To the nation’s fifty million crypto holders, I say this: I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency,” Trump addded.

Remarkably, the former President also pledged to pardon Ross Ulbricht if re-elected. In 2015, a court sentenced Ulbricht to two consecutive life terms plus 40 years for creating and operating Silk Road, a darknet marketplace primarily used for drug transactions. However, many in the crypto community argue that Ulbricht’s sentence represents a governmental overreach. 

 “If you vote for me, on Day one, I will commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence to time served. He’s already served 11 years, and we’re going to get him home,” Trump promised.


Meanwhile, Trump’s pro-crypto stance appears to be enhancing his election prospects. According to Polymarket, a popular crypto-based prediction platform, Donald Trump has a 56% chance of winning the election, compared to Biden’s 38%.

Trump’s chances increased substantially over the past months following a series of pro-crypto actions and statements. Notably, his campaign has begun accepting crypto donations in various digital assets, including Bitcoin, making him the first major candidate to do so.

In response, the Biden administration has noticeably shifted its approach to crypto. The White House has expressed interest in working with Congress on effective crypto regulations. Additionally, the crypto-skeptic Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved an Ethereum ETF, marking a significant policy shift.

ETF Approval Changes Everything, Says Ethereum Co-Founder Joe Lubin - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFew weeks in crypto’s short history have seen as much progress as this one. In Washington, D.C., a sudden confluence of bipartisan support coalescing behind a crypto regulation bill on Wednesday, followed the next day by the stunning eleventh-hour approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).   To Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin, both events—particularly the SEC’s about-face on Ethereum—represent a seismic shift in how crypto is treated in America, and will be moving forward.“I think this is a game changer,” the entrepreneur told Decrypt in an exclusive interview.Consensys, the $7 billion Ethereum software company founded by Lubin, is currently ensnared in multiple legal battles with the SEC over crypto’s legal status. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) But Lubin believes this week’s events may have proved that crypto has graduated to a higher status within the American power apparatus—upending the calculus for such battles. “My guess is that this is now an extremely important political issue,” he said. “And that overrides.”“If you want to get elected, you’re probably going to either need to have the blockchain decentralized protocol ecosystem on your side,” Lubin continued. “Or at least you don’t want them to hate you.”As Lubin sees it, the SEC’s decision to approve spot ETH ETFs was undeniably a last-minute political decision, potentially put in motion by a request—or demand—from the White House itself.That political pressure, multiple crypto lobbyists in Washington previously told Decrypt, likely stemmed from a series of election-related developments last week.SEC leadership likely feels no different about crypto than it did a week ago—the silence from the agency has been deafening—but political pressures may have now thrown a wrench in its aggressive, ongoing legal crusade against top American crypto firms like Consensys. Lubin isn’t letting down his guard just yet, however. “We have to stay vigilant,” he said. “We can't assume that we’re not going to be attacked again.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

                        The FTX estate, responsible for managing the defunct exchange’s bankruptcy, has auctioned off the last of its heavily discounted Solana (SOL) tokens.The tokens were sold to Pantera Capital and Figure Markets at a significantly reduced price as part of efforts to reimburse creditors and former clients.FTX Sold $2.6 Billion Worth Of Solana Token (SOL)In a bid to compensate creditors and former clients, the FTX estate sold the last of its Solana tokens, valued at $2.6 billion, to Pantera Capital and Figure Markets. The tokens were sold at $102 per token, well below the current market price of $168. Figure Markets acquired 800,000 SOL tokens, while Pantera Capital obtained the remaining lot.A four-year vesting schedule for the tokens will be implemented as part of the agreement with the purchasers. This structured release aims to mitigate potential market impacts from the large transaction.The FTX bankruptcy estate has recovered $7.3 billion in assets so far. However, the recovery efforts have not been without controversy.Sunil Kavuri, a creditor leading the FTX creditor community, criticized the estate’s decision to sell assets at such deep discounts. He argued that the digital assets should have been returned to the creditors and clients directly rather than sold cheaply.Kavuri stated, “Sullivan & Cromwell has trampled over our property rights. They have liquidated billions of dollars of crypto assets. There’s a token S&C sold at 11 cents; it’s now trading at two dollars. FTX had $10 billion in Solana tokens — they sold it at a 70% discount.”His sentiments reflect broader frustrations among those affected by the FTX collapse, who have long been critical of the actions taken by the estate’s bankruptcy lawyers, Sullivan & Cromwell. The court ordered an independent investigation into Sullivan & Cromwell’s role in the bankruptcy proceedings, ultimately clearing them of collusion with FTX. Despite this, criticisms persist regarding the handling of asset sales.Following the announcement of the bankruptcy auctions, SOL’s price dropped by 4%, but the alternative layer-1 network continues to show strong price performance. SOL is currently on an uptrend that began in November 2023, reaching a high of $210.Uncovering More Corruption Surrounding FTX
According to an independent examiner’s report by Robert Cleary, FTX Group allegedly paid over $25 million in hush money to seven whistleblowers before the crypto exchange’s collapse in November 2022.The report revealed that FTX settled claims with whistleblowers who raised concerns about various improprieties, including systemic issues and misleading regulators. These settlements, handled primarily by attorney Daniel Friedberg, ranged from $1.8 million to $16 million.For instance, one whistleblower received $16 million after alleging the exchange misled regulators and lacked proper corporate structure, while another, who worked at Alameda Research for less than three months, received $2 million for raising concerns about regulatory and governance issues.Notably, US prosecutors are seeking a 5—to 7-year sentence for former FTX executive Ryan Salame, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and operating an illegal money-transmitting business during his tenure as CEO of FTX’s Bahamian subsidiary. Salame’s charges include orchestrating a scheme allowing customers to use U.S.-based bank accounts without federal compliance and participating in illegal political donations amounting to over $100 million. Prosecutors argue that his offenses are significant, involving more than $1 billion in unlicensed transactions, and call for a substantial sentence to ensure appropriate punishment and deter future offenses.The UK government’s Charity Commission investigation also recently found that Effective Ventures Foundation, an FTX-funded charity, acted diligently and quickly to protect its funds after FTX’s collapse. Following FTX’s collapse, Effective Ventures disclosed its connections to the exchange, prompting a regulatory probe. The charity repaid $4.3 million to the FTX estate, matching the total amount it received from FTX and its foundation in 2022. Effective Ventures’ interim CEO, Zachary Robinson, stated that EV UK and EV US collectively repaid $26.8 million to the FTX estate, covering all funds received.

Will US Crypto Foe Gary Gensler Remain SEC Chair? When is the Change? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Investment bank TD Cowen's research group noted that the latest approval of Ethereum ETFs is an expected development following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.
The approval, which came nearly six months earlier than expected, was seen as inevitable after the SEC approved Ethereum Futures ETFs.



However, the approval does not indicate a change in the SEC's overall attitude towards crypto, according to analysts. Gary Gensler, the agency's crypto-critical president, issued a “highly critical” statement opposing the adoption of crypto legislation that could diminish his agency's power.






Gensler said:

“The crypto industry's track record of failures, scams, and bankruptcies is not because we don't have rules, or because the rules are unclear.
“This is because many investors in the crypto industry do not play by the rules.”

Despite potential setbacks for Gensler's agency, TD Cowen predicts the SEC will maintain its Democratic majority through 2026. The research group expects the agency to continue taking action against crypto trading platforms that trade tokens believed to be unregistered securities.

RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) to Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because RIPDOGEY has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, RIP DOGEY can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and RIP DOGEY could become the next viral memecoin.



RIP DOGEY launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy RIP DOGEY on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for RIP DOGEY by entering its contract address – GVZoEtPFj1fMuW2zA4Zww27Mcx1yJSobrW3hzp5hfqCe – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like RIPDOGEY.

Shiba Inu's Shibarium Skyrockets 60% in Key On-Chain Metric in 24 Hours


The Shiba Inu ecosystem has witnessed a notable rise in activity on its Shibarium network, marked by an increase in a key blockchain metric over the last 24 hours. Shibariumscan reports that transaction volume jumped from 5,150 to 7,930, reflecting a notable 60% growth.This spike in transaction volume has concurrently led to a sharp increase in network fees. The amount of BONE tokens used to pay these fees climbed from 16.68 BONE to 32 BONE during the same period.As per Shibarium's transaction model, BONE are used for transaction fees, and a portion of these tokens is converted into SHIB, which are then burned. This burning process decreases the circulating supply of Shiba Inu tokens, potentially boosting their price over time.Source: ShibariumscanSeveral elements are driving this surge in network activity. Recent market volatility has heightened investor interest in Shiba Inu tokens, leading to an increase in transaction demand on Shibarium.Source: ShibariumscanThis heightened activity is evidenced by a 13.7% increase in active accounts on the network, rising from 687 to 781. Notably, while active user numbers grew, new account creation slightly declined, suggesting that the existing user base is fueling this surge in activity.It seems that the dual advantages of rising transaction volumes and the systematic reduction of SHIB tokens through burning are driving the network's growth and potential for future value appreciation. This dynamic is likely encouraging SHIB enthusiasts to remain engaged and continue investing in the Shiba Inu network.

Retail traders dominate the action on Ethereum as the ETF narrative takes over


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved, on May 23, securities exchanges’ listing of Ethereum (ETH) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETH’s price surged following the news as related keywords started dominating the cryptocurrency space.



However, Vini Barbosa spotted divergent data on Santiment’s Sanbase Pro charts, suggesting retail traders currently dominate the Ethereum market.



In particular, Ethereum’s social dominance reached year-over-year highs at 14.21%, strongly dominating other cryptocurrencies in social indicators. This index alone usually suggests retail traders are the protagonists in the current action, and whales have previously opened positions.







Additionally, a key on-chain metric of network activity made one-year lows, showing divergence with the price and social indicators. Ethereum registered a weekly $7.63 million in on-chain transaction volume, which validates retail traders’ protagonism with lower relative volume.

Retail traders navigate Ethereum ETF news



From another perspective, Finbold also gathered data from Santiment that reveals the keywords “Ethereum,” or “ETH” dominated social context together with “ETF” on May 23 with 563 mentions on social platforms and a 4.05% dominance over other trending keywords.

Interestingly, most media outlets and influencers covered the SEC’s first-step approval of Ethereum ETFs, which the crowd replicated in groups. This could have fueled retail’s ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO), driving ETH price upwards on crypto exchanges.



Yet, it is important to understand that the ETFs still need further approvals from the regulatory agency to start trading. The SEC currently only approved NASDAQ, CBOE, and NYSE to list the assets, but not the assets’ issuers themselves.



ETH price analysis



As of this writing, Ethereum was trading at $3,811, up 1% over its price on May 23. Moreover, ETH has nearly 22% accumulated gains month-over-month, suggesting institutional traders were already previously pricing the ETF news.

Now, ETH must be able to keep its momentum despite the drop in related social indicators and network activity. This will be challenging, and a weaker momentum with retail traders’ dominance could foreshadow a price correction before further surges.



Investors must remain cautious and avoid opening positions under FOMO, making rational and thoughtful decisions moving forward.

Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) Will Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BUTSUCKS will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Buterin Sucks.



Currently, Buterin Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BUTSUCKS on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Buterin Sucks by entering its contract address – jr8okimfHEWaJpDmiZenkGWHzEr5bb53bDZf4kQvF7w – in the receiving field.




BUTSUCKS currently has a market cap of just under $12,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

PEPE: 100% Gains In 30 Days, But Can It Keep Its Composure?


																The cryptocurrency world is witnessing a familiar sight: a meme coin on fire. PEPE, a token emblazoned with the internet’s favorite frog, has skyrocketed in recent weeks, leaving investors wondering if this is the dawn of a new era or a fleeting fad.

PEPE On A Tear: New Highs And Whale Activity
Over the past month, PEPE has been on a tear, exceeding expectations and leaving a trail of green for investors. The price triumphantly reached a new all-time high, surging over 100% in just 30 days. This astronomical rise translated to happy hodlers, with IntoTheBlock data revealing that a whopping 97% were sitting pretty in profit.
CoinGecko data show that Pepe has risen 56% in the previous week and 99% in the last month, recovering its position as the third-largest meme coin by market capitalization from Dogwifhat (WIF).
The bullish momentum hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. The past 24 hours saw another surge of 3.7%, further propelling PEPE to its current peak. This impressive performance has garnered significant attention, not just financially, but also on social media. The coin’s social volume has spiked, indicating a surge in interest and online chatter.

Adding fuel to the fire, a whale, a term used for large investors with significant buying power, has been making waves. Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, recently reported a whale withdrawing a staggering 500 billion PEPE from Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange. This mass accumulation suggests a whale-sized vote of confidence in PEPE’s future.
Buying Frenzy Or Overheated Engine?
While the recent price increase and social media buzz are undoubtedly positive signs, some analysts are urging caution. A closer look at technical indicators reveals potential signs of an overheated market. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures buying and selling pressure, has registered a decline.

Similarly, the Money Flow Index (MFI) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are both hovering in the overbought zone, suggesting PEPE’s price might be due for a correction.
Further complicating the picture is the presence of selling pressure. While some investors are piling in, others might be cashing out on their profits. Santiment, a crypto analytics platform, observed a rise in PEPE’s exchange outflow last week, indicating buying pressure. However, they also noted an increase in supply on exchanges, suggesting some investors might be taking advantage of the high price to sell.

Potential Price Correction
NewsBTC analyzed PEPE’s daily chart to gauge the impact of this potential selling pressure. Their analysis suggests that the price might first fall to $0.0000122 before potentially finding support and initiating another bull run. However, a deeper correction could see PEPE plummet to $0.000010 or even lower.

The Most Traded Memecoin
Meanhwhile, Pepe was still among the most traded cryptocurrency assets over the previous day, according to data from Binance, with only BNB Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) surpassing it.
Pepe continues to be the most traded meme coin, surpassing popular coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Floki (FLOKI), and Shiba Inu (SHIB).

Political support is bad for Bitcoin in the long run: Samson Mow - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Former Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow believes that the newfound political support for Bitcoin could weaken its core principles and increase the risk of future failures that could harm users.“I’m not bullish on politicians becoming pro “crypto.” It may feel nice given the prior hostile anti-crypto stances, but long term it’s bad for Bitcoin,” Mow stated in a recent post on X.According to Mow, political involvement potentially compromises Bitcoin’s strength. He pointed out that the shift in stance could lead to similar collapses like FTX or Luna and ultimately harm the entire ecosystem.“Without a strong Bitcoin ethos, this shift only paves the way for the next FTX/Luna/Genesis, & once again, we will pay for it,” he added.Mow’s comments follow a post by Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known advocate for crypto’s future in the US.Mow didn’t oppose the fact that Lummis is one of the most genuine pro-Bitcoin politicians. However, he disagreed with Lummis grouping Bitcoin with other crypto assets. He said that many people, including politicians who are becoming pro-Bitcoin, might not understand the difference between Bitcoin and other crypto assets.Crypto has become an increasingly influential factor in US politics in recent years, with industry entities investing heavily in lobbying and campaign contributions to shape regulations and elect sympathetic representatives.Over the past two weeks, US lawmakers have voted on three crypto-related bills, including H.J.Res. 109, a bill seeking to overturn SEC’s crypto rule SAB 121, FIT21, a bill created to establish a regime to regulate US crypto markets, and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, a legislation aiming to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).The most remarkable development is that the Biden administration has softened its stance toward crypto. Instead of threatening a veto of FIT21, which the White House did with H.J.Res. 109, it only voiced concerns about the lack of investor protection.Some experts and industry figures suggest that the recent listing approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US may be partly influenced by political considerations.They speculate that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision might have been impacted by potential pressure from the Biden administration, which has long faced criticism for its stance on crypto regulation.Observers believe these moves are part of a strategy to win votes in the upcoming presidential election, especially since Donald Trump, Biden’s biggest competitor, has publicly advocated making the US a crypto leader. Trump also aims to end hostility toward the industry.

Legendary trader foresees major crypto disaster ahead


    The recent approval of Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by regulatory bodies marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency history. 



Amidst this development, veteran trader Peter Brandt has raised alarms, warning of potential disasters in the crypto staking sector following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green light for spot Ethereum ETFs.



Peter Brandt, a well-known figure in the trading community, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on May 24 to express his grim outlook. 







“The biggest disasters yet to come in crypto will be related to staking,” Brandt predicted, emphasizing the potential for significant financial losses and bankruptcies.







Potential regulatory impact



Brandt’s recent warnings are part of a broader critique he has been voicing. Earlier this month, he predicted a full-scale SEC assault on crypto staking, describing it as a “bloodbath” and deeming the practice “illegal as hell.”



Brandt’s comments came in the wake of the SEC’s unexpected approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs, a decision that caught many in the crypto industry off guard. 



Previously, the SEC had not engaged with issuers, but it suddenly began interacting with them and requested resubmissions of filings on an accelerated basis. 



Despite the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, the SEC has not clarified whether Ethereum is classified as a security or a commodity. Notably, all issuers of these ETFs did not include staking in their applications, which highlights a critical distinction.



Concerns and reactions from the crypto community



Brandt elaborated on his concerns in follow-up posts, outlining the potential negative impacts of staking on the market.



He pointed out that crypto staking involves owning, borrowing, or leveraging assets such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum. These assets are typically lent out to earn revenue, often in the form of interest. 



Brandt cautioned that as staking becomes more widespread and accepted, it could attract increased scrutiny and regulation from central banks, government treasuries, and other authorities.



He was skeptical of the profitability of staking, comparing it to collapsed scams like Ponzi schemes, where high returns were often fraudulent. He warned that the introduction of new regulations could fundamentally change the crypto space or even lead to the end of staking.







Brandt’s predictions have sparked significant debate within the crypto community. Before issuing his controversial statements, Brandt acknowledged that his opinions might not be well received by supporters of popular digital assets such as Ethereum and Solana.



True to his prediction, many community members dismissed his warnings. Critics argued that Brandt was uninformed about the staking process and overstating its risks. 



One community member criticized Brandt for his statement, asserting that he was exaggerating the impacts of staking by claiming it would result in a “disaster.” 



Another member clarified that staking involves using coins or tokens to verify and secure the consensus mechanism of a blockchain rather than simply lending assets for interest.



The future of crypto staking remains uncertain, with Brandt’s warnings highlighting potential risks from increased regulatory scrutiny and government intervention. 



As the crypto industry continues to evolve, stakeholders must navigate these challenges carefully to avoid potential financial disasters. 



The recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC marks a turning point, but it also brings to light the complexities and uncertainties that lie ahead for the crypto staking sector.

Dogecoin Whales Disappear After DOGE Meme Dog Kabosu's Passing


Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen a noticeable decline in the activity of major players, or "whales," coinciding with the recent passing of Kabosu, the dog immortalized in the iconic Doge meme. Analysis of key metrics shows a significant decline in whale activity.Thus, according to IntoTheBlock, large transactions involving DOGE have dropped significantly over the past 24 hours, down 29.69% to 6.63 billion DOGE. Of particular note is the drop in transactions exceeding $100,000, from $1.56 billion to $1.12 billion, with 1,300 such transactions recorded during the period.The decline in whale activity is also evidenced by a marked reduction in the inflow and outflow of funds to wallets containing at least 0.1% of DOGE's circulating supply. Inflows into these wallets fell 87.52% to a modest 59.86 million coins, while outflows fell to 103.87 million coins, down 29.59% from the previous day.Source: IntoTheBlockThis decline coincided with the announcement of the death of dog Kabosu by its owner on social media. Kabosu's image became synonymous with the Doge meme, which later inspired the creation of Dogecoin in 2013. With a current market capitalization of $24.43 billion and daily trading volume approaching $2 billion, Dogecoin has a major place in the cryptocurrency market.While a direct link between Kabosu's death and the decline in whale activity remains speculative, it is possible that the emotional resonance associated with the beloved dog may have influenced investor sentiment.

Analytics Company Santiment Shares the Most Trending Altcoin Right Now and Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment shared the token that it thinks is the most trending altcoin of the recent period in its statement.
According to analysts, Ondo (ONDO) is the most trending altcoin in the cryptocurrency world with its 75% rise in the last 11 days. Analysts say ONDO's performance is hard to miss.


Santiment attributes the reason for this price increase and high trend to the increase in the number of ONDO wallets containing assets, which was 5,110 on February 26, to 33,225 wallets today. This means that the number of wallets has increased by 550%. During the same time period, the price of the altcoin increased by approximately 200%.

ONDO, a real-world assets (RWA) themed altcoin, claims to be bringing US bonds to the cryptocurrency world.





However, the altcoin is not listed on Binance at the time of writing this article. However, interestingly, this time Coinbase acted earlier than Binance and listed ONDO. Bybit, Kraken and Kucoin, other major cryptocurrency exchanges, are also among the exchanges currently listing ONDO.

Turkey Will Discuss Cryptocurrency Regulation in Parliament This Week: Here's What to Expect - Bitcoin Sistemi


A regulation determining the legal framework of cryptocurrencies is coming to the agenda of the Parliamentary Planning and Budget Commission this week. With the changes to be made in the Capital Markets Law, the legal definition of crypto assets will be made.
With this regulation, the establishment and activities of crypto asset service providers will need to obtain permission from the Capital Markets Board. Authority for the issuance, sale and distribution of crypto assets will be given to the Capital Markets Board.


Making a statement last week, AK Party Group Chairman Abdullah Güler shared the details of the bill. According to Güler, the bill contains 19 articles.

Cryptocurrency exchanges will start providing services by obtaining a license from the CMB. This aims to ensure that investors can trade safely under the supervision of the CMB.
Crypto asset service providers will be obliged to ensure the security of their information systems. In this context, the criteria to be determined by TÜBİTAK regarding technological infrastructure will be specified in the law.
The sale and distribution of crypto assets will be determined by the CMB. For crypto asset issuance, a preliminary report will be received from TÜBİTAK.
Contractual provisions that limit or eliminate the liability of crypto asset service providers to their customers will be deemed invalid. Control mechanisms will be established to examine investors' complaints and objections. Measures will be taken against market-distorting transactions.
Procedures and principles regarding crypto investment consultancy will be regulated by the CMB.
Customer assets cannot be seized due to the debts of cryptocurrency exchanges.
CMB will monitor exchanges that operate without permission.
Providing crypto asset services without permission will be considered a crime under the Turkish Penal Code and the penalty will be imprisonment from 3 to 5 years.
There will be a transition period for organizations currently operating. Those operating will apply to the board within 1 month or take a decision on liquidation within 3 months.
The activities of crypto asset providers operating abroad will also end with the transition period.


The following was said about the taxation of cryptocurrencies:






“The statement in the proposal, 'Each year, one percent of all revenues of the platforms, excluding the interest income of the previous year, will be paid to the Board and one percent will be recorded as income by paying to the TUBITAK budget by the end of May of the relevant year', relates to the payments to be made by the platforms. “In the proposed law, there is no tax regulation for end users who buy and sell through the platforms.”

Dogwifhat smashes past $3: Will WIF reach $5 soon? - AMBCrypto



Buying pressure on WIF increased over the last few days. 
WIF must go above $3.30 in order to sustain its bull rally.

Dogwifhat [WIF] bulls have stepped up their game over the last few days, as the meme coin registered a double-digit growth. 
As a result, WIF broke above a bullish pattern, which has the potential to cause further growth in the coming days. 
WIF bulls are winning
According to CoinMarketCap, WIF investors were having a great week as the meme coin’s price increased by a healthy 20% in the last seven days. 
The bulls pushed even harder in the last 24 hours as WIF’s value surged by 8%.
 At the time of writing, Dogwifhat was trading at $3.11 with a market capitalization of over $43.1 billion, making it the 38th largest crypto. 
The recent price uptick also allowed the meme coin to break above a symmetrical triangle pattern. Captain Faibik, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting this development. 
The tweet mentioned that WIF consolidated inside the pattern for the last 80 days before finally breaking out, which could result in an 80%–90% bull rally soon. 
Apart from this, Lookonchain recently posted a tweet that pointed out that buying pressure on the meme coin was high. 
According to the tweet, a whale spent 17,966 SOL, worth $2.98 million, to buy 953,177 WIF at $3.13. This whale previously spent 1 million USDC to buy 355,417 WIF at $2.81 on the 21st of May. 
However, it was surprising to note that despite the hike in price and buying pressure, sentiment around the meme coin remained bearish as its Weighted Sentiment went into the negative zone. 
Its Social Volume also remained low, reflecting a decline in WIF’s popularity. 
Source: Santiment
WIF’s possible next targets
The good news was that while the meme coin’s price increased, its Open Interest followed a similar path. For starters, the metric represents the total number of active positions in a specific asset.
 A rise in the metric usually hints that the ongoing price trend will continue further. 
However, the metric registered a slight decline in the last few hours. 
Source: Santiment
The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) looked bearish as it was resting under its neutral mark. Also, the Money Flow Index (MFI) continued to support the buyers as it went northward.

Read dogwifhat’s [WIF] Price Prediction 2024-25

AMBCrypto then analyzed Hyblock Capital’s data to find WIF’s possible targets if its bull rally continues. 
We found that it would be crucial for WIF to go above $3.30 first, as it has twice failed to do that in the recent past. A successful breakout above that level would open the door for WIF to touch $4.

Costco and Salesforce earnings, inflation, crypto: The markets this week

After a week in which the Nasdaq reached a new all-time high and Ether ETFs received SEC approval, standouts in the upcoming week include several earnings reports, new economic data — and potentially some more action in the crypto market.Nvidia earnings stun the street and the stock is soaringOh, and most important, U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. Check out the best Memorial Day weekend deals here.Macroeconomic data due this weekConsumer sentiment has declined as inflation concerns persist. According to a Friday release from the University of Michigan, the consumer sentiment index for May dropped to 69.1 from 77.2 in April. On Tuesday, the university will publish the results of its consumer confidence survey for May.The Commerce Department will release its GDP report on Thursday. Last month, the growth was much weaker than expected. Moreover, on Friday, the investor will watch the personal consumption expenditures price index, which measures the prices that U.S. residents pay for goods and services. Last month, the key inflation measure increased more than expected. In March, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, increased 2.8% from a year ago, an increase similar to February but higher than expected.Analysts are confident about Costco’s report Wholesale giant Costco will release its quarterly report on Thursday. Analysts expect earnings per share of $3.71 on average, up from the initial projection of $3.61 for the third quarter of 2024. Its competitiveness with e-commerce giant Amazon will also draw attention. In the latest quarter, Costco’s e-commerce sales grew by 18.4% compared to the previous year. Costco’s membership base will also be an important factor in determining the growth of the company.Salesforce’s earnings report is dueOn Wednesday, Salesforce, a cloud-based software company, will release its quarterly report. The company made headlines when it initially announced plans to acquire data-management software maker Informatica but later decided against it. The acquisition of Informatica, which would have been Salesforce’s largest acquisition since it bought Slack in 2021, could have been valued at around $10 billion.On average, analysts estimate the quarter’s earnings per share to be $1.82, compared to the reported EPS of $1.15 for the same quarter last year. Furthermore, investors would like to know how the software company is incorporating AI—which is in demand these days—and how this is going to generate revenue.Other earnings to watchIn addition to these, IT company HP will release its quarterly report on Wednesday, while BestBuy and Dollar General will release theirs on Thursday.There may be some action on the crypto marketWith Ether ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the crypto market may see some action soon. It is ironic that the market became volatile before the landmark decision but did not respond afterward. In the last week, Bitcoin reached over $70,000, and Ether went up over 20% in a day before slowing down. Still, there is hope that the crypto market will rise, with some expecting Ether to surge around $6,000 with a 60% increase in its price.

Bitcoin Envisioned to Reach $80,000 by End of May and $95,000 in June ⋆ ZyCrypto

Bitcoin is struggling to restart its long-term bull market, but one analyst believes we are only days away before another all-time high of $80k is achieved. BitQuant, the technical influencer in question, doesn’t stop at that and believes that there is a good chance the crypto asset will reach as high as $95k in a month.







Upon closer scrutiny of the tweet, the analyst admits that the cryptocurrency may record a price correction after going close to the coveted $100k figure in June. At the end of the tweet, he conveniently states that he doesn’t trade local tops, so he won’t be selling his Bitcoin next month even if he records this considerable price gain.



What do Other Analysts Say?



BitQuant is part of a group of Bitcoin proponents on X who believe a healthy price rally is imminent in the coming weeks. However, not all analysts share this rosy picture; some even call for BTC to struggle for a short while before resuming the long-term bull market. Michael Von de Poppe, a more popular crypto trader, believes BTC may remain within $67.5k-$68k. He even called on the market to register short-term price corrections followed by rebounds in the near future. 



Others, including Willy Woo, are less clear about their predictions for June. However, Woo tweeted that it was “only a matter of time before BTC recorded a new All-Time High above $73k.







So, a move at least to $80k is not being ruled out by any crypto analyst right now, but BitQuant’s prediction of $95k within weeks is on the overly optimistic spectrum.

The popular cryptocurrency XRP, which rose 7% in May, could face potential turbulence in June. Last month, XRP ascended above the important psychological mark of $0.5 and maintained stability, much to the annoyance of investors expecting more significant price changes.Despite the performance in May, which is in line with the token's historical average gain of 27.7%, June may not bring the same positive returns.Historically, the first month of summer has not been favorable for XRP. Over more than a decade of history, the average return for June is -5.59% and the median return is -8.92%. This suggests a likely downturn for XRP in the coming month. According to CryptoRank, the last profitable June for XRP was in 2017, and all subsequent Junes have ended with losses of at least 8.15%.XRP to USD by CoinMarketCapWhile the crypto market is known for its unpredictability, the historical data for XRP represents a significant sample given its status as one of the oldest tokens on the market. Investors should be cautious as patterns over the years indicate a high probability of negative returns in June.XRP Monthly Returns by CryptoRankThe stability that XRP showed in May, despite the lack of strong swings, is now in stark contrast to the less optimistic outlook for June. If historical trends continue, XRP bulls may find themselves disappointed as the token could face a decline.While the market awaits the results, the reliability of the XRP price history remains in question. Whether historical patterns will continue in June remains to be seen, but the data suggests that investors hoping for growth in the first month of summer should be cautious.

Biggest Video Games Releasing in June 2024 - Decrypt

June is a quiet month for games. For nearly a quarter century, game journalists would trek out to Los Angeles for the Electronic Entertainment Expo and split time between crawling the busy, loud, show floor and diving into often much-too-cold meeting rooms for a half-height bottle of water and a meeting with developers.But with the departed E3 now in the rearview mirror, Summer Games Fest has taken its place as a less formal, less centralized, and more optional version of that previous event. Because these events pack the month so full of game news, it's often been a slow time for actual game releases.This month, though, there's one huge release you can't ignore in the form of Elden Ring's long-awaited expansion, along with some worthy smaller games to check out. Here’s what we’re looking forward to playing in June.Note: All of the games listed below are traditional or "Web2" video games. None have crypto or blockchain elements, as far as we know.Destiny 2: The Final ShapeRelease Date: June 4Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SDestiny 2's ongoing story has been working up to this moment for years. The Final Shape brings the ongoing Destiny storyline to an end, opening Bungie's slate up to begin a new storyline or even announce Destiny 3. (Don't worry, we don't know anything you don't).Along with bringing the current storyline to a close, this expansion introduces the Prismatic subclass, which allows you to combine Arc, Solar, Void, Statis, and Strand powers into the perfect subclass of your own design.Star Wars: HuntersRelease Date: June 4Platforms: Android, iOS, Nintendo SwitchWhile Star Wars Outlaws—set to release late this summer—is getting all the attention right now, it's not the only Star Wars game on the horizon. June will bring us Star Wars: Hunters.Get ready for video game buzzwords: This is a free-to-play, player-versus-player competitive arena game with a cast of all-new characters cast from familiar molds. Character types include a Wookie, a Trandoshan, and a Rodian. There are bounty hunters, Jedi, and scavengers.Picking from the varied list of characters, you'll participate in the kind of modes you know and love from other games. There's a team deathmatch-style mode called Squad Brawl, a Domination-style one called Power Control, and a capture-the-flag or keep away-style game called Trophy Chase. Again, this game is free-to-play, and it's on all of the most popular mobile platforms, so it's worth a look if you're itching for a Star Wars experience right now.Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The GameRelease Date: June 4Platforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|SHorror movies are almost perfect subject matter for asynchronous multiplayer, where some players are powerful, seemingly immortal beings and others are hapless victims who can do little but escape. The formula works in Dead by Daylight and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Game, but no one would've bet money on the 1988 cult classic horror movie “Killer Klowns from Outer Space” getting its own adaptation.In this adaptation, three players take control of one of five unique Klowns—a race of malevolent clown-like aliens who come to earth to prey upon humans—while seven others play as the townspeople of Crescent Cove, and must avoid the Klowns and their hilariously horrifying weapons. In the movies, that includes a popcorn bazooka, cotton candy cocoons, sentient balloon animals, people-shrinking shadow puppets, and more. In zombie movies, you aim for the head. In Klown movies, you aim for the nose.Still Wakes the DeepRelease Date: June 18Platforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|SSet in December 1975, Glaswegian electrician Caz McLeary is trapped aboard an oil rig off the coast of Scotland when disaster strikes. The player, as McLeary, must survive not only the dangerous weather and deteriorating oil rig but also the pursuit by a mysterious monster now aboard the rig. With Still Wakes the Deep, developer The Chinese Room returns to narrative horror. This studio previously worked on Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, Dear Esther, and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.Elden Ring: Shadow of the ErdtreeRelease Date: June 21Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SMuch like an Elden Ring player dodging the Fire Giant, other games are dodging the release of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. Elden Ring was one of the best-reviewed and best-selling games of 2022, so this expansion is almost certain to be massive.This expansion will bring a large new area to explore, new weapons and equipment to use, and new enemies and bosses to repeatedly die to… and then triumphantly defeat. The new area itself, the Land of Shadow, is reportedly as large as Elden Ring's first area, Limgrave. That's not huge in comparison to the overall Elden Ring map—but the Elden Ring map is gigantic, so we're expecting to have plenty to do.Luigi's Mansion 2 HDRelease Date: June 27Platforms: Nintendo SwitchFor our US-based readers, you might remember Luigi's Mansion 2 as Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, the name it was released with in the United States in 2013. Everywhere else, it was just called Luigi's Mansion 2. Luigi's Mansion 2 HD updates the Nintendo 3DS game for the Switch with new visuals, leaving the game otherwise largely intact. The game will also feature cooperative multiplayer for up to four players.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Hedge Funds Net Short on Bitcoin and Ethereum Futures on CME: Kaiko Analytics - The Daily Hodl


								New data from market intelligence firm Kaiko Analytics shows that hedge funds are net short on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).
In a new research article, the crypto analytics platform says that while hedge funds are net short on both BTC and ETH on the CME, it does not mean the funds are bearish on crypto, but rather, that they are engaging in basis trades, a type of arbitrage strategy.










Net short means that the hedge funds have accumulated more short positions than long positions in the crypto derivatives markets.
Says Kaiko Analytics,
“This doesn’t necessarily mean these funds are bearish on crypto, it’s more likely they’re engaging in one of crypto’s most popular trades, the basis trade. 
The basis trade is a type of arbitrage strategy that exploits the price difference between two similar assets. In this case between an BTC or ETH spot and futures. Hedge funds are likely ‘long basis’ at present. This means they are selling futures short while holding spot BTC or ETH. 
This protects against price moves and guarantees a specific sale price in the event of volatility in the underlying asset. The long basis trade works best when prices are in a state of contango, which means futures prices are above spot prices. The two prices will trend towards one another as expiration nears.
While we don’t have the data to say with certainty that this is why hedge funds are net short, it’s the most likely explanation for the massive short positions held by these sophisticated traders, who would rarely short without hedging.”

Position trader profits $13 million (345%) with the 'Nvidia of crypto'


    A position trader has booked an estimated $13.2 million (345%) profit in seven months of buying and holding patiently. Render (RNDR)—this position trade’s cryptocurrency, became known as the “Nvidia of crypto”—creating a decentralized network of GPU rendering.



Notably, SpotOnChain reported the seven-month position trade that started with a 1.69 million RNDR purchase on Coinbase. The withdrawals happened between November 2 and November 10, 2023. At that time, this position was valued at around $3.83 million, with Render priced at $2.265 on average.



This trader became dormant for seven months after building the position, waiting patiently for the best time to sell. Interestingly, the whale missed Render’s price top in March but remained still even during a significant crash in April.







The trader decided to take profits as the price recovered, moving their whole Render stack to Coinbase on May 24. In particular, the 1.69 million RNDR were priced at $17.03 million by the time of the activity. Thus, the position trader’s estimated profit was $13.2 million, up 345% from the initial investment in November last year.

What is position trading, and how does it benefit traders?



Position trading is a long-term strategy that involves holding positions for weeks, months, or even years.



This approach allows traders to capitalize on significant market trends and capture substantial profits over time. By focusing on the bigger picture, position traders can avoid the noise and volatility of short-term price fluctuations.



Moreover, this strategy requires less time and effort compared to other trading styles, such as day trading. Position traders can conduct thorough research and analysis to identify high-quality assets with strong fundamentals and growth potential.



Additionally, by holding positions for extended periods, position traders can benefit from compound returns and potentially lower transaction costs. However, it’s essential to manage risk effectively and have patience when employing this strategy.



RNDR: The ‘Nvidia of crypto’ price analysis



Render has been dubbed the “Nvidia of crypto” due to its strong performance and alignment with AI and GPU sectors. The RNDR token saw a 345% increase from November 2023 to May 2024, driven by the market’s interest in AI-related assets.



Furthermore, Render’s decentralized GPU rendering solutions democratize access to high-quality rendering, mirroring Nvidia’s impact on the gaming industry. The growing demand for GPU-intensive applications aligns with Render’s focus on providing GPU computing power for various tasks.



As of May 26, RNDR had a market cap of $3.9 billion, trading at $10.15, indicating significant growth potential and investor confidence.

Position traders have looked into the “Nvidia of crypto” for solid investments that are now rendering fruits.

XRP to 'make extraordinary moves' after clearing this level


    The price of XRP continues to consolidate above the $0.50 support level, and a crypto analyst has suggested that the token has the potential for further upside if it breaches several resistance marks.



Based on the token’s technical analysis, the analyst, Dark Defender, suggested in an X post on May 26 that XRP is on the brink of breaking through a critical resistance zone. This breakthrough could trigger a substantial price surge.



In making the prediction, the analyst focused on the Heikin Ashi Candles combined with the Fisher Indicator. He explained that this method effectively identifies trends by analyzing highs, lows, and opening and closing prices over a specified time frame.







According to the expert, combining these indicators provides a smoother trend direction, making it easier to predict potential market movements. Based on his chart analysis, the analyst pointed out that XRP’s challenging zone lies between $0.6044 and $0.6649.

Key technical indicators to watch 



Dark Defender emphasized that once the weekly candle closes above $0.6649, XRP will gain much stronger momentum, allowing it to move toward higher Fibonacci levels.




“Based on the Heikin Ashi Candles & Fisher Indicator, one of my favourites, indicates the trend shift clearly on the weekly time frame.<…> Once the weekly candle closes above $0.6649, XRP will be much stronger. <…> We are in Grand Wave 3, and XRP will make extraordinary moves above $0.6049,” the expert said. 




To substantiate his analysis, Dark Defender pointed to the Ichimoku Clouds, confirming the Fibonacci levels within the identified resistance range. Notably, the Ichimoku Cloud is a technical indicator that can assess potential future price movements and identify key support and resistance levels.



It’s worth noting that XRP remains at the center of the crypto market, with the token failing to make any substantial price movement. Since losing the $0.60 support, the token continues to hover above $0.50. Notably, XRP investors seek an opportunity to aid the token’s rally to the coveted $1 mark.



In the meantime, XRP is facing long-term bullish sentiments that could positively influence its price. For instance, following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of an Ethereum (ETH) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), speculation is rife that a similar product might receive the green light for XRP, with experts projecting it could happen in 2025.



At the same time, investors closely watch the ongoing legal proceedings between Ripple and the SEC. A ruling in favor of the blockchain firm could act as a bullish catalyst for XRP.



Additionally, optimism about the case emerged after Coinbase announced that the crypto exchange had relisted the digital token for its clients in New York. Coinbase removed the token from its US markets in 2021 due to a lawsuit. Therefore, XRP could rally as Coinbase’s move may renew investors’ optimism and confidence in the asset.



XRP price analysis



By press time, XRP was trading at $0.53 with daily losses of about 0.23%, while the weekly timeframe indicates gains of about 2.5%.

Despite the extended consolidation of XRP, the token’s bullish momentum has remained steady. The stability above $0.50 hints at a possible surge to the $0.60 mark soon, a level that could pave the way toward $1.

Coinbase and SEC Reach Fresh Agreement on Document Handling: Details - Coin Edition


							

Coinbase and SEC submitted a joint Stipulation and Proposed Protective Order to the court.
The agreement includes provisions for resolving disputes and handling inadvertent sharing of protected information.
Coinbase has moved to challenge the SEC’s interpretation of investment contracts.




U.S.-based exchange Coinbase and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have reached a consensus on handling sensitive documents. In particular, on May 24, a Stipulation and Proposed Protective Order was submitted in a letter to presiding Judge Katherine Polk Failla.









This agreement ensures that the court can enforce the terms should any breaches be alleged in the lawsuit between the SEC and Coinbase. In the letter, both parties acknowledged their commitment to good faith cooperation regarding document requests and production. The agreement outlines a process for addressing any questions related to reductions, categories, metadata, or assertions of privilege in the documents produced.



Additionally, the agreement includes a clause for inadvertent sharing of protected information, requiring the disclosing party to notify the other promptly, specifying the information and the basis for the claim of privilege. The receiving party is then obligated to return, destroy, or sequester any copies of the protected information within five days of receipt.



Meanwhile, Coinbase challenged the SEC’s interpretation of investment contracts in the ongoing legal dispute on Friday, arguing that the SEC is bypassing established case law and the Howey test. 



Coinbase’s appeal contests the March ruling that supported the SEC’s claim that Coinbase’s staking program is an unregistered securities offering. The exchange asserted that investment contracts require a post-sale contractual commitment, which the SEC disputes. 



The case highlights inconsistencies with the SEC’s approach in similar cases. Notably, the SEC’s lawsuit from June 2023 accuses Coinbase of securities law violations, including listing 13 cryptocurrencies as securities. 



Accordingly, Coinbase actively campaigns for crypto industry defense through initiatives like the Stand With Crypto campaign and a political action committee.

Crypto Hiring: Crypto exchange names new CEO; Tokenization-focused firm expands - Blockworks


A crypto exchange named a new CEO and a tokenization-focused firm picked a leader for its new office in Canada. 
Gracy Chen is set to replace Sandra Lou as Bitget’s chief executive, the company said Tuesday. 
Chen had joined Bitget as a managing director in 2022 and was tasked with leading the company’s growth strategies.   
The crypto exchange launched a crypto-backed credit card last year usable wherever Visa is accepted and is “developing more services to support this integration,” Chen noted in a letter. 
Investing in the crypto ecosystem via the exchange’s Web3 Fund and EmpowerX Fund also remains “a key long-term focus,” she added.

Meanwhile, crypto infrastructure firm Taurus opened its first North America office in Vancouver, Canada. 
Andrew Maledy — previously an engineering manager at Procore Technologies — is set to lead the office as the company links up with regional partners and clients of its custody and tokenization technology.
Taurus raised $65 million in a February funding round led by Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank took part in that round too — linking up with Taurus in September to build out digital asset custody and tokenization services.  
The company gained approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) in January to open its digital assets marketplace to retail clients.
