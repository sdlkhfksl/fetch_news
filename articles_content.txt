X platform user calling himself DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) and one of the X team members has published a post, stating that “2024 will be the year of 𝕏 Payments.” This triggered an enthusiastic response from the crypto community based on this popular social media platform and average X users.Hope for DOGE payments on X arise from ashesThis announcement follows the news of X owner tech centibillionaire Elon Musk securing licenses for payment processing and money transmitter operations in three new US states. The authorities of Illinois, Oregon and New Mexico granted the necessary approvals to Musk’s company a week ago.As the list of these granted permissions grows bigger, hopes of Musk finally implementing cryptocurrency-powered payments on the X platform have been reignited. In particular, this is true about the iconic meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE), of which Musk is a loyal fan.Even before he purchased Twitter in 2022 and rebranded it as X a year later, he spoke during podcasts that DOGE seems like an ideal means of payments on the social media behemoth, as well as a way to reward content creators.DOGE price jumps 44% in anticipationSince March 20, when the aforementioned news about X securing new licenses spread around the crypto space, the Dogecoin price has shown a staggering increase by more than 44%.DOGE gradually surged from $0.1291 to the $0.1863 level where the popular meme coin is changing hands at the time of this writing.In the meantime, a recent report shows that Dogecoin open interest has reached an astounding $1.26 million. Even if Elon Musk has not been speaking openly about DOGE as of late, the analyst believes that the tech mogul and X developments remain the main drivers behind the DOGE price.In particular, it says, the massive rise of the open interest above $1.26 billion has been triggered by the obtaining of the above-mentioned new licenses for the X platform. A chart shared by the source shows that the rise in the open interest started on the day when the news came out – on March 20. If X starts utilizing Dogecoin for internal payments and for tipping, it will be a great expansion of DOGE adoption and will certainly have a tremendous impact on the meme coin’s price.

Finance Guru Reveals Why Bitcoin Is The ‘Perfect Asset At The Right Time’ | Bitcoinist.com


								Robert Kiyosaki, the best-selling author of the popular book, ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ has hailed Bitcoin as the perfect asset. Delving into the digital asset’s distinctive qualities, the financial expert offers a comprehensive comparison between BTC and traditional fiat currencies through a question-and-answer format. 
Bitcoin As The Perfect Asset
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Kiyosaki posed a series of questions about Bitcoin, accompanied by answers to each query. When he questioned his stance on BTC, the finance guru unequivocally declared himself a Bitcoin bull, affirming his admiration for the cryptocurrency. 

He characterized Bitcoin as the “perfect asset at the right time,” because of its high value and potential in today’s economic and financial landscape. 
According to the financial author, BTC could be a scam or a Ponzi Scheme. However, the same could be said about most of the traditional fiat currencies in the world such as the United States Dollar (USD), Euro, Yen and others. 
Kiyosaki has branded fiat currencies as “fake,” shedding light on the inconsistencies in the US government’s efforts to stimulate economic and financial growth. The finance expert criticized US political leaders, denouncing them as “incompetent or corrupt or both,” while outlining the economic challenges such as debt and inflation faced by the US. 
Despite his pessimistic assessment of fiat currencies, Kiyosaki has remained optimistic about Bitcoin. The financial guru has heralded Bitcoin as a strong network, highlighting that he was super bullish on the cryptocurrency because it applied Metcalf’s law, which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its user base. In other words, as more people use Bitcoin, its overall value increases. 
Kiyosaki’s Advice To The Crypto Community
In his post, Kiyosaki advises the broader crypto community against investing their funds in the US dollar, urging them instead to save in more valuable and tangible assets like silver, gold and Bitcoin. He emphasized that individuals who saved in “fake money” were at a disadvantage, highlighting the risks associated with investing in a currency vulnerable to inflationary pressures.

Further stressing his views on BTC, Kiyosaki acknowledged the possibility of the cryptocurrency’s future value diminishing to zero. However, he noted that fiat currencies could face a similar risk, highlighting the historical depreciation of thousands of fiat currencies to zero. 
As a result, the financial guru has encouraged investors to safeguard their funds by investing in real-world assets like Bitcoin. He has predicted the price of Bitcoin to soar to $100,000 within six months, anticipating the cryptocurrency to potentially rise to this value by September 2024. This forecast underscores the financial author’s bullish outlook on Bitcoin and his unwavering endorsement of the cryptocurrency’s potential.

U.S. Judge Rules SEC Lawsuit Against Coinbase Can Move Forward - The Defiant

The judge has ruled that through its staking program, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered intermediary of securities.A federal judge in Manhattan on Wednesday ruled the case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange Coinbase can move forward.According to the ruling by Judge Katherine Polk, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered intermediary of securities–thanks in large part to the “well-pleaded allegations” of the Complaint by the SEC.“The Court finds that the SEC adequately alleges that Coinbase, through its staking program, engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities,” read the latest ruling.The lawsuit was filed on June 6 by the SEC, which argued that the largest exchange in the country was violating the nation’s securities rules and regulations.Coinbase WinCoinbase did score a win today, however. Polk sided with the company in dismissing the claim that the company acts as an unregistered broker by offering its Coinbase Wallet.Chief Legal Officer for Coinbase, Paul Grewal, posted on X today that the company was expecting the ruling, claiming early motions against government agencies are “almost always denied.”Grewal also called out lawmakers in Congress, encouraging the body to build on the momentum from last year regarding digital asset legislation, especially “If we want innovation to remain in the U.S.”The SEC has been on a tirade against the crypto industry, including court cases against Binance, and a number of tokens the agency called unregistered securities.The Coinbase versus the SEC case will now face a jury, although no date has been set for when court proceedings will commence. Both parties have until April 19 to propose a case management plan, said the judge.

Why is 2140 the end of bitcoin inflation? - Blockworks


It’s well known that the Bitcoin network experiences a halving of supply approximately every four years. Less appreciated is that these are set to continue for over a century into the future.
Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto programmed the year 2140 — 30 halvings from now — as the year that the block rewards (the subsidy paid to miners for processing transactions into blocks) would drop to less than one satoshi, the smallest unit of bitcoin.
The use of the term “satoshi” — equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin (or 0.00000001 BTC) — emerged organically among early Bitcoin users and developers, appearing in various forums and discussions starting in 2010 or 2011, and became widely accepted in 2013.
Read more: The Bitcoin halving is about a month away — here’s what you can expect
The halving is modeled after the physical mining of scarce resources, according to Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief security officer at Casa.
“There’s nothing special about the year 2140,” Lopp told Blockworks. “It’s just how the nature of halvings along with the level of precision of satoshis ended up working out.”
Lopp notes that Nakamoto explained the supply schedule to Mike Hearn, a former Google engineer who became an early Bitcoin contributor, in 2009:
“My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess,” Satoshi wrote. “I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard.”
Read more: Satoshi warned against labeling bitcoin as an ‘investment’
He picked 21 million, but Satoshi added that the divisibility of a bitcoin in practice could be represented differently depending on how valuable one bitcoin gets. “For example, if 0.001 is worth one euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had one bitcoin it’s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as one.”
For what it’s worth, 0.001 BTC is worth about 65 euros (approximately $70) today.
Why the rate of issuance would decline for 132 years, however, was never explained.
“I expect it was more of a ‘better safe than sorry’ decision to give the system decades to bootstrap,” Lopp said.
Unless the price of bitcoin (BTC) doubles every four years, each halving brings less income from block rewards to miners. So to maintain the network’s hashrate, which is important for Bitcoin’s security, transaction fees will become more important over time.
Whether that will happen in practice remains to be seen, but Lopp is optimistic.
“I expect that as we see the multi-layered Bitcoin ecosystem continue to expand, the base chain will start to look more and more like a high-value cryptographic accumulator and it will make economic sense for on-chain transactions to pay relatively high fees,” he said.

PlanB's Poll Shows Strong Belief in Bitcoin's $100k Milestone by 2024


																With the Bitcoin halving drawing near, market participants are contemplating whether the asset has reached its peak or if there’s further room for growth and when the next upward shift might transpire.
Following a breather from a powerful uptrend, Bitcoin is slowly regaining its strength again as it trades above $69k. However, market participants remain optimistic about BTC’s trajectory and are confident that the leading crypto asset will claim a milestone by the end of this year.
According to PlanB’s latest poll on X (formerly Twitter), a staggering 71.9% of respondents anticipate Bitcoin reaching $100k by 2024, demonstrating bullish sentiment.
Meanwhile, 18.1% foresee this milestone in 2025, with only a modest 5.1% expecting it in 2026 or beyond. Surprisingly, a mere 4.9% doubt that the world’s largest crypto will ever achieve the coveted $100k mark.






The result does not seem far-fetched, considering there are multiple bullish catalysts at play.
For one, the Coinbase Premium Index has also flipped positive, which is indicative of renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors in the United States.
Spot Bitcoin ETF is also seeing notable inflows while new players are gearing up to offer similar products.
For example, asset management company Hashdex announced that it was venturing into the US spot Bitcoin ETF scene by converting its futures ETF to hold spot Bitcoin primarily.
Rebranded as the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, it will predominantly allocate its assets to spot Bitcoin, with a minor portion invested in Bitcoin futures contracts.
Earlier this week, renowned author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Robert Kiyosaki, also advocated for Bitcoin as the top investment choice while simultaneously criticizing the US dollar for its fundamental flaws.

Shiba Inu Climbs To Second Spot In Crypto Searches As SHIB Rallies


                            The ever-vibrant Shiba Inu community is thriving once more as SHIB gains widespread recognition surpassing top cryptocurrency assets in the market to become the second most sought-after digital asset in the entire European continent, securing its stance in the crypto landscape.
Shiba Inu Takes Europe By Storm
XRP enthusiast and market expert Marcel Knobloch, also known as Collin Brown, reported the coin’s latest milestone on X. According to Brown, Shiba Inu has seen significant growth in its long-term investor base, taking Europe by storm by becoming the second most search crypto in the continent.
Brown noted that the milestone is reminiscent of the peak of 2021, having rallied a startling 300% in just 8 days. SHIB’s interest is not limited to Europe, and it has taken the top spot on search charts all the way from Italy to Nigeria.

As a result of the development, WazirX’s poll has crowned SHIB the king of meme cryptos. Thus, Collin Brown has urged the cryptocurrency space to watch out for Shiba Inu, noting that the Shiba pack is at the forefront of the race.
The rankings were determined following a comprehensive analysis of Google Trends data in the past 1 year in order to ascertain the cryptocurrency that, based on searches, each nation in Europe desires to invest in. After gathering collective data, the findings showed a noteworthy pattern that indicated changes in people’s interest in the crypto market.
Shiba Inu went past notable coins like Ethereum (ETH) – the second largest crypto asset, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) – the largest meme coin, securing the top pick in about 7 European countries. These include Russia, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and among others. 
Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) – the largest crypto asset remains the most searched coin in the continent acquiring top choice in about 21 European nations, such as Poland, Germany, Belgium, Romania, etc.
Latest Milestone Buttresses SHIB’s Price
SHIB’s recent achievement displays a constant rise in its interest, reflecting the trust of its community members around the world. In addition to bolstering SHIB’s standing, this ranking indicates that European investors are considering adopting the token even more.

Following the project’s landmark, the Ethereum-based memecoin has managed to secure gains of over 18% in the past week. SHIB has experienced a rebound to the $0.000030 threshold, after falling as low as $0.000025 during the start of the week. With the memecoin market demonstrating momentum presently, SHIB might be poised for more significant gains in the coming months.
Consequently, SHIB’s rise to the aforementioned price has taken advantage of the market’s general recovery and its seven-day upswing. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.0000305, indicating a decline of 1% in the past day. Meanwhile, its trading volume and market cap have decreased by over 1% and 16%, respectively.

Casa's multi-key solution for tackling self-custody Bitcoin inheritance

Bitcoin self-custody firm Casa is rolling out an inheritance feature aimed at streamlining the transfer of assets to benefactors from deceased estates.The inheritance of cryptocurrencies can be a complicated process, even more so if the owner of the digital assets has not made any provisions for their families or designated recipients to take control.Nick Neuman, co-founder and CEO of Casa, tells Cointelegraph that the inheritance of cryptocurrencies has long been an issue for crypto-natives looking to ensure that their digital holdings are passed on accordingly.“It’s not overlooked. Many people recognize it as a big problem they want to solve but they haven’t had good tools to solve it yet, so most people either don’t have a solution, or have cobbled together something that they hope will work but don’t feel good about,” Neuman said. Casa has offered an inheritance feature to its highest membership tier in the U.S. for the past few years. Neuman said the new offering will be available to all Casa members and differs from the existing high-tier feature, allowing users to transfer Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC) holdings to benefactors.Related: Casa Releases Self-Custody Bitcoin Wallet Focused on PrivacyThe offering aims to ensure that the process of managing cryptocurrency holdings of deceased individuals is straightforward, secure and resistant to malicious actors. Neuman said that instances where inheritance plans have not been made have been “precarious and stressful,” adding:“When we’ve tried to help recover assets for people who don’t have an inheritance plan and have passed away, it has taken anywhere from 6-12 months to figure everything out. Even then, the chance of actually recovering the assets is low.”The offering hinges on a Casa’s user designating a recipient to a specific token vault in its proprietary app. The recipient then creates a free Casa account and scans a QR code provided by the vault owner, which contains an encrypted version of the owner’s mobile key. Related: Casa launches multisignature Ethereum self-custody vaultThe key can only be imported by the specified account and the recipient can’t initially use it or see the vault balance as Neuman explains:“If the vault owner passes away, the recipient can request access to the vault in their Casa app. This starts a six month timer, and sends a ton of notifications every month to the owner.”If the owner is still alive, they can reject the request in their app. If the timer runs out after six months, the recipient can use the shared mobile key and request a signature from the Casa Recovery Key for the shared vault. This will give them 2 out of 3 signatures required to access the asset.Casa's inheritance feature allows a vault owner to assign encrypted keys to benefactors to access assets after their death. Source: CasaCasa will also offer a five-key vault, where one hardware key is shared with the recipient. The small increase in friction for recipients adds increased security and resilience of a five-key vault for larger holdings.Best guess estimates pin the value of lost Bitcoin at around $140 billion, of which misplaced keys are often a cause. Since its inception in 2016, Casa has promoted multisignature self-custody in the crypto industry. Its flagship Bitcoin vault allows users to store the cryptocurrency using up to five keys for more distributed security. Casa’s service originally catered to Bitcoin “whales” willing to spend $10,000 a year on custody before opening its service to a broader base of users. The company has now added an Ether vault to its platform, with ETH holders also able to use up to five keys to secure their holdings.Magazine: ‘SEAL 911’ team of white hats formed to fight crypto hacks in real time

The USDC balances on Coinbase are increasing.

In a strategic move aimed at taking advantage of lower fees and faster settlement times, Coinbase, one of the leading crypto exchanges, is gearing up to store a greater number of corporate and customer USDC balances on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. 
The decision comes as Base’s Total Value Locked (TVL) surpasses the impressive milestone of 1 billion dollars, indicating a significant increase in user deposits and activities within the ecosystem.

USDC Balances Increasing on Coinbase
Branzburg, vice president and head of consumer products at Coinbase, highlighted the benefits of using Base infrastructure, stating: “This allows us to manage and protect customer funds with lower fees and faster settlement times, without any impact on the Coinbase user experience”. 
The move underscores Coinbase’s commitment to leveraging innovative solutions to improve operational efficiency and provide a seamless experience to its users.
The announcement was positively received, with Base collaborator Jesse Pollak expressing enthusiasm and support for Coinbase’s decision. Pollak described the move as “grounded” and said he was excited to continue assisting Coinbase in its journey towards harnessing blockchain technology.
Base, built on the open-source OP Stack, has seen a significant surge in its Total Value Locked, reaching over 1 billion dollars. Defi Llama data reveals that user deposits on Base have more than doubled since the beginning of the month, going from 470 million dollars to over 1 billion. 
This exponential growth highlights the increasing adoption and trust in Base’s capabilities as a Layer 2 scalability solution for Ethereum.
A significant portion of Base TVL can be attributed to the decentralized exchange Aerodrome, which has seen exponential growth since the beginning of February. The surge in transaction activity on Base, especially compared to other optimistic rollups like Arbitrum, highlights the increasing traction and utility of the platform in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
While Base has seen a surge in the number of transactions, the daily transaction volume of OP Mainnet has recorded a more modest increase. This divergence in transaction activity highlights the unique value proposition offered by Layer 2 solutions like Base, which prioritize scalability, lower fees, and faster transaction settlement times.
The reason behind Coinbase’s decision
The decision by Coinbase to store a greater number of USDC balances on Base is indicative of a broader trend towards adopting blockchain-based solutions for financial infrastructures. By leveraging the capabilities of Layer 2 scaling solutions, companies like Coinbase can streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.
Furthermore, Coinbase’s approval of Base could potentially pave the way for greater adoption by other companies and institutions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As more entities recognize the benefits of on-chain solutions like Base, it is expected that momentum towards mainstream acceptance and use of blockchain technology will accelerate.
In conclusion, Coinbase’s decision to increase USDC balances on Base underscores the platform’s commitment to innovation and efficiency in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. 
With Base’s total locked value surpassing one billion dollars and transaction activity on the rise, the collaboration between Coinbase and Base marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a more scalable, efficient, and inclusive financial ecosystem powered by blockchain technology. 
As the sector continues to mature, we expect to see further advancements and partnerships aimed at unlocking the full potential of decentralized finance.

Sam Bankman-Fried to be sentenced in FTX collapse: What to know

Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency executive, will receive his prison sentence on Thursday. If prosecutors get what they want, the former CEO of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX could serve 40 to 50 years in prison. Is Bitcoin a good speculative investment?Here’s what you should know.Who is Sam Bankman-Fried?Sam Bankman-Fried, also known as “SBF,” launched the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2019, and it went bankrupt in 2022. Born in 1992 in California, he grew up in an academic family, with both of his parents professors at Stanford Law School.He earned a physics degree with a minor in mathematics from MIT in 2014. While in the program, he worked as an intern in 2013 for the trading firm Jane Street Capital in New York. It was there that he met Caroline Ellison, who later became his girlfriend. Ellison would become the CEO of Alameda Research, a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm and SBF’s first company, founded in 2017. It was later discovered that he built FTX to support Alameda’s trading business.What was FTX?Bankman-Fried co-founded the crypto exchange FTX in 2019 with American computer programmer Gary Wang. As the covid-19 pandemic later boosted cryptocurrency trading worldwide, FTX rode the wave. In 2020, FTX purchased Blockfolio, the market’s leading mobile news and portfolio tracking app, for $150 million. SBF appeared as a speaker at various crypto and blockchain conferences, attracting a large following.How did it collapse, and what happened next?In November 2022, the crypto news website CoinDesk reported on FTX’s poor balance sheet and liquidity crisis. Big names such as cryptocurrency exhange Binance opted not to provide any support to FTX or Bankman-Fried.The cryptocurrency exchange collapsed overnight, resulting in a loss of $10 billion in customer funds. This had a ripple effect on other crypto companies, throwing them into financial turmoil.Several companies with direct or indirect connections to FTX — including BlockFi, Voyager, Celsius, Genesis, and Gemini — went bankrupt in a matter of weeks. The cryptocurrency market saw its darkest period to-date, resulting in a loss of more than $1 trillion, and Bitcoin’s price dropped below $18,000.What was Sam Bankman-Fried convicted of?Once a crypto icon, Sam Bankman-Fried became a fraudster. Federal prosecutors filed both criminal and civil charges against Sam Bankman-Fried and other top FTX executives in late 2022. They were accused of misappropriating $10 billion in customer deposits and with generating false financial statements.The court appearances of FTX’s top executives attracted widespread attention — as did their romantic lives.In November of 2023, a federal jury in New York convicted Bankman-Fried of fraud for stealing at least $10 billion from customers and investors.What sentences are prosecutors and defense lawyers seeking?When he returns to court today, Bankman-Fried will be sentenced. Prosecutors are seeking 40-50 years in prison, while Bankman-Fried’s lawyers are asking for only 5-6 years in prison. His lawyers have cited medical conditions including neurodiversity and autism, making him “uniquely vulnerable in a prison population,” as well as Bankman-Fried’s desire to make “the world a better place” and his remorse over the collapse of the crypto exchange.

According to Nansen, a look at chains beyond Ethereum and other chains like Bitcoin and Solana indicated a drop of $818 million.Since the news broke that KuCoin and two of its founders had been charged with breaking anti-money laundering rules by U.S. federal prosecutors, there has been an increase in withdrawals from the platform. The exchange also recorded outflows of stablecoins in response to the news.On Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors charged KuCoin and two of its founders for failing to comply with U.S. anti-money laundering rules. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which controls derivatives markets, filed a lawsuit against the firm on the same day.KuCoin CEO reacts"As the People's Exchange, we prioritize user asset security above all else. All operations, including deposits and withdrawals, are normal," Kucoin CEO Johnny Lyu said in a reassuring statement to users, while adding that legal matters were being handled by the legal team.Lyu added, "The challenge we're facing is not unique to KuCoin but rather typical growth and regulatory issues encountered by emerging industries.

Copper's Party Raises Eyebrows Over Sushi Served on Models

                        Crypto custody firm Copper reportedly threw a London party where attendees were served sushi off two partially-clad models.The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the private function, dubbed “The Copper Experience,” was held last week. The venue for this event, held after the Digital Assets Summit 2024, was the 5-star Mandrake Hotel in London’s Fitzrovia.Per an image the FT obtained, a red-lacquered dining room reportedly featured two individuals in minimal attire positioned on a long table, with sushi served directly on their bodies.The outlet said that the after-party invitation promised a multi-sensory experience: “Attendees will be able to entertain and explore all five senses.”Copper didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.A senior Copper employee told the FT that having scantily clad people was not the typical party set-up. They added that: “Crypto is getting a lot more civilized, so that’s not really the style.”Regulatory Headaches in UK Led Copper to Pursue Swiss Registration
Copper specializes in digital asset custody and trading services tailored to institutional investors. Its offerings include a scalable settlement network, custody-integrated staking, and automated wallet services.Notably, in 2023, the company appointed former UK Chancellor Philip Hammond as its chairman. He was reportedly not in attendance at the controversial event.Facing challenges in obtaining approval from the UK’s financial regulatory authority, Copper withdrew its application to operate in the country in 2022. Instead, it shifted focus toward securing registration in Switzerland.Male-Dominated Culture in Industry Underlines Concerns Over Event
An insider close to the company described the situation as more akin to flamboyant performance art than anything salacious. They also revealed that the models were a man and woman, clad in swimwear.The practice of serving sushi off semi-clad bodies, known as nyotaimori, has gained attention in Western countries as an exotic cultural experience inspired by Japanese traditions. This tradition, although available in certain Western locations, remains on the fringes, even within Japan’s expansive erotic entertainment industry.Despite its occasional portrayal in media and popular culture, nyotaimori dinners are not widely adopted. They are also not considered a commonplace practice, either in Japan or Western societies.The FT highlighted concerns around a prevalent culture of “crypto bros,” characterized by male dominance in major companies, as a persistent issue. This culture has been linked to governance failures, exemplified by the collapse of exchanges like FTX.Hosting a Nyotaimori dinner, which is seen as potentially objectifying, may be viewed as perpetuating this problematic culture and further highlighting governance shortcomings within the industry.

Staked Ethereum reaches weekly high: How whales played a part - AMBCrypto



Deposits on the chain have outpaced withdrawals this week.
The number of ETH staked decreased as the price of the altcoin jumped.

In three separate transactions, a whale sent 12,800 Ethereum [ETH] to the Beacon Chain on the 27th of March. According to Whale Alert, the first transfer was 6400 ETH, valued at $23.05 million.
The subsequent ones were also with the same amount.
For the uninitiated, the Beacon Chain has been a key part of Ethereum since it transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). With the chain, users can participate in governance, act as validators, and also stake their ETH.
It’s raining interest on the chain
Previously, the Beacon Chain only allowed deposits via a contract. However, the 2023 Shanghai upgrade changed that and provided validators to withdraw their staked assets.
AMBCrypto’s evaluation showed that these transactions mentioned above have had a positive impact on the staking sector.
At press time, Nansen data showed that deposits since the beginning of the week tapped a new high.
Source: Nansen
Details from our examination showed that ETH deposits were as high as 80,463. However, withdrawals could not match up as the number was 49,101 ETH as of this writing.
This difference was proof that validators, who were to deposit a minimum of 23 ETH, trusted Ethereum to produce a good yield. In total, 23.9 million ETH has been deposited since Shanghai.
Withdrawals, on the other hand, have been lower at 10.1 million.
As expected, Lido Finance [LDO] led the top entities’ cohort. However, there has been a change in the supply of ETH staked. In a previous article, AMBCrypto reported how nearly 30% of the supply was locked.
Price increases drive withdrawals
But press time data showed that the ratio has declined to 26%. This decrease could be connected to the surge in withdrawals at different times.
Furthermore, on-chain data showed that as the price of ETH increased, the deposits fell.
From the chart below, you can see that the amount of staking deposits when the cryptocurrency traded between $2,500 and $3,000 was higher than when the value was over $4,000.
Source: Nansen
This data explains that some validators were satisfied with the reward as those prices. If this trend continues, then deposits on Ethereum’s Beacon Chain might reduce as the price increases.
However, the sentiment might change considering what happened when ETH changed hands below $1,500 and when it traded above it.
In the meantime, ETH’s price was $3,585. This value was a 2.05% decrease in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent decline, there have been bullish predictions for the cryptocurrency.

Realistic or not, here’s ETH’s market cap in BTC terms

If these predictions come to pass, then it might instill confidence in validators waiting on the sidelines to lock their assets.
At the same time, those who have staked at a much lower value could view the hike as an opportunity to get their yield.
