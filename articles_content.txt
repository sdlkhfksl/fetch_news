It ruled that the regulators failed to justify its decision to block the company from doing business.Binance.US didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.Florida Suspended Binance.US Amid Anti-Money Laundering Concerns
Florida cracked down on Binance.US in November, using an emergency order to suspend its money transmitter license. This action came one week after Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to violating US anti-money laundering laws on Nov. 21, 2023.Despite the global Binance exchange facing action from the US government, its local affiliate continued operating within the country.“We remain fully operational and are committed to continuing to serve our customers with the same products and services as we always have,” the US affiliate said on Nov. 28.Florida Regulator’s Process Deemed Unfair
After the emergency order, Binance.US challenged Florida’s regulators. The platform argued that the order was riddled with errors, misinterpreted local laws, and would cause significant financial harm. The firm pointed to potential losses for over 170,000 Florida accounts and the dangers forced asset liquidation would cause.The judges unanimously sided with Binance.US in their ruling. They noted that the Florida Office of Financial Regulation failed to justify that the process for arriving at its decision was fair under the circumstances.“A forced and untimely sale of Florida customers’ digital assets threatens financial harm because of digital asset price fluctuations,” the court wrote. “In addition, an account holder who is forced to sell a digital asset at a price higher than a cost basis would incur unplanned and extensive tax liabilities.”The judges conclusively noted that the ESO failed to discuss alternative remedies. They also failed to explain why less harsh measures would be insufficient to address the alleged emergency.

Speculation Grows Around Potential Spot Solana ETFs


As the anticipation builds around the SEC’s potential approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), experts are turning their attention to the possibility of other cryptocurrencies, like Solana (SOL), gaining similar recognition.
Industry leaders are discussing whether Solana could be the next asset to see the introduction of spot ETFs, a move that could significantly impact the crypto market.
Industry Perspectives on Spot Solana ETFs

In a recent CNBC appearance, Brian Kelly, CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM, highlighted Solana’s potential, noting that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are the top three cryptocurrencies for this cycle. Furthermore, Kelly suggested that if the SEC approves spot Ethereum ETFs, it would provide clearer regulations for Ethereum and the broader market. This potentially leads to the approval of more spot crypto ETFs, including Solana.

ETF analyst James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence offered insights in response to Kelly’s speculation. Seyffart emphasized the regulatory hurdles Solana faces, particularly due to its current classification as a security by the SEC.

“Based on current precedent/needs — Will happen within a few years of getting a CFTC regulated futures market. But Congress & Market structure bills like FIT21 could make it happen quicker. I think a SOL ETF would see most demand vs other digital assets (aside from BTC & ETH). But SEC isn’t dancing around SOL’s status like they have ETH. Those lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken and others flat out say ‘Solana is a security’. Which could very easily make this a very rocky road,” Seyffart noted.

Despite the challenges, Seyffart acknowledged the demand for Solana ETFs. However, he suggested that Litecoin (LTC) might see ETF approval first, albeit with less market interest. Crypto journalist Laura Shin added that while Litecoin might have “little regulatory baggage,” Solana makes sense from a usage and fundamentals perspective.

The crypto community eagerly awaits the SEC’s official decision on spot Ethereum ETFs, which could set the stage for future approvals. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas speculated that an announcement might come around 16:00 today. His prediction was based on the timing of the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.

UK Gets Its First Low-Cost Crypto ETPs as WisdomTree Lands FCA Approval


							

UK regulatory approval paves the way for wider institutional crypto adoption.



WisdomTree offers low-cost, physically-backed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE.



The SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US has led to adoption by other countries.




In a move that could significantly expand access to cryptocurrencies for institutional investors in the UK, WisdomTree received approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to list its Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Ethereum (ETHW) exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).



The listing, expected for May 28th, comes just two months after the LSE’s initial announcement and positions WisdomTree as one of the first issuers to secure a crypto ETP listing with the FCA.



These physically-backed ETPs boast a competitive Management Expense Ratio (MER) of 0.35%, making them among the most affordable institutional-grade crypto exposure in Europe.



Reacting to this news, Alexis Marinof, Head of Europe at WisdomTree, emphasized that this listing is essential for industry growth and will increase crypto participation in the UK market. He stated:




“FCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty – we would expect FCA approval of our crypto ETPs’ prospectus to remove those barriers to entry.”




WisdomTree has pioneered institutional-grade crypto products in Europe, launching its first Physical Bitcoin ETP in 2019. The firm currently offers a diverse portfolio of eight physically backed crypto ETPs, including both single-asset and diversified crypto baskets.









The recent wave of regulatory approvals for crypto products around the world appears to be driven, in part, by the success of Bitcoin ETFs in the US, which saw significant inflows following their launch. This has prompted other financial centers, like Hong Kong, to fast-track their own crypto investment offerings.



Notably, Hong Kong recently approved Bitcoin and Ether ETFs with features like in-kind transfers and multiple fiat currency denominations, allowing for more convenient investment options. However, despite these functionalities, Hong Kong’s ETFs attracted a relatively modest $22.5 million on their first day of trading, highlighting the nascent stage of institutional adoption in this market.

‘Quite Likely’ Bitcoin Explodes to Six Figures This Cycle, Predicts Analyst Kevin Svenson - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Analyst and trader Kevin Svenson is expressing bullish sentiment on Bitcoin (BTC) amid a double-digit rise in the flagship crypto asset’s price over the past seven days.
Svenson tells his 78,400 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is on a parabolic trend that started in the fourth quarter of 2023 and could rally to a target of around $90,000.










According to the analyst and trader, Bitcoin could then surge higher following a correction that would potentially come after hitting the initial $90,000 target.
“So it’s not the end of the cycle when we hit $90,000 breakdown… it is simply just an area to cool off to go sideways for re-accumulation, healthy price action, let coins change hands. Let a whole new group of investors get in on that sideways action. That’s healthy. And then look to run up again…
…and yes we could probably go to six figures in this cycle. It’s quite likely that we do.”

Svenson also says that Bitcoin could against his expectations.
“Is it possible that we don’t go that high? That’s also possible – we hit a price target slightly lower than $90,000 and we break the trend. That’s also a break of the parabolic trend which might mean we’re going sideways for a while before going up again. There are a lot of possibilities.”

Why Toncoin has not joined Bitcoin, Ethereum, in the latest crypto rally - AMBCrypto



Toncoin was underperforming, trading at $6.2 at press time.
TON’s market cap was $22 billion, ranking in the top 10 despite recent price drops.

Toncoin [TON], the native cryptocurrency of the Toncoin network, is stubbornly sitting out the current crypto rally. 
While most major altcoins have surged thanks to Bitcoin’s [BTC] recovery above $70K and the Ethereum [ETH] spot ETF hype, TON has fallen by 5.8%, now trading at a disappointing $6.2. What gives?
TON is struggling, but it’s not all bad
Notably, TON has been struggling to join the crypto rally. Despite its weak performance, it boasts a solid $22 billion market cap, placing it in the top 10 cryptocurrencies. 
So, while the price action might be sluggish, it’s still holding a significant place in the crypto ecosystem.
Santiment has pointed out TON’s impressive growth in the past six months. Specifically, the number of non-empty wallets holding TON has shot up by 110%, reaching 16,800. 
This suggested that there was still a lot of interest and belief in Toncoin’s potential.
TON’s yearly gains are still among the highest in the market, registering over 220%. 
Moreover, data from DeFiLlama shows that the altcoin’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to over $289 million, showcasing the widespread adoption and prominence of The Open Network’s dApps.
Technical analysis
TON/USDt 5-day trading chart displayed a volatile trading pattern, with the price experiencing several significant fluctuations. 
Toncoin reached a high near $6.75 and a low around $6.20, indicating a trading range of $0.55 over the past five days.
Source: TradingView
After reaching its peak, Toncoin experienced a sharp decline, thanks to a strong sell-off or profit-taking near the highs. 
The price stabilized somewhat after reaching lows, suggesting some level of support around the $6.20 mark.
TON’s trading volume has been relatively consistent, with spikes correlating closely with significant price movements. This means that there is active trading during periods of high volatility.
Over the five days, the most consistent support level appeared at around $6.20, and the price bounced back multiple times due to the bears staying largely in control.

Is your portfolio green? Check out the TON Profit Calculator

Due to the strong bearish pattern, it has witnessed, TON will likely fail to hold on to the $6.2 support level, thereby plunging below $6 or even $5.5. But if it holds on, a modest rise to $6.5 might be on the horizon.
So, TON still has a chance to join the rally.

Swimming Cat (SWIMCAT) Will Surge 15,000% Ahead of Bitrue Listing, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Swimming Cat (SWIMCAT) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Swimming Cat (SWIMCAT), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Swimming Cat presents a similar opportunity.



Swimming Cat has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days before it will be listed on Bitrue – a massive cryptocurrency exchange – and Swimming Cat could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Swimming Cat can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Swimming Cat on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Swimming Cat by entering its contract address – 2NsBvNNCzDDfhuzq6D55mCyzg6zt43rfdjnzTAg14Kr4 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SWIMCAT.

Nvidia Smashes Q1 Targets, Unveils 10-to-1 Stock Split


On Wednesday, American technology giant Nvidia (NVDA) announced its Q1 2024 earnings report. The company’s performance exceeded expectations for both sales and earnings, resulting in a significant rise in its stock price.
The company’s performance highlights the ongoing robust demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, with notable gains in its data center sales and networking parts.
Nvidia’s Strong Q1 2024 Earnings Boost AI Market Confidence

Nvidia reported revenue of $26.04 billion, surpassing the expected $24.65 billion. The chipmaker also saw a significant increase in net income, reaching $14.88 billion, or $5.98 per share. In comparison, in Q1 2023, Nvidia’s net income was $2.04 billion, or $0.82 per share.
Nvidia’s data center category, including AI chips and components for AI servers, saw a 427% increase in revenue to $22.56 billion. Colette Kress, Nvidia’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), attributed this growth to shipments of Hopper graphics processors, including the H100 GPU. She highlighted Meta’s Lama 3 announcement, which utilized 24,000 H100 GPUs, as a key driver.

Networking revenue also surged, reaching $3.17 billion, over three times higher than Q1 on the previous year. Nvidia’s InfiniBand products significantly contributed to this growth by supporting the connection of vast chip clusters.
Additionally, Nvidia’s gaming revenue rose 18% to $2.65 billion, driven by strong demand for its hardware. The company also reported $427 million in professional visualization sales and $329 million in automotive sales.
CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that demand for Nvidia’s AI chips remains robust. The company anticipates revenue from its next-generation AI chip, Blackwell, later this year.
According to its official website, the Blackwell GPU architecture features six transformative technologies for accelerated computing. These technologies will help unlock breakthroughs in data processing, engineering simulation, electronic design automation, computer-aided drug design, quantum computing, and generative AI.

“We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI,” Huang said.

Nvidia repurchased $7.7 billion of shares during the quarter and paid $98 million in dividends. On the same day, Nvidia announced a 10-to-1 forward stock split to make stock ownership more accessible.
Each record holder of common stock as of June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares to be distributed after market close on June 7, 2024. Split-adjusted trading will begin on June 10, 2024.

Nvidia also increased its quarterly cash dividend from $0.04 to $0.10 per share on a pre-split basis. Post-split, the dividend will be $0.01 per share. Looking ahead, Nvidia projects $28 billion in revenue for this quarter.
NVDA’s price skyrocketed after the announcement, surpassing the $1,000 mark. During the US stock market after hours, at 17:32 ET, NVDA traded at $1,019. Yet, its price has now been corrected to $1,007 at the time of writing.

Optimism surrounding Nvidia’s performance extends to the crypto market, particularly AI-related tokens. In the past seven days, some major AI tokens, such as Fetch.AI (FET), Render (RNDR), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Bittensor (TAO), enjoyed an increase of roughly 10% to 20%. However, shortly after the earnings report release, these tokens entered correction phases, signaling sell-the-news actions from the investors.

Binance Tax Case in Nigeria Adjourned, Bribery Claims Emerge


							

Nigerian court postpones tax evasion trial of Binance



Binance executives accused of facilitating illicit flows, face laundering charges



Binance CEO alleges bribery demands by Nigerian authorities, sparking dispute




A Nigerian court has adjourned a tax evasion case against Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange, until next month. The postponement came after authorities failed to produce Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive charged in the case, in court on Wednesday; as reported by Reuters.



Neither Nigerian authorities nor Binance offered an explanation for Gambaryan’s absence. Moses Ideho, a lawyer for the revenue service, said Gambaryan was expected to be brought to court by the Nigerian prison service. Judge Emeka Nwite then set June 14 as the date for the possible arraignment of Binance and Gambaryan.



Gambaryan and another Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, were detained by Nigerian authorities following an official meeting where Binance was accused of facilitating a $26 billion illicit flow. The executives, whose passports were seized, filed a lawsuit against the Nigerian authorities alleging human rights violations.



The case escalated further when Binance CEO Richard Teng accused Nigerian authorities of demanding a $140 million bribe, a claim the authorities dismissed as a “diversionary tactic.”









Ginger Onwusibe, Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes, rejected Teng’s allegations, stating that Binance was attempting to blackmail the authorities. “There were absolutely no solicitations or demands of any kind made by representatives of the Committee towards Binance at any point,” he said.



Binance and its executives face four counts of tax evasion, accused of failing to register with Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service. They are also charged with laundering more than $35 million, with a trial on those charges scheduled for Thursday.

Is Binance Preparing to List a New Altcoin? Here is the Surprise Altcoin at the Focus of the Claims! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the altcoins listed by Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, are closely followed by investors, there has been a new development regarding the altcoin listing.
Chinese cryptocurrency journalist Wu Blockchain said in his post that some monitoring robots detected that Binance added a new Toncoin (TON) port on May 23.


Stating that this situation seems to be a signal for Binance to list TON, but it is just a prediction, Wu said:

“Some monitoring robots detected that Binance added a new Toncoin (TON) port on May 23.

House passes crypto regulation bill, eyes Senate approval


The U.S. House of Representatives approved the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a bill designed to regulate the cryptocurrency market. 



The bipartisan vote on Wednesday resulted in 279 members, including 71 Democrats, endorsing the legislation, while 136 opposed it. 



This bill, now proceeding to the Senate, could forge a new regulatory framework for digital assets, enhancing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) oversight.



It also introduces guidelines for the secondary market trading of digital commodities initially offered as investment contracts, in addition to addressing stablecoins and anti-money laundering protocols. 

	
	
	
	


Despite the White House’s critique of the bill for lacking adequate consumer and investor safeguards, the administration has indicated a readiness to work towards a regulatory framework for digital assets.



FIT21’s passage signals a potential shift in the Congressional perspective on cryptocurrencies and their influence on the financial sector. 



FIT21 has encountered opposition from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who contends that the bill might lead to regulatory loopholes and compromise investor protection. 



House Financial Services Committee Ranking Democrat Maxine Waters has also expressed concerns, arguing that the bill could overburden the CFTC and not provide sufficient regulatory authority.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) in Stasis as SEC ETF Decision Looms, Nvidia (NVDA) Hits Record High

"The SEC should approve U.S.-listed ETH ETFs today. Hours before the Bitcoin ETF approval, SEC Gensler tweeted that crypto investors should consider all potential risks before making any investment. Today, a tweet could come around 9 a.m. ET. and would provide more clarity on whether approval would be imminent," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients.

Research Firm Boosts Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Probability To 90%: But Will It Be A 'Sell The News' Event? - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) - Benzinga

Cryptocurrency research firm 10x Research raised the chances of the SEC greenlighting the Ethereum ETH spot ETF later today to 90%.What Happened: In its latest newsletter, 10x Research deemed the approval a "formality". It noted that an X post by SEC Chair Gary Gensler cautioning investors of potential risks–similar to the one before the approval of Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs in January–could come around 9 a.m. EDT. This is typically a sign of the approval being immediate.The analytics platform highlighted that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE has narrowed its discount to its net asset value (NAV) to 8% from 30% a week ago."An 8% discount implies at least a 90% probability that an ETF would be approved," the firm pointed out. The research firm also foresaw the approval becoming a "sell the news" event. These fears aligned with the moves of Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke who transferred nearly 10,000 ETH to cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. Why It Matters: The mood in the cryptocurrency market was upbeat as VanEck’s spot Ether ETF was listed by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) — a necessary precursor to SEC approval. Note that the final decision on VanEck's application is expected to come from the SEC later today.Alongside, a slew of other ETF hopefuls, including BlackRock Inc. BLK amended their 19b-4 filings for spot Ether ETFs.Meanwhile, the chances of approval on decentralized prediction market Polymarket jumped to 67%Price Action: At the time of writing, Ether was exchanging hands at $3,785.04, following marginal gains of 0.83% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Dogecoin Reversal Imminent, Says This Analyst — Predicts Over 30% UpsideMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

The alliance aims “to protect and educate users, emphasizing that scams are a tech-wide issue, not limited to social media, crypto, or finance,” Coinbase noted in an official release.According to Global Financial Fraud assessment by the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) released in April, global embrace of new technologies are “enabling organized crime groups to better target victims around the world.”Perpetrators are increasingly using deception strategies like pig-butchering, which entail fraudsters gaining victims’ trust before stealing from them, it added.The use of AI, large language models and cryptocurrencies have resulted in more sophisticated frauds with little cost, INTERPOL stressed.As a result, the Tech Against Scams initiative creates a safer digital environment and prevent scammers from exploiting users.“Our collaboration across sectors will enhance visibility and help us develop evolving best practices to combat rapidly evolving scams, such as pig butchering,” Coinbase noted.Combating Scams Through Education
Estimates suggest that consumers worldwide lose $1.4 trillion to financial scams every year. The coalition primarily aims to help users recognize the early signs of whether they are in contact with a scammerThe alliance focuses on educating users about scam strategies and tactics and how to prevent them.“Together with industry leaders, we’re committed to protecting and educating users,” Coinbase stated on X.“Tech companies across industries collaborating with each other is essential for preventing criminal activity, and ultimately helps online platforms stay ahead of, and develop effective solutions for, various types of financial crimes,” said Yoel Roth, VP, Trust & Safety at Match Group.Roth also noted that the collaboration would invest in new technologies to help disrupt fraud and scams faster.

                        Crypto investor and trader Brian Kelly has suggested that Solana (SOL) could potentially become the next cryptocurrency to have a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.On a recent episode of CNBC’s ‘Fast Money’, Kelly, who also serves as the founder and CEO of the BKCM Digital Asset Fund, posed the question, “The trade now is, who’s next?”He then suggested, “You’ve got to think about Solana as probably the next one. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are probably the big three for this cycle.”The speculation comes just a day before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to decide on at least one proposed spot Ether (ETH) ETF.Solana ETF Might Not Come Next
However, not everyone shares Kelly’s optimism.Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, expressed skepticism, stating that a spot Solana ETF might not materialize until a Solana futures product is listed on a major exchange or until Congress establishes a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, echoed Geraci’s sentiments, predicting that the launch of a spot Solana ETF could be years away, contingent upon regulatory milestones such as approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).Despite the differing opinions, Seyffart highlighted the potential demand for a spot Solana ETF, suggesting it could surpass other digital assets outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum.However, regulatory hurdles loom large.The SEC, under the leadership of Gary Gensler, has previously categorized Solana as a security in lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken, adding complexity to the path for potential ETF applicants.Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, offered a contrasting perspective, suggesting that either Litecoin (LTC) or Dogecoin (DOGE) might beat Solana to the ETF race due to perceived cleaner regulatory pathways, despite lower demand compared to Solana.While few ETF issuers have openly discussed the possibility of filing for a spot Solana ETF, Franklin Templeton, a trillion-dollar asset management firm, recently praised Solana and its founder Anatoly Yakovenko.This has fueled speculation about the firm’s potential interest in launching a Solana ETF in the future.Fidelity Files Amended S-1 Application with SEC
As reported, Fidelity made an amended S-1 application to SEC for its spot Ether ETF yesterday. The updated application specifies that the underlying Ether tokens of the ETF will not be staked.S-1 filings are mandatory registration forms required by the SEC for launching publicly traded securities products in the United States.The speculation around the approval of spot Ether ETFs has also provided a boost to spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw an uptick in inflows on Tuesday.BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) witnessed a substantial inflow of $290 million on May 21, marking a reversal in the trend of zero or minimal inflows observed over the past six weeks.The recent influx of funds into BlackRock’s ETF represents the highest level since April 5, eclipsing the cumulative inflows witnessed over the past 21 trading days.On May 21, BTC reached a six-week high of $71,600, but it subsequently dipped below the $70,000 level during early trading on May 22, currently trading at $69,444 at the time of writing.

How Rumors About Bybit’s Insolvency Sparked Panic


Recent rumors suggesting the insolvency of crypto exchange Bybit have sent shockwaves through the crypto community, escalating panic and speculation. 
A significant error on Arkham’s on-chain analysis platform mistakenly showed a drastic drop in Bybit’s assets, triggering anxiety.
Bybit Gives Clarification Regarding the Insolvency Rumors

Initially fueled by the alarming graphical representation, the rumors led to a substantial outflow of funds. Reports from DefiLlama co-founder 0xngmi indicate withdrawals exceeding $50 million. Despite this, 0xngmi contextualized the situation, stating that the withdrawals are nothing compared to Bybit’s total assets.
In response to these unsettling events, a Bybit spokesperson clarified the situation in an interview with BeInCrypto. The Bybit spokesperson pointed out that the rumors were baseless and possibly propagated by individuals dissatisfied with Bybit’s stringent compliance measures.

“We were surprised to unexpectedly receive an inquiry from some private talks. Bybit is very stable and safe with all your assets,” the spokesperson told BeInCrypto. 

Furthermore, Bybit has encouraged its users and stakeholders to refer to its official Proof of Reserves (POR) report. This report confirms the stability of its asset base, along with data from other reputable on-chain analysis platforms such as Nansen and DefiLlama.

This incident occurs against a backdrop of heightened vigilance within the crypto community. Following the high-profile collapses of several crypto firms in 2022, including FTX and Celsius, there is a pervasive atmosphere of caution and skepticism about the solvency of crypto exchanges.
Historically, such rumors have not been confined to Bybit alone. In December 2023, similar concerns were raised about another exchange, MEXC, following the mysterious deletion of the “MEXC_CEO” Twitter account. Consequently, user complaints about frozen funds on social platforms intensified worries about the financial health of crypto exchanges.

The rapid response from Bybit and the clarification provided should reassure its users and investors. Nevertheless, this incident highlights the fragile nature of trust in the volatile crypto sector and the speed at which misinformation can spread, affecting market stability and investor confidence.

Bitcoin's Next Big Move: Analysts Predict A Breakout At $71,500


																Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, appears poised for a major move, but the direction remains shrouded in mystery. Analysts are divided on whether a bullish breakout or an extended consolidation period lies ahead.

	Related Reading


Reaching New Highs: Euphoric Bulls On The Horizon?
Renowned crypto analyst Checkmate has ignited a spark of optimism with his “Euphoric Bull” theory. According to Checkmate, a surge to a new all-time high could signal a critical shift in market sentiment. This type of bull phase would represent a significant acceleration in bullish momentum, potentially leading to a steeper price increase.
Checkmate’s theory hinges on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a metric that compares the current market value of Bitcoin to the total value paid to acquire all Bitcoins in circulation. Historically, when the MVRV ratio climbs above one standard deviation of its average, it has often preceded a shift to a “Euphoric Bull” phase.

However, Checkmate warns that Bitcoin doesn’t always follow the script on the first try. The market often exhibits cautious behavior, with Bitcoin potentially attempting to breach this key MVRV level multiple times before a decisive breakout.

Bitcoin’s recent consolidation period comes after a surge that saw the alpha crypto reach a six-week high of $71,950. While a slight pullback has occurred, Bitcoin is still trading comfortably near the $70,000 level, with a healthy daily trading volume. This price movement suggests a potential pause before the next significant move, making the current moment a tense waiting game for both traders and investors.
Breakout Or Consolidation? A Bullish Dilemma
Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has emerged as a key voice in the ongoing debate. Rekt Capital believes a weekly candle closing above $71,500 could be the catalyst for a significant breakout. This milestone, if achieved, could trigger a surge in bullish momentum, propelling Bitcoin towards a notable uptrend.
BTCUSD trading at $69,460 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com
However, Rekt Capital also acknowledges the possibility of an extended consolidation phase. Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a tendency to consolidate within its re-accumulation range for several weeks before experiencing a breakout. This extended consolidation, Rekt Capital argues, would bring Bitcoin closer to aligning with historical halving cycles, events that have historically preceded major bull runs.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Meanwhile, other analysts are predicting a potential banner year for the world’s leading cryptocurrency in 2025. The high-end prediction of $168,459 represents a staggering potential increase, fueled by factors like historical price trends and the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. Buoying this optimism are technical indicators pointing towards a “Bullish” market sentiment with a hefty dose of “Extreme Greed.”

However, a dose of reality is necessary. The wide range between the predicted high and low ($69,971) underscores the inherent uncertainty in these forecasts. Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, evident in the recent 4.47% price swings within just 30 days, further complicates things. While this level of greed suggests investor confidence, it can also be a warning sign of a potential market correction on the horizon.

Solana: The Dark Horse in the Crypto ETF Race as Ethereum Surges


							

Brian Kelly predicts Solana as next possible crypto spot ETF.



Solana ETF approval faces regulatory hurdles, experts say.



Some experts favor Litecoin or Dogecoin for the next ETF due to their simpler mechanisms.




Crypto investor Brian Kelly suggested Solana (SOL) could be the next cryptocurrency to secure a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, following the SEC’s anticipated decision on a spot Ether ETF.







Kelly, who is also the CEO of BKCM Digital Asset Fund, believes Solana is one of the “big three” coins alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, some industry analysts disagree.



Approval for a spot Solana ETF hinges on a futures product being listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or the establishment of a clear regulatory framework from Congress. Currently, only Bitcoin and Ether futures have been approved.



Even if approved, experts believe there would be significant demand for a Solana ETF, potentially surpassing all other digital assets except Bitcoin and Ether. However, the SEC’s classification of Solana as a security in past lawsuits could pose challenges.









Others like Adam Cochran of Cinneamhain Ventures believe Litecoin or Dogecoin might be next due to a “cleaner path” with proof-of-work mechanisms similar to Bitcoin.



While few ETF issuers have spoken of a Solana ETF, Franklin Templeton’s recent praise for Solana has sparked speculation. Additionally, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan has called Solana the “crypto asset of 2024” due to its institutional potential.Market analysts who predicted that Solana (SOL) would surpass Ether (ETH) in the upcoming bull run are facing a reality check as ETH stages an impressive surge. On Monday, Ether (ETH) recorded gains exceeding 19%, boosting its market capitalization by a significant $70 billion. This surge brings ETH’s overall market cap to $439 billion, narrowing the gap with Solana’s total market value.

VanEck Throws Down the Gauntlet: First to File, First to Launch Ether ETF?


							

VanEck pushes for first-to-file advantage in ether ETF race.



SEC faces calls for fair assessment as multiple firms vie for approval.



The SEC is set to make its decision on the ETH ETF on May 23.




Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, asserted to the SEC that the first firm to file for the first ether ETF should be the first firm to launch it. 



This benefits VanEck, the New-York-based fund group, which manages $100 billion in assets. It filed for a spot ether ETF in the US in 2021 and then refiled in July 2023. 



The SEC had 240 days to review VanEck’s application, which means the regulator was expected to rule by May 21; one day before the Ark Invest/21Shares proposal. Ark Invest is one of several firms seeking to launch Ether ETFs, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, Invesco, and Hashdex.









Over the past few weeks, the SEC, stock exchanges, and fund issuers have extensively engaged. A Tuesday X post came from VanEck: “SEC comments rolling in.”



Sigel, speaking at an X Space on Wednesday, made VanEck’s case: 




“VanEck was the first to file our S-1 for this spot ethereum ETF, and we fully expect to get our comments back first and go first. The SEC should let their process work and make that happen. The comments rolling in for me is a good sign.”




The first-come, first-served principle is the only fair one, as the VanEck executive emphasized. Sigel added that he fundamentally disagreed “with the whole lining everyone up and saying go at the same time; that’s never how the process works,” adding that it “just always pits the incumbents over the smaller entrants.”The price of Ethereum (ETH) has been on the rise since the chances of approval of spot ETH ETFs were increased by analysts from 25% to 75%.

Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BIDDOG will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Biden in a Dogs World.



Currently, Biden in a Dogs World can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BIDDOG on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Biden in a Dogs World by entering its contract address – bUv1o6DFK5Wa7V1SY2HoFTUmaZSQ58eKqk5rKxvWuZr – in the receiving field.




BIDDOG currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Decentralized AI Platform Bittensor Gains 15% Amid Unconfirmed Grayscale Rumors - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDecentralized AI project Bittensor has seen its native token, TAO, gain 15% in the past day. It seems to have been helped along by an unconfirmed rumor that longstanding digital asset manager Grayscale plans to register a new trust that tracks the token. But that's not the only recent news for the project.At the time of writing on early Thursday morning, the Bittensor price has climbed 15% in the past day to trade for $483.10. That's a 24% gain compared to this time last week, according to CoinGecko data.That makes TAO the best performing asset in the top 100 on CoinGecko at the time of writing, beating ETH meme coin darling PepeCoin. PEPE and other meme OGs like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, have all seen sizable gains as investors wait with bated breath to see if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Ethereum ETF to trade.A pseudonymous Crypto Twitter user, CEYEBER—who founded the official Bittensor Community Channel on Telegram—claims to have had the Grayscale rumor "confirmed by close sources." But if it's real, there's still no sign of it in Securities and Exchange Commission filings.If the TAO offering were going to be another close-end fund available over-the-counter to wealthy investors—like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was before it was converted to a spot ETF and the rest of the firm's single asset funds still are—then there would likely be a Regulation D filing. More recently, in March, Grayscale filed to establish a Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust as a new spot BTC offering with an S-1 registration.Neither type of filing has been submitted at the time of writing. In fact, "Bittensor" doesn't appear in any SEC filings at all going back to 2001. But that doesn't mean it's impossible.

Spot Solana ($SOL) ETFs: The Next Frontier in Cryptocurrency Investments? | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 22 May 2024 when Brian Kelly, a notable crypto investor and CNBC’s ‘Fast Money’ trader, suggested that Solana (SOL) could be the next cryptocurrency to get a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Kelly’s prediction has ignited a lively debate among industry experts and market observers.



Kelly is a financial analyst and television personality known for his expertise in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. He is the founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, an investment firm focused on digital currencies. Kelly is also a frequent contributor to CNBC, where he provides analysis and commentary on financial markets, with a particular focus on cryptocurrency trends and investment strategies. He has authored “The Bitcoin Big Bang: How Alternative Currencies Are About to Change the World,” which explores the potential of Bitcoin and other digital currencies to revolutionize the financial industry.



According to a report by Cointelegraph, during the CNBC post-market talk show Fast Money, Kelly expressed his belief that Solana might be the next major cryptocurrency to be featured in a spot ETF. “You’ve got to think about Solana as probably the next one. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are probably the big three for this cycle,” Kelly remarked.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Not everyone shares Kelly’s optimism. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, countered that a spot Solana ETF is unlikely unless there is a Solana futures product listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or a robust cryptocurrency regulatory framework is established by Congress. 



James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, echoed Geraci’s caution. Seyffart suggested that a spot Solana ETF would require a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-regulated market, which he believes could happen within a few years. He noted that such an ETF could see significant demand, second only to Bitcoin and Ether. However, he also pointed out that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has previously classified Solana as a security in lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken, potentially complicating future applications.







Contrary to Kelly’s and Seyffart’s views, Adam Cochran, partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, argued that either Litecoin (LTC) or Dogecoin (DOGE) would be more likely candidates for the next spot ETF.







At the time of writing (8:47 a.m. UTC on May 23), SOL is trading at around $177.31, down 1.6% in the past 24-hour period. In the year-to-date period, SOL is up 70% vs USD.

Samson Mow, former Blockstream CSO and now the chief executive officer at Bitcoin adoption-focused company Jan3, is a radical Bitcoin maximalist.As the deadline for the SEC to reveal its decision on spot Ethereum ETFs is drawing closer, Mow began to slam Ethereum-based ETFs. In a recent tweet, this “$1 million Bitcoin” advocate wrote that he is expecting them to be beaten by Bitcoin-based ones.Besides, he believes now is the last time for holders to sell Ethereum at a good price against Bitcoin."Last chance to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC"Samson Mow tweeted that he does not believe that the potential approval of Ethereum funds by the SEC regulator is bullish since, according to him, even if approved, spot Ethereum-based ETFs will “undoubtedly massively underperform Bitcoin ETFs.”For those who are in doubt, the Bitcoin maximalist suggested comparing demand for both BTC and ETH on other markets and said it is important to consider that Ethereum will not give staking rewards.Mow concluded his tweet by saying that now is “the last chance to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC.” In the comments to his root tweet, Samson added that he expects the news of the potential approval to become one of the biggest “sell the news events” this year.When a commentator pointed out that there is no company of the scale of MicroStrategy, which is acquiring Ethereum now in the same amounts as Michael Saylor’s company, is accumulating Bitcoin.Contrary to Mow, Bitcoiner and VC investor Anthony Pompliano believes that the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC could become “the last dam to be broken” before the U.S. approves the entire cryptocurrency space.Bitcoin ETFs keep seeing inflowsAnalytics account on X @spotonchain has revealed a recent update on spot Bitcoin ETF flows.

Andrew Tate hints Ethereum could hit this price


    Although the cryptocurrency community is familiar with Andrew Tate’s love for Bitcoin (BTC), the social media personality and former professional kickboxer also seems bullish on the market’s largest altcoin – Ethereum (ETH) – as he recently suggested it would surpass an important price level.



Indeed, true to his style of communication, the popular influencer with a massive following promised his followers on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that he would call them all “losers” if Ethereum hits the price of $4,000, according to his X post on May 22.



At the same time, Tate shared his post from early March, when he correctly predicted that Bitcoin would reach $70,000 and, as promised, told his audience they were losers when the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, indeed, crossed this important psychological barrier.











Indeed, his enthusiasm seems to stem from the expectations that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve the first spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) any day now, which have also sparked a price rally. 



Andrew Tate net worth



Elsewhere, in April, Tate asked his followers if he should “buy 10,000,000 of bitcoin” (offering only ‘yes’ options), indicating plans to buy $10 million worth of Bitcoin, adding up to the estimated Andrew Tate net worth between $4 million and $12 million, most of which comes from cars he owns with his brother Tristan Tate.







Furthermore, he has also claimed to have earned about $85 million on “Defi land” during the previous bull run, acknowledging that there might be worthwhile digital assets out there and inviting his audience to take a guess at what these valuable crypto assets were this time around.







Andrew Tate Twitter teachings



As a reminder, the influencer often uses X to propagate his often controversial ideas among his supporters, and he has also revealed his Bitcoin dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, according to which he has been buying BTC “every single week without fail” since 2018.







More recently, Tate announced he was going to completely abandon fiat money and buy over $100 million worth of Bitcoin after he touted the largest asset in the crypto market as the only acceptable monetary and investment choice, as Finbold reported on May 16 and April 29.







Meanwhile, Ethereum, which appears to be his most recent crypto recommendation, was at press time trading at $3,810.13, getting closer to Tate’s predicted price as it advances 1.53% on the day, 26.38% across the week, and 20.91% in the past month, as per data on May 23.



That said, doing one’s own research, weighing all the risks, and keeping up with any relevant Ethereum news is critical when investing in the asset, as the situation in this sector can sometimes change unexpectedly.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally, Dogecoin (DOGE) Advancement, Ripple (XRP) Predictions: Bits Recap May 23


																TL;DR

BTC’s price climbed above $71,000 due to optimism about Ethereum ETF approval, resulting in a 6% weekly and 13% monthly increase, but then retraced to $69,500.
DOGE’s value ascended as well, briefly surpassing $0.17 and achieving a market cap near $25 billion. Significant metrics rose, with 85% of holders in profit.
XRP’s price saw a slight increase with predictions of further gains due to bullish indicators. The outcome of Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC could cause significant volatility.


BTC’s Uptrend
The price of the primary cryptocurrency started the ongoing week at around $67,000: the same level witnessed over the weekend. However, the consolidation came to an end on May 21 when BTC pumped above $71,000.
BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko

The main catalyst for the rally appeared to be the reemerged hopes that the US SEC could approve Ethereum ETFs as early as this week.
Over the past few days, BTC’s value slightly retraced and is currently trading at approximately $69,500 (per CoinGecko’s data). The figure represents a 6% rise on a weekly scale and a 13% spike in a month.
Numerous analysts believe that Bitcoin is yet to experience a real bull run. The X user Alpha Analysis recently predicted that the asset’s price might jump to as high as $138,000 this summer, assuming history repeats itself. 




DOGE Climbs the Crypto Ladder
The leading meme coin – Dogecoin (DOGE) – has also experienced a substantial price increase lately, briefly surpassing the $0.17 mark. Its market capitalization pumped to almost $25 billion before settling at around $24 billion, thus surpassing Toncoin (TON) as the ninth-biggest cryptocurrency. 
Important metrics related to Dogecoin’s ecosystem also witnessed a significant rise. On May 21, aggregated daily volume, where each transaction exceeds $100,000, exceeded $1.5 billion. A few days later, the figure surpassed the $2 billion milestone.
As of the moment, approximately 85% of all DOGE holders sit on paper profits, with whales controlling 63% of the circulating supply.
XRP Forecasts
Ripple’s XRP is also among the digital currencies that witnessed an uptick recently, albeit in a more modest fashion than its rivals. Many analysts expect the asset to perform much better in the near future, outlining impressive predictions.
The X user JAVON MARKS claimed that a bullish breakout is in the cards due to XRP nearing “a major converging point” and “an RSI Pattern that is currently indicating underlying momentum in prices.” 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a metric used in technical analysis to measure the speed and change of price movements. An RSI above 70 suggests the coin might be overbought and could be due for a correction. Data shows the ratio has predominantly hovered below the aforementioned figure during the ongoing month, currently pointing at 49.
Based on these conditions, the analyst set a wild target of $15-$20 for XRP’s value. “The signs for bullishness are there, and only time may be in the way of it being showcased,” they argued.
One essential factor that can propel severe volatility in XRP’s price is the possible outcome of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC. Those willing to learn about the case’s specifics and its potential impact on the asset, feel free to check our dedicated video below:

U.S. bitcoin spot ETFs have seen remarkable success, particularly BlackRock’s IBIT, which captured 94.86% of recent inflows, totalling $280 million out of $305.7 million. This fund now holds nearly 282,000 BTC, closely rivalling Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust.
Fidelity’s FBTC also saw significant inflows.
Other bitcoin ETFs experienced no activity.
BlackRock’s IBIT is attracting 414 institutional investors, making it the fastest-growing ETF.

                        The number of United States adults reporting crypto ownership or usage has seen a significant decline, according to the latest annual household survey conducted by the Fed. The survey, known as the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), indicates that approximately 18 million US adults reported using cryptocurrencies in 2023, representing a drop from previous years.In the 12-month period leading up to October 2023, the survey found that 7% of the surveyed US adults reported using cryptocurrencies, down from 10% in 2022 and 12% in 2021.Only 1% Used Crypto for Financial Transactions: Fed Survey
Among those who reported using crypto, only 1% stated that they used it for financial transactions or sending money, which is a 50% decrease from the previous year.On the other hand, 7% of respondents mentioned purchasing or holding cryptocurrencies as an investment.These findings from the Federal Reserve survey significantly differ from Coinbase’s claim that 52 million Americans own cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, did not provide any response on how it arrived at this figure.The survey shed light on the reasons behind crypto usage for financial transactions.Nearly 30% of respondents who used crypto for such purposes stated that it was because the recipient preferred cryptocurrencies.Notably, a lack of trust in banks was the least cited reason.The survey also revealed that individuals with annual incomes of $100,000 or more were more likely to have used cryptocurrencies for any reason.Regarding demographics, millennials (aged 30 to 44) constituted the largest group of crypto users, closely followed by Generation Z adults (aged 18 to 29).Additionally, men were three times more likely to use cryptocurrencies compared to women.The survey highlighted that Black and Hispanic adults were more commonly engaged in crypto usage for financial transactions, while Asian adults were the largest demographic using crypto as an investment.Conversely, White adults were the least likely to use cryptocurrencies for any reason.Conducted in October 2023, the survey included 11,488 US adults aged 18 and older.Crypto’s Influence in Politics Increases
Aside from its growing adoption among retail users, cryptocurrencies are also used to influence politics.A well-funded political action committee (PAC) backed by prominent figures in the cryptocurrency industry has set its sights on key Senate races, with the goal of potentially shifting the balance of power in Congress. The PAC, called Fairshake, recently spent over $10 million successfully opposing a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in California.As reported, approximately 73% of US voters believe that US presidential candidates should have an informed perspective on innovative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency. Likewise, a recent report from Coinbase claimed that California voters who own cryptocurrencies are expected to have a significant impact on the 2024 elections.

Notcoin down 55% since launch - Did Toncoin suffer as a result? - AMBCrypto



Notcoin has lost over 50% of its value in just seven days.
While Toncoin has seen a decline in demand, the buyers remain in control of its market.

NOT, the token that powers Notcoin, the play-to-earn clicker gaming app on Telegram, has shed over 50% of its value in the first week of its listing. 
Exchanging hands at $0.0053 at the time of writing, the altcoin’s price has plummeted by 55% since its launch on the Toncoin [TON] network on the 16th of May. 
During this time, it airdropped nearly $1 billion worth of NOT tokens to its eligible investors.
NOT quickly gained traction, reaching an all-time high of $0.037 shortly after its launch. 
Within 24 hours of being listed on major exchanges such as Binance [BNB], the token surged to the eighth position in trading volume, exceeding $1.4 billion.
However, NOT’s daily trading volume fell after the airdrop buzz cooled. 
With a trading volume of $130 million recorded at press time, this has plummeted by 91% since the 16th of May, according to Santiment’s data. 
Source: Santiment
Toncoin stands strong
AMBCrypto previously reported that the anticipation leading up to the NOT airdrop event resulted in a surge of activity on Toncoin, boosting the value of its TON coin.
However, data from Santiment shows that the decline in NOT’s trading activity has impacted the demand for TON. 
According to the on-chain data provider, the daily count of addresses involved in TON transactions has dropped by 40% in the past seven days.
Similarly, new demand for the altcoin has decreased as well. Since the 16th of May, the number of new addresses created daily to trade TON has fallen by 53%.
Source: Santiment
However, despite the reduction in daily demand for TON, the market remained significantly under bullish influence at press time. 
AMBCrypto found that TON closed above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the 23rd of May and traded above it at $6.49 as of this writing. 
When an asset rallies above its 20-day EMA, it is considered a bullish signal. This means that the asset’s current price has surged past its average price in the past 20 days. 
TON holders often interpret this as a shift toward coin accumulation.

Bloomberg analyst predicts Solana ETF delay despite community anticipation

James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, has suggested a potential timeline for the launch of a Solana-based spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).Seyffart indicated that a Solana ETF might be delayed despite growing anticipation within the crypto community following recent discussions surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs.CFTC-regulated futures marketThe Bloomberg ETF expert explained that the timeline for a Solana ETF could extend over several years, influenced by the regulatory environment in the United States. He said:“Based on current precedent/needs, [it] will happen within a few years of getting a CFTC-regulated futures market. But Congress [and] market structure bills like FIT21 could make it happen quicker.”He also highlighted that the Solana ETF might face delays due to its classification as a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Unlike Ethereum, the SEC has explicitly labeled Solana as a security in its lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken. Seyffart added:“But SEC isn’t dancing around SOL’s status like they have ETH. Those lawsuits against COIN and Kraken and others flat out say ‘Solana is a security.'”Despite these challenges, Seyffart believes a Solana-based ETF would likely attract more demand than other altcoins ETFs.Experts debate Solana ETFSeyffart’s comments come amid increasing community calls for a Solana ETF.On a recent CNBC show, Brian Kelly, CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM, suggested that Solana could be the next crypto-based spot ETF to debut in the US.Additionally, Kelly noted that the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could clarify the market, potentially paving the way for the launch of other crypto-based ETFs.However, Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, believes a spot Solana ETF won’t materialize until a Solana futures product is traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or US lawmakers establish clear crypto regulations. He added:“Crypto ETF spigot turned off for a while after spot Ethereum ETF approval.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Nancy Pelosi Votes For Landmark Crypto Bill, Defies Longtime Adviser And Current SEC Commissioner Who Gave Thumbs Down For Bitcoin ETF - Benzinga

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who voted in favor of the bill laying down clear regulations for the cryptocurrency industry, went against the stand of her former financial adviser and incumbent SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga.What Happened: In a massive win for the digital asset market in the U.S., the House of Representatives passed landmark legislation establishing a regulatory framework for the industry. The bill led by Republicans received bipartisan support, with as many as 71 Democrats voting in favor, including Pelosi.Following the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, also known as FIT21, Pelosi said in a statement, "The digital asset industry needs clearer rules of the road and the federal government needs stronger enforcement authority in order to ensure the responsible development of this emerging technology.""Millions of Americans own cryptocurrency.  American companies are the cutting edge of global financial technology.  Many jobs in my Bay Area community are dependent on this industry," the influential Democrat emphasized.Interestingly, Pelosi's stance contradicted that of Lizárraga, who served as her senior financial adviser for 10 years. Why It Matters: Lizárraga has backed SEC Chair Gary Gensler‘s position that most digital asset tokens are securities and serve as unregistered market participants.He was also one of two SEC commissioners who voted against the approving spot Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs earlier this year.Lizárraga criticized the crypto industry after the FTX collapse, saying it has worsened the financial market's underlying weaknesses. However, Pelosi’s vote for friendlier cryptocurrency legislation and strong support for the industry’s interests reflected a diverging stance.This also signaled an evolving perspective on the investment class in the country. With a growing crypto demographic–the highest in absolute numbers and the third-highest by population share–lawmakers may be inclined to take a more accommodating approach toward digital assets.Read Next: Research Firm Boosts Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Probability To 90%: But Will It Be A ‘Sell The News’ Event?Photo via Shutterstock

SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) surpasses one billion USD in assets - Crypto Valley Journal

The SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) announced that the issuance of digital assets on its platform surpassed the CHF 1 billion mark. This primarily involves the tokenization of traditional bonds on the blockchain.Since September 2021, the Swiss stock exchange SIX is operating a fully regulated platform for the issuance and trading of digital assets. SDX members include leading Swiss banking institutions such as UBS, ZKB, Raiffeisen Switzerland, several cantonal banks and others. In addition, international institutions are running their digital asset trials on the platform.
One Billion CHF thanks to World Bank bondThe participation of key issuers such as the World Bank, UBS AG, the City of Lugano, the Cantons of Zurich and Basel-Stadt, the City of St. Gallen and SIX Group AG has significantly advanced the digital transformation of the Swiss financial market, according to a press release. In particular, several issues were part of the SNB's Helvetia Phase III project, which enables settlement in Swiss francs (CHF) as a digital central bank currency (wCBDC). Switzerland is the only major financial center in the world to have enabled settlement of securities transactions in wCBDC. Interested readers can learn more about this topic in an interview with Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the SNB Board.SDX achieved this milestone in collaboration with the World Bank. The World Bank priced the first digital CHF bond from an international issuer to be settled in Swiss francs using the digital central bank currency (wCBDC) provided by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). With a maturity of seven years and a volume of CHF 200 million, this was the largest Swiss franc bond issued by the World Bank since 2009. SDX processes the coupon and redemption payments in tokenized CHF.
Further expansionThe success of the digital bond issuance strengthens SIX's position as a pioneer in digital assets. With a focus on regulatory compliance, security and efficiency, SDX continues to set new standards in digital finance, revolutionizing the way investors access and interact with financial markets."Surpassing the one billion mark underscores the growing acceptance and proliferation of digital assets in the global financial landscape and the leading position of the Swiss financial center in this critical area of capital market innovation. [...] The digital bonds issued to date remain accessible to the entire investor community as they are listed, traded and settled on both a regulated digital exchange and traditional market infrastructures." - David Newns, Head of SIX Digital Exchange

Analyst Says Blue-Chip Ethereum Rival Could Explode by up to 237%, Updates Outlook on Pepe, Floki and Chainlink - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist believes that a top Ethereum (ETH) rival could go on an explosive rally of more than 230%.
Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 213,800 followers on the social media platform X that Solana (SOL) could reach a new all-time high (ATH) by the end of the summer.










“1. New ATH by end of summer. 2. Cycle top around $400-$600.”
Source: Inmortal/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Solana’s price will consolidate before breaking through the diagonal resistance toward new ATHs. Solana reached its ATH of about $260 in November 2021.
Solana is trading for $178 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum’s rally to kick off the week will likely propel memecoins Pepe (PEPE) and Floki (FLOKI) higher.
“ETH moving gives the altcoins a free hand to move as well. PEPE is following well and it is very likely that FLOKI will move soon too. You know, contagion, muscle memory.”
Source: Inmortal/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Floki could break out to $0.000340, a more than 52% gain from the current value.
Floki is trading for $0.000223 at time of writing up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the analyst believes that decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK) is heading to $28 if it can hold $16 as support on the three-day chart.
“Marines ready to send it if we find acceptance above $16.”

LINK is trading for $16.35 at time of writing, down 2% in the last 24 hours.

BREAKING! SEC Begins Negotiations with Companies Applying for Ethereum ETFs! - Bitcoin Sistemi


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has begun discussions with prospective issuers of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) regarding their S-1 registration statements, according to a senior official at an issuing firm.
SEC Working on S-1 Forms with Ethereum ETF Issuers
“Basically, it's just getting started,” the official said, noting that the SEC's Investment Management Division seemed a bit surprised by the shift in focus on Ethereum ETFs.


Despite the initial nature of these discussions, the source expressed cautious optimism about progress towards the Ethereum ETF, emphasizing that they do not expect the process to be halted.
For Ethereum ETFs to be approved, the SEC must first approve 19b-4 forms, which outline proposed changes to exchange rules required for trading ETFs.





This was done in a unified scheme for Bitcoin ETFs. Following this, S-1 registration statements providing detailed information about the ETF must go into effect before trading can begin.

Issuers typically go through a cycle of submitting, amending, and re-filing these forms before the final versions are approved by the SEC.


Today is the last day for the SEC to make a decision regarding Ethereum ETFs. An approval is expected today. As developments occur, we will share them with you at the last minute.

Enormous 5.7 Trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 24 Hours: What's Happening?

According to Shiba Inu's on-chain data, large transactions recorded have increased to 341 in the last 24 hours from 82 transactions at the week's low, implying a large increase in investors. The total volume of these large transactions amounts to 5.7 trillion SHIB, having reached the seven-day high of 8.97 trillion SHIB on May 16, 2024.There are a few reasons that this increased activity in big transactions may be taking place. Expectations over some major price action might have caused whales to reposition. Other than that, it could be strategic portfolio adjustments, new partnerships or ecosystem developments within the Shiba Inu project that have not been announced yet.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewAccording to the SHIB price chart, Shiba Inu is trading within an uptrend channel pattern, with the current price level at about $0.00002550. The 50-day exponential moving average is supporting the price, and the 200-day exponential moving average is closing in below the current price, indicating a generally medium- to long-term bullish trend.The Bollinger Bands are slightly expanding, indicating that volatility is starting to pick up and could very soon bring more substantial price moves. The Relative Strength Index stands at 54.79, showing that SHIB has not been oversold or overbought, hence, there could be a potential upward move.One way or another, the most likely reason behind the surge is lying beneath the upcoming surge of large transfers. Whales have the means to access pieces of information and resources that normal traders do not have, thus positioning themselves in anticipation of changes on the market. By doing so, the rise in activity on SHIB can be taken as an indication of their confidence about potential future gains from putting money into Shiba Inu.

Former nChain CEO jailed for 10 months over Craig Wright leaks


Reports that the former CEO of nChain, Christen Ager-Hanssen, was sentenced to 10 months for the leaking of documents exposing Craig Wright have been confirmed. 
According to What The Finance (WTF), a judgment hearing took place on May 3 in the High Court as part of nChain Holding AG’s case against Ager-Hanssen.  
During the hearing, the judge established that Ager-Hanssen had broken multiple court orders requiring him to remove leaked documents from the public domain, reveal who received his documents, and give up various devices.   
The leaked document was reportedly the Fairway Brief, a collection of confidential information relating to Craig Wright’s false claims to be Satoshi. The document also alleged Calvin Ayre, Marco Bianchi, and the Fairway Family Office AG conducted a ‘criminal conspiracy’ that would allow Ayre to take over nChain’s IP for a cheaper rate.   
nChain reportedly acquired court orders to remove the information from the public domain before filing for contempt of court. The judge concluded that Ager-Hanssen deliberately breached these orders and he was found in contempt of court. The court reportedly viewed his non-compliance as an attempt to undermine court authority and nChain’s requests to keep its information confidential​​.

As a result, he was handed immediate custodial sentences of 10 months and four months, to be served concurrently, for breaching the various orders. He is reportedly due to be released in five months. His hearing was initially reported by WTF who confirmed the news today.  
Ager-Hanssen is reportedly going to appeal his conviction. Whistleblowers UK, which will reportedly support Ager-Hanssen in an appeal, told WTF, “This case like many others, demonstrates that UK whistleblowing laws are out of step with justice and do not do what they are supposed to do, which is to protect whistleblowers against criminals.”

Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON) to Skyrocket 13,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gay Elon Musk (GAYELON), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GAYELON has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Gay Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin.



Gay Elon Musk launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Gay Elon Musk on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Elon Musk by entering its contract address – AErKQkbiSgsRMT1GmS7XW5tWkpSmdT1zdVJCMv1unvBH – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYELON.

Mysterious 240 Million XRP Transfer: Where Did It Go?

In a striking development within the cryptocurrency market, an unusual transfer of 240 million XRP tokens was executed from the Coincheck exchange to an unknown wallet. This significant movement has sparked interest and speculation in the crypto community.Crypto data tracker Whale Alert reports, "240,850,537 XRP worth $127,054,365 was transferred from Coincheck to unknown wallet." This recent withdrawal of the massive amount of XRP tokens, valued at approximately $127 million, was directed to an unknown address, which was activated in February. The destination wallet "UQ2Eh" continuously receives XRP transfers from Coincheck, indicating a solid relationship with the exchange. The reasons behind this transfer and the identity of the wallet owner remain unknown, adding to the mystery surrounding the transaction.While the exact motives remain speculative, several potential reasons for the transfer have emerged: the transfer may have been made on behalf of an institutional investor. Institutions frequently transfer substantial amounts of cryptocurrency to cold storage wallets for security reasons or to represent a long-term holding strategy.Additionally, Coincheck may be transferring assets as part of enhanced security measures. After a major security incident in 2018, Coincheck has prioritized security, and moving funds to more secure storage solutions may be part of sustained efforts to safeguard assets.Third, the large transfer might be linked to an OTC trade, where substantial amounts of cryptocurrency are exchanged directly between parties. Whether this move signals institutional interest, enhanced security measures, or upcoming strategic announcements, might suggest interest in XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, XRP was down 0.60% in the last 24 hours to $0.529.

Ethereum ETF Approval Is Likely Say Sources Close to SEC: Report - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIt's Ethereum ETF deadline day for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now sources close to the SEC are saying the regulator has shown signs of warming to the idea of allowing spot Ethereum ETFs to trade.Unnamed sources told Fox Business that the commission has been taking cues from recent court rulings and its past decision to allow ETH futures ETFs to trade as it considers whether to grant permission for nine funds to begin trading.Most pressing for the SEC is making a decision on the filings from Cboe exchange to list the VanEck Ethereum ETF and the Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF.But that's not all. Counting VanEck and Ark Invest with 21Shares, there are nine total applicants. The rest include BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale—which wants to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) the way it did its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)—Hashdex, Franklin Templeton, Invesco with Galaxy Digital, and Bitwise.At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is north of $3,800—that's 2% higher than it was this time yesterday.Trading volume swelled to $45 billion in the past 24 hours as hype for a potential Ethereum ETF has surged. For reference, that's just $4 billion shy of the amount of Bitcoin that changed hands in the past day, according to Coinglass.What's more, Ethereum open interest has grown by another 4% to $16 billion. That's also come with some bad news for Ethereum derivatives traders. In the past day $43 million worth of Ethereum futures positions have been liquidated, which is nearly double the value of Bitcoin futures positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass.Meanwhile, Gensler faced tough questions in a letter from the House Financial Services Committee yesterday.Republican lawmakers, including HFSC Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-SC), were curious about the regulator having recently given digital asset firm Prometheum the green light to begin offering an Ethereum custody service.The fact that Prometheum is an SEC-regulated firm and got permission from the commission to offer the service seems to imply that the commission is treating ETH like a security—even though it has countless times refused to share its position on the matter.As a footnote: An unredacted version of the Consensys lawsuit against the SEC over its treatment of Ethereum says that an internal memo circulated last year instructed commission staff to treat ETH like a security.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe predicts 'big bull cycle' for these assets


    Amid significant developments in different markets and across industries, hard assets like gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies seem to be teetering at the edge of a massive bull cycle, at least according to one crypto trading expert, who has referred to them as must-haves in portfolios.



As it happens, renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has observed the “extremely low (…) valuations of Crypto & Gold, Silver compared to the Dollar & Equities,” adding that “we’re on the edge of a big bull cycle in hard assets overall, commodities included,” in his X post on May 22.



In other words, he suggested that investors should accumulate in their portfolios exactly these “hard assets” – crypto, gold, and silver – today, while they are still cheap in comparison to the United States dollar and stocks, as the “big bull cycle” could start at any moment, judging by the chart patterns.

Indeed, gold is currently trading at the price of $2,364.39 per ounce or $76,016.82 per kilogram, recording a decline of 0.75% on the day, dropping 0.83% across the week but still recording an increase of 2.85% on its monthly chart, according to the latest data retrieved on May 23.

Cryptocurrencies price analysis



Meanwhile, in terms of digital assets, van de Poppe has earlier observed that the crypto market representative, Bitcoin (BTC), was “slowly consolidating,” adding that he was “expecting a retest at the $68K mark, before a continuation upwards,” and reiterating that the “trend is clearly upwards.”

It is also worth noting that van de Poppe has earlier highlighted that altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) were still heavily undervalued, with most of them being “down 70% against Bitcoin,” sharing his expectations that altcoins would “do way better (…) in the coming months,” as per his X post on May 21.

Institutional Bitcoin FOMO? ETFs Hit 850K BTC, BlackRock Closes In


							

US Bitcoin ETFs amass over 850,000 Bitcoins, signaling growing institutional interest



BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF nears the top spot, challenging Grayscale’s dominance



Bitcoin market cools down, hinting at potential for a major price movement




According to the latest updates from venture capital firm HODL15Capital, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have achieved a historic milestone, accumulating over 850,000 Bitcoins since January 2024. The report also notes that the global ETF market has surpassed 1 billion Bitcoins.







The US Bitcoin market has seen eight consecutive days of positive net inflows, with a net inflow of $154 million on May 22, 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack with an inflow of $92 million that day, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with an inflow of $74.6 million. However, Grayscale Investment’s GBTC experienced a notable outflow of $16.1 million after five consecutive days of positive flows.



Notably, BlackRock’s substantial inflow of $92 million on the eighth day of continuous positive flows could potentially propel IBIT to become the largest Bitcoin ETF, surpassing GBTC. Currently, BlackRock’s IBIT holds 281,883.91970 Bitcoins, closely trailing GBTC, which holds 289,500.0395 Bitcoins.



A recent analysis by Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin market has entered a cooling period “after several months of intense distribution pressure.” The report suggests a significant market shift characterized by decreased selling activity and a decline in volatility.



In an X post, Glassnode stated, “Whilst capital inflows remain modest, the lightening of sell-side, and compression of volatility suggest a bigger move could be on the horizon.”







Over the past few days, Bitcoin has been hovering around the $70,000 mark, with investors eagerly watching for the cryptocurrency to reach its all-time high of $73,700. As of press time, BTC was trading at $69,469, marking a slight decline of 0.43% in one day. However, the cryptocurrency has seen notable surges of 5% and 4% in one week and one month, respectively.

$800 billion Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin to hit $150k this year


    With Bitcoin (BTC) surging past $69,000, questions about new all-time highs and its potential price in 2024 are becoming increasingly prominent. Many experts have weighed in, but the most influential opinions come from financial institutions and their analysts.



Recently, Standard Chartered made one of the most bullish predictions. Analysts from this leading international cross-border bank predicted that Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs above $73,700. 



This projection, which is slightly higher than the cryptocurrency’s previous peak, comes with an ambitious and unexpected timeline.







Bitcoin’s new all-time high already in a couple of days



Geoff Kendrick, Head of EM FX Research, West, and Crypto Research at Standard Chartered, has made a bullish prediction for Bitcoin, the maiden cryptocurrency. 



Kendrick stated that BTC is poised to surpass its previous all-time high reached on March 14, 2024, potentially reaching approximately $73,798. He expects this significant surge to occur by the weekend, attributing the potential increase to recent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs.



On May 21, data from Farside Investors indicated that Spot Bitcoin ETFs had their best inflow week in the last two months, with US funds collectively seeing $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17. 



Since their launch on January 11, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded inflows exceeding $13 billion. This increased demand and influx of capital contributed to Bitcoin’s previous rise to a new all-time high in March and could drive further surges in the cryptocurrency’s value.



Bitcoin over $150,000 by the end of 2024 thanks to Ethereum



Kendrick has also revealed that the potential approval of Ethereum (ETH) Spot ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price dynamics. 



He has reiterated his earlier prediction that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000 by the end of 2024 and reach an impressive $200,000 in 2025.

Hours Before the Potential Approval of the Ethereum ETF, Discussion Started to Which Project the Next ETFs Will Be? Here are the Details! - Bitcoin Sistemi


BKCM CEO Brian Kelly made headlines when he suggested on CNBC that Solana (SOL) could be the next cryptocurrency with an exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Speculation Grows on Potential Solana ETF Amid Market Uncertainty
The announcement reignited debate in the financial community, particularly after similar speculation emerged in Hong Kong earlier this year that an issuer might be preparing a SOL ETF.


But Kelly acknowledged some hurdles that could hinder the launch of a Solana ETF. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Solana does not currently have a futures ETF, a factor that simplifies the process for regulators and issuers.
In addition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified Solana as a security, further complicating its path to becoming an ETF.






Despite these challenges, the potential for a Solana ETF continues to generate buzz. Known for its high transaction speeds and low costs, Solana has gained significant traction within the crypto community.
An ETF will likely appeal to a broader audience of investors by increasing its legitimacy and accessibility.


The crypto market is keenly watching developments on this front, as the successful launch of a Solana ETF could signal a new phase of growth and adoption for alternative cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.
However, given the regulatory environment and expressed reservations from major issuers, the realization of a Solana ETF remains uncertain.

FTX-Funded Charity Effective Ventures Acted ‘Diligently’: UK Govt.


                        
                            FTX-Funded Charity Effective Ventures Acted ‘Diligently’ Protecting Funds: UK Govt. Probe Conclude

                        The UK government’s Charity Commission probe has concluded that Effective Ventures Foundation, an FTX-funded charity, acted “diligently and quickly” to protect charity funds in the wake of FTX’s massive collapse.“The inquiry found that the trustees took appropriate steps to protect the charity’s funds and complied with their legal duties acting diligently and quickly following the collapse of FTX,” a press statement read.Per the investigation, the charity fund received £3.3 million ($300,000) in donations, which the trustees “ringfenced,” requesting and obtaining a Defence against Money Laundering from the National Crime Agency.Further, the charity also decided to reach a settlement agreement for the repayment of funds received from FTX in 2022. “The charity made this decision following independent legal advice they had received,” the report added.During the investigation, two trustees with connections to FTX resigned from their positions at the charity.However, following the collapse of the FTX exchange, trustees not connected to FTX, “acted quickly to assess the risk to the charity and installed measures to protect charitable assets and continued operations.”Effective Ventures Agreed to Repay Millions
The Charity Commission in England and Wales announced in Jan 2023 that it initiated investigations on Effective Ventures (EV), owing to the fact that FTX is a “major sponsor.”Effective Ventures reportedly disclosed its links to FTX as a “severe event,” which may possibly harm other assets. This eventually triggered the regulator to probe the trustees of the charity.Per reports, the UK charity under investigation told Civil Society early this year that it paid $4.3m (around £3.4m) to the FTX estate.“This amount is equal to the entire amount which EV UK received from FTX and the FTX Foundation during 2022,” a spokesperson for the charity noted.The FTX Foundation, which shut down in November 2022 after FTX exchange collapsed, was one of EV UK’s largest founders.However, in a recent statement, Zachary Robinson, interim CEO of EV US, said that both EV UK and EV US had collectively paid $26.8m to FTX estate. This is 100% of the funds that EV received from FTX, he added.“This means that EV’s projects can continue to fundraise with confidence that donations won’t be used to cover the cost of this settlement. We strongly condemn fraud and the actions underlying Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction.”

Best AI Crypto Coins in 2024: Top 8 Projects to Watch


																Cryptocurrencies that have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) or plan to do so have been soaring in popularity.
The fast-paced expansion and development of AI have generated considerable interest, controversy, and fear among the public, especially tech enthusiasts, investors, and even government officials and politicians. Projects like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as its numerous alternatives, have been making headlines left and right, and this has inevitably impacted the crypto industry.
This can be reminiscent of Bitcoin and the early creation of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market.
But as with the broader cryptocurrency market, AI-focused projects have also increased in their numbers and identifying the legitimate and promising ones can be a bit challenging.
That’s why, in this guide, we take a closer look at the top AI-based crypto protocols that you should have on your watch list.

Quick Navigation

What is AI Crypto?
Before proceeding, let’s briefly explain AI crypto and why this sector has blossomed in the last few years.
At the forefront of crypto, AI crypto projects appreciated substantially, especially in the first quarter of 2024. The reason is not just hype; the combination of AI and blockchain technology has opened several windows of new use cases and applications for finance, data storage, cloud computing, and much more.
In decentralized finance (DeFi), for example, we can see different types of dApps using AI. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) can use AI to facilitate trade automation through algorithms (as many automated market makers do).
AI can also improve the screening process for smart contracts, allowing founders to spot potential threats and vulnerabilities. In another example, AI is frequently used to produce generative art NFT projects, such as Interactive Non-Fungible Tokens (iNFTs), which incorporate intelligent traits and reasoning abilities.
There are currently hundreds of AI-based crypto projects, each targeting a specific market within and outside the space.
Best AI Crypto Projects to Watch This Year
Fetch.ai (FET)
Fetch.ai is one of the top crypto AI projects boasting billions in total market capitalization.

It allows users to leverage resources and tools to build and monetize their AI-powered crypto apps and services. However, one feature that distinguishes Fetch is autonomous economic agents.
These agents, which can be devices, services, organizations, or individuals, are capable of performing various tasks such as processing and sharing data among IoT (Internet of Things) devices, executing crypto transactions for users, and facilitating trades and swaps on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap through crypto trading bots.
The protocol operates on its own blockchain, powered by its utility token, FET. A unique aspect of its blockchain is its mixed consensus: Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), in which miners validate transaction blocks and agents earn fees for executing multiple AI-related tasks.
For developers, Fetch offers a comprehensive suite of tools, including AI, Web3, and blockchain infrastructure, resources, and extensive documentation to create decentralized AI projects.
Likewise, Fetch also features the Open Economic Framework (OEF), an AI-driven layer that stores information for agents. This layer allows agents to interact and source information while nodes (miners) are rewarded with FET for facilitating these interactions.
Render Network (RNDR)
Render Network is an Ethereum-based blockchain platform that aims to decentralize GPU cloud rendering by connecting those who need rendering services with owners of high-performance GPUs.
It is one of the top Solana projects.

This system enables artists, individuals, and companies to carry out rendering tasks more affordably and quickly than traditional centralized options.
The platform operates as follows: creators submit rendering jobs, and node operators use their spare GPU capacity to complete these jobs and earn RNDR tokens as compensation. Render Network supports a range of tasks, from basic rendering for gaming and entertainment to complex projects involving AI and machine learning.
The protocol also implements a tiered pricing system based on the reputation of node operators. The highest-rated operators fall into tier 1 and are typically the most expensive but offer more reliable and scalable services, often used by Render’s partners.
Tier 2 provides high-quality services at a reduced cost, and Tier 3 offers the most economical options, but reliability and scalability are not the highest-rated. This pricing structure supports the democratization of GPU cloud computing, particularly for Web3 creators, by adapting to various budget needs.
The Graph (GRT)
The Graph is a decentralized, open-source indexing protocol that collects, processes, and stores information and data similarly to a web browser like Google.

It allows users to navigate and explore different blockchain ecosystems and their respective dApps. The Graph is also available in at least 14 languages.
One of the key features of The Graph is Subgraphs, which are indices designed to enhance data querying for users across several networks, including EVM-compatible blockchains and even the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
Subgraphs can index all public information globally, bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. This data can be stored, organized, and shared across applications, making it accessible for anyone to query. Naturally, users pay using the protocol’s native coin, GRT.
GRT has one of the largest supplies in the AI sector, with a max supply of 10,799,004,319 tokens and approximately 9.5 billion tokens in circulation.
BitTensor (TAO)
BitTensor is an open-source infrastructure built around a blockchain called Subtensor. It utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI).

This mechanism resembles Proof-of-Work (PoW) by rewarding miners for their valuable contributions across various technology and research domains within the BitTensor network.
BitTensor functions as a decentralized marketplace with multiple subnets, each designed for specific tasks. Unlike parallel chains in systems like Avalanche, these subnets are competitive marketplaces tailored for AI, machine learning, data storage, price feeds, cellular automation, and more.
A notable example of a subnet in BitTensor is Decentralized AI Detection, where miners are incentivized to share findings, solutions, products, tools, and frameworks to help the network detect content generated by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
Anyone can create a subnet by paying a registration fee in TAO, BitTensor’s native token, and establish incentive mechanisms for miners and validators. Each subnet has validators who assess the quality of miners’ work and reward them with TAO.
BitTensor aims to democratize and commoditize AI and emerging technologies through blockchain technology.
Akash Network (AKT)
Akash Network is one of the top AI crypto coins that introduces a cloud-computing marketplace where users can buy and sell cloud resources using AKT as the payment method.

Akash Network rose to prominence as one of the largest AI crypto coins thanks to its simple business model: users needing cloud computing can purchase resources from those with extra capacity, all in a peer-to-peer manner.
The platform’s main competitive edge is its ability to provide decentralized storage and asset ownership at a lower cost than traditional centralized systems, appealing to both businesses and individuals.
Akash has formed partnerships with leading institutions in the crypto space, such as Coinbase Prime, which offers custodial services for AKT, and Solve.Care, a blockchain-based healthcare platform aimed at decentralizing patient data and integrating blockchain benefits into healthcare systems.
Akash utilizes the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage due to its enhanced security and resistance to censorship.
The rise in popularity of DeCloud (decentralized cloud), AI, and ML protocols has driven increased usage and renewed investor interest in Akash and similar AI coins.
AIOZ Network (AIOZ)
AIOZ Network, created by the tech company AIOZ, is a blockchain-based platform that aims to deliver scalable and reliable solutions in Web3 storage, AI computing, live streaming, and video on demand.
The company, founded by Erman Tjiputra, focuses on making AI development more democratic and decentralized through its two main offerings: the W3AI marketplace for AI computation and the Web3 AI Platform, which provides a variety of AI solutions for businesses, developers, and individuals.

AIOZ operates on the Cosmos network and is compatible with BEP and EVM, using a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism powered by Tendermint Core that allows for up to 1,500 transactions per second. Its Decentralized Content Delivery Network (dCDN) utilizes a global network of nodes to provide additional computing power.
The network offers a decentralized marketplace for the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market, enabling contributors to monetize their AI-related assets and computing resources.
This setup offers competitive costs for cloud computing and allows for the deployment of AI applications, benefiting businesses and developers by providing cheaper alternatives to traditional infrastructures.
SingularityNET (AGIX)
SingularityNET is a marketplace for AI products and services. It allows users to create their AI-powered models through the protocol’s blockchain, which offers smart contract templates for faster and easier development and deployment.
The platform allows developers to build AI models and systems or purchase existing ones to integrate into their projects, creating a decentralized AI ecosystem that benefits both projects and developers. These and other transactions on the platform are carried out using the protocol’s native token, AGIX.

SingularityNET is one of the AI crypto projects due to its extensive offerings, featuring over 70 AI-powered services. These include:

Domain-Specific Language (DSL): a self-organizing network of AI agents that can delegate tasks to each other.
OpenCog Hyperon: an open-source general AI system based on OpenCog, a framework for developing AI models, robotics, and virtual embodied cognition.
Training AI models: users can train and customize AI models for various services based on specific needs.
Other services include speech command recognition, neural image generation, multilingual speech translators, real-time voice cloning, and more.

Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)
Through AI-powered smart contracts, Ocean Protocol allows data suppliers to sell specific data directly to consumers. This data can be from multiple industries, including healthcare, politics, finance, e-commerce, and more.
Ocean Protocol is one of the OGs in AI-crypto. It was founded in 2017 by Bruce Pon, an entrepreneur who established BigchainDB, a blockchain database software company, and AI researcher Trent McConaghy, who holds a PhD in Creative AI.

Ocean Protocol offers other appealing features. One is the Ocean Predictoor, which allows users to run AI-powered prediction or trading bots on crypto price feeds to generate yields.
It supports Javascript and Python and provides builders with a library of resources and tools to build AI decentralized applications and APIs to monetize them. Developers can leverage many features, such as IP ownership, access licenses, payment routing, analytics for on-chain data, and more.
How to Buy AI Crypto?
There are two main ways to buy AI crypto tokens. The first is through centralized exchanges like Binance.
As a partner of Binance, CryptoPotato readers can receive exclusively a $600 voucher. Use this link to head to Binance. Open a new account, verify it, and then complete the following tasks for up to $600 free.

That said, once you have an account registered, you will need to navigate to the top of your main menu and in the right corner, click on the “depoist” button and select “buy crypto.”

From there, you will simply need to input your preferred currency and the cryptocurrency you want to buy. You can use a regular credit or debit card for this.
Alternative, you can also use a decentralized exchange (DEX), but that’s a more complicated process and would require more technical knowledge.
Is AI Good for Crypto?
AI and blockchain technology can synergize if both are used for their best purposes. As we’ve seen with the projects listed above, AI can be used for trading automation in a blockchain-based protocol, enhancing trading functions and price automation.
For crypto institutions, AI algorithms, through machine learning, are helping exchanges provide and fulfill trading orders quicker, develop chatbots that assist users, smart trading bots that can analyze market trends and predict price movements, and more.
Regarding security and on-chain analysis, blockchain firms can use AI to spot potential threats and vulnerabilities in a smart contract. Moreover, wallets and exchanges can use AI to detect suspicious activity or flag addresses that have been poisoned or belong to a malicious actor.
Even in mining, we see AI and crypto merging, as AI marketplaces can provide or optimize computing power allocation for users.
There are certain drawbacks, however, and we can summarise them as follows:

Centralization: There’s a growing concern in the public that leading AI companies are working on their AI models behind closed doors, leaving investors and users out of the picture and raising concerns over the lack of transparency and power centralization. Projects like BitTensor try to democratize AI developments and innovation by rewarding users for sharing their discoveries and models.


Black Box Problem: AI algorithms can be opaque, making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes. The black box problem refers to the challenge of transparency and interpretability of AI algorithms during their time of existence and may complicate/strain operations in crypto projects.


New risk and security challenges: introducing AI in crypto could mean new risks and vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit.

Best AI Crypto Projects – Conclusion
There are multiple ways in which AI and crypto can work, from fraud detection, smart contract security, and on-chain analysis to cloud-based resources, mining, and trading optimization.
The marriage between AI and crypto has opened new windows of use cases and applications for multiple industries. However, their drawbacks must be addressed and analyzed thoroughly to mitigate their negative impact on users and investors.

                        SOL has fallen by 4% in the past 24 hours, with the Solana price dropping to $173.63 on a day when the cryptocurrency market has barely moved.Despite this loss, Solana remains up by a healthy 7% in a week, with the popular altcoin also sitting on a 22% gain in a fortnight, and a hefty 775% increase in a year.With the coin’s medium- and long-term momentum remaining strong, today’s dip represents a good opportunity to buy it at a discount, before it rises again.Solana Price Prediction 23 May: SOL is Up 7% in a Week – Time to Buy?
SOL may have taken a hit today, yet its chart is in a sweet sport insofar as it points to an incoming rebound.For instance, Solana’s relative strength index (purple) has fallen to almost 30, indicating an oversold position that should make the coin attractive to new buyers very soon.Source: TradingViewMeanwhile, SOL’s 30-day average (orange) is falling towards the 200-day (blue), and when it gets low enough a recovery should follow.It’s likely that any further dips in the near term will not be severe, given that Solana’s trading volume still remains relatively high, at around $3.3 billion today.What will be interesting is whether SOL’s support level (green) can prevent a concerted fall below $173.If it can, we may see a strong return to growth over the weekend, compensating for the past couple of days of stagnation.One thing that may boost the Solana price and the wider market is the incoming decision from the SEC regarding several spot-based ETH ETF applications.There are promising signs that the SEC will indeed approve these applications, with VanEck’s ETH ETF listed yesterday on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker symbol ETHV.While this is obviously bullish for ETH, it will also be highly positive for Solana, and not simply in terms of raising a general appetite for big alts.In particular, it would pave the way for a spot-based Solana ETF, which would do for the Solana price what January’s BTC ETFs have done for Bitcoin.For this reason, we can expect the Solana price to reach $200 in the next few weeks, and $250 by the end of the summer, based on bullishness stemming from Ethereum ETF approvals.Diversification into New Altcoins for Big Returns
Solana certainly has good prospects, yet it isn’t the only promising alt in the market today, with a range of new meme coins looking very strong.While meme coins can be risky, one way of identifying more reliable candidates is to look for successful presales, which indicate market belief.And one new coin with a growing sale is WienerAI (WAI), a new Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has raised over $2.7 million in its token offering.What’s special about WienerAI is that it’s more than another viral meme coin, with its platform also offering an AI-based trading bot.Answering queries from traders, WienerAI can identify high-potential coins before they begin rising, helping investors to make better informed choices.It will also provide an atomic swap feature, so that traders can buy new tokens quickly through the WienerAI app.Also helpful is its front-running protection, which will help investors trade ahead of MEV- and front running-bots.As a whole, such features mean that WAI will have plenty of utility as a token, something which will boost the market’s demand for it.It will have a max supply 69 billion tokens, while holders will be able to stake it for a passive income.VIDEOThis is why its sale is already doing so well, with latecomers able to join by going to the official WienerAI website and connecting their wallets.The coin is currently selling at $0.00071, a price which may end up seeming very cheap once the coin lists.Buy WAI Today

BTC, ETH Consolidate Ahead of Ether ETF Decision

Shares in Nvidia reached a record high during Wednesday's post-market hours after the company beat analyst estimates to report record revenue of $26.04 billion for the first quarter. The rally might be a positive signal for cryptocurrencies, including tokens supposedly associated with AI technology. This is because, historically, the inflow of money into the crypto market and the so-called AI coins has been partly contingent on outsized gains in NVDA and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index. Top AI coins such as FET, ICP, RNDR and GRT traded mixed, having rallied in the lead-up to the NVDA announcement, according to data by CoinGecko.

Solana Steps Up To The Plate: CEO Predicts It Could Be Next Crypto ETF


								The long-awaited approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Ethereum in the US seems imminent, and industry insiders are already looking ahead. Solana, a high-speed blockchain network, is emerging as a potential frontrunner for the next cryptocurrency ETF.

Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, believes Solana is a strong contender for an ETF due to its growing popularity and potential to be part of a “big three” alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in the current crypto market cycle.
This sentiment aligns with the recent surge in anticipation surrounding Ethereum ETFs. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent shift in stance, evident in the last-minute approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs in January, has fueled optimism for Ethereum and potentially other cryptocurrencies.


Investor Interest: A Mixed Bag
However, not everyone in the industry agreed with Kelly’s forecast.
According to Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, a spot Solana ETF won’t be available until Congress establishes a legal framework governing cryptocurrencies or until a Solana futures product traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is listed.


As of right now, the United States has only authorized futures for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).
For his part, analyst Robert Mitchnick of Blackrock, a leading investment management firm, throws a bucket of cold water on the altcoin ETF party.
Mitchnick’s conversations with clients, based on a report, reveal “little interest” in altcoins like Ethereum, let alone lesser-known players. This suggests that even if the SEC greenlights an ETF, widespread investor adoption might be slow.

Interestingly, Europe appears to be ahead of the curve when it comes to Solana. Several exchange-traded products (ETPs) already exist there, highlighting a potential gap in the US market that a Solana ETF could fill.
Legal Status: A Potential Roadblock
While industry figures like Kelly are optimistic, a significant hurdle stands in the way of a Solana ETF: its legal classification. The SEC’s lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance in 2023 named Solana as a security, not a commodity.

This distinction is crucial because ETFs traditionally deal with commodities, not securities. The Solana Foundation vehemently disputes the SEC’s claim, emphasizing the decentralized nature of its blockchain network. However, the legal ambiguity could lead to a lengthy approval process or even rejection by the SEC.
Solana: The Road Ahead
The success of an Ethereum ETF, if approved, will likely be a bellwether for future cryptocurrency ETFs, including SOL. Additionally, the SEC’s stance on Solana’s legal status needs clarification before any concrete progress can be made.

Ethereum beats Bitcoin in this area: Will ETH's growth continue? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin in terms of year to date growth.
Overall interest in Ethereum NFTs and its ecosystems fell significantly.

Ethereum [ETH] has had a tumultuous time in 2024, with prices seeing massive fluctuations during this period. Despite the volatile trajectory of ETH’s price movement, it has still managed to outperform BTC.
Ethereum comes out on top
According to Artemis’ data, Ethereum not only outperformed Bitcoin in 2024, but also managed to outpace tokens in other sectors such as AI, Data Services and RWA (Real World Assets).
Source: X
Interestingly, the surge in Ethereum’s price over the last year was driven by retail investors.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that addresses holding anywhere between 0.1 to 10 ETH had accumulated large amounts of ETH over the last few months.
In contrast to that, whale investors were observed to be selling their holdings and were not showing any interest in accumulation.
This could be positive for Ethereum in the long run, as a presence of a large number of retail investors could make the Ethereum network much more decentralized.
However, large sell-offs from whales may impact the price movement of ETH negatively in the short term.
Source: Santiment
At press time, ETH was trading at $3,765.89 and its price had surged by 0.21% in the last 24 hours. Despite the surge in price, the Network Growth had plummeted over the last few days.
A decline in Network Growth indicates that the frequency with which new addresses were trading ETH had fallen significantly.
If new addresses continue to lose interest in ETH, it could impact ETH’s price negatively in the long run.
Moreover, the velocity at which ETH was trading at had also fallen, implying a decline in ETH’s overall trades.
Source: Santiment
Activity on the network
Another factor is the overall health of the Ethereum ecosystem.

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25

Per AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, Daily Active Addresses on the Ethereum network had declined from 630,000 to 430,000 over the past few weeks.
This indicated that users were moving to other networks and platforms.

                        The approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States could potentially trigger a substantial rally of up to 60% in the price of ETH.In a recent note, Singapore-based QCP Capital, said it has achieved this forecast by drawing parallels to the market reaction following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.QCP Capital pointed out that when spot bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, Bitcoin experienced a significant surge from $42,000 to over $73,000 within a two-week period after the ETFs began trading.“With Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,” QCP Capital stated.Ether ETF Approval Might Be Around the Corner
The firm also mentioned that VanEck’s ETF had been listed by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), further indicating that approval for spot ether ETFs was highly likely, with trading expected to commence as early as next week.The measure of implied volatility reflects the market’s anticipation of future price fluctuations for a financial instrument.QCP Capital’s statement suggests that the current level of implied volatility in the market indicates strong expectations for significant price movement in response to the potential approval of spot ether ETFs.CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics firm, reported increased buying activity on both centralized and blockchain-based crypto exchanges in a Wednesday report.On Tuesday, holders purchased over 100,000 ETH in spot markets, marking the highest daily level since September 2023.The surge in buying coincided with reports of a favorable decision regarding spot Ether ETFs, leading some analysts to increase the odds of approval to over 75%, up from the earlier estimate of 25%.Furthermore, open interest in ether-tracked futures reached a record high of $14 billion, accounting for 67% of bitcoin open interest as of Wednesday.CryptoQuant noted that traders appeared to be increasing their exposure to ETH relative to Bitcoin, and the buying activity from ETH permanent holders on that day was the largest seen in 2024 so far.ETH Price Might See Major Correction if ETFs Denied
However, QCP Capital’s analysts cautioned that a “significant price correction” could occur if the ETF application were to be dismissed.The reminder highlights the potential market volatility and uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the approval decision.Six issuers, including BlackRock, recently filed updated copies of their ether ETF proposals prior to the decision, removing plans to stake the token.The change suggests that staking activities may have posed regulatory obstacles.As of Thursday, data from popular staking service Lido indicated that annualized yields on ether staking were nearly 3%, further highlighting the potential value and income-generating opportunities associated with participating in staking activities.As reported, Fidelity made an amended S-1 application to SEC for its spot Ether ETF yesterday. The updated application specifies that the underlying Ether tokens of the ETF will not be staked.

Bankman-Fried Moves to New Facility While Fighting FTX Conviction


							

Sam Bankman-Fried, transferred to a California prison while appealing his 25-year conviction for fraud and money laundering.



The transfer process for Bankman-Fried is expected to be slow, taking over a month.



Bankman-Fried’s legal team appeals his 25-year sentence and $11 billion forfeiture.




Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is set to be transferred to a new prison as he prepares an appeal to overturn his conviction.



Wall Street Journal reports Bankman-Fried is likely to be moved to a medium-security facility in California. However, the exact location of the prison remains undisclosed.



The transfer process is expected to be slow, potentially taking over a month. This delay is partly due to a recommendation by the judge who presided over Bankman-Fried’s trial, suggesting that he should stay incarcerated in New York to facilitate access to his appellate counsel. Despite this recommendation, the decision has been made to relocate him.



Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $11 billion after being convicted on seven counts, including fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering. The charges stem from the collapse of FTX in November 2022, which followed a revelatory report by CoinDesk.









The report indicated that Alameda Research, a sister company to FTX, was in precarious financial health, leading to a rapid and dramatic downfall of the exchange, once the world’s third-largest.



The relocation of Bankman-Fried highlights the ongoing legal battles and the complexity of his case. His legal team is vigorously working on the appeal, aiming to overturn the convictions that have significantly impacted the cryptocurrency industry.



As the process unfolds, further details about the transfer and its implications for Bankman-Fried’s appeal will likely emerge, keeping the crypto community and legal observers closely watching.

Crypto Trader Books 735,800% Profit on Large-Cap Memecoin That’s Just Hit New All-Time High: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								An early buyer of a top-30 memecoin by market capitalization has turned a few hundred dollars into millions within a period of a little over a year.
According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, the trader acquired billions of the Pepe (PEPE) memecoin days after it publicly launched.










The trader then sold 42 billion Pepe tokens on July 7th of 2023, 100 billion Pepe tokens on May 4th and the remainder on May 22nd, netting him approximately 735,831% in profits.
“An early buyer of PEPE deposited all 182.9 billion PEPE ($2.53 million) into Binance six hours ago.
This guy spent 0.22 Ethereum ($462) to buy 324.9 billion PEPE on April 15th, 2023 and sold it all for $3.4 million.
He was lucky enough to turn $462 into $3.4 million, a gain of 7,368x!”
PEPE is trading at $0.0000128 at time of writing, up by around 97% over the past 30 days.
The blockchain tracker also says that another trader who is still holding trillions of Pepe acquired between April 14th to April 23rd of 2023 is now sitting on a profit of over 95,000,000%.
“This diamond [hands] trader turned $83 into $79.4 million by buying and holding PEPE, a gain of 958,580x!
Three wallets(belonging to the same person) spent only 0.041 Ethereum ($83) to buy 6.44 trillion PEPE ($79.4 million), and have never sold any PEPE to date.”
Lookonchain further says that crypto investment firm BlockTower Capital booked a profit of over 20% after selling a stash of Pepe on the institutional trading platform Cumberland.
“BlockTower Capital transferred 202 billion PEPE ($2.8 million) to Cumberland for sale two hours ago after the PEPE price broke through $0.000014.
BlockTower Capital bought the 202 billion PEPE ($2.22 million) via Cumberland six days ago.
Making $578,000 in six days, with a return on investment of 26%.”

BJ's Wholesale Club: Q1 Net Sales Up 4% But Operating Income Falls 13.9% - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BJ) reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, showcasing a mixed performance across various metrics. The company experienced a 4.0% year-over-year increase in net sales, reaching $4.81 billion, while total revenues grew by 4.1% to $4.92 billion. Membership fee income saw a notable rise of 8.6%, amounting to $111.4 million. However, the company faced challenges in its merchandise gross margin rate, which decreased by 50 basis points due to lower ancillary income. Operating income also declined by 13.9%, falling to $160.8 million from $186.8 million in the same quarter of the previous year.



Despite these setbacks, BJ’s Wholesale Club managed to maintain a steady earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.83, with an adjusted EPS of $0.85. The company’s comparable club sales increased by 1.6% year-over-year, although this growth was more modest at 0.6% when excluding gasoline sales. Digitally enabled comparable sales growth was a standout, soaring by 21.0% year-over-year, reflecting the company’s successful push into digital conveniences and e-commerce. Additionally, BJ’s opened one new club and one new gas station during the quarter, contributing to its strategic growth initiatives.



BJ’s Wholesale Club Beats EPS and Revenue Expectations in Q1



When comparing the current quarter’s performance to expectations, BJ’s Wholesale Club met the anticipated EPS of $0.83, and the adjusted EPS figure exceeded expectations.



Revenue for the quarter was $4.81 billion, slightly below the expected $4.85 billion. This shortfall can be attributed to various factors, including increased selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A), which rose to $721.8 million from $689.3 million the previous year. The rise in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by increased labor and occupancy costs due to new club and gas station openings and other investments aimed at driving strategic priorities.



The company’s net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased to $111.0 million from $116.1 million in the same period of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA also saw a decline, dropping to $236.4 million from $251.5 million year-over-year. Despite these declines, BJ’s Wholesale Club’s adjusted EPS remained consistent at $0.85, indicating that the company managed to control costs and maintain profitability on an adjusted basis. However, the decrease in operating income and net income highlights the challenges the company faced in managing expenses amidst its expansion efforts.





BJ’s Wholesale Club Remains Optimistic for FY 2024



BJ’s Wholesale Club remains optimistic about its growth prospects for the rest of fiscal 2024. The company’s outlook remains unchanged, focusing on maintaining strength in traffic, unit volumes, and market share. “As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our strength in traffic, unit volumes and market share led by our continued focus on delivering value to our members and executing on our strategic priorities,” said Laura Felice, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of BJ’s Wholesale Club.



The company plans to open a total of 12 new clubs this year, which is expected to further enhance its market presence and drive revenue growth. BJ’s Wholesale Club’s strategic priorities include enhancing its merchandising improvements and digital conveniences to provide compelling value to its members.

What are Bitcoin Runes? New Token Standard on the Bitcoin Network

Bitcoin Runes is a token standard that provides much more efficient methods to create new fungible tokens. Created by Casey Rodarmor, it was launched on the 4th Bitcoin halving day and on the 840,000th block. 
Runes employ an efficient method of creating new cryptocurrencies from unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) which till now just went to junk. 
The protocol brings great relief to developers, miners, creators and also to the entire ecosystem which has been reeling with the after effects of Bitcoin Halving. The protocol has several advantages over its predecessor and would likely see the same shining fate as of its senior cousin, the Bitcoin Ordinals.
Introduction
Bitcoin Runes is a token standard that guides developers in the creation of new cryptocurrencies. These new cryptocurrencies are created as fungible tokens and can be easily developed with a little knowledge. 
The protocol was created by Casey Rodarmor who was also responsible for creating the Bitcoin Ordinals. The Ordinals protocol was key in introducing NFT-like features on the Bitcoin blockchain, something which was much greater than any expectation. 
This article explores every aspect of Bitcoin Runes, be it around its benefits, improvements over predecessors, technical information, jargons and also disadvantages. At the end we have also provided a few comments on its sustainability and its future.
Who Created The Runes Protocol
The Runes Protocol was first proposed by Casey Rodarmor, who also created the famous Bitcoin Ordinals in December 2022. Casey’s proposal sought to address the problems of BRC-20 protocol which left a huge amount of junk in the form of unspent transaction outputs or UTXOs. These UTXOs were created as a result of every successful transaction.
In the Bitcoin network, transaction outputs work in a similar way as “gas” in Ethereum but in a slightly different way. Consider that you were buying something worth $4.93 with a $5 bill. Now imagine what would happen if people could only transact with notes and no one accepted coins. Obviously, the 7 cent worth of coins would go to waste. 
The Bitcoin UTXOs are small quantities of Bitcoins that are used to pay for transaction fees. They are very similar to the loose 7 cents that no one accepts.
Motive for Creating Bitcoin Runes
The Bitcoin Runes were created primarily as an easy way to create memecoin-like cryptocurrencies. Upon seeing the success of memecoins in Solana (BONK, dogwifhat, and others), he was looking for a way to implement it in the Bitcoin network.
Here is a tweet from the creator himself on why he created Bitcoin Runes.

Though the BRC-20 protocol existed which creates cryptocurrencies on the Bitcoin network, yet it was a resource intensive method and left a huge signature of UTXOs much like an old car leaves a smoke trail.
Runes were a much simpler way of creating new coins. The protocol does not depend on any other protocol such as BRC-20 or Ordinals and is self-contained which means all its dependencies are already present inside it.
Terms and Definitions Associated with Bitcoin Runes
Struct
A struct or structure in the context of Bitcoin is a set of instructions that guide an activity inside the Bitcoin blockchain.
Runestone
A runestone is a message that is used to send parameters to the Bitcoin network on how the fungible token (Rune) should be created.
A runestone looks in a similar way as below.

“`rust
struct Runestone1 {
edicts: Vec<Edicts>,
etching: Option<Etching>,
mint: Option <RuneID>,
pointer: Option <u32>’
}
“`

Each Runestone is capable of transferring multiple types of fungible tokens within a single output.
Etching
Etching is the process of inscribing a transaction output with a message (runestone) that contains details of the fungible token that is to be created. The message contains details such as name, quantity, symbol, etc. 
UTXO
An UTXO is a collection of satoshis (100 Mn Satoshis = 1 Bitcoin) that are used to pay for transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. When a transaction output becomes so small that it cannot be used to pay for network fee, it goes to junk. The Runes protocol is key to manage these junk UTXOs.
Cenotaphs
Those runestones which have some kind of an error are called cenotaphs. These errors may have been introduced due to bad parameters, any network clog or any other random factor.
How Does it Work?
Overview
The Runes Protocol works in a way which is known by the OP_RETURN method. 

First, with each transaction, a set of parameters are given to the Bitcoin network. This process is known as etching.
After a successful transaction, these parameters define the output. The parameters contain information as to how the UTXOs will be converted into new fungible tokens. The process is called minting.
The next step involves transferring a rune from a transaction input to output. This process is called an edict.
At the end of the transaction, the user receives fungible tokens on their address.

Let us now break down the steps to understand the process in a much more detailed manner
Etching
Etching is the process of creating a Bitcoin Rune by sending token parameters to a transaction input.
The list of parameters that are sent along with a transaction output are:

Name: The name simply refers to the name of the fungible token to be minted. 
Divisibility factor: This is the number of units a rune can be divided into.
Symbol: This refers to the symbol of the new fungible token or tokens.
Premine: It refers to the initial allocation of the runes that are kept for its creator.
Terms: Refers to the rules that are to be followed by users during an open mint.
Cap: It refers to the number of times a rune should be minted.
Amount: This refers to the numeric quantity of the rune to be minted. A single UTXO can mint multiple fungible tokens at once.
Start height: This is the block height where the minting of the rune starts.
End height: This is the block height where the minting of the rune ends.
Edict: These are messages that contain instructions on how a transaction input can be converted into an output.

Minting
Minting refers to the process of converting the unspent transaction outputs(UTXOs) into new fungible tokens. The UTXOs are converted into runes through a function called OP RETURN. This function returns the UTXOs in the form of new fungible tokens.
Transfer
The next step involves transferring a rune from input to output. These transfers are governed by edicts which are messages that are sent to describe the specifications of a rune.
Here is a sample of an edict:

“`rust
struct Edict {
id: RuneID,
amount: u128,
output: u32,
}
“`

Each runestone can create multiple types of fungible tokens with just a single input. This is a great improvement over earlier protocols where only a single type of fungible token was created at one time.
To do that, we just need to define each output with a separate edict.
For example, let’s say we have an UTXO that we wish to convert into fungible tokens. With Runes, we can not only do that but also achieve something that was impossible prior to this. For example, a single UTXO can create  1000 tokens of A type, 20 tokens of B type and 5 tokens of C type. 
Bitcoin Runes vs BRC 20s
Bitcoin Runes provide several upgrades over BRC-20 protocol and these upgrades define the difference between the two.

UTXOs are repurposed on Runes whereas they are discarded on the BRC-20 protocol.
The fungible tokens created using Runes protocol can be transferred on Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, whereas BRC-20 tokens cannot be transferred using L2s.
Runes are based on UTXOs whereas BRC-20 tokens are based on Ordinals theory.





Bitcoin Runes vs Bitcoin Ordinals
Runes are a protocol that uses UTXOs to create new fungible tokens. On the other hand Ordinals use satoshis to create inscriptions that lead to the creation of non-fungible assets.
What Does Runes Offer to the Bitcoin Ecosystem?
Runes offer a great benefit to the entire Bitcoin network. 
Reduces Wastage of UTXOs
First, it reduces the junk that is created by UTXOs. With Runes, these UTXOs can be converted into useful tokens with a simple OP_RETURN method.
More Users and Greater Liquidity
Second, it brings more liquidity to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Due to the bullishness around memecoins, Runes would be able to bring more users and liquidity to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Just like other ecosystems, Runes have capability to drive memecoin rally into the Bitcoin ecosystem. More tokens would attract more users and hence more liquidity.
More Fees to Miners
Third, it brings more fees to the miners. More transactions would definitely generate more fees which would compensate miners in a better way. Further, after the Bitcoin Halving event, miners desperately need more fees to cover operational costs. 

Suggested Reading: What is Bitcoin Halving: A Comprehensive Guide

Runes have already generated the traffic that could fulfill the needs of the miners. However, its sustainability is in question. If it goes in the Ordinal way, it would surely compensate Bitcoin miners in a sustainable way.
Advantages over Other Protocols
There are several advantages associated with the launch of the Runes protocol. Some of them are:
Improvement Over BRC-20

The main intention of creating runes was to establish a token minting process that would not be as messy as the BRC-20 protocol which left a huge trail of UTXOs after each transaction.
The Runes protocol on the other hand, managed these UTXOs in a clean way by allowing users to repurpose them as new tokens.
Works Well on Bitcoin Layer-2 Solutions

Runes work well on Layer-2 protocols such as the Lightning Network. However, BRC_20 protocols do not work in Bitcoin L2s.
Simplified Token Minting Process

With the Runes protocol, minting a new token on the Bitcoin blockchain would be at its easiest. This has already begun in great numbers. A few Runes-based tokens are:

Satoshi Nakamoto
The Ticker Elsa
Wanko Manko Runes
Meme Economics
LOBO The Wolf Pup

Are There Any Disadvantages?
Despite all the advantages, there has been an unintended consequence of Bitcoin Ordinals. As a result of their immense popularity, just like Ordinals, Bitcoin Runes too have clogged the Bitcoin blockchain. Despite being an unintended act, this congestion has led to a spike in fees.
Bitcoin Runes Creates Spike in Bitcoin Fees
On April 20th, 2024, the day of launch of the Runes protocol, there was a clog in the Bitcoin network which spiked its fee to $128 per transaction as compared to its usual fee of $5 to $10 per transaction. Although the major reason for the spike was the race to transact on the 840,000th block (the halving block), yet Runes were a major contributor to the spike in the  transactions.
What’s Next for Runes?
If the development of Runes continues in the future, we see a thriving ecosystem. Runes have the capability to bring DeFi to the Bitcoin blockchain, something that every Bitcoiners wants in the ecosystem. Though some rudimentary DeFi capabilities exist on Bitcoin, yet the network is far from achieving the feats of Ethereum.
Conclusion
Bitcoin Runes are a new improvement over BRC-20 protocol to create new tokens. The Runes protocol utilizes a new way to create cryptocurrencies with the Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). This method not only reduces junk UTXOs but also converts them into something useful. 
The protocol is expected to bring much relief to the Bitcoin ecosystem in terms of users, miner fees and liquidity. Also, it is expected to bring much greater DeFi capabilities to the Bitcoin ecosystem, something which is much desired. Finally, we expect Runes to have a stable presence in the Bitcoin network so that it not only improves the network’s capabilities but also helps Bitcoin achieve the tag of a true market dominator.

WIF’s 18.33% Surge in 24 Hours Signals Memecoins Season Return, BBG Next! - Coin Edition


							

Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based memecoin, surged 18.33% in the last 24 hours.
WIF’s rally signals a potential return of the memecoins season.
Investors look toward BBG, as a target for massive profit in the upcoming bull run.




Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based memecoin, surged 18.33% in the last 24 hours, per TradingView’s data, delivering early signals of a return of the memecoin season. The novel memecoin launched six months ago but was one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies in Q1 2024, rallying over 2,100% in its first bullish trend.



WIF’s Q1 rally is typical of memecoins behavior that distinguishes the crypto category as a speculative opportunity for digital asset investors. Most top memecoins typically have that one season of ballistic movement before settling into the broader crypto market dynamics.



After WIF’s significant rally in Q1 2024, many crypto users are paying close attention to the next viable option. Top on the crypto users’ list is the Barbie Girl (BBG) memecoin, based on Binance’s BNBChain.



For those who may have missed the initial WIF rally, the BBG could present an opportunity for significant profit-making in crypto investment. It is a memecoin project that launched towards the end of 2023 but is only beginning to ramp up activities that could lead to massive adoption.



BBG’s social status is growing significantly following the project’s attractive marketing strategies. At the end of April, BBG announced a bonus plan for referring users on its platform. The novel memecoin project offers a 10% bonus to existing users who convince others to buy the BBG token. 



Crypto users seeking to benefit from the program would first sign up on the BBG website and buy at least $1 worth of the token to get a referral code. The users can share their referral codes unlimitedly and earn 10% of the value invested by anyone using them.



Many crypto users consider this a timely strategy, given the growing memecoins awareness and crypto users’ openness toward adopting the technology. WIF has signaled the potential return of the memecoin season, and crypto users are watching BBG as the next big thing regarding the memecoins rally.

Santiment Warns These Popular Altcoin Investors: A $52 Million Dump May Come! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While there has been a rise in Ethereum ETFs in recent days, Santiment warned investors about the popular artificial intelligence altcoin RNDR.
Render Network (RNDR), one of the leading names in the artificial intelligence industry, has been the subject of notable whale activities and an upward trend with its rise in recent weeks.


Stating that at this point, a large whale sent 4.89 million RNDR tokens worth approximately $ 52.1 million to an unknown wallet, Santiment stated that this transfer could cause potential fluctuations in the RNDR price in the near future.
At this point, Santiment recommends that those holding RNDR keep a close eye on the market as there may be increased volatility on the horizon. Because large transactions made by whales can often lead to price fluctuations.






“Whaling activity is high among the AI sector and Render is no exception.
A known whale sent 4.89 million RNDR (worth $52.1 million) to an unknown wallet earlier today as prices corrected.
“Investors holding this asset should beware of increased volatility.”

RNDR continues to trade at $10.55 at the time of writing.

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH) has recently captured attention with a notable surge in a critical metric that could shape its future trajectory. CryptoQuant, a leading market analytics platform, has highlighted a significant development in the perpetual futures market that may influence Ethereum’s price dynamics moving forward.The focal point of interest is the seven-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio on the Ethereum perpetual futures market. This metric serves as a crucial indicator of market sentiment, reflecting whether buyers or sellers dominate market orders. A ratio below 1 indicates a higher prevalence of selling pressure, whereas a ratio above 1 suggests increasing buyer activity.Recent trends and market implicationsFor the past several months, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio for Ethereum has consistently been below 1, signaling heightened selling activity. Analysts attribute this trend to speculative trading or hedging strategies among investors. Despite this prolonged period of bearish sentiment, recent data indicates a noteworthy shift. The ratio has begun to show a gradual increase, now approaching 1.This uptick in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio coincides with a significant rise in Ethereum’s market price. As of the latest report, Ethereum is trading at $3,833, marking an impressive 27.76% increase over the past week. Such price movements are closely tied to market sentiment and trading activities on the futures market.Potential market dynamics shiftAnalysts suggest that the rising Taker Buy Sell Ratio may indicate a potential shift in market dynamics. If this trend continues, it could alleviate the intense selling pressure that has characterized the Ethereum futures market in recent months. With increased demand from the spot market and a reduction in aggressive selling, Ethereum’s current uptrend may sustain itself in the near term.Overall, monitoring key metrics such as the Taker Buy Sell Ratio becomes increasingly important. The recent increase in this ratio, combined with Ethereum’s notable price surge, presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for investors and traders alike. Market participants will be closely watching these developments to gauge Ethereum’s future price movements and market sentiment.

Little Known Meme Coin CorgiAI Up 60%, Flips Pepecoin and Memecoin - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsA relatively unknown meme coin, CorgiAI, has become the eighth largest meme coin by market cap according to CoinGecko.The token flipped Pepecoin, Memecoin, and TRUMP by skyrocketing 60% over the past 24 hours and 102% over the past week. CorgiAI is within flipping distance of Book of Meme, with a market capitalization of over $800 million, according to CronoScan.This figure is similar to what is reported on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, although the latter indicates it has been self-reported by CorgiAI (CORGIAI) and not been verified. Meme coins are by nature very volatile, since CorgiAI’s creation a year ago the token has seen similarly huge swings three times already. CorgiAI's smart contract also includes a mint function, according to GoPlusLabs, meaning more tokens can be created if exercised so proceed with caution.CorgiAI is a community driven meme coin on the Cronos network which aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to build tools. The most recent example of this is the Corgi Cre8r, an NFT text-to-image AI generator.Cronos is a layer-1 blockchain which is capable of interoperating with Ethereum and Cosmos. It was created by Crypto.com in partnership with Cronos Labs. Its CRO token is currently sitting at a $3.4 million market cap, according to CoinGecko.Despite being around for a while, the chain has made relatively little noise in terms of meme coins. In an attempt to address this, the chain decided to promote its native meme coins through a campaign which gave users the opportunity to win token rewards and an exclusive NFT.The “Cronos Spring Odyssey: Memecoin Trails,” asked participants to follow the tokens Twitter account, like and retweet a post, as well as buy and hold $5 of CorgiAI. Since this campaign began, the token has skyrocketed 97%, according to CoinGecko. In turn, it is now the fifth largest token on Cronos behind USDC, Wrapped Bitcoin, Maker stablecoin DAI, and the network’s native CRO.While 10 other tokens were part of the campaign, CorgiAI saw the most significant gains. Crow with knife is in second seeing 14.3% gains over the past 24 hours, reaching a $55,000 market cap.This may be because CorgiAI has also been running allow list campaigns and giveaways on their Twitter. These campaigns, run through GALXE Quest, had similar requirements to the Cronos Spring Odyssey with Twitter interactions combined with buying and holding tokens providing an entry.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

US CBDC, FIT21 crypto bills: 'A lip service' or balanced regulation? - AMBCrypto



The US House passed the FIT21 Act to set regulatory clarity for crypto. 
Next on the line is the US CBDC bill and how the US Senate handles both. 

US crypto regulation has recorded significant progress as digital assets became a political and contentious issue ahead of the US elections. 
After the successful repeal of SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) on 16th May, more progress on crypto regulation has been made this week. 
On 22nd May, the US House of Representatives voted and passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, known as the FIT21 Act. Despite President Joe Biden’s opposition to the FIT21 crypto bill, it passed with bipartisan support. 
FIT21 crypto bill
The FIT21 bill aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets in the US. Notably, the bill seeks to offer the bulk of the crypto oversight to CTFC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission), an entity viewed as less hostile to the industry compared to the SEC. 
However, the SEC will retain authority on digital assets that fall within the ‘security’ definition. Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong called the FIT21 Act update a ‘historic vote’ for crypto regulation and clarity if passed into law. 
“Historic vote today on the FIT21 bill in the House of Representatives, that will finally start to create some clear rules to regulate crypto”
The Blockchain Association, for its part, referred to the development as a ‘watershed moment’ for the crypto industry. 
Interestingly, the update also prompted the White House’s reaction. The administration registered its opposition to the FIT21 Act but maintained its willingness to work for a ‘balanced’ regulatory framework for digital assets. 
Reacting to the White House’s statement, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart called it a ‘lip service.’
“What are the odds that this is just lip service? I guess time will tell”
The next step for the Republican-sponsored FIT21 Act will be the Senate. However, market watchers believe that the progress could pause until the next congress picks it up in January 2025. 
After FIT21 Act, House to vote on US CBDC
The US House of Representatives will now vote on another crypto bill, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, HR 5043, this week. The bill seeks to bar the Federal Reserve from issuing CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency), also known as a digital dollar, or using it as a monetary policy tool. 
The bill was introduced by Tom Emmer, the Republican House Majority whip, who maintained that the US CBDC pushed by the Fed would threaten Americans’ privacy. 
“The Biden Administration has proven they are itching to trade Americans’ right to privacy for a CCP-style CBDC surveillance tool.”
Should both bills pass the US House and Senate and become law, they could provide the regulatory clarity the industry has long sought.

Robinhood Taps 0x For Gasless Swaps On Arbitrum - The Defiant

Robinhood introduced support for swaps on Arbitrum in February.Robinhood, a commission-free trading platform, is launching gas-free trading on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum Layer 2 network by TVL.Robinhood launched the feature on May 23, allowing users to execute gasless trades on the Arbitrum network via Robinhood Wallet. 0x, a decentralized exchange protocol, will provide decentralized exchange aggregation services for Robinhood.Robinhood said 0x will provide traders with the best price quote available to traders. Users can also route trades incurring gas fees should they offer a better price than gasless trades.“Users can swap without needing ETH for gas on Arbitrum, with 0x as the DEX aggregator behind the activation,” Robinhood said.The news follows Robinhood teaming up with Arbitrum in February to offer traders access to swaps via Arbitrum-based decentralized exchanges.“Accessing and transacting on L2s has historically been difficult to non-crypto natives, but Robinhood Wallet now helps strip away the complexities to help onboard those new to web3,” said Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Crypto.Robinhood expands crypto offeringsRobinhood first began providing crypto trading services in February 2018 with the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum markets across five U.S. states. “Cryptocurrencies have become the first foray into investing and financial services to a large number of people,” said Robinhood co-founder, Vlad Tenev.Robinhood began expanding its roster of cryptocurrencies with the addition of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin in July 2018, alongside the introduction of support for on-chain cryptocurrency transfers. By 2021, Robinhood users in all but two U.S. states could access its cryptocurrency markets.In March 2021, Robinhood announced plans to ship a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, following up with a beta launch of the Polygon-powered wallet to 10,000 iOS users in September 2022. Robinhood Wallet became available to all iOS users in March 2023 and Android users in March of this year.In December 2023, Robinhood rolled out crypto trading for European users, also announcing plans to bring the service to U.K. customers in 2024. The company launched a custodial Solana (SOL) staking service for European customers last week.However, Robinhood’s crypto business suffered a blow in the U.S. on May 4 when it received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A Wells Notice is issued when the regulator completes an investigation concluding that the recipient has infringed securities law, and typically precedes a formal complaint.The notice came despite Robinhood delisting Solana, Cardano, and Polygon after the assets were named as securities assets in the SEC’s lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.

Xapo Launches Lightning Network Deposits Amid Growing Adoption In Key Latin Markets - The Defiant

Argentina and Brazil accounted for 43% of Lightning Network payments executed via Xapo in March.Xapo Bank, the pioneering digital asset custodian and bank, is the first fully licensed bank to support Bitcoin deposits via Lightning Network.Announced on May 23, the move allows Xapo’s global custodians to deposit BTC using Lightning Network, the payments-focussed Bitcoin Layer 2, via Lightspark, a firm providing Lightning Network-based payments infrastructure. Xapo does not charge fees for users depositing via Lightning Network.“We believe in the Lightning Network’s future as the primary avenue for Bitcoin transactions, especially for daily, small-scale exchanges,” said Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank.“Today's Bitcoin users seek not only to store their wealth but also to integrate Bitcoin into their daily transactions seamlessly,” said David Marcus, CEO and Co-Founder of Lightspark.Coinbase, the largest U.S. centralized exchange, similarly tapped LightSpark to launch support for Lightning Network payments three weeks ago.The move follows Xapo introducing support for Lightning Network payments last year.Adoption of the service recently spiked, with the number of Lightning Network payments executed via Xapo increased by 44% from February through March 2024, with Argentinian and Brazilian users accounting for 29% and 14% of transactions, respectively.Xapo noted that the countries have historically experienced high inflation, bolstering the value proposition of Bitcoin for local users.According to Look Into Bitcoin, 4,868.2 BTC worth nearly $337.7 million is currently locked on the Lightning Network.Xapo was among the first firms to provide Bitcoin services to the Latin American market. The company was founded by Wences Caseras, an entrepreneur who launched the first internet service provider in Argentina in 1994.Caseras became interested in Bitcoin after his family was severely impacted by rampant inflation and stringent capital controls in Argentina. After investing in BTC, Caseras built a “vault” to store his Bitcoin, which became the foundation for Xapo.Caseras went on to found the Lemon Bitcoin wallet in 2012, and Xapo in the following year. Xapo’s institutional custody business was acquired by Coinbase in 2019. Xapo Bank became a fully licensed digital bank under the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission in 2021.

Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Miner Awakens: 2,000 BTC Moved in One Go

According to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, an early Bitcoin miner from the Satoshi era has moved 2,000 BTC. This activity involved coins mined in 2010, a time when Bitcoin's value was negligible compared to today's prices."Satoshi era" refers to the period when Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was active in the community, roughly between 2009 and 2010.  Bitcoin mined during the early years (2009-2011) is considered part of Bitcoin’s foundational history. Transactions involving these coins are rare and often attract considerable attention. This is often because old Bitcoin miners act as a source of liquidity and distribution.The transfer was notable not only for its size but also because it involved coins that had been held for roughly 14 years. The motivation behind moving such a significant amount of Bitcoin after a prolonged period can vary. Some potential reasons include: the holder might seek to capitalize on current market prices or to fund new ventures or investments. Sometimes, old addresses move small amounts to test modern transaction capabilities and security before deciding on larger moves.It is also possible that the owner might be moving their holdings to enhance security, utilizing modern wallets with advanced security features compared to older ones. The movement might be part of a broader market strategy, such as preparing for a large sale through over-the-counter (OTC) markets.According to Moreno, the latter scenario might be the case. He speculates that the coins likely went to an OTC desk or custodian, given that they were forwarded to several other new addresses almost immediately.At the time of writing, BTC was down 0.5% in the last 24 hours to $69,681. At current prices, the value of the transferred 2,000 BTC would be worth nearly $130 million.

Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE) to Explode 11,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gold Pepe (GOLDPEPE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gold Pepe presents a similar opportunity.



Gold Pepe has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days before it will be listed on KuCoin – a massive cryptocurrency exchange – and Gold Pepe could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Gold Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gold Pepe on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gold Pepe by entering its contract address – 5EZoavSMtfuq3dQuyQsYqUgmD7avZJEZMYpLtpZFBgYz – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GOLDPEPE.

                        Nvidia’s impressive Q1 earnings report caused AI-related stocks to surge, but AI crypto has not followed suit despite Crypto trader’s expectations.On May 22, Nvidia released its Q1 earnings report. Revenue jumped 18% from the previous quarter and surged 262% year-over-year, beating analyst estimates of $24.6 billion.The earnings report was released after the NYSE market closed on May 22. However, Nvidia’s stock spiked 6.06% in after-hours trading, reaching $1,007 and pushing its market capitalization to over $2.5 trillion.Anticipating Nvidia’s earnings report, investors expected a positive outcome to be a catalyst for AI-related cryptocurrencies.This led many AI-related projects to rally hard ahead of the report, as investors scrambled to capitalise on the best AI cryptocurrencies.AI Crypto Falls Despite Nvidia Earnings
Immediately following Nvidia’s earnings report, tokens such as Fetch.ai (FET), The Graph (GRT), Injective (INJ), Render (RNDR), and SingularityNET (AGIX) did jump higher. However, many of them have since started to retrace.With Nvidia and other AI-focused companies performing so well in the stock market, the question many investors are now asking is whether AI-related crypto tokens will also benefit from the bullish sentiment surrounding AI.Notably, On May 22, a known “whale” wallet transferred approximately $52.1 million worth of Render to an unknown wallet, as reported by Santiment. This could indicate that holders were anticipating a “sell the news” event.However, this initial retracement might precede a rally. Pseudonymous crypto trader D0c Crypto pointed out that RNDR didn’t experience a price spike until 48 hours after Nvidia’s previous earnings report during an X post.This marks a potential opportunity to enter the market and see further gains following the Nvidia earnings report, as well as a potential buying opportunity.Although this sentiment does pose some potential gains, the aforementioned AI crypto projects are limited due to their high market capitalization. Consequently, traders looking for quicker and bigger gains may do well to investigate some of the newer low-cap AI coins currently doing the rounds.Meet Crypto’s First AI Trading Companion: WienerAI

Crypto Update: Meme Coins Steal Spotlight as Bitcoin Reaches $71K


							

PEPE has soared by 63.63% to reach $0.00001467, setting a new all-time high.



Similarly, Solana meme coins BONK, WIF, and BOME, surged by over 30%.



However, Shiba Inu shoulders a 3% loss in the cumulative seven-day trajectory.




The meme coin landscape is once again leading the narrative as the crypto market enters the second phase of the bull cycle. With Bitcoin returning to the $71K range, some meme coins have taken the spotlight from Bitcoin, registering significant double -digit percentage growth.



Take PEPE, for example, which was trading at a mere $0.000008947 just a week ago. Today, it has skyrocketed by 63.63% to reach $0.00001467, setting a new all-time high.



Similarly, Solana’s premier meme coin, BONK, sold for $0.00002367 on May 16. By May 23, BONK had achieved a 46.39% rally that took its market value to $0.00003465.



Dogwifhat (WIF) and BOME, other prominent meme coins in the Solana ecosystem, have recorded a similar 30% uptick in their seven-day trajectory. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu, the second most valuable meme coin, has been on the sidelines while WIF, BOME, PEPE, and BONK surged.



Currently, Shiba Inu bears a 3% loss in the cumulative seven-day trajectory, making it the only prominent meme coin yet to commence its bullish resurgence with Bitcoin’s comeback.



Nonetheless, market analysts are confident that Shiba Inu’s next explosive gains are just around the corner. In a recent update, analyst Clifton highlighted the formation of a bullish pennant on Shiba Inu’s chart. Analysts Davie and “Word of Charts” have noted similar observations in separate analyses of Shiba Inu.









For context, a bullish pennant formation indicates that an asset is poised to continue an uptrend that began earlier before encountering temporary resistance. In Shiba Inu’s case, SHIB experienced an aggressive uptrend in early March that took its value to $0.000045 but then lost momentum.



These market watchers believe Shiba Inu could surpass the $0.00005 threshold during its comeback. Currently, SHIB trades at $0.00002533, down 3% in the last 24 hours.

5 of the Best DeFi Lending Protocols for Taking Full Advantage of the Crypto Bull Market - CoinJournal



                    

                    It’s no secret that crypto is in the midst of a multi-year bull market right now with leading assets such as BTC and ETH chasing all-time highs and most other tokens, including memecoins, going from strength to strength. It’s also no secret that there’s never enough capital to buy all of the assets on your bull market wish list.
Lending protocols provide a solution to this, allowing DeFi users to deposit one asset, such as ETH or BTC, and borrow stablecoins, which can then be swapped for other assets, be it AI tokens, RWA assets, or memecoins. When used responsibly, lending allows savvy DeFi users to maximize their gains. They can capitalize on the upside to their collateral increasing in value while also using their borrowed assets to make additional gains.

But the lending protocol you choose will dictate the assets you can deposit, the ways you can utilize your borrowed funds, the interest you’ll pay, and the lending-borrowing ratio you can maintain. Here are five of the best lending protocols that will give you the most bang for your buck.
Nolus
Nolus is a cross-chain lending protocol that’s on the up. There’s a respectable $3.3M in TVL and $55M in volume since it launched less than a year ago. There are two things that make Nolus an ideal solution when operating in a bull market. Firstly, there’s its ingenious provision of up to 150% financing – 3x the industry average – through its DeFi Lease product. This allows lenders to obtain the maximum available capital and thus earn the maximum available yield.
As for how Nolus achieves this without increasing liquidation risk, it’s because both the staked asset – the down payment – and the borrowed asset are combined to acquire the asset the user desires. By pooling these sources, it’s possible to access much greater capital than would otherwise be available. The second neat thing about Nolus is that it doesn’t liquidate the user’s position in full should they become under-collateralized. Rather, it administers partial liquidation, granting ample opportunity to top up collateral and minimize downside risk.
Aave
Aave needs no introduction to DeFi users, having established itself as a mainstay of the $36B DeFi lending industry. $20B of that total is accounted for by Aave alone, whose multi-chain reach, robust security, and user-friendly interface have made it a favorite for everyone from minnows to whales. More than 160,000 native token-holders can participate in onchain governance, meaning Aave can also claim to be one of the most decentralized lending protocols on the market.
With eight networks supported, Aave provides familiarity, giving users confidence that they can rely on its battle-tested protocol on whichever chain they choose to ply their trade. There are multiple ways to earn an APY as an Aave user. You can deposit assets and earn interest on the borrowing of others; you can deposit your own assets and borrow a secondary asset, taking advantage of competitive interest rates; or you can stake AAVE and earn rewards for helping to secure the protocol.
Kamino
Solana is the largest non-EVM chain for DeFi and memecoin trading and it naturally has its own protocols where lending is available. Chief among these is Kamino, which allows native Solana assets including USDC, SOL, and JUP to be deposited or borrowed. The APYs are attractive too, providing ample incentives for those with spare crypto to park to earn a passive double-digit return.
One of the best things about Kamino is the range of assets it supports. In addition to Solana “blue chips,” it allows popular memecoins such as WIF and BONK to be used as collateral. This allows Solana users to reap the rewards of memecoin season while also borrowing assets that can be used for other purposes such as liquidity mining – or simply to buy more memecoins.
Compound
Compound is one of the oldest and most trusted DeFi lending protocols. Around $2.5B is deposited into its decentralized protocol at present and used to borrow approximately $900M in assets. A number of EVM chains are supported including Polygon, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, and of course Ethereum. ETH and USDC can be borrowed and the borrowing APRs are attractive.
One of the best things about Compound is that it’s been integrated into numerous third-party platforms including OKX, Binance, and Crypto.com. As a result, users of centralized crypto services can reap the rewards to be had from Compound’s efficient and highly secure crypto lending protocol. Governance is handled by COMP holders, who can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.
YouHodler
YouHodler is a centralized platform that intersects with DeFi, whose lending and borrowing formula has inspired its own service. Designed to promote the hodl mentality, YouHodler incentivizes users to avoid selling their crypto where possible and to instead borrow against it – a strategy that can prove profitable in a bull market. One of the most useful things about YouHodler is the sheer number of cryptos that can be borrowed against: anything in the top 50 by market cap is accepted.
There are other unique features to YouHodler too that make this CeDeFi platform worthy of consideration. Like its provision of a market-beating loan-to-value ratio value of 97%. Or the fact that borrowed assets can be converted to fiat and withdrawn to a bank account. If you don’t want to sell your crypto but have a house to buy or car to fix, YouHodler is a good choice.
If you’re keen to borrow against your long-term crypto assets, you should choose a trusted lending platform and maintain a healthy collateral ratio, which can help you to make your digital assets work for you.

River Protocol Takes on Slack, Discord With Messaging Apps on Ethereum L2 Base - Decrypt

With big tech companies like Google and Meta pumping potentially unwanted AI features into their messaging platforms, there is a growing call for decentralized and encrypted alternatives that don't rely on the centralized heavyweights.One company that aims to provide this service is Here Not There Labs, creator of the Towns social app and the newly launched River Protocol. River aims to offer an alternative to chat platforms like Slack and Discord, powered by blockchain tech and both customizable and private for creators.“You see a lot of social media products that are decentralized, but you don’t see a lot of social media protocols,” Here Not There Labs co-founder and CEO Ben Rubin told Decrypt. “I do not know of a social media [app] that is owned and operated by the participants of its network that have a means to create trust between one another in a way that is permissionless.”Created in 2023, River Protocol is designed to allow developers to build decentralized, real-time messaging applications using an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer-2 blockchain, off-chain nodes, and smart contracts on Ethereum scaling network Base.A screenshot from Towns, which is built on River Protocol. Image: Here Not There LabsAccording to the River Protocol website, the project is governed by the River Association, a decentralized autonomous organization or DAO, that allows RVR token holders to participate in the protocol’s future.River Protocol joins a growing number of decentralized applications offering secure communications and social media including Farcaster, BlueSky, Nostr, and Blockscan Chat. But while many social media protocols are aiming to take on Twitter, River Protocol is more focused on teams, companies, and projects who need their own dedicated server.“Each group is represented as a space, and each space is its own smart contract that is being deployed on-chain,” Rubin said. “What the smart contract does is allow the group to issue membership into the space, and also program the entitlement of who can read and write, and under what conditions."According to Rubin, this type of setup works best for large groups with specific roles assigned to members like moderators, or who need to set restricted access to channels in the group.River stores content off-chain and uses on-chain roll-ups. A bespoke appchain handles messaging to maintain speeds to provide a similar experience to Telegram or WhatsApp. This separation, Rubin added, ensures robust security for permissions while optimizing messaging to be fast and user-friendly—yet maintains user control and decentralization.“While our main deployment is on-chain, you can read on [Ethereum] mainnet, Polygon, or across any other chains to compose rules together,” Here Not There Labs co-founder and CTO Brian Meeks added. “All of that creates a trust route for the messaging, which is happening in the River protocol. But you can cryptographically verify that what is in the River protocol is what is allowed based on what's on-chain.”Other potential user cases for River Protocol besides messaging apps, Meeks added, include connecting players of decentralized video games.“Everything benefits from communication,” he said. “You can compose their protocol together into your game, into your app, or into whatever other decentralized experiences you have, and bring in a real-time provable, verifiable, end-to-end encrypted communication experience.”Additional reporting by Sander Lutz.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum Records Largest Daily Gains In 3 Years, Flips Mastercard And LVMH In Market Cap - Benzinga

On Monday afternoon, news broke that the probability of the SEC at least partially approving a spot ethereum ETF had vastly increased. This immediately led to massive buying activity for ETH, sending the price from less than $3,100 to over $3,800 in 24 hours. This marked the largest daily move for ETH since May 2021. Don't Miss:The move followed a post on X from Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, who has been covering crypto ETFs for several months. The post detailed how he is raising the "odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they’d be denied)."The post has amassed nearly five million views at the time of writing and was one of the first to start the frenzy surrounding the spot ETH ETFs. The announcement was highly unforeseen, as many had written off the ETFs due to the SEC's lack of comment on the issue and final deadlines for a decision looming later this week. Trending: According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here’s why it can be true.This news further enabled ethereum to reach a market cap of over $450 billion, making it larger than all but 20 companies worldwide. Here are some of the companies that ethereum surpassed after the news:
Mastercard (MA)



LVMH (LVMUY)



Procter & Gamble (PG) 



Samsung (KRW)



Bank of America (BOA)
However, approval of ETFs is not as black and white as a simple "yes" or "no" from the SEC because two forms must be approved for the ETFs to go live. The 19b-4 form allows the funds to list the ETFs, while the S-1 form is a detailed account of how the ETFs would work. According to ETF analyst Nate Geraci, the SEC could greenlight the 19b-4 forms but delay a decision on the S-1s. This would give them time to take a closer look at the individual applications from different sponsors to understand what a launch would look like. If this were to happen, it would be a positive for the spot ETFs and ethereum. It would allow the applications to move into the next stage of the process and one step closer to launch. Additionally, the possibility of full approval of the 19b-4s and S-1s is still on the table.Many crypto enthusiasts believe that a spot ETF approval would propel ETH to a price above $4,000, with some predicting that ETH could set new ATHs above $4,900. Given that Bitcoin hit new highs after the approval of its ETFs, a similar trend could occur for ethereum. Read Next:

The meme cryptocurrency SNEK, one of the largest assets on the Cardano blockchain, has seen a significant surge this week, adding over 20% to its value. The price of SNEK, known for its snake mascot, rose from 0.00227 ADA to 0.00277 ADA since Monday. This price increase has pushed SNEK's market capitalization to 203.74 million ADA, equivalent to $97.56 million. Currently, the token ranks as the third largest asset in the Cardano ecosystem, trailing only behind WorldMobile (WMT) and SingularityNET (AGIX).SNEK promotes itself as "the chillest meme coin on Cardano," with a mission of fostering community growth, advancing decentralized finance within the Cardano network and rewarding its holders. In recent years, SNEK has garnered significant support from the Cardano community. This support underscores the coin's popularity, even catching the attention of Charles Hoskinson. SNEK price outlookHowever, despite its growing popularity and substantial market cap, SNEK has yet to be listed on major exchanges like Binance or OKX. The absence of listings on these major exchanges may be seen as an unrealized trigger for the price. Source: TapToolsThe recent price surge appears to be fueled by the broader meme coin mania sweeping the cryptocurrency market. As meme cryptocurrencies inspired by various animals have seen triple-digit growth, SNEK has stealthily made its presence felt, suggesting that its rise may be just beginning.The SNEK price chart indicates a pattern of increasingly higher lows, hinting at a bullish trend as it approaches a key resistance level against ADA. If current market sentiment continues, it could drive more Cardano token holders to invest in SNEK, potentially amplifying its recent 21.6% rise.

Spot Bitcoin ETF (BTC) Holdings Hit New High of 850K

The spot ETFs ended Wednesday with their eighth straight day of net inflows, gobbling over 24,500 BTC over that period. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks – with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows and even net outflows on some days.

Pepe Memecoin Soars 27% Amid Speculation of Spot Ether ETF Approval



                    

Ethereum-based memecoin Pepe surged 27% to a new all-time high over the past 24 hours, fueled by speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.



“PEPE is probably the best memecoin play for the ETH ETF,” crypto trader Matthew Hyland claimed in a May 21 X post.




Pseudonymous crypto trader “Kaleo” noted the irony in how ETH is moving, and PEPE has become one of the most obvious hindsight trades out there.



Ether has risen 23.28% over the past two days, reaching $3,785, amid renewed hope that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may approve spot Ether ETFs by a May 23 deadline. 



This unexpected development has caught analysts and the crypto industry by surprise.




Pepe (PEPE) is currently trading at $0.00001387, up 23.48% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.



Pseudonymous crypto trader “Plazma” believes PEPE’s upward trend will continue but anticipates brief periods of volatility.

“PEPE price discovery should continue for the next few weeks with some normal breaks for a few days and the usual pullbacks. 




“We will be at 2x-3x in just a few weeks,” they wrote in a May 21 X post.



Meanwhile, PEPE’s open interest (OI) — the total value of all outstanding PEPE futures contracts across crypto exchanges — increased 40% to $172.96 million over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.



An OI rise typically indicates traders are more confident in entering future positions on a cryptocurrency, with data showing a significant number in long positions.



If PEPE’s price drops 6%, it would liquidate $10 million in long positions.



PEPE led price growth among the top 10 memecoins by market capitalization over the past 24 hours, but other top memecoins also saw significant price increases over the past week.



Bonk (BONK) rose 40.80%, Floki (FLOKI) increased 21.94%, and Book of Memes (BOME) climbed 25.04%.

Crypto Sector Makes Its Mark on the US Presidential Election! After Trump, Joe Biden Also Gave the Green Light to Crypto! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


President Joe Biden's campaign team is seeking a meme master in a strategic move to attract Gen Z voters.
The Biden for President (BFP) campaign has posted a job opening for an “Partner Manager” who will be tasked with overseeing day-to-day operations to engage the best content creators and meme pages on the internet.


President Biden's Campaign Seeks Meme Developer to Engage Generation Z Voters
The meme manager's primary responsibilities will include managing relationships with digital media companies, podcasters, and various social media influencers.
Biden's campaign has dabbled in meme culture before. The campaign adopted the “Dark Brandon” Meme in early 2022, depicting the 81-year-old president with laser eyes, to appeal to younger, internet-savvy audiences.





The meme gained traction and was mentioned by Biden himself on Seth Meyers' Late Night in February.

The push to appeal to young voters with digital and meme-based content underscores the campaign's effort to modernize its outreach.


The move also comes as Democrats are changing their stance on cryptocurrency, likely influenced by former President Donald Trump's pro-cryptocurrency comments to garner votes for the 2024 elections.
Trump, who is no stranger to meme culture himself, exploited the mug shot taken in Fulton County Prison in Georgia in August 2023 by selling products featuring this image.





His campaign also launched a “MugShot” non-fungible token (NFT) collection in December 2023, following his indictment.

Jeff Kauffman: Decentralized Social Will Revolutionize Marketing

Kauffman: Two brands that are doing well are Coinbase and 9dcc, a fashion brand started by G-Money. 9dcc is a good example of a brand that truly understands this offline, online, and on-chain brand experience and customer experience. But I'll start with Coinbase. They've done this cool thing as a publicly traded company where they've released their earnings report as an NFT collectible for free. Anyone can mint it, and then those who did receive discounts to their merch store, and get exclusive perks, for example, access to limited edition hats that are only available to people who minted their earnings report. 

This shows the connection between offline, online, and on-chain. The offline component is the merchandise (the physical goods), the online component is the shopping experience of buying or securing the goods, and the on-chain element is minting their earnings report on-chain. And with the on-chain element, what's key is that brands are putting their story on-chain.

Will Solana Or Dogecoin Be The Next Crypto ETF If The Ethereum ETF Is Approved? - Benzinga

As the financial markets eagerly anticipate the approval of the Ethereum ETH/USD Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), discussions are already swirling about which cryptocurrency might be next in line for ETF consideration. Industry experts suggest a varied and cautious outlook on the future of crypto ETFs, particularly those beyond Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum.Solana ETF: A Rocky Road AheadBloomberg analyst James Seyffart highlighted the significant regulatory hurdles facing a potential Solana SOL/USD ETF.“The SEC isn’t dancing around SOL’s status like they have ETH. Those lawsuits against COIN and Kraken and others flat out say ‘Solana is a security,’ which could very easily make this a very rocky road,” Seyffart tweeted. This sentiment underscores the complexities involved with SOL’s classification and the substantial legal and regulatory barriers it faces.Market Sentiment and Structural ChallengesNate Geraci, President of ETF Store reinforced the notion that a SOL ETF is not on the immediate horizon. “No SOL ETF until either CME-traded SOL futures exist or Congress puts a legit crypto regulatory framework in place,” Geraci asserted. He further added, “Crypto ETF spigot turned off for a while after spot ETH ETF approval,” suggesting that the market might see a pause in new ETF approvals post-ETH.Evan_ss6 also weighed in on the debate, emphasizing the structural challenges: “BTC and ETH will remain in a class of their own. SEC relied on a ~32 month sample period for correlation analysis between spot and CME futures. Given SOL CME futures do not even exist yet, my base case is SOL spot ETF will take at least 3 years.”Also Read: VanEck’s Spot Ethereum ETF Listed On DTCC As SEC Decision LoomsDogecoin ETF: Political Pressure and Market SpeculationWhile the path for a SOL ETF appears fraught with difficulties, there is a glimmer of optimism for a Dogecoin DOGE/USD ETF. Andrew Kang noted the shifting political landscape, which could favor DOGE: “With significant political pressure for regulation of crypto to be officially bestowed upon the CFTC, the odds for a DOGE ETF look brighter than ever.”However, despite this optimism, a Polymarket poll indicated only a 10% chance of a DOGE ETF being approved in 2024.Nevertheless, the conversation remains active, with HORSE tweeting, “DOGE is a close 2nd,” indicating that Dogecoin is still a significant contender in the ETF race.Looking Ahead: Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets EventAs the landscape for crypto ETFs continues to evolve, the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will provide a crucial platform for industry leaders, regulators, and investors to discuss these developments. This event promises to offer deep insights into the future trajectory of digital assets, regulatory challenges, and investment strategies, making it an essential gathering for those looking to navigate the complexities and opportunities in this dynamic market.Read Next: White House Won’t Veto Crypto Bill, But Seeks Stronger Consumer ProtectionsImage: Shutterstock

Demystifying AI’s Black Box: How Blockchain Tech Can Shine a Light on Previously Hidden Inputs

Andrew Stanco:  It’s a mix, in a way, because our focus is on the enterprise, since that’s going to be one of the first big places where you need to get AI correct from a training and governance standpoint. If you dig into that, then we need to have an area where a developer—or someone in that organization— can annotate the code and say, “Okay, this is what happened,” and then create a record. It’s enterprise-focused, with an emphasis on working with developers and the people building and deploying the models.

Ethereum ETFs are the wrong solution to the right problem - Blockworks


Numbers don’t lie — spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been a boon for the market. The first day of trading in the US saw over $4.6 billion in volume. Within a month, bitcoin rose above $50,000 for the first time since the bear market and hit $70,000 in March for the first time ever. 
But this bitcoin ETF liquidity boost does not address any of the underlying issues in today’s crypto user experience, nor does it offer investors empowerment through self-custody. 
In the case of ethereum ETFs, the outcome will likely be the same. Rather than rely on regulatory approval of such financial products to welcome traditional investors onboard, our industry needs to reimagine how we approach digital asset management so that users don’t need to choose between convenience and financial freedom. 
What interest in ETFs really tell us
The appeal of ETFs is exposure to the crypto market without the hassle of digital asset custody. With over 900,000 ETH forever lost due to user error, it’s understandable that investors would look for easier ways to tap into the value created in this space. 
But using old-world instruments to address crypto’s user experience challenges goes against what this industry set out to do — transform existing financial infrastructure to empower the little guy. 
After years of being looked down on by Wall Street, ETFs are tacit acknowledgments by traditional investors that the crypto sector is something worth opening the floodgates of retail and non-crypto money into. Supposing that ethereum ETF approval generates further interest in the crypto space — be that bullish interest from Larry Fink at BlackRock, opposition from ECB director generals, or just curiosity from the trainer at my local gym — the opportunity lies in shepherding these new investors toward full ownership of their assets. 
The ETF wrapper is one means of entry into crypto as an asset, but removing the wrapper brings us to the real treat — true ownership. 
Newfound industry attention, now to trust ourselves
Why should individuals care about self-custody and financial freedom? While the answer may be obvious to those deeply embedded in the crypto community, trusting traditional banks is the norm, and the convenience brought by these institutions outweighs the risks of crypto for many individuals. 
When the Bitcoin white paper was published 15 years ago, the manifesto envisioned a peer-to-peer network without financial intermediaries. Ethereum then brought new functionality to the digital asset space and created the foundation for DeFi innovation. For the first time, individuals could harness digital ownership and exchange assets globally online while preserving personal privacy and autonomy.

The challenge now is to get people of all investment experience and levels involved directly through self-custody of their assets. Products like ETFs, which mirror instruments in the traditional finance space, may have a positive market impact. However, they do not push individuals to reconsider traditional financial hierarchies and take ownership into their own hands. Only by directly engaging in self-custody platforms will we see crypto values influence mainstream audiences.
We’re only as good as our infrastructure
Self-custody is important, but how are we going to convince the next billion users to value freedom over convenience? It’s obvious that seed phrases and hardware wallets are not going to unlock digital ownership for mainstream users. In a time where payments can be made with a tap of a phone or a watch, the crypto industry needs usable features to appeal to traditional investors and everyday users. 
That’s why Vitalik and other leaders in the Ethereum space are calling for a transition to smart accounts. By abstracting away the complexities of digital asset management, smart accounts enable features like crypto recovery, self-custodial debit cards and email login. In addition to smart accounts, improvements in scaling tools like zero-knowledge (zk) rollups have increased the capacity and throughput of DeFi applications, overcoming bottlenecks and preparing the industry for mainstream adoption.
Better features and scalability have paved the way for new use cases in crypto. Self-custody is no longer limited to individual asset management. With multi-signature accounts, for example, organizations and businesses can co-manage assets with ease. Further, developments in zk have reduced transaction fees, making it feasible for projects to facilitate large batches of transactions cost-effectively.
The crypto industry needs to continue building momentum
Bitcoin and ethereum ETFs have captured the zeitgeist, and now the crypto industry needs to capitalize on the mindshare introduced by this regulatory milestone. In the same way that football’s popularity grew in my German hometown in the aftermath of Germany’s 2014 FIFA World Cup victory, this newfound interest among conventional investors allows us to push self-custody to the forefront and showcase the opportunities unlocked by digital ownership.
ETFs encourage adoption; true crypto ownership encourages autonomy. Simplifying crypto user experience should be championed above simple ETF wrappers and commodity baskets. Bolstered with new liquidity, the industry needs to use this pivotal moment as a catalyst to revamp user experience across the board. Improving crypto-native platforms progresses the movement for digital ownership, which will outlast any market trends in the coming years.

Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over As It’s Yet To Reach Escape Velocity- What This Means | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst James Check (also known as Checkmatey) has predicted that Bitcoin could still make further moves to the upside. However, he warned about an “escape velocity” that could send the flagship crypto’s price spiraling down. 
What The Escape Velocity Means And How It Affects Bitcoin
Simply put, escape velocity is the minimum speed at which a person or object needs to escape the Earth’s gravitational pull (i.e., the force that brings one back down to Earth). Crypto analyst James Check referred to this term while noting that it is likely that Bitcoin hasn’t reached the point of “euphoric escape velocity yet.”

This suggests that the crypto token has yet to reach a point where it can be said that its price is unlikely to drop beyond a critical support level like $70,000. The analyst remarked that Bitcoin not reaching escape velocity is a “good thing.” He further explained that this signals that the market is “unlikely to be over-stretched, over-bought, and over-saturated.”
Check mentioned that a break above $73,000 would turn short-term holders (STH) into “sufficient profit,” leading to some resistance to Bitcoin’s price. Basically, the analyst suggested that Bitcoin reaching that price level could lead to a wave of sell-offs from these short-term holders, which could cause Bitcoin’s price to stagger or even decline. 
However, things could also turn out well as Check added that the $73,000 level could also be where an “escape velocity phase shift” takes place for Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin reaching $73,000 is also significant because it is close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. 
While highlighting an inverse head-and-shoulder pattern that had formed on Bitcoin’s chart, crypto analyst Crypto Jebb mentioned that there is a “great degree of likelihood” that Bitcoin would experience a rise to $100,000 should it break above $73,800. 
Another Wave Of Demand Is Emerging
James Check noted that the market is seeing early signs of a new wave of demand that could send Bitcoin to a new ATH. He highlighted that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs look to have reversed from a four-week streak of net outflows to net inflows, with these funds recording over $1.2 billion in net inflows over the last weeks. 

The crypto analyst claims that this occurrence “may well be the ground zero for that second wave of demand” if the net outflows phase is over. Generally, Check sounded bullish on Bitcoin’s future trajectory as he also noted that the crypto token is coming out of two months of healthy consolidation. 
Based on this, he stated that he wouldn’t be surprised if Bitcoin is on the brink of setting a new all-time high. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,400, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Tech tycoon Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter in October 2022 for $44 billion and then rebranded it as X (planning to make it "The Everything App" in the near future) has announced that yet another useful feature of his social media platform has been upgraded.The community, which features many XRP fans and meme lovers, replied with a wave of enthusiasm about the new upgrade of the feature that helps verify real information on X or correct false information – Community Notes.Musk announces Community Notes update, community respondsThe serial tech entrepreneur tweeted that Community Notes has finally been translated, quoting a tweet from his account that was not in English as usual but in French.The tweet also announced that from now on any comments made in Community Notes can be translated with a single click on the post: “Now, if you see a Community Note in another language, you can tap to translate. Available today for contributors, coming soon to everyone on X.” Major XRP enthusiast @XRPcryptowolf once again reminded Musk that the implementation of cryptocurrency payments on the X platform is the only thing missing now.A “meme artist,” @X_BEBEeth, also asked when crypto payments would become available on the platform. Many other meme-themed accounts also responded either praising and thanking Musk (and suggesting that Grok be added to the Community Notes) or asking him about the probability of crypto payments on X in the future.Musk and other leaders slam Microsoft's new AIThis week, a new AI-based feature announced by Microsoft made waves within the cryptocurrency community. The corporation’s CEO, Satya Nadella, announced the launch of “Recall” – an addition to Microsoft’s Co-Pilot AI that is designed to constantly take screenshots of users' PCs or laptops to allow them to later search through this archive processed by AI.Musk referred to this innovation as a “Black Mirror” episode and stated that he would switch off this feature. Vitalik Buterin wondered if this data is to be collected and added to Microsoft’s databases. Satya Nadella stated that it would only be collected locally, i.e., on users’ devices.Ripple CTO David Schwartz wondered who would ever want to use such a feature.

Binance Struggling Due To Regulatory Compliance In Nigeri...


                                Binance Executives Facing Regulatory Hurdles In Nigeria                                What's The NewsBinance, a global cryptocurrency exchange platform has experienced some regulatory issues in Nigeria. It is a company that has been known to have operations in the cryptocurrency market with much intensity. It has been in the spotlight for some time, especially after being accused of engaging in regulatory misconduct and other unlawful business practices.In February, Nadeem Anjarwalla joined Binance as an executive who was supposed to oversee the company’s operations in Africa. He was alleged to have manipulated Nigeria’s fiat money (the Naira). Later, Anjarwalla and Tigran Gambaryan the head of financial crime compliance at Binance were arrested in Nigeria.The Nigerian court has been in a tax evasion case with Binance and the case has been moved to June 14. This delay was attributed to the failure to produce Gambaryan in court with no proper explanation for his absence. The Nigerian lawyer representing the NRS also looked puzzled when asked why Gambaryan had not been brought to court by the Nigerian prison service.Previous decisions allowed Gambaryan to act in the present case on behalf of Binance. There are charges against both Gambaryan and Anjarwalla for non-registration with the Nigerian Tax authorities and tax evasion. Also, the Nigerian authorities claimed that Binance was involved in money laundering amounting to more than $35 million. Gambaryan’s wife has also been persistent in his release and has filed a petition to bring him back to the United States and as of the time of writing the petition has 3373 supporters.The CEO of Binance, Richard Teng has come out in the open to condemn the action of the Nigerian authorities pointing out that such actions are setting a bad precedent for companies around the world. He argued that Gambaryan and Anjarwalla had been guaranteed safe conduct for their meetings in Nigeria but they were detained unlawfully.Binance Encountering Hurdles In The Crypto MarketThe allegations against Binance have resulted in severe operational interruptions. Due to regulatory pressure, Binance was recently forced by a Nigerian court to remove the Naira from its trading list and disclose the identity of its users in Nigeria. On the 5th of March Binance suspended and banned all operations related to the Naira thus pulling out from Nigeria.The ongoing legal and regulatory issues have not only affected Binance's operations in Nigeria but have also had broader implications. Binance has been at the center of controversy over regulatory compliance, a factor that has led to tension between the exchange and the Nigerian government. The company was also charged with a substantial $10 billion fine as part of the legal proceedings.This situation has raised concerns about the general issues that most cryptocurrency exchanges are bound to encounter due to the different regulatory systems across the globe as experienced by Binance in Nigeria. As regulatory authorities keep on putting restrictions on the trading of digital currencies, such firms are experiencing challenges in their operations as they face legal challenges as seen with Binance.ConclusionBinance's situation in Nigeria highlights the complexities and risks involved in the global cryptocurrency market. The company's struggles with regulatory compliance, allegations of illicit activities, and the subsequent market exit from Nigeria demonstrate the challenges that even the largest players in the industry must contend with. As the legal battles continue, the outcome will likely have significant implications for Binance and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.Also Read: Finance Ministry Acting Or Enacting A Ban On Stablecoins?

This absence of “wallet awareness” is glaring. True Web3 content should react to wallet data, creating dynamic and personalized interactions. In Web2, some sites already offer tailored experiences based on user data. Web3 should go even further by using wallet information to deliver curated content, targeted recommendations, personalized growth marketing, and actionable insights by default.

SHIB price predicted to hit 5.5 cents; Here’s when


    As many assets in the cryptocurrency sector begin to somewhat consolidate their gains from earlier this week, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is no exception, but the crypto asset inspired by the popular doge meme could hit the price of $0.055 in the next 16 years, according to a recent prediction.



Indeed, Shiba Inu has slowed down its price advances in recent days, but its advance of nearly 150% since the year’s turn, the market capitalization of over $15 billion, and its climb in the crypto ranks speak volumes of the asset’s strength and further potential.



Shiba Inu price prediction 2040



In this context, an extremely optimistic price prediction has appeared that anticipates Shiba Inu to hit the whopping price of 5.5 cents (or $0.054 minimum) in the next 16 years, or specifically by 2040, which, if correct, would represent a mind-blowing advance of 210,673% from SHIB’s price at press time.

On the other hand, one platform’s advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are not as bullish in terms of SHIB price by 2040, albeit they do envision significant improvement that would send Shiba Inu to $0.000289 by the end of that year, suggesting an increase of 1,028.02% from its current price on May 23.



Shiba Inu price analysis



For now, SHIB is changing hands at the price of $0.00002562, recording a 0.57% drop in the last 24 hours, advancing 2.90% across the previous seven days, and losing 6.64% on its monthly chart, with the strongest support level resting at $0.00002321 and facing firm resistance at $0.00002782.



Shiba Inu price 7-day chart. Source: Finbold



Based on technical analysis (TA) indicators, SHIB’s present price is both above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.00001625 and the 50-day SMA of $0.00002476 – with both being bullish signs that suggests the strong possibility of more price increases in the near future.



At the same time, however, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) of the currently 12th-largest asset in the crypto sector by market capitalization is hanging in the neutral zone at 52.06, as it is pointing neither toward the oversold/undervalued (below 30) nor overbought/overvalued (above 70) position.



All things considered, 16 years is a long time, and SHIB might actually meet the expectation of hitting (or even surpassing) the price threshold of 5.5 cents. However, it is challenging to make any definite SHIB price predictions as the situation in this sector can change.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) 485% Netflow Surge Takes Intriguing Twist: Details

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has triggered a staggering 485% netflow spike on a seven-day basis, albeit a negative one, which adds an intriguing twist to the positive narrative.However, in the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu has marked positive netflows, soaring from -97.45 billion SHIB to 379.61 billion SHIB.  The Large Holders Netflow Indicator from IntoTheBlock gives information about whale position changes. Positive netflow spikes might be interpreted as accumulation from large holders, while decreases point to reduced positions or selling.Regardless of the implications, a surge in netflow might signal whale activity.  The rise in netflow at this moment remains significant as SHIB approaches a critical juncture in its price that might impact its short-term trajectory. The cryptocurrency market has been closely watching Shiba Inu as it fights to keep its price above the daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) 50, a key barrier that has restrained its upward movement since mid-April.For SHIB, the SMA 50 has acted as a resistance level, capping its price in a range and preventing a bullish breakout. Since mid-April, SHIB has attempted to breach this level multiple times, only to be driven back down, indicating market hesitation.However, recent developments indicate a shift in the tide. SHIB's price has now pierced through the daily SMA 50 barrier, signaling a potential shift in momentum.  Market sentiment has also played a crucial role in SHIB's recent price action. Positive news regarding the progress toward the approval of U.S. Ethereum spot ETFs has contributed to a more optimistic outlook for cryptocurrencies, including SHIB. This sentiment reversal has provided the necessary impetus for SHIB to challenge and surpass the SMA 50.As SHIB trades above the daily SMA 50, currently at $0.00002467, the market is watching to see if it can sustain this. A steady hold above the SMA 50 could pave the way for further recovery and potentially usher in a new bullish trend for SHIB. Failure to hold above current levels, on the other hand, could lead to a price drop and further consolidation. At the time of writing, SHIB was up 0.07% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002561, per CoinMarketCap data.

Analysts Suggest Possible Upside Surprise in SEC Decision on Spot Ether ETFs Despite Pessimistic Sentiment



                    

Despite skepticism from numerous crypto analysts and the broader crypto community regarding the approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), some experts believe a surprise may be possible.



“If by some chance the SEC decides to approve then so many will be caught severely offside,” said crypto trader Matthew Hyland to his 142,000 followers on X on May 17. 




He added, “If 90% of people think the ETH ETF will be denied, and the majority of those people think it will lead to a crypto crash then who will actually be selling?” Hyland noted that the expectation of denial is already “priced in.” 



As of publication, Ether is trading at $3,102, according to CoinMarketCap.



Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has estimated the odds of approval at 35%, while the broader crypto community, based on New York-based Polymarket’s predictions, places their estimates closer to 7%.

Meanwhile, Coinbase institutional research analyst David Han believes there is potential for a positive outcome. 



“We believe the odds of approval are closer to 30-40%,” Han stated in Coinbase’s monthly outlook report published on May 15.



Han elaborated that as cryptocurrency becomes a more significant issue for voters in the lead-up to the November U.S. presidential election, the SEC might reconsider its stance on denial. 




“As crypto begins to take form as an election issue, it’s also less certain in our view that the SEC would be willing to front the political capital necessary to support a denial,” he said.



Han further argued that even if the VanEck and ARK Invest ETF applications are denied by the initial deadline of May 23, litigation could potentially overturn that decision. 




This suggests that while current sentiment is largely pessimistic, there are plausible scenarios where the SEC might approve the spot Ether ETFs, leading to significant market movements.

The asset witnessed a nearly 30% increase in value over the past week, escalating from below $3,000 as of this time last week to as high as $3,810 yesterday. 
This uptick coincided with significant regulatory movements. 
Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far revised its stance on Ethereum spot ETFs, prompting exchanges to update their 19b-4 filings. 
This week, several Ethereum ETF issuers submitted their updated filings, with a decision on the VanEck Ethereum ETF application expected shortly.
 Institutions like Standard Chartered already predicted that an Ethereum ETF approval is imminent. 
Amid these regulatory developments, Ethereum’s co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke has made headlines for reportedly cashing out during this price rally. 
Detailing the Ethereum co-founder’s transactions
SpotonChain reported that Wilcke transferred approximately 10,000 ETH (worth around $37.38 million) to the Kraken exchange at a rate of $3,738 per ETH. 
Since the beginning of 2024, Wilcke has moved a total of 24,300 ETH to Kraken, totaling about $75.52 million. 
Source: Spotonchain
These transactions indicated Wilcke’s strategy to capitalize on the rising prices, despite still holding a substantial 126,000 ETH, valued at approximately $473 million.
 So far, Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke’s recent activities have raised questions about his market strategy. 
By depositing large amounts of ETH into the Kraken exchange, Wilcke appears to be taking advantage of the price increase. 
His deposits started when ETH was priced lower, and his most recent deposit preceded another significant price surge. This timing suggests a calculated approach to maximize returns.
Meanwhile, AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode data indicated that the circulating supply of Ethereum has spiked over the past month. Normally, an increase in supply could pressure the price downward.

However, Ethereum’s price has risen alongside the supply, suggesting that demand has kept pace with the increased availability. 
This balance is crucial for maintaining price stability and indicated a healthy market where new supply is absorbed by growing demand.
Market trends and technical analysis
The market dynamics around Ethereum are quite intriguing, especially with the increased circulating supply and active addresses. 
Santiment data shows a rise in Ethereum’s active addresses from under 8 million in March to nearly 9 million in April, although there has been a slight retraction to 8.35 million, as of press time. 
Source: Santiment
This fluctuation in active addresses is a vital indicator of demand. If the number of active addresses continues to decrease while supply rises, Ethereum could face a price correction from current price levels.

Furthermore, technical analysis of Ethereum’s 30-minute chart revealed a bullish trend, with several breaks of structure to the upside. 
However, AMBCrypto predicted a potential retracement to around $3,600. This level is seen as a liquidity zone that could provide the fuel for Ethereum’s continued upward trajectory.

Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP) to Skyrocket 13,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Grabby Trump (GRATRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because GRATRUMP has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Grabby Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Grabby Trump could become the next viral memecoin.



Grabby Trump launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Grabby Trump on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Grabby Trump by entering its contract address – 84ABvkFYWuh5oCSvPMztyeK5yVQAsd17egSLgJN4X9nr – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GRATRUMP.

ByBit insolvency rumors highlight Ethena’s centralization


Rumors of problems with Ethena’s $2.5 billion so-called stablecoin USDe have been fueled this week by reports that giant exchange ByBit — where Ethena trades some of its assets — is experiencing financial problems, possibly even insolvency.
Some claim that the rumors were attributable to a dashboard error at Arkham while others believed them to be true. Observers noted a small amount of exchange outflows relative to ByBit’s total assets.
ByBit itself has since refuted any claims of insolvency.
Protos reached out to the exchange for comment but at time of publication has not received a response. Over the last seven days, neither the price of Ethena’s proprietary token ENA nor its stablecoin USDe have declined in price.
For its part, Ethena claims to hold all of its collateral off-exchange at third-party custodians like Copper or Cobo. Although it clears trades via crypto exchanges, it claims to hold the collateral backing its positions, including ByBit perpetual futures, off-exchange.
Give us money, we trade it, earn 37% APY
Ethena’s marketing pitch is simple. It accepts capital, executes trades on various exchanges using this capital, and pays out a stratospheric yield above 37%. It also incentivizes extra deposits with an airdrop of its proprietary token ENA — a classic crypto marketing ploy.
Its hook is only slightly new. Ethena crafted a scheme that would take Ethereum’s 3.4% and add complexity and lots of leverage. It would also supposedly allow investors to earn the staking yield from Ethereum without subjecting themselves to the price fluctuations of ETH, via its USDe.
Ethena claimed to accomplish this feat by establishing a leveraged delta-neutral ETH trade. Its leaders would also control the private keys and exchange login credentials to hold most of the protocol’s assets. It would call itself the ‘internet bond,’ its proprietary token a ‘synthetic dollar,’ and its unsustainable 37% APY an ‘internet native yield.’
Delta neutrality is a way to invest so that the value of a portfolio usually doesn’t decrease when small changes occur in the value of the underlying asset. A trader hedges ‘delta,’ a greek financial term meaning ‘sensitivity to changes in the price of the underlying,’ by buying an equal amount of long and short positions simultaneously.
In a perfect world, this delta neutrality allows a trader to preserve the USD value of a position, regardless of whether the price of an asset like ETH declines. If ETH declines, the short position gains in value to compensate.
No free lunch on Wall Street
Of course, there’s no free lunch in finance, and holding delta neutrality in order to capture Ethereum’s staking yield carries significant risks. The two most important risks are Ethena leadership’s control of keys and funds, as well as the risk of crypto exchanges going under.
Ethena has both risks in spades. By its founding backer’s own admission, “Ethena is not decentralized, nor is it trying to be.”
Ethena backs each USDe, which is supposed to be worth $1, with two major assets. First, it buys a staked ETH (stETH) position from LidoDAO, Ethereum’s largest liquid staking protocol. Second, it collateralizes perpetual futures short contracts on crypto exchanges, including ByBit. Lido pays out most of Ethereum’s staking yield to Ethena, which Ethena then eventually leverages and passes along to USDe tokenholders who stake their USDe.
With the USD price of ETH hedged against a decline thanks to its perp shorts, as long as management and custodians don’t steal or lose the money, Ethena hopefully stays delta-neutral.
Ethena aimed to differentiate itself from failed stablecoins like Charles Hoskinson’s BitUSD, Mark Cuban’s Iron Titanium, Mark Lamb’s flexUSD, Huobi’s HUSD, or Do Kwon’s Terra and Basis Cash. Its marketing campaign worked. It rebranded itself away from ‘algorithmic’ stablecoin — a tarnished word after the multi-billion dollar collapse of Do Kwon’s algorithmic stablecoin Terra — and instead claims that USDe is a ‘synthetic dollar.’
Synthetic is, of course, different from algorithmic.
Arthur Hayes is Ethena’s biggest cheerleader
Arthur Hayes, who made millions by trading against his own customers at BitMEX and later pleaded guilty to federal crimes, is the main cheerleader for Ethena. Hayes predicts that USDe“}[=, which has a market capitalization of $2.6 billion today, will one day grow larger than its $111 billion stablecoin competitor, Tether (USDT). 
“Combining physical staked ETH plus a short ETH/USD perp swap position creates a high-yielding synthetic USD,” Hayes wrote glowingly. He also assured his fanbase that despite similar, nose bleeding-high interest rates above 30% advertised for both USDe and UST during their respective launch phases, “USDe generates yield in a completely different fashion than UST.”

Ethena investors won’t be critics
Ethena also gained significant support from crypto influencers who might have otherwise criticized the project. Influencers like Cobie, Andrew Kang, Dovey Wan, and the founders of three DeFi protocols are backers. Ethena’s own fundraise was financially supported by the crypto exchanges that process trades using its collateral.
On Ethena’s own cap table are ByBit, Deribit, OKX Ventures, Binance Labs, Gemini, and Kraken. Meltem Demirors likened USDe’s 37% yield to USDC’s 5% yield, as though the two are comparable. The founders of two competing stablecoins, Synthetix and Frax, are backers of Ethena.
Delphi Digital — which invested in the now-collapsed Terra Luna scheme, heavily broadcast Terra to wealthy New York traders, and charges over $5,000 per year for so-called research — employed an author who owns Ethena assets USDe and ENA to write a glowing, nine-chapter report.
Coincidentally, that Delphi author concluded that Ethena is “democratizing access to the delta-neutral basis trade and allowing it to seamlessly compose with the rest of DeFi.” Incredibly, Delphi alluded to a Bloomberg article about “the closest thing to a risk-free bet in the cryptocurrency market” as though Bloomberg analysts were referencing Ethena’s delta-neutral trade. They were not.

Crypto regulation bill passed in the House, heads to Senate

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a crypto market structure bill on Wednesday evening that aims to regulate the industry at large.RFK Jr. investing in GameStop is hilarious, exec saysThe bill, “The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act” (FIT21), would effectively classify cryptocurrency as a commodity, not a security, and therefore exempt from securities regulations. It would also determine oversight of cryptocurrencies, whether they should be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).The Republican-led bill — the first standalone legislation of its magnitude — passed with a 279-136 vote in the lower chamber, gaining support from 71 Democrats, including former Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California.The crypto bill cleared the U.S. House despite criticism from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who publicly expressed his opposition to it.Gensler stated, “FIT21 would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.” He reiterated his stance on cryptocurrency as securities, expressing concern that the bill would exclude blockchain-recorded investment contracts from the statutory definition of securities and, hence, the protections of the federal securities laws.Yesterday, hours before the vote, the White House also expressed opposition to the bill, citing concerns due to inadequate investor protections. President Biden released a statement saying that he is against the legislation, but he hasn’t threatened to veto it.What’s next?The bill must now gain approval from the Senate, but this will be challenging as the leading figures in the Democrat-controlled Senate have shown little interest in it.There is a very low chance that the bill would become law in Congress, but it can shed light on how Democrats and Republicans view crypto regulation.In an election year when crypto has become a political issue — with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, accepting crypto donations and Democrats showing a softer stance on crypto — the reactions of both political parties are important.

Grayscale Investments launches Near and Stacks crypto trusts - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest crypto asset manager, has announced the creation and public launch of two new crypto investment trusts: Grayscale Near Trust and Grayscale Stacks Trust. The new trusts, which opened on May 23, allow eligible individual and institutional accredited investors to access daily subscriptions for diversified crypto exposure.The Grayscale Near Trust is exclusively invested in NEAR, the native token of the Near Protocol, while the Grayscale Stacks Trust is exclusively invested in STX, the native token of the Bitcoin Layer 2 protocol Stacks. These trusts are among the first investment products solely invested in NEAR and STX tokens.Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s Head of Product & Research, said that Grayscale is committed to helping “drive the crypto ecosystem forward” as blockchain tech stacks tackle the challenges of scalability.The new investment trusts function similarly to Grayscale’s existing suite of single-asset investment trusts, providing investors with a familiar structure to gain exposure to these specific crypto assets. The launch of the Near and Stacks trusts comes as Grayscale’s odds of having an Ethereum ETF approved have significantly increased over the last week.Senior ETF analysts at Bloomberg have raised their predictions from 25% to 75% on the likelihood of the Securities and Exchange Commission approving ether ETFs, citing an apparent “180” about-face in the agency’s thinking. After initially withdrawing its application, Grayscale recently refiled its ether ETF application, removing language pertaining to staking and confirming that it will not participate in any other mechanisms associated to Ethereum’s proof of stake consensus algorithm.Grayscale’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, GBTC, continues to maintain one of the highest assets under management (AUM) among crypto funds, amassing $20.08 billion worth of funds as of May 23. The company recently appointed Goldman Sachs’ strategy exec Peter Mintzberg as its new CEO.

Render and Helium fuel expansion of Solana's DePIN ecosystem: Flipside - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Solana’s Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) ecosystem is experiencing significant growth, driven by its high-speed transactions, low costs, and robust infrastructure, according to the “Solana DePIN Snapshot: H1 2024” report by on-chain data firm Flipside. The report explored different sectors within the DePIN narrative by analyzing their key projects. Render Network was used as a benchmark for the decentralized compute sector. Decentralized compute networks provide scalable and cost-effective computing power by leveraging a network of decentralized nodes.Render has successfully rendered approximately 33 million frames, equivalent to 33,000 GPU hours using NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. Weekly active node operators peaked at 1,900 in January 2024, a 66.3% increase since migrating to Solana. Node operator rewards increased by 34.3% post-migration, peaking at 228,000 RNDR in early January 2024.Rewards paid for Render node operators. Image: FlipsideAnother sector from the DePIN narrative is decentralized connectivity, which was represented in the report by Helium. Decentralized wireless networks are based on the idea that, as technology has progressed, physical networks don’t need to be built from a top-down approach.Helium Network’s mobile network token burns vastly outnumber those of the IoT network, driven by the rapid adoption of Helium Mobile services. Helium Mobile subscribers peaked at nearly 90,000 in January 2024, sustained by competitive pricing and MOBILE token incentives. Mobile Discovery Rewards growth has accelerated since December 2023, outpacing new subscriber growth.Rewards paid for mobile discovery. Image: FlipsideDecentralized data and sensor networks are also a part of the DePIN industry, and are represented in the report by Hivemapper. The projects within this sector leverage distributed technology to collect, process, and share data from a vast array of sensors, creating a robust, real-time web of information.Hivemapper has mapped over 50 million kilometers across 90+ countries, making it the fastest-growing mapping project. There has been a significant rise in net HONEY burns due to increased network activity and enterprise adoption. Nearly one-third of HONEY token owners are active contributors, indicating high community engagement.Different HONEY holders by percentage. Image: FlipsideFurthermore, another traditional service that has its decentralized version in DePIN is storage solutions. Decentralized storage networks provide secure, scalable, and cost-effective data storage solutions by distributing data across multiple nodes rather than relying on centralized servers.Activity registered by SHDW largest holders. Image: FlipsideShdwDrive is the representation of this DePIN niche in Flipside’s report. The project demonstrated impressive performance in Testnet 2, handling up to 38,000 transactions per second during surge scenarios. The number of SHDW token holders peaked at 67,000 in March 2024, with more top wallets accumulating than selling. Staking activity has shifted towards withdrawals since rewards ended, typical for pre-utility phases.

Why Monero Will Survive Despite Being Delisted by Exchanges



                    

Monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency known for its strong privacy features, security, and decentralization. Recently, several major exchanges have delisted Monero due to regulatory pressures and compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Despite these challenges, Monero’s inherent features and the support of its community suggest that it will continue to survive and remain relevant in the cryptocurrency landscape.



Reasons for Delisting



Regulatory bodies are increasingly scrutinizing privacy coins like Monero. These cryptocurrencies pose challenges to compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Exchanges face pressure to adhere to these regulations to avoid penalties and maintain their operational licenses. Delisting Monero is a step taken by exchanges to align with regulatory requirements and reduce compliance risks.




Risk Management



Exchanges consider the risks associated with listing privacy coins. These risks include potential misuse for illicit activities and the consequent impact on the exchange’s reputation. By delisting Monero, exchanges aim to mitigate these risks and maintain their standing within the financial and regulatory ecosystem. This risk management strategy helps exchanges avoid potential legal and financial repercussions.



Community and Support



Monero has a dedicated and active community that plays a crucial role in its development and maintenance. This community-driven approach ensures continuous improvements and updates to Monero’s technology. The Monero Research Lab is a key contributor, focusing on enhancing privacy features and overall security. Merchant adoption of Monero is growing, with various businesses accepting it for transactions. This real-world usage underscores Monero’s practical value. Additionally, Monero is used for private transactions, donations, and e-commerce, further demonstrating its utility and acceptance in various sectors. The strong community support and diverse use cases contribute significantly to Monero’s resilience and sustainability.



Merchant Adoption and Use Cases



Monero’s adoption among merchants is expanding as businesses recognize the benefits of its privacy features. Various e-commerce platforms, both large and small, accept Monero for payments, providing customers with a private and secure transaction option. In addition to e-commerce, Monero is used for donations, allowing contributors to maintain their anonymity. The coin’s privacy and security features also make it suitable for private transactions, protecting users’ financial information from public exposure. These use cases highlight Monero’s practical applications and its growing acceptance in different sectors.



Alternatives to Traditional Exchanges



Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provide a platform for trading cryptocurrencies without relying on a central authority. These exchanges facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions, enhancing privacy and reducing the need for regulatory compliance typically associated with centralized exchanges. By using smart contracts, DEXs allow users to trade Monero securely and privately, mitigating the risks linked to centralized exchanges.



P2P Trading Platforms



Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platforms enable direct transactions between individuals. These platforms often incorporate escrow services to ensure the security of trades. Users can buy and sell Monero directly from one another, using Monero wallets like XMRWallet, bypassing the need for traditional exchanges. P2P platforms offer increased privacy and control over transactions, making them a viable option for trading Monero.



Atomic Swaps



Atomic swaps are a technological innovation that allows direct exchanges between different cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized intermediary. By using cryptographic protocols, atomic swaps ensure that trades are executed securely and privately. This method enables Monero users to trade directly with holders of other cryptocurrencies, maintaining privacy and reducing dependence on traditional exchanges.



The Future of Monero



Monero continues to develop its technology to enhance privacy, security, and efficiency. Ongoing projects include improvements to its cryptographic protocols, such as ring signatures and confidential transactions. Future developments may focus on scalability, making the network more efficient and capable of handling a higher volume of transactions without compromising privacy.




Regulatory Landscape



The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, particularly privacy coins like Monero, is evolving. Potential regulatory changes could impact how Monero is traded and used. However, Monero’s decentralized nature and strong privacy features make it adaptable to various regulatory scenarios. The community is actively monitoring regulatory developments and is prepared to respond to ensure compliance while maintaining core principles.



Community Initiatives



The Monero community is engaged in several initiatives aimed at promoting and supporting the cryptocurrency. These include educational efforts to inform users about Monero’s benefits and proper usage, as well as organizing events and conferences to foster collaboration and innovation. Community-driven projects continue to enhance Monero’s functionality and usability, ensuring its relevance and utility in the future.



Conclusion

Statement from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler on Cryptocurrencies: "Without Prejudice, But..." - Bitcoin Sistemi


The political landscape in the US witnessed a significant shift this week, reviving hopes of approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.
However, this development appears to have had little impact on Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler's stance on cryptocurrencies.


In a statement on Thursday, Gensler reiterated his belief that most cryptocurrencies are securities. His remarks come as many expect spot Ether ETFs to be approved later in the day.

Gensler said the following about cryptocurrencies in his speech:






“There are 15,000 or 20,000 tokens in this space. These are not traded as currency. Without prejudging any of them, they generally have a group of entrepreneurs, and the public looks at whitepapers, looks at websites, looks at these groups of entrepreneurs, and invests based on these groups of entrepreneurs. So this fits the classic Supreme Court test of what a security is.

“Not all crypto tokens are securities, but again, without prejudice, I believe most are.”

The True Value of Web3: You Can Take Your Toys and Leave

This is why Web3 people are always banging on about the importance of digital property rights. Without property rights on the internet, users become shackled to the Web2 platforms that amass them. When everything they’ve created and achieved, and even the community to which they belong, is owned by the platform, it’s not as simple as just picking up, moving on, and starting anew. In fact, the more value the creator creates on Roblox, the harder it gets for them to leave. It is a poignant example of the injustices of centralization online and the need for a more equitable internet that affords all users the right to take their shit and leave, if they want.

Pundit Predicts A Spot Solana ETF Approval After Ethereum ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
As the cryptocurrency community eagerly anticipates the potential approval of Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Matrixport co-founder Daniel Yang has ignited speculation about Solana (SOL) being the next in line for such investment products.



Yang’s remarks come amid heightened interest in cryptocurrency ETFs following recent regulatory developments.



On Tuesday, May 21, Yang highlighted the significant impact of reports suggesting that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested issuers to update Form 19b-4 in their product applications. Notably, following these reports, he pointed out the surge in the Ethereum to Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair, indicating market optimism surrounding ETF approvals and expressing hope of seeing a SOL ETF soon after Ether’s.



“What’s the trade, if ETH ETF really get approved in two days?…. A better trade I will argue for is: “BUY SOL/ETH.” This may sound absurd and definitely unpopular. Reasons are: 1) SOL will be the No.1 next in line if ETH ETF get approved.” Wrote Yang.



Elsewhere, analysts, including one identified as ‘Gumshoe,’ also view the approval of Ethereum-based instruments as potentially more advantageous for Solana than for Ethereum itself. Earlier this week, the pundit argued that a rejection could make Ethereum less appealing while enhancing Solana’s attractiveness as an investment option.

&nbsp



Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency community is concerned about the broader implications of ETF approval processes. Should any ETF applications be rejected, it could deliver a significant blow to the sector, prompting what one observer likened to a “nuclear strike” on market sentiment.



Industry experts have outlined bullish scenarios for Solana’s price trajectory. Ryan McMillin, investment director at Merkle Tree Capital, predicts a rise in Solana’s value to $400 by November 2024, citing a potential catalyst in meme coins related to the upcoming US election campaign.



Echoing this sentiment, Daniel Chung, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, anticipates Solana will revisit $200 by the end of May. These projections reflect a positive outlook on Solana’s fundamentals and positioning within the broader cryptocurrency landscape.



Moreover, Solana’s technological prowess has not gone unnoticed, with CoinGecko analysts recognizing its network as the fastest among major blockchains. Notably, on April 6, the Solana network achieved a record-high average daily transaction throughput of 1,504, further solidifying its status as a leading blockchain platform. Analysts from The Digital Asset Fund Manager Survey also highlighted how institutional demand for the crypto asset had soared in the same month, underscoring their bullish outlook.



That said, as anticipation builds around the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, all eyes are now turning to Solana, poised to capitalize on the momentum generated by its predecessor. Whether Solana will follow in Ethereum’s footsteps remains to be seen, but market sentiment suggests that the cryptocurrency’s future is brimming with potential.



At press time, Solana was trading at $171, reflecting a 4.28% drop over the past 24 hours. However, the coin surged nearly 9% over the past week, with a market capitalization of $77 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Can Ethereum Trust Its Own? Researchers' Side Deals Raise Transparency Concerns


								The Ethereum (ETH) community is in a tizzy after two prominent researchers from the Ethereum Foundation, Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist, disclosed their involvement with EigenLayer. This restaking protocol has emerged as a potential game-changer in the Ethereum ecosystem, but the researchers’ lucrative advisory roles have ignited concerns about conflicts of interest.

Transparency Or Self-Serving? The Disclosure Debate
The drama unfolded on a social media platform formerly known as Twitter (X). Drake, on May 18th, announced his advisory position at EigenLayer, emphasizing transparency and the importance of the community being informed.


He even went a step further, pledging to reinvest all proceeds from the role back into the Ethereum ecosystem. This move, some argue, demonstrates a commitment to maintaining neutrality.


However, Feist’s disclosure on May 19th lacked a similar commitment. While he clarified his role is personal and independent of the Ethereum Foundation, there was no mention of reinvesting his “significant amount” of Eigen tokens. This asymmetry has fueled speculation about the true motivations behind these involvements.
Crypto Twitter Erupts
The disclosures stirred crypto Twitterverse. Influential crypto trader Jordan Fish, known as Cobie, wasted no time in firing off a tweet directed at Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.
Ethereum is now trading at $3,923. Chart: TradingView
The tweet questioned the ethical implications of such arrangements. Can researchers working for the very foundation of a blockchain receive significant compensation from projects built on that blockchain, especially when those projects might have goals that conflict with the core values of the original platform?
While Buterin remained silent on the issue, the question resonated deeply within the community. The potential for financial gain to influence research objectivity is a major concern in any field, and blockchain is no exception.
Trust And Innovation In The Wild West Of DeFi
The Ethereum Foundation and the involved researchers have yet to provide further comment. This silence adds fuel to the fire of suspicion. However, the situation also highlights the ongoing struggle to maintain trust and transparency within the rapidly evolving world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

On the one hand, fostering innovation is crucial for the continued growth and development of the Ethereum ecosystem. EigenLayer, with its restaking capabilities, could unlock new possibilities for the platform.
On the other hand, ensuring the integrity of research and development is paramount. If researchers are swayed by financial incentives from projects with potentially conflicting goals, the entire ecosystem could be compromised.
The coming days and weeks will be crucial for the Ethereum Foundation. How they address these concerns and navigate this ethical tightrope will determine whether this episode remains a bump in the road or a turning point for trust within the Ethereum community.

USDD partners ignore HTX danger


USDD is a massive stablecoin that describes itself as ‘algorithmic’ and has a market capitalization of approximately $730 million. However, despite this size and seeming importance, it has a variety of issues, from its design to its reserves and its partners.
Changes to USDD
When USDD was launched, it was intended to inherit an algorithmic design reminiscent of the Luna-Terra system. The original whitepaper described how, by the end of 2022, Tron version 5.0 was going to be released, which would integrate USDD minting and redemption directly into the core of the protocol. However, as of press Tron version 5.0 has yet to be released. 
This version was meant to actually ‘burn’ the tron (TRX) used to issue new USDD; currently, the TRX that is ‘burned’ isn’t burned but instead held in a wallet and counted as collateral for the token.
Following the collapse of the Luna-Terra system, more recent whitepapers for USDD no longer mention being integrated into the core of Tron in this way. Additionally, USDD currently has no documented mechanism to redeem USDD.
Protos has reached out to Tron Network and USDD to see when version 5.0 will be released and whether or not it will integrate USDD in the manner described in the original USDD whitepaper. 
Is it even a DAO?
USDD is managed by the Tron DAO Reserve (TDR), which you would assume is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), but unfortunately, it doesn’t meaningfully fulfill that role. 
The governance page shows only a single proposal in the entire history of this protocol. This proposal allowed for the TDR to use the ‘burned’ TRX, despite that appearing to be inconsistent with what the word ‘burned’ means. 
There are no proposals that describe how the reserves are held, no proposals that explain why the direction of the protocol has changed, and no proposals that explain why certain partners have been added or removed for TDR. 
Does HTX have the funds it is supposed to?
USDD lists TZ1SsapyhKNWaVLca6P2qgVzkHTdk6nkXa as one of the addresses that hold the collateral for USDD. This address holds approximately 972 million TRX, worth approximately $120 million. It is also important to note that almost all of these tokens are staked. These funds, which are nominally managed by TDR, are also included in the HTX proof-of-reserves, which suggests that they’re currently held at HTX. 
There are no governance proposals that explain why these funds are being held in this way. Protos reached out to HTX and TDR but they didn’t provide clarification on why these funds are held in this way. HTX did claim that “the platform has never had any security incidents in the past 10 years,” despite this not being true. When asked for clarification about the previously disclosed security incidents, HTX reiterated that no security incidents had occurred. 

Issues with partners
USDD relies on the partners in the TDR to manage issuance of the token, a role that has become more important as USDD has seemingly abandoned its goal of integrating issuance directly into the core of Tron.
Alameda Research, the now-bankrupt trading firm that was embezzling billions of dollars worth of customer funds from FTX and was owned by financial criminal Sam Bankman-Fried, was just one of the partners for this product who have experienced significant issues. 
Justin Sun, an ‘advisor’ to HTX and a frequent promoter of USDD, owns Poloniex, an exchange that is one of the other partners. Poloniex has yet to finish a promised proof-of-reserves and has refused to disclose the reserves for its WBTC on Tron product, a significant portion of the ‘bitcoin’ on HTX.

Multichain was a bridge before it was hacked, its chief exec was arrested, and the remainder of the team has lost access to the web presence and most of the other materials. Despite these issues, it’s still listed on the USDD website.
TPS Capital (also known as Tai Ping Shan) is listed as a partner, despite its website no longer being available. TPS Capital was an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk that was deeply connected to Three Arrows Capital. 
FalconX is listed as a partner and also recently settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over charges of failure to register as a futures commission merchant. 
Other partners include Mirana Ventures, Amber Group, and Ankr. 
Protos has reached out to all of the current partners except for TPS Capital and Multichain to determine if they are concerned about collateral for USDD being stored at HTX and whether or not they participated in any type of governance process to choose to store the assets there. At time of publication, none of them have responded.

Bitcoin Price Drop Below $70,000 Apparently Driven By Lack Of Interest, Glassnode Data Shows


																On-chain analytics platform Glassnode has provided insights into why the Bitcoin price recently dropped below $70,000. The platform suggested that the flagship isn’t yet seeing enough demand, which could send its price to new highs. 
Demand For Bitcoin Is Still Modest
In one of its latest market reports, Glassnode mentioned that “the rate at which new capital is flowing into the Bitcoin network has slowed down considerably from its peak.” They made this assertion based on the Realized Cap metric, which measures the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was traded. Glassnode claimed that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap is currently at $574 billion.

Source: Glassnode
The platform further revealed that the injection of liquidity into Bitcoin has cooled off since the flagship crypto hit an all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. This is in stark contrast to the period before Bitcoin hit that ATH, with Glassnode noting that the flows into Bitcoin back then were “extremely sharp, culminating at a value of $3.38 billion daily.”
Meanwhile, Glassnode stated that the Realized Cap “remains in positive profit-dominated territory and is returning towards an equilibrium position.” However, they noted that Bitcoin’s modest demand was still able to spark this recent rally thanks to the “declining sell-side headwinds from mature investors.”
Basically, Glassnode suggested that things were looking up for Bitcoin but that it could be way better if there were more capital inflows. There could indeed be an increase in capital inflows soon enough, considering that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have broken their streak of net outflows and are once again recording impressive net inflows into their funds. 
Data from Farside Investors shows that these funds have already seen almost $700 million in net inflows this week. Specifically, these Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of $305.7 million on May 21 alone. That day was also BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) most profitable day yet, with the fund taking in $290 million. 
Some Positive Key Takeaways
Glassnode also assessed some other vital on-chain metrics, which provided some positives for Bitcoin’s future trajectory. The platform noted that there has been a “large decline” in Bitcoin’s Sell-Side Risk Ratio, which “suggests the market has found a degree of equilibrium over the course of this correction.”
Source: Glassnode
To assess market volatility, they also measured the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 60 days. They concluded that “volatility continues to compress to levels typically seen after lengthy consolidations and prior to large market moves.”

Meanwhile, Glasnode revealed that 2.14M BTC out of the Short-term holder (STH) supply, currently at 3.36M BTC, fell into an unrealized loss following the recent market correction. They claim that this suggests that many of the BTC held by this category of investors are held at an unrealized loss, which reduces the risk of top-heaviness developing.

Expert Warns: Sell Your Ethereum (ETH) Now Before It's Too Late - Here’s Why


								As the crypto world anticipates the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s decision on spot Ethereum ETFs, Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption firm Jan3, has voiced skepticism about the potential of Ethereum-based ETFs compared to Bitcoin.
He argues that the imminent approval of these funds is not necessarily a bullish signal for Ethereum, predicting that they will “massively underperform” compared to Bitcoin ETFs.

Mow’s Call: Why Ethereum Holders Shoud Probably Cash Out Now
Diving deeper into the Bitcoin advocate remarks, Mow suggests that this period may be the last opportunity for Ethereum holders to sell their holdings at a favorable price relative to Bitcoin.
He points to the lack of staking rewards and the lower demand for Ethereum in various markets as reasons for his stance. According to Mow, “This is the last chance to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC.”

The majority echoed his sentiments in the comments of Mow’s posts, which were restricted to only his followers or people he mentioned. A user named ‘VeteranHODL’ suggested that Ethereum ETFs might become the “biggest sell the news event this year,” Mow agreed, stating: “Many.”
Another commenter, ‘Satu Madu,’ speculated that these ETFs could divert funds from Bitcoin ETFs, a theory Mow dismissed by citing the lack of significant Ethereum accumulation by major institutional investors like MicroStrategy.

Meanwhile, Ethereum’s market performance has been strong so far, with a nearly 30% increase over the past week and a 2.9% rise in the last 24 hours alone, bringing its price to $3,792. This rise comes amidst speculation and investor interest in the outcome of the SEC’s pending decision on Ethereum spot ETFs.

Insights Into Bitcoin Spot ETFs
On the other side of the crypto ETF spectrum, Bitcoin spot ETFs have seen significant inflows, indicating strong investor interest. According to SoSoValue data, the net inflow reached a record $154 million on May 22, marking the eighth consecutive net inflow.
Among the various Bitcoin spot ETFs, BlackRock’s IBIT saw the highest net inflow for the day at $91.95 million, bringing its total to $16.08 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC also showed strong performance with a daily net inflow of $74.57 million, culminating in $8.65 billion.
In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC experienced a net outflow of $16.09 million, contributing to its total historical net outflow of $17.63 billion, indicating a divergent investor sentiment within the sector.

Bitcoin spot ETFs‘ total net asset value has reached $59.20 billion, with a net asset ratio of 4.33%. The cumulative net inflow now stands at $13.33 billion, reflecting the growing confidence and sustained interest in Bitcoin through these investment vehicles.

Comparing Bitcoin ETFs and Direct Bitcoin Ownership: A Guide for Financial Advisors

In both cases, owning the underlying asset enables full portability, 24/7 liquidity, and the ability to do things on Bitcoin or Ethereum crypto rails (namely global payments, Decentralized Finance, and more). However, the ETH ETF now introduces a key aspect that advisors should consider. Unlike bitcoin, ether can become a yield-bearing asset by staking it to help secure the Ethereum network. It is very unlikely that the first ETH ETFs offer any staking rewards to investors for a number of regulatory and operational reasons of the issuers. Today, owning and holding ether directly (and for that matter, any other yield-bearing digital asset) is the only way to access these staking rewards, so advisors should consider this when talking to clients about Ether. These staking rewards become income-generating opportunities that investors with considerable ETH exposure should, at the very least, consider, or at the very least, understand that they are leaving on the table if they only hold the asset in ETF form.

Cryptocurrency Market Sheds Over $100 Billion Ahead of SEC's Decision on Spot Ether ETF | Cryptoglobe


                                
The cryptocurrency space has lost over $100 billion in market capitalization ahead of an expected decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) application from VanEck.



Much like the spotlight that shone on Bitcoin earlier this year, the pre-decision volatility has already set in, causing the significant price fluctuations across the market, with BTC itself dropping from over $71,000 to little over $68,000 at the time of writing.



The price of Ethereum’s Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization that earlier this week saw a 20% surge in a single day after the SEC abruptly asked he exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.



VanEck’s Ethereum ETF has faced its fair share of delays and amendments. Today, its 19b-4 form, a crucial document for regulatory approval, reaches its deadline for the SEC’s verdict, with the securities regulator having to decide whether to greenlight the investment vehicle or reject it.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst Eric Banchunas has predicted that the SEC’s decision is set to come a few hours from now at around the same time of day it approved spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January.







The market’s volatility has exacted a toll as over $220 million in liquidations occurred today alone, affecting traders who had taken on excessive leverage ahead of the decision, with the market seemingly confident as ETH is up 1.8% over the last 24 hours, outperforming BTC’s 3% drop.



Other major cryptocurrency also dropped, as BNB is down 4% to less than $600 a coin, and SOL dropped 4.5% to $172. DOGE, ADA, AVAX, and SHIB are among other tokens that saw dropped between 2.5% and 5.7%.

Expecting a Rally in Ethereum, Bernstein Analysts Pointed to This Altcoin for After ETF Approval! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While there are only hours left for the Spot Ethereum ETF decision, a remarkable report came from Bernstein analysts.
According to Coindesk, Bernstein analysts stated that the possible ETH ETF approval would be a very important turning point for both ETH and the cryptocurrency industry.


At this point, analysts think that the approval of a spot ETH ETF in the USA will be an important move for crypto industry regulations, and said that this approval will increase the expectations for ETH rival Solana to be classified as a commodity.
Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra stated that the Biden administration may soften its stance on cryptocurrencies ahead of the Presidential elections in November and said:






“Longer term, if Trump is elected, we believe crypto could see significant legislative and institutional support (along with a new SEC chairman) that would lead to long-lasting structural changes in crypto financial integration.
Additionally, a possible Ethereum ETF approval would set a precedent for Ethereum, the first blockchain asset other than Bitcoin, to be considered a commodity.
This would raise hopes for Ethereum's peers (possibly Solana) to follow suit. As a result, the chances of altcoins like SOL being accepted as securities will increase.”

Bernstein analysts also predicted that the ETH price would rise 75% to $6,600 following a possible Ethereum ETF approval.

No, a Sponsored Labeled Crypto Press Release Is Not An Alternative to Editorial Coverage

With these services, press releases are generally just "syndicated", meaning that, although they will indeed be published by dozens of news sites, including crypto-focused ones, they'll often end up published in a non-editorial “backyard” section of the website that gets a lot less eyeballs. The actual content will just be a duplicated version of the original press release, with no editorial review, no analysis, no opinions or unique interpretation of what's happening. Just a sponsored labeled press release, with a regulatory requirement to disclose that it's basically just a paid ad, which generates neither the credibility or trust projects are seeking.

Legendary Trader John Bollinger Shares Take on ETH Price as ETF Decision Nears

As the cryptocurrency community anticipates the upcoming decision on Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), legendary trader John Bollinger's latest take on the ETH market has garnered significant attention. John Bollinger, a technical analyst, is renowned for creating the Bollinger Bands — a popular technical analysis tool.In a tweet, Bollinger stated that he has made multiple inquiries concerning Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ticker ETHE). In recent days, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust has been a prominent indicator, fueling anticipation about Ethereum ETF approval.  Grayscale Investments hopes to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE) to an ETF if the SEC approves it. As speculation increased, the fund's discount to its underlying Ethereum holdings fell to less than 7% from 20.5% on Friday and up to 56% last year, according to Bloomberg. A similar pattern was observed in January before the SEC approved the conversion of Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust. While expectations continue for potential SEC approval, Bollinger feels that the market has already priced in most of the news regarding the Ethereum ETF, and the resultant discount, which is thought to be in the context of Grayscale's ETHE, is largely gone.With the news accounted for, Bollinger perceives that the current market move is overextended, indicating that the price may have reached a peak that could be followed by a correction. Owing to this inference, the Bollinger Bands creator said in a tweet, which he tagged ETHUSD and ETHBTC, that he had trimmed his position.Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has risen more than 29% this week and was trading up 3.92% in the last 24 hours to $3,873 at press time.As the market anticipates the Ethereum ETF decision, sentiment is a mix of optimism and caution. While the potential approval of an ETF could boost ETH prices, the latest take from the Bollinger Bands creator might suggest caution due to the possibility of a "sell-the-news" event, where prices drop after the announcement due to investors taking profits.

Bybit Fights FUD with Proof of Reserves, Unveils New P2P Program


							

Bybit CEO Ben Zhou dismissed insolvency and hacking rumors.



Independent examinations affirmed the security of funds.



Bybit launched its Global P2P Ranger Recruitment program.




Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, recently addressed and dispelled rumors that the exchange has been breached and is insolvent. These rumors were primarily fueled by a glitch in Arkham Intelligence’s Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) graph, which caused it to display empty Bybit wallets. This news triggered panic among market participants as it gained momentum on X (formerly Twitter). However, independent examinations showed that funds contained in the platform were secure and unaffected..



Taking to his X account, Zhou cleared the air regarding the insolvency and hacking claims, saying, “Hearing some rumours about Bybit being insolvent or hacked and etc. Please note that we have updated our POR this month as well as you can view all Bybit wallet through Nansen (Total more than 11B) . None of the rumours that I have see so far have any real facts supporting it, Please be aware.”



Zhou also shared a link confirming that Bybit holds over 100% of user assets and the exchange can fulfill all withdrawal requests.



The Nansen data showed Bybit’s wallets containing over $11 billion in crypto assets. This figure represents the token aggregate in Bybit’s addresses per the reported data. Nonetheless, Nansen noted that the data does not represent an absolute assertion of Bybit’s assets or reserves.



In a separate development, Bybit has announced its Global P2P Ranger Recruitment program. The initiative aims to encourage a vibrant P2P trading ecosystem, with incentives tied to monthly performance. According to reports from Yahoo Finance, the initiative will provide crypto enthusiasts with a monthly reward of 1,000 USDT.









The program’s requirement states that interested individuals should be passionate about cryptocurrency and P2P trading, in addition to having a weekly availability of 25 hours. Other conditions include English proficiency, with fluency in other languages viewed as a plus.



Furthermore, qualified candidates will be rewarded based on their active engagement and community support. Bybit’s team will review applications and extend invitations to eligible candidates to join the platform’s global network and contribute to enhancing the P2P trading experience.

                        Know-your-customer (KYC) solutions are becoming increasingly important for crypto companies, financial services firms, and institutions. Grand View Research found that the global KYC software market size was valued at $2.93 billion in 2021. The number is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.8% over the next six years.Grand View Research’s report further noted the growth of the KYC market, which can be attributed to the importance of compliance management and the rising number of identity-related frauds in financial institutions. The rise of deep fakes and artificial intelligence (AI) related scams is also leading to greater KYC adoption. The Problem With Traditional KYC Solutions
While KYC is an important requirement, the process is often a burden for both users and businesses. Riley Hughes, Co-founder and CEO of digital identity startup Trinsic, told Cryptonews that users undergoing KYC typically have to provide a photo of themselves, along with an identification document. As KYC becomes more common, Hughes pointed out that users typically have to repeat this process multiple times.“A person will likely have to perform KYC about ten different times across multiple apps and platforms,” said Hughes. “But statistics show that asking users to verify themselves using a photograph of a plastic ID card results in as much as 40% drop-off.”Vishal Kapoor, Chief Operating Officer of blockchain technology firm Chia Network, further told Cryptonews that KYC is expensive to implement. A recent article from Betanews mentioned that KYC measures amount to 40% of all anti-money laundering (AML) compliance costs, totaling $5.7 million yearly for banks.Reusable KYC Gains Traction
Given these challenges, reusable KYC solutions have started to gain traction. “Reusable identification, or KYC, allows users to leverage past verification instead of having to re-verify themselves across platforms,” said Hughes. To put this in perspective, Hughes explained that Trinsic recently launched an “identity acceptance network” that enables reusable KYC.“Businesses can now use Trinsic to verify 60,800,000 people 10 times faster than a from-scratch identity verification, while also reducing fraud,” he said.Hughes explained that businesses including CLEAR – the technology company that operates biometric travel document verification at major airports – along with others, have partnered with Trinsic as part of the identity acceptance network. “The objective behind this network is to get users KYC verified as fast as possible to meet the business risk threshold,” he said. “If users have already been verified by a business in the network, we try to route other businesses in the network to that verification.”For example, if a CLEAR user possesses a CLEAR verification, they may use this again for other platforms within the identity acceptance network. Blockchain for Reusable KYC
While reusable KYC solutions can save users and businesses time and money, adding blockchain to the mix enables users to own their personal information and data. For example, identity technology company Dentity is part of Trinsic’s identity acceptance network. Dentity CEO Jeffrey Schwartz told Cryptonews that the platform stores users’ credentials on the Bitcoin blockchain. “We store decentralized identifiers (DIDs) on-chain to verify the authenticity of issuers,” said Schwartz. “The only thing that needs to be on-chain is what is required to verify a credential.”Chia Network is also doing this. According to Kapoor, Chia’s verifiable credentials (VCs) allow a KYC provider to perform KYC by issuing a verifiable credentials token on-chain. “This enables service providers, such as Dapps, to verify that a user has undergone KYC verification with a trusted KYC provider — without requiring the user to reveal any personal information,” he said. Kapoor explained that people are seeking better protection of their personal information as identity scams rise. Panda Security statistics show that over 10 billion personal records have been exposed globally due to data breaches since March 2020.“Using VCs and DIDs on-chain, the individual can custody their own VC and decide to whom it can or should be shared, without risk of oversharing or data exposure,” Kapoor mentioned. “This also decreases the external touchpoints with their sensitive personal information.”Blockchain Protects User Data
While it’s notable that reusable KYC is gaining traction, a number of concerns linger. For instance, a recent Reuters article pointed out that criminals can still quickly exploit automated KYC checks, putting a user’s information at risk. Storing data on-chain seeks to solve this problem. For example, Deloitte Switzerland began issuing reusable KYC credentials last year to enable access to global fundraising of digital assets. Polimec, a decentralized funding protocol developed on Polkadot, has partnered with Deloitte Switzerland to enable this feature. Luca von Wyttenbach, the co-founder of Polimec, told Cryptonews that a KYC credential enables users to establish a digital self-sovereign identity by validating their data once they have had Deloitte.“After Deloitte has issued a KYC Credential, which is kept under a user’s control, they will be able to use it with different online services, the first being Polimec,” said Wyttenbach.He added that the website or service provider can rely on the shared data since it has been approved and certified by Deloitte. “This means that users only have to share the minimum necessary data about themselves,” he remarked. Wyttenbach further explained that Deloitte’s KYC credentials are anchored on the KILT Protocol. He noted that Deloitte conducts customers’ KYC and is the only party receiving and storing that data. Next, the data is created into a KYC Credential, which is hashed and stored in the user’s Deloitte wallet. “The hash is anchored on KILT, meaning that no personal information is stored on-chain. Users get to verify their data against the hash by presenting their credentials,” Wyttenbach said. “ In short, the credentials are pseudonymous – hence, all transactions and network participants on Polimec can be processed in a regulatory compliant and secure manner while preserving data privacy.”Challenges May Hamper Adoption
While reusable KYC solutions on the blockchain are currently being used, challenges are still present. For instance, Julian Leitloff, Co-founder of the decentralized identity platform idOS Network, told Cryptonews that encouraging widespread adoption of reusable KYC solutions among users and service providers is a major hurdle.Echoing this, Schwartz remarked that Trinsic’s Identity Acceptance Network requires collaboration. “The idea behind this is that we all share user credentials,” he said. “I hope this collaboration will allow us to achieve that, but interoperability is key here.”Hughes is aware of this challenge. He shared that Trinsic’s Identity Acceptance Network currently covers over 60 million users, yet he believes that the platform needs to move forward aggressively. “Everyone in the EU will soon have access to a digital identity wallet,” said Hughes. “We will need to implement the same standards moving forward.”In addition, Leitloff pointed out that another major challenge around reusable KYC includes ensuring privacy and data security. “As user data must remain private and secure even when shared across multiple platforms,” he said.To address these challenges, Leitloff explained that idOS is implementing advanced encryption techniques such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to protect user data. “Promoting the use of standardized identity formats like W3C Verifiable Credentials ensures consistency and interoperability,” he said. “Utilizing decentralized storage networks will also enable data availability and reduce the risk of centralized points of failure.”

F1 Legend Michael Schumacher's Family Wins Lawsuit Over Faked AI Interview - Decrypt

The family of Formula 1 racing legend Michael Schumacher has won its lawsuit against the German weekly magazine Die Aktuelle, the Associated Press reported on Thursday. The lawsuit stemmed from a 2023 article that used generative AI to create an “interview” with the seven-time champion.According to the Associated Press, the Schumacher family was awarded the equivalent of $217,000, with the publisher of Die Aktuelle, Funke, issuing an apology last year after the AI-generated interview came to light.In April 2023, Die Aktuelle published a magazine edition with the front cover featuring a photograph of a smiling Schumacher with the headline, “Michael Schumacher, the first interview.” The interview however, was not conducted with Schumacher—but rather was created using the neutral language chatbot platform, Character AI.The Schumacher family has guarded the racing star’s privacy after he suffered a severe brain injury in 2013. Prior to his injury, Schumacher won 91 races and seven championships in a career that spanned from 1991 to 2012.The use of generative AI to create fake versions of celebrities and high-profile individuals remains a hot-button issue. On Monday, OpenAI removed ChatGPT’s ability to speak after one of the voices, “Sky,” was accused of sounding like actress Scarlett Johansson, who starred in the 2013 AI-themed film “Her.”"We've heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky. We are working to pause the use of Sky while we address them," OpenAI said in a statement. Johansson said that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously approached her about voicing a chatbot, ahead of the alleged impersonation.On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission proposed a rule that political ads should be required to disclose if they use AI-generated content ahead of the 2024 U.S. elections in November.Edited by Andrew HaywardGenerally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Crypto engagement dropped to 7% among US adults in 2023, Fed finds


A Federal Reserve survey has indicated a decrease in cryptocurrency engagement among American adults, with only 7% reportedly using or holding digital assets in 2023. 



The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), conducted in October 2023, revealed that the number of adults involved with cryptocurrency fell to 18 million, down from 10% in 2022 and 12% in 2021. 



The survey also found that a mere 1% of adults used crypto for financial transactions, representing a 50% reduction from the previous year. 



Despite the observed decline in cryptocurrency usage, the digital asset industry continues to exert influence in other domains, such as politics.  

	
	
	
	


Public opinion surveys indicate that American voters expect presidential candidates to have a grasp of emerging technologies, including AI and cryptocurrency. 



According to Coinbase, California’s crypto owners have the potential to affect the outcome of the 2024 elections



Although the Fed’s findings suggest a waning interest in cryptocurrencies as both an investment option and a transactional medium, it’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency market has flipped the switch this year.



In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds after denying the financial instrument for a decase.

	
	
	

	


By the end of October 2023, the cryptocurrency market was valued at around US$1.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.



That value has more than doubled and the market cap of the industry is estimated at US$2.675 trillion, as of May 23.

Gala Says Hacker Has Returned Over $20,000,000, Plans To Reimburse Users Affected by the Exploit - The Daily Hodl


								Blockchain-based gaming platform Gala (GALA) says it recovered over $20 million worth of crypto assets that were stolen during a security breach earlier this week.
In a statement, Gala says that a hacker initiated a transfer of $200 million in Gala tokens on May 20th, but the monitoring system flagged the suspicious activity, which allowed the platform to freeze the tokens and blocklist the unauthorized wallet.










“This was an isolated incident on the Ethereum network, and our immediate response was to activate GalaChain’s blocklist protocol, swiftly halting any further unauthorized minting and movement of GALA and effectively mitigating the incident.”
The platform says 90% of the illicitly minted GALA have been locked and a new Founder’s Node ecosystem governance vote will decide if the blocklisted tokens will be considered burned.
“We want to assure our community that the minting capabilities of GALA on GalaChain remain secure and uncompromised. Our internal controls and multi-sig security protocols are designed to protect against such incidents, and we are continuously enhancing them to stay ahead of potential threats.”
Gala credits its security team’s swift response and the involvement of law enforcement agencies in the return of the stolen crypto assets. The platform says it will also reimburse users who were affected by the exploit.
“Plans are already in place to make reimbursements to anyone who has been subjected to unreasonably high transactional fees associated with this incident.”

Coinbase accused of celebrating ‘Shitcoin Pizza Day’ with USDC promo


Bitcoin maxis have branded Coinbase an ‘enemy of Bitcoin’ and accused it of ‘cultural misappropriation’ after the crypto exchange decided to sell pizza with USDC on Bitcoin Pizza Day.
On May 22, Coinbase set up a pizza truck selling slices for $1 worth of USDC. Coinbase said it was “celebrating how far crypto has come since 2010 in helping to create a cheaper, faster system.”
However, some crypto enthusiasts weren’t impressed by the USDC pricing. Users on X (formerly Twitter) claimed the crypto exchange should be ‘ashamed,’ questioned why the truck wouldn’t accept bitcoin, and said Coinbase is behaving like a ‘bad actor.’

One attendee filmed themselves next to the Coinbase truck claiming, “The Bitcoin pizza guys are trying to beef with Coinbase.” One man can then be seen walking by with a sign that reads “It’s Bitcoin Pizza Day not Shitcoin Pizza Day.” 
Another passerby can be heard saying, “This is a cultural misappropriation of bitcoin.” Additionally, someone claiming to be a core contributor to BTCPay Server was also pictured behind the Coinbase Pizza truck holding the same ‘Shitcoin Pizza Day’ sign.

However, others were skeptical of the protests, with one user noting, “Bro it’s such a good marketing ploy. No one is organically counter-protesting a Coinbase pizza truck.  I’m like 99.9% that this is a publicity stunt.” 
Another joked, “Bro said cultural misappropriation lmao bitcoiners are down SO BAD.”
Bitcoin Pizza Day started in 2010 and marks the first-ever ‘real-world’ bitcoin transaction when Laszlo Hanyecz paid someone 10,000 BTC to order two Papa John’s pizzas. That figure would be worth just under $700 million today. 
Papa John’s frequently celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day but was criticized by the UK’s advertising watchdog in 2021 for trivializing crypto investing.

What Ethereum ETF Approvals Would Mean for US Crypto Policy - Decrypt

When the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated earlier this week that it was suddenly open to the prospect of approving spot Ethereum ETFs, after months of stubborn signals to the contrary, the about-face didn’t just catch Crypto Twitter by surprise.It also shocked the nation’s top crypto lobbyists, who spend their days tracing minuscule shifts in Washington’s mood on the industry. “It is a remarkable pivot,” Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a prominent crypto lobbying group, told Decrypt. “It is one that I did not foresee.”How did the pivot come to pass? And after years of relentless hostility against the crypto industry, might the development indicate that the SEC, and the U.S. government more broadly, are changing their tune on crypto?“I think we've absolutely turned a corner,” Smith said. “It marks a complete shift in understanding about the political importance of crypto.”Crypto industry lobbyists who spoke with Decrypt attribute the SEC’s sudden tack to a recent change of political winds in the nation’s capital. Most agree the series of events that prompted the change kicked off last week, when President Joe Biden issued a forceful threat to veto a pro-crypto bill. The bill, which sought to repeal an SEC rule dubbed SAB 121—which discourages American banks from holding crypto—later passed in the Senate with a surprising amount of support from Biden’s own party. Twelve Democrats supported the bill, including Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader. That degree of Democratic support was not anticipated on Capitol Hill. And it undoubtedly sent a message to the White House, the Blockchain Association’s Smith believes. “To have that many [Democrats] break away from the Biden Administration after it already put out a veto threat on it,” she said, “that is significant.”Exacerbating matters is the fact that, in recent weeks, Republicans including former president Donald Trump have begun embracing crypto more explicitly than ever before—creating the impression among crypto industry leaders that only one political party is on their side.Cody Carbone, Chief Policy Officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, another crypto lobbying group, believes the pressure recently applied by Republicans on crypto, in tandem with the open dissent Biden is now facing on the subject from leaders within his own party, led the president to make a calculated decision to back off crypto—at least for now. “The Administration is seeing, in a very tight election that can be swung by a few million votes, that this is not the hill to die on,” Carbone told Decrypt. That evolution in Biden’s thinking could already be seen Wednesday, when the president issued a statement regarding another crypto-related bill up for a vote this week—FIT21—which seeks to create a federal framework for regulating crypto. While Biden objected to the bill’s passage, he crucially did not threaten to veto it, as he did last week with the repeal of SAB 121. On Wednesday afternoon, FIT21 easily passed a vote in the House, 279-136, with support from 71 Democrats including former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.Ji Kim, chief legal and policy officer at lobbying group Crypto Council for Innovation, sees the events of the last week as proof that crypto has now—albeit suddenly— graduated into a topic of consensus within U.S. politics. “What this all means is that crypto is absolutely a bipartisan issue," he said, "and that members of Congress are further realizing crypto is absolutely here to stay."For the same reasons the White House is now tacking on crypto to save face, the SEC is too, crypto lobbyists say—especially given that the unexpectedly popular, bipartisan repeal of SAB 121 singled out the policies of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Rubber-stamping spot Ethereum ETFs—which would allow Wall Street firms to buy and store ETH on behalf of their clients—might prove the most visible way for Gensler to take some heat off his back, the Blockchain Association’s Kristin Smith estimates. “I think this is his sort of peace offering, to show that he is open to this space, and he realizes now that the political winds are against him,” she said. But crypto lobbyists disagree on what the move would mean for the SEC’s long-term crypto policy moving forward. Smith is optimistic the change of heart would mark a major shift in how Gensler and the SEC might police crypto from now on.   “I think he's going to have no choice but to back down,” she said of the SEC Chair. “That doesn't mean he goes back and undoes all the actions that he's initiated—but he's going to have to think twice before doing something aggressive against the crypto industry.”The Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Cody Carbone, however, has a less cheery outlook. He figures spot Ethereum ETF approvals would represent nothing more than a cold and calculated political maneuver on Gensler’s part. A meaningful change in the SEC’s outlook on crypto? Far from it.“I don't think you're going to see him dropping any of these cases or stop fighting,” Carbone said of Gensler. “I just don't think you'll see any more headlines. Most of his decisions are driven by PR.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Grayscale launches investments trusts for Stacks and Near Protocol - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Grayscale announced trusts for Near Protocol and Stacks.
Crypto market is upbeat ahead of a potentially huge announcement from the SEC on spot Ethereum ETF.

Grayscale Investments has announced two new investment trusts to provide for diversified crypto exposure – the Grayscale Near Trust and Grayscale Stacks Trust.
According to details of the announcement, the two products are similar to other single-asset investment trusts and are exclusively invested in Stacks (STX) and Near Protocol (NEAR).
“By creating distinctive solutions to address blockchain’s scalability challenges, Stacks and Near are poised to help foster greater adoption—ultimately helping to drive the crypto ecosystem forward,” Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Head of Product & Research at Grayscale, said in a statement.
Eligible individual and institutional accredited investors can now access daily subscriptions for the two trusts, Grayscale specified in the announcement.
Grayscale eyes approval for its spot ETH ETF
Grayscale is a leader in the crypto products space, with its spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) currently the largest by assets under management (AUM). The company is also among those eyeing an approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot Ethereum ETFs.
Like most other issuers, Grayscale submitted a revised 19b-4 filings for its spot Ether ETF. The platform joins BlackRock, Bitwise and other applicants in submitting the 19b-4s, with provisions for ETH staking removed.
The SEC is expected to approve the first spot Ethereum ETF for the US market, with an announcement highly anticipated on today. 
Analysts forecast that an approval could catalyse an explosive run for ETH and other altcoins.
STX and NEAR tokens could surge amid this bull run, with the Bitcoin Layer 2 protocol Stacks also likely toget impetus from Bitcoin’s anticipated rally.
Stacks price was at $2.01 while Near Protocol traded at $7.64.

Bybit CEO dispels insolvency rumors amid $115 million user withdrawals

Bybit crypto exchange CEO Ben Zhou has firmly denied rumors about the exchange’s alleged insolvency circulating on social media.This week, obscure social media accounts began spreading these rumors, with one user suggesting that a bug in a proof-of-reserves graph from Arkham Intelligence might have sparked the speculation.Zhou promptly dismissed these claims, stating they were baseless. He said:“None of the rumours that I have see so far have any real facts supporting it, please be aware.”The CEO reinforced his point by sharing the exchange’s Proof of Reserves, which showed Bybit’s assets across various wallets.The exchange’s Proof of Reserves website confirms that all assets are fully collateralized, with reserves exceeding 100%. Specifically, the reserve ratios for Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and USDC are 116%, 106%, 107%, and 129%, respectively.Furthermore, Nansen’s data shows that Bybit holds over $11.3 billion in assets. However, the dashboard included a disclaimer noting that it was not intended to be a comprehensive statement of Bybit’s actual reserves.0xngmi, the pseudonymous co-founder of DeFillama, also downplayed community concerns, pointing out that outflows from the platform as of May 22 were minor compared to its asset balance.Nonetheless, DeFillama’s CEX transparency dashboard showed that Bybit users had withdrawn $115 million in digital assets from the platform as of May 23. This was the second-highest amount of withdrawals during the reporting period among the centralized trading platforms monitored by the crypto analytics platform.Meanwhile, some community concerns are unsurprising, given that Bybit is facing a regulatory challenge in France. French authorities have warned crypto investors that Bybit is not registered as a digital asset provider in the country, adding that access to the platform’s website might be blocked.Moreover, the crypto community’s distrust of centralized exchanges has increased following the high-profile collapse of FTX in 2022. FTX, once one of the largest crypto platforms, collapsed after its leadership team was found to have misused customer funds. Its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was convicted on criminal charges in November 2023 and received a 24-year sentence in March.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

An Ethereum ETF Could Return 'Animal Spirits' To Crypto Reminiscent Of The 10x DOGE, SHIB Runs In 2021, Predicts Trader - Benzinga

In anticipation of a possible Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETF approval, crypto researcher The DeFi Villain stirred excitement by reminiscing about the unprecedented bull run and 2021 alt-season, suggesting that investors might need to prepare for similar market dynamics soon.What Happened: The DeFi Villian, aka VIKTOR, suggests "animal spirits" could soon reignite crypto markets if an Ethereum spot ETF gains approval. He recalls how Dogecoin DOGE/USD surged nearly 10x in a single day in January 2021, despite already having a billion-dollar market cap.Also, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD was swaying between a $3 and $4 billion valuation for four months. Later, it multiplied from $4 billion to a $40 billion valuation in less than a month.He also noted the significant growth witnessed in ThorChain RUNE/USD and Filecoin FIL/USD. Polkadot DOT/USD also had a notable run, climbing from a $5 billion market cap in December 2020 to $56 billion after an 8x increase over two months.Axie Infinity AXS/USD jumped from $200 million to $10 billion in five months, with an FDV peaking at $43 billion. The DeFi Villain emphasized that what seemed ludicrous in earlier bull runs can reoccur: BNB BNB/USD, for example, was already valued at $6 billion only to pump 8x in 20 days to reach a $50 billion market cap.Also Read: What Would Ethereum ETF Approval Mean For The Price Of ETH?Why It Matters: The DeFi Villain’s thread serves as a potent reminder of the magnitudes that altcoins can achieve during a bull run. With the looming possibility of an ETH ETF, the market could see a resurgence of these sensational price movements and a potential alt-season explosion.Warning traders to be prepared, he tweets "The final leg for meme coins is VERTICAL and BRUTAL."What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Dormant Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Whale Wallets Reactivated Ahead Of Spot Ethereum ETF DecisionThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Good News for Ripple (XRP) from Coinbase - Bitcoin Sistemi


Coinbase, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced the resumption of XRP trading in New York.
The announcement was made by Paul Greal, Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer, and Greal said: “XRP trading on Coinbase is available again in NY. We have listened and worked in strong partnership with the state. And now we can announce, we are back in business.” “


XRP trading has been restricted in New York since December 2020, when the New York Attorney General's Office filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs. This led to many cryptocurrency exchanges suspending XRP trading for New York residents.

However, New York residents looking to purchase XRP had to resort to using a cryptocurrency exchange registered with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and authorized to operate in the state. Some of these exchanges were Bitstamp, Bitfinex and Bittrex.





In a significant development last July, Coinbase, along with other exchanges, moved to relist the controversial token following a court ruling stating that secondary sales of XRP were not securities. Despite this, trade was not supported in New York until now.

Will Hong Kong Allow Staking Facility in Spot Ethereum ETFs?


Hong Kong is exploring the possibility of enabling staking services for Ethereuma-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
This initiative could position the Asian financial hub as a pioneer in the crypto investment market, notably diverging from the conservative US stance.
Can Staking Revive the Struggling Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong?

According to Bloomberg, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and various local ETF issuers are actively discussing integrating staking mechanisms into these financial products. Staking involves committing crypto holdings to support network operations, in return earning holders a potential yield. Specifically, Ethereum staking could yield about 4% annually.

“It would be a milestone for Hong Kong to add staking into spot-ETH ETFs,” Serra Wei, CEO of Aegis Custody said.

This development aligns with Hong Kong’s broader strategy to reaffirm its position as a leading global financial center. After experiencing political upheaval, city officials have proactively fostered a progressive digital asset environment. This initiative was marked last year by the establishment of a dedicated regulatory regime.
Despite these innovations, spot-crypto ETFs in Hong Kong have encountered tepid demand since their debut in April. According to data from SoSoValue, the total net assets of all Hong Kong spot Ethereum ETFs currently stand at approximately $50 million.

However, the potential introduction of staking options could enhance the attractiveness of these ETFs compared to direct crypto purchases on exchanges.
Contrastingly, in the United States, financial giants like Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Ark Investment Management have recently retreated from including staking features in their proposed Ethereum ETFs. Aimed at facilitating smoother regulatory approvals, these decisions could render the ETFs less appealing compared to other investment avenues offering higher yields through active crypto staking.

Moreover, Hong Kong’s ambition to establish itself as a crypto hub extends beyond ETFs. The region is also examining applications to expand its array of licensed digital-asset exchanges and is developing a framework for stablecoins. These cryptocurrencies aim to minimize price volatility by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as fiat currency.

Ether ETFs approval could drive 60% price increase, crypto firm says

Crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital has predicted a potential 60% increase in the price of Ether, projecting that it could surge around $6,000 if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves spot ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The crypto market is volatile right now, and all eyes are on the regulator, which will announce its decision this week.RFK Jr. investing in GameStop is hilarious, exec saysThe financial watchdog will decide whether to approve or deny Van Eck’s spot Ethereum ETF application on Thursday and the Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF application on Friday.The approval of the spot Ether ETF application would be a historic moment for the crypto industry, as financial giants have been waiting for it for years. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year boosted the crypto industry and market, with Bitcoin soaring by over 50% in less than a month.Meanwhile, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has listed Vaneck’s ETF on its website, indicating that approval and trading could begin as soon as possible. The DTCC provides post-trade clearance, settlement, custody, and information services.BlackRock, Bitwise, Grayscale, Van Eck, Ark 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin, and Invesco have amended their 19b-4 filings with the SEC to remove provisions for staking. By doing this, these financial companies hope to obtain approval more easily. The 19b-4 filings are documents that national exchanges like the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) submit to the SEC to request approval for listing new products on their trading platforms.Experts are optimistic that the SEC will make a favorable decision regarding the Ether ETFs. Earlier this week, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their approval odds for Ethereum ETFs from 25% to 75%. Balchunas posted on X that the SEC “could be doing a 180” due to increasing political pressure. Crypto has emerged as a significant political topic in this election year, with presidential candidate Donald Trump making several pro-crypto statements while campaigning in May. Moreover, President Joe Biden is also taking a pro-crypto stance to garner support from the crypto community.On Thursday mid-morning, Bitcoin was trading at $68,000, with a nearly 2.5% loss, while Ether was hovering around $3,800, more than a 1.9% gain, according to CoinMartketCap.

Financial Leaders Warn of a Potential Hard Landing as Fed Weighs Options - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



As the U.S. economy continues to navigate a complex landscape with persistent inflation and a stock market setting new highs, the Federal Reserve seems committed to its patient approach regarding interest rate adjustments. Despite some encouraging signs of easing inflation, Fed officials have emphasized the need for more consistent data before considering any rate cuts.Some financial leaders have been speculating lately on the Federal Reserve’s future actions. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon speculates that the central bank might actually hike key interest rates this year, going against the market expectations of two rate cuts this year. 



Federal Reserve Officials Reiterate the Need to be Patient



Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, along with Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Susan Collins, have all expressed the importance of maintaining the current benchmark policy rate at 5.25%-5.50% until there is more definitive evidence of a sustained decline in inflation. While there is cautious optimism due to recent improvements, concerns persist about the potential for inflation to reaccelerate if rates are reduced prematurely.



Market participants anticipate potential rate cuts starting in September 2024, contingent on favorable inflation data. Traders are firming up expectations for a rate reduction in September, followed by another in December. However, some prominent figures, such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, have suggested that the Fed might still hike rates further or refrain from cutting rates in 2024, citing the economy’s resilience driven by government spending and investments in AI infrastructure.





US Inflation Still Above the Fed’s 2% Target Rate, Labour Market Showing Signs of Cooling



The Federal Reserve closely monitors various economic indicators to inform its decision-making process. Recent inflation data, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has shown some positive signs, with a 12-month increase of 3.4% ending in April. However, Fed officials require more months of data demonstrating a consistent decline toward the 2% target before considering policy changes.



The labor market has also been a key focus, with U.S. employers adding 175,000 jobs in April, a lower figure compared to previous months. This potentially signals a cooling labor market that could support the case for rate cuts. Additionally, the economy’s resilience is attributed to the lingering effects of fiscal and monetary stimulus, which drive liquidity and market activity. Improved business activity has raised doubts about the immediate necessity for rate cuts, suggesting that the economy might be able to handle current rates for an extended period.



Hard Landing and Stagflation Risks



Despite some positive economic indicators, financial leaders are concerned about the possibility of a “hard landing” for the U.S. economy. Jamie Dimon warned that stubborn inflation could lead to stagflation, characterized by high rates, recession, and declining corporate profits. Historical trends suggest that the second phase of controlling inflation could be more challenging and increase the risk of a hard landing.



Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser also highlighted the potential difficulties in managing the second phase of inflation, hinting at the challenges ahead. The cautious outlook among financial leaders reflects the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of the current economic trajectory without facing significant downturns.







Do you think we’ll see two rate cuts in 2024? Let us know in the comments below.

Altcoin That’s Exploded Over 1,100% in Three Months Set To Outperform Large-Cap Memecoins, Says Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto trader believes that one red-hot altcoin is set up to outperform other large-cap memecoins.
Pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,200 followers on the social media platform X that memecoin Pepe (PEPE) has more upside potential based on buyer demand and trading volume.










“If you’re looking for a big cap meme to long, I think PEPE is a good one. Good liquidity, strong volume, this one definitely catches up to the others a bit in my opinion. Not saying it’ll flip DOGE or anything but should go up more relatively. Long in the green boxes.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Pepe was trading at $0.0000011 on February 19th and is trading for $0.00001383 at time of writing, a gain of 1,157%.
Next up, the trader believes Ethereum (ETH) is heading past its all-time high (ATH) of around $5,000 if a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) is approved.
However, he warns ETH may retrace once it crosses $4,000, before continuing higher.
“ETH: I think we pullback briefly around $4,000 but this certainly breaks all-time highs if/when ETF gets approved. This still seems like a free trade for ETH going to ATH, which is at $5,000. Could be some bumps along the way but it seems inevitable.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Ethereum is trading for $3,811 at time of writing, up about 1% in the last 24 hours.
The trader also believes that ETH against Bitcoin (BTC) may have reached a market bottom at 0.049 BTC ($3,333) and could outperform the crypto king in the short term.
“ETH: is this the bottom? Hard to really say. We’ve been cucked for so long on this that it’s hard to call it. I think that it’s probably safest for most to just buy this on the way up versus trying to knife catch. ETH should outperform BTC, eventually (for a short period).”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
ETH/BTC is trading for 0.056 ($3,811) at time of writing, up 4.77% in the last 24 hours.

Grayscale, a leading asset manager, has expanded its product offerings and established two new investment trusts that will provide investors with exposure to the Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Stacks (STX) and Near Protocol (NEAR).
The new trusts will be limited to accredited investors and operate similarly to other private offerings offered by Grayscale. These trusts join a diverse portfolio of offerings for cryptocurrencies such as Solana, Chainlink and Decentraland.


“With the continued demand for diversified crypto asset exposure, Grayscale is committed to launching new products that enable investors to access emerging and emerging parts of the crypto ecosystem,” Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Head of Product and Research at Grayscale, said in a written statement.

“Within the Stacks ecosystem, we are witnessing a strong increase in demand from institutions across the board,” said Kyle Ellicott, Investor Relations Lead at Stacks. “As this wide gap in unlocking Bitcoin liquidity and making it more available continues to narrow, the larger Bitcoin ecosystem is seeing similar demand.” .” said.

Looming ETH ETF Deadline | Bankless


The moment of truth. Ethereum’s first final spot ETF approval deadline is today, but many crypto assets have dipped into the red ahead of this monumental decision. Was there anything to be gleaned from the early morning price action, and where does ETH go from here?Despite yesterday’s Nvidia earnings report beat and the announcement of a 10:1 NVDA stock split, which will theoretically bolster share attractiveness by slashing the purchase price from $1k to more retail-accessible levels of around $100, most assets are down on the day.Although the early morning dump could be interpreted to be a crypto-specific flush of the bulls overzealous on ETH ETF approval, the move lower came in conjunction with a leg down for broader risk markets that started at 5:30 AM PST and sent the S&P 500 falling nearly 1% off its pre-market highs.via TradingViewIn an attempt to predict what the future holds for the future trajectory of Ether price, many analysts have turned to the historical performance of the only other crypto asset to receive a spot ETF: Bitcoin.While approval odds for these two instruments have taken drastically different pathways, with the high consensus on spot BTC ETF approval for many months after BlackRock filed its application coming in stark contrast to the overwhelming spot ETH ETF denial sentiment exhibited throughout recent months, both assets experienced large pumps to kick off approval week as market participants attempted to frontrun the launch.Should history hold for a second time, Ether is due for a pump later today, considering that BTC ripped 6% just prior to the cash close of US markets at 1 PM PST (4 PM EST) after the SEC published an “order granting accelerated approval” of spot BTC ETFs, however, with market participants cognizant that spot BTC ETFs were not a near-term bullish catalyst, it is certainly possible that traders could fade approval.Bloomberg’s ETF analysts currently project that we should receive news on the SEC’s decision to approve or deny VanEck’s spot ETH ETF at a similar time today.via XFrom there, some amount of retracement could be expected before ETH rips to set new highs, until actual trading begins for the new spot products… As was the case in BTC’s approval process, it appears probable that all pending spot ETH ETF applications likely receive simultaneous approval and begin trading Friday, yet some analysts continue to maintain there could be one-off approvals or a lag in trading given what they perceive to be a sudden restart in the approval process.Unfortunately, beyond this point, history suggests that Ethereum will need to digest a substantial amount of redemptions from the $10B AUM Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which will likely weigh heavily on price in the coming weeks before subsiding and allowing for further upside.Optimistically, there may be no bleeding in the aftermath of ETF approval if months of depressed sentiment have made market participants too underweight on ETH, as potentially indicated by the multi-year lows at which the ETH/BTC ratio was trading at just last week. However, it will undoubtedly require a significant amount of net new inflows to ETH beyond ETFs to offset ETHE outflows.Of course, any possibility of near-term bullish pops presupposes that spot ETH ETFs will receive approval today; a denial may spell out the SEC’s rationale behind why Ether is a crypto asset security and wreak havoc on practically every token save BTC.When asked this morning for insight on the impending spot ETH ETF decision, SEC Chair Gary Gensler ominously advised investors to “stay tuned” and claimed his agency’s approval of spot BTC ETFs was only compelled by the DC Circuit Court’s decision in the Grayscale case.

                        The Floki Inu (FLOKI) price has stalled after hitting multi-week highs above $0.0002450 earlier this week, as holders dump FLOKI for a new ICO called 5thScape as the bet on securing 1,700%.FLOKI pushed above its 21 and 50DMAs earlier this month and has been trending higher now since the mid-April lows.Recent gains can be attributed to optimism that Ethereum ETFs might soon gain US approval.That could drive growth in Ethereum blockchain-issued meme coins like Floki.But the FLOKI price has fallen nearly 10% from its Tuesday highs amid a broad market sell-off on Thursday.The Floki price has fallen nearly 10% from its Tuesday highs amid a broad market sell-off on Thursday as investors turn to this new ICO.

With a market cap of just $2 billion, Floki has a lot of room to grow this bull market.The meme coin might even 5x to a market above $10 billion. Floki price predictions are likely to remain bullish.But for investors looking for a higher probability of even larger gains, they will need to find smaller, lesser-known coins.An often-overlooked way to find low-cap gems is via investing in presales.One presale that the team at Cryptonews are big fans of is exciting AR/VR project 5thScape (5SCAPE).Here’s why some think this new ICO could deliver 1,700% gains.Can This New ICO Deliver 1,700% Gains?
5thScape is a first-of-its-kind crypto-infused VR/AR ecosystem that will be powered by the versatile 5SCAPE token.Many expect it to become a market leader, hence it’s no shock that Floki holders are dumping FLOKI for 5thScape.5thScape is building an ecosystem of 5SCAPE-powered VR dApps. The beta version of its first game “MMA Cage Conquest” is already available in the META store.And the project’s exciting presale of its native 5SCAPE token has been making waves. The new ICO has already raised over $6.1 million.At the current price of $0.00327, investors are buying into the project at a market cap of under $20 million.They will also be sitting on paper gains of over 200% when the token launches at a planned $0.1.If 5thScape starts to gain traction as a market leader, it could easily become a $200+ million market cap coin.That could mean gains of over 10x or 1,000% for presale investors.But if investors want to get in at this favorable valuation, they need to move fast. When the presale hits $6.25 million, the price will jump 15% to $0.00376.$5SCAPE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, or BNB.80% of the total 5.1 billion token supply is available for purchase in the presale.Buy 5SCAPE Here

                        Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET and the Dutch police uncovered a major crypto theft linked to the notorious Ebury botnet last week. The botnet has compromised over 400,000 servers in the past 15 years, making it a major threat to the sector.ESET explained in a May 14 report that the Ebury botnet incident was first uncovered during a 2021 investigation by the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU).Ebury Botnet Operators Used AitM Attack to Steal Funds
The operatives found that the cybercriminals had been involved in a series of crypto thefts, specifically targeting Ethereum and Bitcoin nodes. According to the Dutch police, Botnet operators steal assets from unsuspecting users’ wallets when they enter their credentials on the infected servers.The Ebury botnet, active since at least 2009, is used to deploy additional malware, monetize the botnet (such as modules for web traffic redirection), proxy traffic for spam, perform adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks, and host supporting malicious infrastructure.AitM attacks involve intercepting and potentially altering the communication between two parties without their knowledge.Between February 2022 and May 2023, the Ebury botnet compromised over 200 AitM attack targets across 75 networks in 34 countries. It stole cryptos, credentials, and credit card details, accumulating large sums of money over time.The access enables them to steal funds directly from these wallets or use compromised systems to mine cryptocurrencies, siphoning off resources from unwitting victims. The botnet’s ability to stay undetected for long periods allows it to continue its operations, accumulating large amounts of cryptocurrency over time.Crypto Theft on the Rise
The Ebury botnet’s ability to compromise many servers has created the go-to malware needed to facilitate large-scale cryptocurrency theft, which is already rapidly increasing.Recall that PeckShield’s data shows that $336.8 million of crypto funds were stolen in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. The Certik Hac3d Report also revealed that Q1 2024 recorded substantial losses, exceeding $500 million due to cryptocurrency theft, however. This figure marks a 54% increase compared to the same period in 2023, which saw losses of about $326 million.VIDEOCertik’s report highlighted that January 2024 was particularly severe, with $193 million stolen across 78 incidents. Private key compromises were especially notable, resulting in the loss of $239 million across just 26 incidents.These breaches, targeting the unique keys that individuals use to access their cryptocurrency holdings, accounted for nearly half of all financial losses despite making up only 11.7% of all reported security breaches.

U.S. Supreme Court Loss for Coinbase Leaves Company with Mixed Record

Because the scenario outlined in this case is narrow and unusual, it "will have limited applicability in arbitration-related jurisprudence going forward," said Richard Silberberg, an arbitration lawyer with Dorsey & Whitney and a director of the New York International Arbitration Center. "The unanimous SCOTUS decision that a court, not an arbitrator, must decide whether the parties’ first agreement was superseded by the second was hardly surprising," he added, because previous rulings had pointed in that direction.

Fiat-to-crypto on-ramp Transak integrates Tether (USDT) on TON Network - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Transak integrates USDT on TON, enhancing crypto accessibility for over 5 million users.
The integration supports popular wallets, including Tonkeeper, Trust Wallet, and Telegram.
TON Foundation invests 11M Toncoin to boost USDT adoption and user incentives.

Transak, a leading fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, has announced the integration of Tether (USDT) stablecoin on The Open Network (TON) Blockchain.
The listing follows the strategic collaboration between the TON Foundation and Tether, that was unveiled on April 19, 2024, at the TOKEN2049 event in Dubai.
The collaboration leverages TON’s highly scalable blockchain technology, Telegram’s massive user base of over 900 million, and Transak’s user-friendly Web3 onboarding process to offer a frictionless, borderless peer-to-peer (P2P) payments experience for USDT.
To encourage widespread adoption, the TON Foundation also committed a substantial investment of 11 million Toncoin, valued at approximately $72 million. These funds are earmarked for initiatives such as rewards within the Telegram Wallet, liquidity provider incentives on TON Decentralized Exchanges, and zero-fee USDT withdrawals on major centralized exchanges.
Sami Start, CEO & Co-Founder of Transak, expressed excitement about this new offering, highlighting Transak’s commitment to promoting responsible financial freedom and self-custody of digital assets. He emphasized the significant role this collaboration plays in enabling millions to access USDT on TON through Transak’s platform.
Expanding Tether’s (USDT) accessibility and use cases
Following the USDT integration on TON, Transak now offers a seamless way for its over 5 million users to purchase USDT on TON using fiat.
Over 350 decentralized applications (dApps) that incorporate Transak can now also provide their users with an easy and direct way to buy USDT via Transak.
All this will significantly enhance the USDT’s accessibility and also expand its practical use cases.
Buying USDT on TON via Transak
To buy USDT on the TON network via Transak, can visit Transak’s website or the respective section in their preferred dApp and then choose USDT, select the TON network, and enter the desired purchase amount.
After selecting a payment method (credit card, debit card, bank transfer, or other regional options), users must provide their TON wallet address, such as those in Wallet in Telegram, Tonkeeper, or Trust Wallet.
Depending on the payment method and local regulations, additional verification may be required.
Once verified, users can complete the purchase, and Transak will securely process the transaction and transfer the USDT to the specified wallet.
Notably, accessing USDT on Wallet in Telegram would also facilitate instant, no-fee transfers of USDT among Telegram contacts anywhere in the world.

Insiders Share When SEC Will Announce Ethereum Spot ETF Decision - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethereum ETF issuers have been given until this morning to submit their final 19b-4 forms, according to two sources at The Block. However, even if these forms are approved, trading of these products is not expected to begin for a few weeks.
An issuer was notified yesterday that it had until 5pm today to amend and file form 19b-4. According to a different source, another issuer was given an earlier deadline.


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expects to make a decision on approving one or more applications after the market closes today, a source at an applicant company said. This expectation is based on the institution's historical tendency to make such decisions.

However, a source expressed doubts that trading of these ETFs will begin anytime soon. By the time Bitcoin ETFs were approved, S-1 registration statements were already prepared and exchanges were ready to begin trading. In contrast, S-1s for Ethereum ETFs require “too much processing” and discussions with exchanges have not yet begun to prepare for transactions.





One source predicts the S-1s will go back and forth between the SEC and prospective issuers multiple times before they are ready. They said it could take weeks but ultimately depends on how responsive the SEC is.
If the 19b-4 forms are approved and the S-1s go into effect, Ethereum ETFs can begin trading. However, the exact timeline remains unclear and depends on several factors, including the speed of the SEC's response.

Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Teases 420 Million Transaction Milestone As Daily Transactions Jump 50% | Bitcoinist.com


								Shibarium, the Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by the Shiba Inu team, has seen some remarkable growth since it launched in 2023. With the continuous usage, the network is on its way to reaching a new major milestone amid a notable 50% in its daily transactions.
Shibarium Almost At 420 Million Transactions
According to data from Shibariumscan, the total number of transactions that have been carried out since inception is nearing 420 million. At the time of writing, the figure is sitting just above 417.53 million, which means the network has achieved this feat in nine months, after launching in August 2023.

This comes amid a jump in the daily transaction volume, signaling a  interest in the Shibarium network. The daily transactions had retraced to 10,904 on Tuesday after initially rising to 18,554 on Monday, its second-highest daily figure in the month of May so far. However, on Wednesday, the network’s transaction saw a 50% jump from Tuesday’s lows, rising to 15,414.
With these figures and the network’s performance over the last month, its average daily transactions now sit somewhere around 9,000. If this average holds going forward, it could take the network around 8 months to hit the 2.5 million transactions left to hit the 420 million milestone.
However, with the bull market raging on and crypto participation rises, it is possible that Shibarium does begin to see higher adoption. In that case, the Ethereum Layer 2 network could be hitting this milestone very soon.
Where Is The Shiba Inu Price Headed?
The negative performance of the Shibarium network seems to have moved onto the Shiba Inu price as the meme coin despite the crypto market recovery. The meme coin’s price is down 2.55% in the last day, amid a massive decline in its daily trading volume.
Its trading volume is down a whopping 49% in the last day to sit at $631 million at the time of this writing. This decline in volume suggests dwindling interest in the Shiba Inu price, especially as other newer meme coins are posting more gains.

For example, the PEPE price has risen to new all-time highs this week, with over 100% gains in the last month. Likewise, the BONK price looks to be rallying toward new all-time highs, touching gains of 74% in the last month alone.
This suggests a move from more established meme coins to the new, shinier versions, and the price of Shiba Inu could continue to suffer as a result. It is currently trading at $0.00002532, but despite the declines in the last day, it remains the 12th-largest cryptocurrency in the space with a market cap of $14.9 billion.

Is $77,600 The Next Step For Bitcoin? On-Chain Pricing Model Hints So


																Data from a Bitcoin pricing model based on an on-chain indicator suggests that $77,600 may be the level where the asset will see its next peak.
Bitcoin MVRV Pricing Bands Could Provide Hints About What’s Next
In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed what the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Pricing Bands model could suggest about the cryptocurrency’s future.
The MVRV ratio is a popular on-chain indicator that compares the Bitcoin market cap and realized cap. The former is just the total valuation of the asset at the current spot price, while the latter is a model that calculates the asset’s cap by assuming the “true” value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain.

	Related Reading


The previous transfer of any coin on the network was likely the last time it changed hands, and thus, the price at that time would be its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap keeps track of the sum of the cost basis of every investor in the market.
Therefore, the MVRV ratio tells us how the value the investors hold (the market cap) compares against the value they put in (the realized cap).
Based on this indicator, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has developed a pricing bands model. Below is a chart showing what these pricing bands look like.
The different pricing bands based on the MVRV mean | Source: @ali_charts on X
The pricing bands in this model represent levels corresponding to a specific deviation from the mean for the MVRV ratio. From the chart, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency is currently above the price level, corresponding to a +0.5 standard deviation (SD) from the mean for the indicator.
More specifically, the price level around $65,100 would be where the MVRV ratio would be +0.5 SD above its mean. The next major pricing band in this model is +1 SD, which currently corresponds to around $77,600.
In the past, this level has been where at least local tops have been probable to form for BTC. As is visible in the graph, the rally top back in March also occurred when BTC broke this level.
“Based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, if Bitcoin continues to trade above $65,125, the next local BTC top before a brief correction could be around $77,593!” notes the analyst.

	Related Reading


From the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, a potential rally to a new all-time high of $77,593 would mean an increase of more than 11% for the asset. It now remains to be seen how the asset’s price will develop from here and whether it will be able to maintain above the +0.5 SD MVRV level.
BTC Price
Since its sharp surge earlier, Bitcoin’s bullish momentum appears to have cooled off as the asset has fallen to sideways movement around the $69,700 mark.

Gensler Maintains Most Tokens Are Securities | Bankless


SEC Chair Gary Gensler just reaffirmed his stance that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities based on the Supreme Court's Howey Test. The remarks come as the crypto community anticipates the SEC's decision on spot ether ETFs, expected later today.What's the scoop?In his new comments, Gensler reiterated his view that most of the existing "15,000-20,000" crypto tokens do not operate as currency and often have a group of entrepreneurs behind them, making them fit America's definition of a security."It's just a field where the token operators, without prejudging any one of them, aren't making the disclosures that investors really could benefit from and are required by law," the SEC Chair said. Bankless take:Despite Gensler's steadfast position, the crypto regulatory environment appears to be thawing across bipartisan lines in the U.S. via XEarlier this week, the House passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which Gensler criticized for undermining existing securities regulations. The Senate also recently voted to repeal an SEC crypto accounting rule.Additionally, Ethereum ETFs seem poised for approval, and this greenlighting could be a turning point in actualizing a more favorable regulatory climate for crypto in America, regardless of what Gensler personally thinks. Could a DOGE or SOL ETF be coming, then? Only time will tell, but the possibilities seem in play now more than ever.

Bing and DuckDuckGo offline overnight, Google says thanks for the data


A massive, multi-hour outage of Microsoft’s application programming interface (API) used by its Bing search division has caused unprecedented interruptions for millions of people.
Bing, which has over 9% global search market share, also serves critical features for the privacy-conscious DuckDuckGo search engine, AI tools like ChatGPT, and the code development assistant CoPilot. All were offline today for a number of hours.
Complaints rained in across social media as default search engines for millions of browsers returned errors, suspenseful spinning icons, empty search results, and error pages.
Protos reporters began experiencing search engine errors on Bing and DuckDuckGo a couple of hours after midnight New York time.
Problems at Microsoft look to have begun as early as late Wednesday. By 8pm, Microsoft admitted, “We’re aware of and investing reported issues accessing the Microsoft 365 admin center.”
Search engines for millions of browsers returned spinning icons, empty search results, and error pages.

To call Microsoft a giant is an understatement. It’s the largest publicly traded company in the US with a $3.2 trillion market cap. Despite its size — and trillion-dollar lead on the size of its competitor, Google — it has less than 10% global market share of search queries.
Google, by far the world’s dominant search engine, has over 83% market share.
Google remained online during the Bing and DuckDuckGo outages, providing it hours of invaluable search data from frustrated users of its competitors.

In a new post on X, CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno discussed the latest trend in Ethereum’s exchange netflow. The “exchange netflow” here refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the net amount of ETH moving into or out of the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
When this metric’s value is positive, it means that these platforms are receiving a net number of coins right now. As one of the main reasons holders might deposit coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this trend can potentially bearish consequences for the asset’s price.

On the other hand, the indicator’s negative reading implies that exchange-associated wallets are observing net withdrawals currently. Investors may be moving their coins away from the custody of these central entities for long-term holding, so such a trend may prove to be bullish for the cryptocurrency.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum exchange netflow over the last few months:

The value of the metric appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: @jjcmoreno on X
The above graph shows that the Ethereum exchange netflow has registered some large positive spikes recently. These net deposits have been of a scale only observed in March. According to Moreno, these deposits have mostly been headed towards Binance and Bybit.
As mentioned before, net exchange inflows can indicate that selling is taking place in the market, although this doesn’t necessarily have to be the case. Sometimes, large deposits use one of the other services these platforms provide, like derivatives contracts.
Whatever the case, though, volatility does tend to rise following large deposits. The chart shows that the rally top back in March saw the indicator assume high values as investors participated in profit-taking.

Recently, Ethereum has observed a sharp surge, fueled by positive news surrounding the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Given this rally, it’s possible that profit-taking may once again be the goal behind the positive net flows.
So far, though, ETH has managed to stave off this potential selloff, as its price has remained relatively high. It’s uncertain, however, how long demand can continue to absorb the possible selling pressure if deposits continue to flow into these platforms in the coming days.
ETH Price
Ethereum started a move up during the past day as its price breached the $3,950 mark. The rise only lasted briefly, though, as the asset returned below the $3,800 level.

Coinbase Derivatives To Offer Oil and Gold Futures Contracts in Push To Bridge TradFi and Digital Assets - The Daily Hodl


								The derivatives arm of the largest US-based crypto exchange is launching retail-sized futures contracts for oil and gold.
In a statement, Coinbase Derivatives says that while crypto derivatives remain at the core of its business, it is introducing commodities futures contracts to give customers enhanced trading opportunities in the traditional markets.










Commodity futures contracts oblige buyers to purchase an underlying commodity such as oil, gold and silver at a predetermined future price and date. Investors take advantage of these products to hedge investment positions and capitalize on the price movement of the underlying asset.
Explains Coinbase,
“Our main objective in introducing new futures contracts is to provide diversified markets that facilitate price discovery and risk management.”
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-registered exchange says it decided to offer the new commodity futures contracts sized at 10 barrels of oil and 1 troy ounce of gold after noticing increased demand for retail-focused products on accessible and regulated exchanges.
Coinbase says the new contracts, which will launch on June 3rd, will cater to both seasoned investors and retail enthusiasts.
“We believe that offering our participants access to futures on traditional commodities like oil and gold, alongside crypto commodities is a natural expansion of our product suite. We’re eager to see these contracts mature and the liquidity they will bring to retail and institutional investors in a regulated manner.”

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act, AKA ‘The Crypto Bill’, Passes US House - The Daily Hodl


								The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21 Century (FIT21) Act, a bill that would treat crypto assets as commodities provided their blockchain is decentralized enough, has passed the US House of Representatives.
According to a new press release by the Financial Services Committee, the House has passed the new crypto bill, which would bolster consumer protections and give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) authority over digital assets.










As stated by Republican Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the Chair of the Financial Services Committee,
“Today, the House took a historic step by passing FIT21 with broad, bipartisan support. FIT21 provides the regulatory clarity and robust consumer protections necessary for the digital asset ecosystem to thrive in the United States. 
The bill also ensures America leads the financial system of the future and remains a hub for technological innovation.” 
Furthermore, Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer’s Securities Clarity Act – which was initially introduced in 2020 with the aim of properly classifying digital assets – was passed as well as part of FIT21. According to Emmer, this marks a step toward clear crypto guidelines.
“With the passage of the Securities Clarity Act and FIT21, American digital asset innovation can flourish. This globally competitive framework will give entrepreneurs the clarity and assurance they need to build here, in the United States, while ensuring the next iteration of the web emulates our values.” 
Earlier this week, the White House hinted that it would not veto if passed despite facing opposition from Gary Gensler, the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
According to Gensler, the bill would create regulatory gaps and conflicts with current securities laws. Though the White House said it does not support the bill, it noted that it’s willing to work with Congress to improve it.

Howey Who? How US Crypto Bill FIT21 Defines Decentralized Networks - Decrypt

Decentralization has served as crypto’s North Star since its beginnings, but with Wednesday’s passage of a crypto market structure bill, the concept could soon become enshrined in U.S. law.Known as the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, the bill passed by lawmakers in the House of Representatives would provide a pathway for cryptocurrencies to become certified as digital asset commodities under new rules.If FIT21 eventually becomes law, a digital asset would be classified as a commodity and regulated by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) if its underlying blockchain is “functional and decentralized.” In order to achieve that designation, however, FIT21 puts forth several definitions, procedures, and thresholds.Amending the Securities Act of 1933, FIT21 outlines several key terms, such as what a “decentralized network” is and who its “affiliated persons” are. Actions taken by said affiliates, who could be the issuers of a token or those that own at least 5% of its overall supply (including relatives), are critical to determining, under the bill, just how decentralized a network really is.In order to qualify as decentralized, a network’s affiliates must have not had “unilateral authority” to alter how a blockchain functions within the past 12 months. Under the same time frame, affiliates must not have had the ability to prevent users from taking specific actions, such as deploying integrated software, setting up a node, or participating in decentralized governance.Focusing on its overall distribution, a digital asset wouldn't meet the requirements if an affiliate owns 20% or more of its overall supply. That same 20% threshold applies to the overall voting power of a digital asset an affiliate may own when it comes to the decentralized governance process a network’s direction may be guided by.According to Bitwise Senior Analyst Juan Leon, many networks at launch “hover” around that 20% threshold for control or ownership. Most new networks aim for decentralization over time, but their developers—and investors—often begin with outsized influence, he said.“On the one hand, you could think this is going to force that classification on many or most projects as securities,” Leon told Decrypt. “This could push projects to decentralize further from the start, which I think can be a positive thing.”On top of that, FIT21 requires that within the past 12 months, the digital asset has been issued solely through the “programmatic functioning of the blockchain system.” That could be viewed as digital assets that come from the process of mining or staking, or even airdrops.Finally, FIT21 looks at whether affiliates have marketed the digital asset as investments within the past three months, or implemented any “intellectual property to the source code of the blockchain system” that materially changes how it functions. That’s unless the changes were made as technical improvements, or were adopted through decentralized governance.Touching on all these factors, “any person” can file certification with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that a digital asset’s related network is indeed decentralized, FIT21 states. But through a review process, the SEC can rebut certifications.From the agency’s perspective, many digital assets resemble securities under the so-called Howey Test, a four-pronged approach stemming from a Supreme Court case: The investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others.Decentralization may be missing from that statute, but it’s come up for the SEC before. And it was well before SEC Chair Gary Gensler claimed "everything other than Bitcoin,” as a security, would be under the regulator’s remit.More than five years ago, an SEC official, Bill Hinman, gave a speech that concluded that Ethereum is not a security. Though the Commission clarified it did not “necessarily reflect” the agency’s views, Hinman’s remarks posited a network could become “sufficiently decentralized,” to the point where it would no longer be considered a security.“That lack of clarity has imposed significant challenges, and has driven crypto businesses overseas,” Leon said. “This bill, for the first time, tries to comprehensively define how [...] they can assess the decentralization of an asset to determine if it is a commodity or a security.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Why Solana Could Find It 'Much Harder' To Outperform Ethereum After An ETF Approval - Benzinga

Pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader Wazz Crypto discussed the significant challenges Solana SOL/USD will face in outperforming Ethereum ETH/USD moving forward, touching on critical metrics and market dynamics.What Happened: Wazz presents a compelling argument suggesting that "it will be much harder for SOL to keep outperforming ETH from here." He notes that while SOL experienced a 96% decline during the bear market, compared to ETH’s 75%, it was easier for SOL to achieve significant returns due to a simple mean reversion. However, they believe "the meat of the move should be done."Quick overview of both the altcoins historical performance:Cryptocurrency1-Week Gain1-Month Gain1-Year GainEthereum ETH/USD+28.5%+17%+105%Solana SOL/USD+8.5%+8.4%+764%The trader notes the disparity in inflation rates between the two cryptocurrencies, with current ETH inflation at historical lows and SOL’s inflation significantly higher. "Current $ETH inflation is at historical low gas is $5M daily, current $SOL inflation is $13M daily."Additionally, the aftermath of billions of SOL bought by FTX at $60-$80 presents a supply overhang that could hinder its performance.Also Read: Will Solana Or Dogecoin Be The Next Crypto ETF If The Ethereum ETF Is Approved?Why It Matters:  While acknowledging Solana’s success in terms of on-chain activity, Wazz Crypto remains skeptical about its sustainability. "Solana on-chain activity is all meme coin gambling, it's doing great but I'm not sure how long it is sustainable with this high churn rate," they caution.In contrast, they emphasize Ethereum’s institutional advantage, particularly with the potential for an ETF approval, and its robust DeFi ecosystem. "Defi on ETH/EVM is much more vibrant than Solana by multitudes," they add.However, Wazz Crypto does recognize a potential edge for Solana. "I think the biggest advantage SOL might have here is one of the DePin apps really taking off and onboarding millions of users to the chain," they concede, suggesting that a breakthrough app could shift the dynamics.The trader concludes, "ETH value accrual is 15x more capital parked there which is mostly sticky and likely won’t be moving anywhere anytime soon," they explain, underscoring the stability and attractiveness of ETH for investors.What’s Next: The influence of Ethereum as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Solana Meme Coin Platform Pump.Fun Exploited For $1.9M, Vows To Repay UsersThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

Landmark Conviction of Tornado Cash Developer Sparks Debate Over Software Liability in Crypto Industry



                    

The conviction of Alexey Pertsev, a developer of the coin-mixing protocol Tornado Cash, highlights a chilling interpretation of criminal liability with far-reaching implications for the crypto world. 



Pertsev has been sentenced by a Dutch court to five years and four months for money laundering via Tornado Cash, despite not directly engaging in the laundering activities.




Andrew Balthazor, a litigator with Holland and Knight, explained the implications of the verdict to Cointelegraph. 



He stated, “Mr. Pertsev’s conviction reinforces the views of several governments that software developers who make their software available to the public will be held liable for the foreseeable consequences of the public’s use of that software.”



Balthazor elaborated that under this theory of liability, developers cannot claim ignorance of specific criminal acts or point to the software’s limitations in preventing misuse. 



He emphasized that it is the developer’s responsibility to create mechanisms to reduce or prevent foreseeable criminal use of their software. 



When asked if this view included the U.S., Balthazor confirmed that it did, as shown by the Department of Justice’s indictments against Tornado Cash.



This interpretation contrasts sharply with traditional views of liability. 



Natalia Latka, director of public policy and regulatory affairs at Merkle Science, noted how the perception of developers has evolved. 




Historically, developers were seen as neutral creators, responsible for the functionality of their tools but not their misuse. 



However, this perspective has shifted, especially with decentralized networks challenging traditional regulations. 




Latka stated that developers must now consider the legal implications and potential misuse of their creations.

The crypto community quickly recognized the significance of Pertsev’s trial. 



Eléonore Blanc, founder of CryptoCanal, discussed the trial’s implications on social media, suggesting that “Tornado Cash” could easily be replaced with any cryptocurrency. 



She expressed concern that the court systematically disregarded the defense’s arguments, potentially setting a precedent for broader applications in the crypto industry.



Blanc further personalized the ruling, stating, “As crypto builders, we are all Alexey. We keep fighting for him, his legacy and the cypherpunk values.”



The ruling poses risks to privacy, immutability, and decentralization. 



Balthazor argued that immutable smart contracts could become highly risky for developers, suggesting that publicly available programs might need to be amendable to comply with law enforcement or regulatory requirements.



Natalia Latka emphasized that “compliance by design” will become crucial for developers, integrating regulatory compliance from the outset. 



Courts will scrutinize whether developers knowingly created tools for illegal purposes or were negligent, with intent or negligence significantly impacting legal outcomes.



Ultimately, if developers must sacrifice privacy, immutability, and decentralization for compliance, the core values of blockchain technology could be fundamentally compromised.

Are Sideline Skeptics Crypto’s Biggest Enemy or Greatest Strength?

With that said, in a niche industry like crypto, its inherently online culture makes it exceptionally susceptible to trolls – and the more ridiculous or outrageous their ridicule, the greater the potential to frustrate. Since crypto communities are tribal, they often become emotionally and financially invested in their favorite blockchain network or project, making them automatically defensive or resistant to critiques that challenge their interests.

Uniswap Responds to SEC’s Wells Notice, Argues Tokens Are Not Securities but ‘File Format’ for Value - The Daily Hodl


								Uniswap (UNI) is fighting back against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The largest decentralized exchange by trading volume received a Wells Notice from the SEC last month, which indicates the regulator intends to take enforcement actions against the DEX soon.










Marvin Ammori, the chief legal officer at Uniswap Labs, notes that the project submitted an official response to the SEC on Tuesday.
Ammori argues that the SEC relies on a false assumption that nearly all crypto assets are securities.
“But a token is merely a file format–like a PDF or JPEG. Tokens can represent any value, and overwhelmingly represent commodities (BTC, ETH, stables) & memes & access for useful networks. PDFs are not inherently stock certificates, and tokens are not inherently securities.
Even if securities were involved, the Uniswap protocol (and web app, and wallet) don’t fall under definitions of the ‘securities exchange’ or ‘broker.’
Under law, the Uniswap protocol would have to be specifically designed ‘for’ ‘securities’ – and it is not. It is for general purposes, mainly used for commodities.”
Ammori also says current US law requires securities exchanges to be operated by “groups.” The chief legal officer notes that Uniswap is “autonomous software” and isn’t operated or controlled by anybody.
“Our case is so strong that the SEC is trying to change the law to fight us. The SEC has a pending rulemaking proposing to rewrite its own definition of ‘exchange’ – and to redefine ‘group’ and several other words beyond what they actually mean. Changing what words mean in order to sue us under the new made-up law just isn’t going to work in court.”
The SEC has also accused Coinbase, Binance and Kraken of violating securities laws, launching lawsuits against all three exchanges last year.

This Crypto Asset Could Be the Spot ETF Candidate After Bitcoin and Ethereum, According to Investor Brian Kelly - The Daily Hodl


								The founder and CEO of an investment firm specializing in digital currencies is looking down the line for the next crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF).
In a new CNBC interview, BKCM LLC head Brian Kelly reacts to speculation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve Ethereum (ETH) ETF applications as soon as tomorrow by naming which digital asset he expects to receive ETF approval next.










“I think you’ve got to think about Solana as probably the next one, right? Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Now, we have some clarity about what a security is and what isn’t, and they’ll be able to list a lot more crypto, which means a lot more trading for them. So, I think they’re the biggest beneficiaries from the change that’s gone on.”
According to Kelly, this crypto landscape in Washington D.C. is shifting rapidly, and in favor of the crypto industry.
“In general, what this has done is changed the landscape for crypto. 
In May, Trump was asked a question about crypto. He said if you want crypto, vote for Trump. That clip went viral and actually changed things in Washington. We saw multiple votes over the last several days that were pro-crypto. The President said he was going to veto those, and then kind of backed off. 
So, I think there’s been a sea change here in the regulatory environment, and it’s a welcome one from the industry.”

Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin: Tornado Cash Dev Conviction 'Really Unfortunate' - Decrypt

At a fireside chat Thursday, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin completely ignored a question asking if he cared about the prospect of spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETF) being approved in the United States. But he did weigh in on a secondary question on privacy, specifically in regards to the recent sentencing of an Ethereum protocol developer.The crypto figurehead said that Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev being sentenced to 64-months in prison was “really unfortunate,” and continued to back privacy-centric crypto tools, encouraging people to develop “next-gen” solutions.“The Alexei thing is definitely really unfortunate,” Buterin said at DappCon in Berlin. “I think a lot of people have been going under the assumption [...] that just building software is something that’s okay, and is a totally legal and legit way to fight for privacy.”But that assumption didn't hold up to the rule of law in this particular case, after a Dutch court ruled that the developer was guilty of money laundering due to the use of the software he coded. And that must be particularly worrying for Roman Storm, the Tornado Cash co-founder who awaits trial in the U.S. for similar money laundering charges.Tornado Cash and other crypto coin mixers obscure where money is being sent. Privacy advocates emphasize that they have importance for everyday people, but we've seen substantial regulatory scrutiny towards their use for criminal groups looking to launder illicit funds—such as North Korean state-sponsored hacker organization Lazarus Group.As a result, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) banned Americans from using the platform in 2022, and developers have been prosecuted for their role in developing the autonomous protocol.“It's definitely really, really sad, and I hope that with Roman’s trial in the U.S. we get some positive clarity on that.” Buterin said, before applauding ongoing efforts to maintain privacy in the industry.“Privacy is important,” he said. “I think the ecosystem's willingness to rally around things like Railgun and 0xbow, and similar next-gen approaches, shows people’s sincerity on providing privacy for the common people—and not, you know, the Kremlin or whoever.”Previously, Buterin pushed for privacy options that generate a zero-knowledge proof, which verifies that a user isn’t using a criminal address. That's called a Privacy Pool, and both Railgun and 0xbow utilize this system. “I’m really supportive of people working on those things,” Buterin explained. “I hope that things go in a good direction within the ecosystem. And you know, I also hope that governments see the value of this.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Is the House’s FIT21 Bill Really the Legislation That Crypto Needs?

Somewhat ironically, Shapiro and Palley’s criticisms seem to line up with Maxine Waters (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, who said it was the one of the worst bills she's ever seen. In addition to potentially stretching the resources of the CFTC, which only has around 700 employees compared to the SEC’s 4,500, it may also undermine other legislative efforts – like the stablecoin bill Waters worked on alongside House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC).

Vitalik Compares the L2 and Ethereum Sharding Visions | Bankless


Today, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin released an analysis of Layer 2s (L2s) and base layer execution sharding in scaling Ethereum, highlighting the key similarities and differences in these approaches. What's the context?In his new post, Buterin explored the parallels between L2s and sharding, noting how these approaches similarly aim to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently. via Vitalik ButerinHe emphasized that the endgame for both these methods is relying on ZK-SNARKs for computation verification and Data Availability Sampling (DAS) for data verification. Despite these similarities, he went on to explain how there are distinct differences that persist.Summarizing the tradeoffsAs Vitalik noted, L2s provide a variety of execution environments, allowing for different virtual machines and architectures, such as Arbitrum Stylus (WASM-based), Fuel (UTXO-based), and Aztec (ZK-SNARK-based privacy).This diversity enables specialized implementations that wouldn’t be feasible with the single, monolithic Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that sharding would be limited by. Additionally, the Ethereum L1 offers more robust security guarantees at a higher cost, while L2s offer a spectrum of security and cost tradeoffs, making them suitable for non-financial applications like social media and gaming.L2s can also provide faster transaction times using preconfirmation mechanisms, a feature that would complicate L1 if implemented directly. On the flip side, L2 cross-chain capabilities still need work. Culturally speaking, L2s also foster independent sub-ecosystems within Ethereum to an extent that shards likely wouldn't. This encourages innovation and specialization while benefiting from Ethereum's shared security and network effects.In the same vein, rollups allow developers to experiment with new ideas without needing consensus from Ethereum core developers, reducing the political overhead associated with L1 changes.Vitalik's conclusionButerin wrapped up by reiterating that while L2s and sharding have their idiosyncracies and are often seen as distinct scaling strategies, they are fundamentally similar in their general technical approaches. The main difference, he noted, lies in who builds and maintains these components and the level of autonomy they possess. He concluded by emphasizing the need for addressing the coordination challenges of an L2-centric approach to fully realize its potential.Bankless take:Some people in the Ethereum community still long for the original sharding vision, though as Vitalik's new post demonstrates, Ethereum has taken an approach via L2s that, in effect, is sharding–it's just arrived along a different path than was initially planned. While pure sharding has its pros, the flexibility possible with rollups is a big leg up and highlights how Ethereum is now well-suited for development efforts of all stripes.

Popular Cryptocurrency Exchange Responds to Bankruptcy Rumors - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, denied rumors about the company's bankruptcy. Rumors that started circulating on social media platform X on May 22 suggested that Bybit was bankrupt or hacked.
Responding to these claims, Zhou said, “There are no facts supporting any of the rumors I have seen so far. Please be aware.” said. He also noted that Bybit updated its Proof of Reserve (PoR) this month and that all Bybit wallets are viewable through Nansen, with total assets exceeding $11 billion.



A cryptocurrency user suggested that an error in Arkham Intelligence's proof-of-reserve chart could be the source of the rumor. In response to this speculation, Zhou shared a link to Bybit's PoR data and a Nansen dashboard showing all Bybit wallets and the amount of assets they hold, in an attempt to provide transparency and reassure users.
Such rumors have historically affected not only Bybit but other exchanges as well. For example, concerns about MEXC increased after the “MEXC_CEO” Twitter account was discontinued in December 2023. This coincided with a rise in user complaints about frozen funds, fueling concerns about the financial health of the exchange.

'Notcoin' Missions Let You Passively Earn Crypto via Telegram-Here's How - Decrypt

Notcoin, the viral clicker game that had tens of millions of users fervently tapping a digital gold coin to earn crypto via Telegram, has launched a new type of mission that lets players passively earn crypto token rewards.After conducting its NOT token airdrop via The Open Network (TON) last week, Not ranks as the largest gaming token launch so far in 2024–instantly reaching a market cap of nearly $1.5 billion.Now, the token has settled around a $500 million market cap at a price of just under $0.005, and the Notcoin team is starting to roll out the next wave of in-game opportunities to earn more crypto.The newest addition to the game are “earnings missions.” Earnings missions differ from previous tasks or quests players had to complete ahead of the token launch, as completing them lets users earn NOT tokens passively rather than through a one-time reward.Notcoin's tutorial notes that these missions guide players through different communities, belonging to "partner projects," granting them tokens in return for learning about other crypto games and apps.The NOT earnings are based on your in-game level. The higher your level, the larger the pool of potential NOT rewards. You can increase your level by staking Notcoin, and the amount of NOT you have staked at the end of every month determines whether you move up or down the ranks. The highest level, Platinum, earns players the most Notcoin tokens.Sample screenshots from Notcoin's earning missions. Image: NotcoinEach partner mission includes tasks like following them on Twitter, joining their Discord, or downloading their app. At the moment, there are four missions available, including a tutorial, one for a project called TonGifts, and two for third-party crypto games that let Notcoin players earn more NOT by joining their respective communities and playing the games.“300%+ APY now for Platinum [by the way] and we just started with four pools,” the team wrote in an official Telegram community. “The real annual percentage yield, not what others offer you for a week or so. And holy math, it works.

Crypto market structure bill advances to Senate, Rep. Nickel is optimistic - Blockworks


After passing in the US House of Representatives Wednesday evening with widespread bipartisan support, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, known as the FIT21 Act, is headed to the Senate. 
FIT21 advanced Wednesday with the support of 71 House Democrats, including Reps. Nancy Pelosi, D-Cali., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J. Representatives passed the bill with two amendments proposed by Reps. Brittany Pettersen, D-Col., and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., respectively. 
Norman’s amendment requires the Treasury Department, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission to complete a joint study and submit a report to Congress that identifies any digital asset businesses that are owned by “governments of foreign adversaries,” Norman said Wednesday on the House Floor. 
Pettersen’s amendment expands the Bank Secrecy Act to include digital asset entities under the definition of a “financial institution” and orders a study to assess risks posed by centralized intermediaries in areas where anti-money laundering enforcement is not as “robust,” she said Wednesday.
After joint resolution 109 — the measure which, should President Joe Biden refrain from exercising his right to veto, invalidates the SEC’s staff accounting bulletin (SAB) 121 — passed the Senate with unexpected bipartisan support earlier this month, fans of FIT21 are hopeful. 
“I’m optimistic — yesterday’s vote in the House sent a clear message that there’s a strong bipartisan coalition supporting a regulatory structure for crypto,” Rep. Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., told Blockworks. “I’m engaged with my colleagues in the Senate who have the same priorities to protect consumers, cement the US as a global leader in finance and tech, and promote an innovative, inclusive financial future for all.”
Read more from our opinion section: It’s time to overturn SAB 121
Senators will now have the opportunity to consider the legislation as it currently stands and propose amendments. Industry advocates say the current version of the bill is probably not going to make it to the president’s desk. 
“We expect the Senate to continue working on and amending FIT21, and our focus will remain on ensuring that there are protections and legal certainty for developers and users of decentralized networks and protocols,” Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, said. “We look forward to working with the Senate on these core issues.” 
Even with 71 Democrats getting on board with FIT21 in the House, those opposed are expected to lobby in the Senate just as hard. Rep. Maxine Waters, who has dubbed FIT21 the “Not Fit for Purpose Act,” said Wednesday that the legislation serves to deregulate the crypto industry. 
“The SEC is the federal agency on the front lines of enforcing our existing securities laws on crypto firms that have willfully chosen to ignore the law and [which have] defrauded customers out of billions of dollars with ‘get rich quick’ schemes,” Waters said in a statement ahead of Wednesday’s vote. “Giving this industry a free pass to avoid most or all regulations cannot be the answer to the serious concerns that Members have raised about crypto fraud.”
FIT21 advocates will also have to take on SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who said Wednesday that the bill “would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk.”
The Senate has not yet scheduled a floor vote for FIT21.

What Ray Dalio, Larry Fink, Carl Icahn And Others Have Said About Ethereum - Benzinga

With the imminent decision about spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs potentially shifting the limelight away from Bitcoin BTC/USD, a crypto trader pointed out what several big names in traditional finance have said about ETH.What Happened: Evanss6 highlighted quotes from several prominent figures, such as Ken Griffin, who believes Ethereum will eventually replace Bitcoin BTC/USD, and Carl Icahn, who prefers Ethereum over Bitcoin, viewing it as both a store of value and a payment system.He also cited Stanley Druckenmiller, who predicts Ethereum might dominate Bitcoin, and Ray Dalio, who owns both BTC and ETH and sees a place for crypto in investment portfolios. Furthermore, Jamie Dimon was noted for his criticism of Bitcoin but acknowledgment of Ethereum’s use cases.Additionally, Paul Tudor Jones described Ethereum as an "industrial digital asset" and part of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution," emphasizing the development of protocols that interact with traditional companies. Larry Fink was quoted discussing tokenization and the potential for a decentralized ledger-based financial system.Evanss6 concluded that traditional finance leaders are very much interested in Ethereum, despite it nominally being much smaller than Bitcoin.Also Read: What Would Ethereum ETF Approval Mean For The Price Of ETH?Why It Matters: The quotes highlight the interest from major financial institutions to fully embrace Ethereum, recognizing its potential for tokenization and other use cases. While Ethereum’s market capitalization of $450 million is a fraction of Bitcoin’s $1.3 billion, its versatility is tipped to become a major asset if it is fully embraced by traditional finance. However, doubts remain whether Ethereum can fulfill its potential, with Bitcoin advocates pointing out that Ethereum’s complexity makes it intentionally confusing.What’s Next: The influence of Ethereum as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Ethereum ETF Decision Looms: What To Watch Out For TodayImage: Shutterstock

Bold Claim from Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson: "I Don't Think Bitcoin Will Survive" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Cardano CEO Charles Hoskinson recently said that he has strong doubts about the future of Bitcoin.
“Bitcoin needs the industry to survive, and it certainly needs exchanges and all the other infrastructure because it is not self-sufficient at that size,” Hoskinson said.


He compared this situation to the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem, which he believes no longer needs Bitcoin to thrive. “The industry no longer needs Bitcoin to survive,” he said.
While Hoskinson acknowledged that Bitcoin has a reputation as “digital gold,” he noted that it remains a token with a fundamentally deflationary monetary policy. He argued that new digital assets with solid scientific foundations could replace Bitcoin and offer equal or greater security. “At any time, another digital gold could form, and if there is a good scientific basis behind it, it will be just as safe, if not more,” he said.





Referring to the development of Cardano, Hoskinson said that a meticulous scientific approach was followed when designing the proof-of-stake protocol. According to the founder, Cardano's team has focused on creating a secure, energy-efficient consensus protocol for seven years.
Hoskinson stated that despite these advances, the Bitcoin community has rejected these efforts. “The response from the Bitcoin ecosystem was that this was a scam, such a technology could not exist, perpetual motion and proof-of-stake were wrong.” said.



Hoskinson compared Bitcoin's current position to Microsoft's historical dominance with Windows, noting that Windows has lost its critical market position as technology paradigms change. He warned that Bitcoin could face a similar fate if it fails to adapt.
Hoskinson expressed concerns that Bitcoin may lose importance as the industry evolves and focuses on innovations outside the Bitcoin network: “You wake up and realize 98% of what you're doing is outside of Bitcoin. And you start asking yourself, why do I really care about BTC?”

Why Is The Ethereum Spot ETF Decision Still To Be Announced? Bloomberg Analyst Provides Latest Insights - Bitcoin Sistemi


While everyone is waiting for the SEC's decision on Ethereum Spot ETFs, there is no development yet, even though it is 23:30.
Bitcoin Spot ETFs were approved at 11:15 p.m.


Regarding the delay, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said:

“Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas: “No development yet. We're waiting to hear something. I've seen two different people here claim (without citing their sources) that it's been delayed until later in the night, but we can't confirm that with anyone yet. That's all we know right now. Although it hasn't been confirmed.” “Given that the Trading & Markets department was notified at the last minute, a slight delay isn't that crazy. However, everything we've heard suggests it will be approved.”

However, a decision must be made today regarding VanEck's application for Ethereum Spot ETFs, either rejection or approval.

Pundit Predicts Shiba Inu Competitor Dogwifhat Will Reach $10 Amid Short liquidations


																Crypto trader and analyst Unipcs (Bonk Guy) has reiterated his bullish prediction for Dogwifhat (WIF). He made this statement while revealing the sums lost by short traders thanks to their bearish sentiment around the meme coin. 
Dogwifhat Headed To $10
Unipcs mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogwifhat is “headed to $10” and will never drop to as low as $1 again. He added that the market is currently in a meme coin supercycle, which is why he believes the meme coin can attain such heights. The crypto trader also highlighted how WIF shorts were “getting squeezed hard” and said this is the “way it should be.”

Source: X
Besides Dogwifhat, Unipcs generally has a bullish outlook towards meme coins. He earned a reputation for longing Bonk, another Solana-based meme coin, with $16,000 in October 2023 and still holding as at the last time he shared an update on the trade. Based on his update, his unrealized profit has risen to as high as $13.7 million at some point. 
Unipcs’s bullishness on meme coins is also not surprising, considering this category of crypto tokens is projected as one of the leading narratives in this bull run. It is also worth noting that meme coins Dogwifhat and Pepe (PEPE) are currently this year’s best-performing crypto assets among the top 50 coins by market cap, with year-to-date (YTD) gains of over 1,800% and 1,000%, respectively. 
Unipcs isn’t the only one who believes that WIF could rise to $10. Another crypto trader known as ‘Free’ has also reaffirmed on different occasions that the meme coin will still rise to that price level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Bluntz Capital is also ultra-bullish on Dogwifhat, as he once suggested that the meme coin will flip PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to become the second-largest meme coin by market cap, only behind Dogecoin (DOGE).
This Crypto Analyst Has Other Expectations
Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently revealed his bearish expectations for meme coins, including WIF. He foresees a “meme wipeout,” which could be worse than he initially thought. He added that this occurrence would “catch a ton of people off guard.” He claimed he would become a meme coin bull when the time is right, but now is not the right time. 

	Related Reading


In a recent video posted on his YouTube channel, CrediBULL Crypto also analyzed Dogwifhat. He noted that WIF had significantly moved to the upside, as he rightly predicted in an earlier market update. Back then, he mentioned that he was expecting the meme coin to rise to $3.8 before it dropped to as low as $1.6.
However, in his recent video, he revealed that he won’t be shorting Dogwifhat even when it reaches $3.8. Instead, he will wait for the meme coin to claim the untapped highs at the $4 range to validate his bearish expectations. 
At the time of writing, Dogwifhat is trading at around $3, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

                        A dormant Dogecoin (DOGE) whale with a wallet balance of 893,303 DOGE (about $145,101) became active on May 22 after over 10 years of inactivity. The account made a transaction for the first time since May 2014. The sudden resurgence has sparked fears about the impact of such a transaction on Dogecoin’s price trend.According to Whale Alert, the Dogecoin Whale transferred 23,338 DOGE, valued at about $4,000, to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.Dogecoin Whale Owns 869,964 DOGE Despite Huge Transfer
Despite the big transfer, the whale still holds over 869,964 DOGE, worth about $141,101.The latest reawakening isn’t an isolated event. Earlier in the month, a Dogecoin Whale transferred $60 million in DOGE to Robinhood, which had just received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).On May 21, Whale Alert revealed another major transaction. The transaction involved shuffling a 600 million DOGE, approximately valued at $100 million, between two unknown wallet addresses. Specifically, the Dogecoin whale transferred 300 million DOGE to each wallet.These transactions have drawn considerable attention, but the motives and implications of these transfers are unclear.The movement caused DOGE’s price to rise 13.08%, however.DOGE recorded a price increase of 13.08%Coinglass data further indicates heightened investor interest in the asset. According to the derivatives data, DOGE’s open interest (OI) increased by 27.05% to $1.05 billion, accompanied by a volume upswing of 212.27% to $3.73 billion.The latest activity, along with the previous Dogecoin whale transactions, is driving the conversation around Dogecoin price prediction.

Terra Founder Do Kwon's Fate May Be Sealed: SEC Travels to Montenegro - Bitcoin Sistemi


Montenegrin Minister of Justice Andrej Milović and Director General of Capital, International and EU Fund Projects Dragutin Đeković recently met with representatives of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The SEC delegation included Director of Investigations Gurbir Greval, Head of the Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit (CACU) David Hirsch, CACU Deputy Director Jorge Tenriero, Office of International Affairs (OIA) Deputy Director Matthew Greiner and Senior Special Counsel (OIA) Marley Miller.


During the meeting, Minister Milović was presented with a detailed principle on the work of the SEC, with particular emphasis on the principles of monitoring and protecting investors participating in stock market transactions and cryptocurrency trading. It was explained how the legal system works regarding these activities, what legal remedies are available for investors and what actions are taken in different situations.

One of the topics of the meeting was the SEC's investigation into the Terra (LUNA) founder Do Kwon case. Minister Milović was informed about the results of this investigation and the progress of the legal process against Do Kwon in the USA.





Minister Milović emphasized the importance of international cooperation in the field of investor protection and the fight against fraud in financial markets and thanked the SEC representatives for the detailed presentation and useful information.

XRPL Transactions Surge Over 100% in Q1 2024 as Average Costs Plummet, Ripple Report Reveals



                    

The number of transactions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) more than doubled from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the end of the first quarter of 2024, while the average transaction cost nearly halved, according to Ripple’s Q1 2024 XRP Markets Report.



On-chain transaction activity on the XRPL surged by 108% during Q1 of 2024, reaching approximately 251.39 million transactions compared to 121.03 million in Q4 of 2023, as noted in the report published on May 17.




Additionally, the average cost per transaction fell by 45%, amounting to approximately $0.000856.



“As such, the decrease in average cost per transaction indicated a reset and that no network congestion occurred in the quarter,” the report states.



The distribution of XRP trading volume among cryptocurrency exchanges remained stable in the first quarter. 



Binance, Bybit, and Upbit together accounted for over 70% of the total traded volume. 



During this period, the proportion of volume traded via fiat pairs decreased from 15% in Q4 to 11%. Currently, most XRP trading occurs against Tether.

The report also addressed the ongoing lawsuit between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple. 




The SEC filed the lawsuit in December 2020, alleging that Ripple’s executives conducted an initial public offering of XRP, which it considered an unregistered security during the capital-raising period.



On April 22, Ripple responded to the SEC’s request for $2 billion in remedies, disagreeing with the demand. 




Ripple argued that the law doesn’t permit the SEC to demand disgorgement or interest on disgorgement unless they can prove someone was harmed.



“In terms of next steps, both parties will wait for the Judge to make a determination on the final remedies – likely in the coming months,” Ripple explained.



“Ripple remains confident that the Judge will approach the remedies phase fairly,” it added.

                        The Uniswap (UNI) price just dipped to $9.0, just as hopes had been rising that it was about to reach for the $10 mark, with UNI now around 10% down from earlier session highs in the $9.80s.No one single catalyst can explain the decentralized exchanges (DEX)’s abrupt reversal.Rather, UNI’s intra-day turn-around is in tandem with a sell-off in the broader market.Bitcoin (BTC) just dipped back below $67,000, having touched $72,000 earlier this week.Other major cryptos were also pulling lower, with Ether (ETH) dropping back to the $3,600s from session highs near $4,000.Perhaps the market is experiencing a sell-the-news reaction to major positive catalysts this week – expectations that the SEC is about to approve spot Ethereum ETFs and the passage of the FIT21 bill through the House.Either way, the Uniswap price is taking a hit. Here’s where it could be headed next.Uniswap Price Prediction – Is $50 Possible?
$10 is a key area of resistance for the Uniswap price. It’s no surprise that UNI has found strong resistance here.But that doesn’t mean that UNI’s recovery is over. The cryptocurrency recently broke convincingly to the north of its 21 and 50DMAs.It had previously been stuck in a $6.50-$8.0ish range for over one month.A run back higher towards $17 could be on the cards later this year.The Uniswap price could soon power back towards earlier yearly highs. Source: TradingViewThe SEC’s u-turn on Ethereum ETFs has sparked hopes they might not go through with charging the Uniswap Foundation.The Uniswap Foundation received a Wells Notice from the agency earlier this year.If the agency doesn’t press ahead with charges, that would be a big weight off UNI’s shoulders.But could it go all the way to $50?Well, Uniswap hit as high as $45 back in 2021. That was the peak of meme coin mania during the past cycle.But this cycle could blow the last cycle out of the water. It already is in some ways, with Bitcoin hitting new record highs this year and comfortably holding in this area.That reflects the fact that crypto adoption has risen leaps and bounds since 2021.At $50, Uniswap would hit a fully diluted market cap of just over $50 billion.As the dominant multi-chain DEX protocol that continues to lead its sector forward, that’s not an unfair price prediction.Uniswap Alternative to Consider – Multi-chain Meme Coin Dogeverse (DV)
UNI could 5x from current levels this bull market. And most investors would be more than happy with 5x gains.But many investors are hunting bigger upside of 50-100x.These investors tend to turn to the highly speculative and volatile meme coin market.Meme coins are of course very risky, and there is no way around it.But one way that investors can turn the odds in their favor is to get into high-potential meme coins early and at a favorable valuation, before they start to pump.One meme coin that the team at Cryptonews thinks has a lot of potential is Dogeverse.Dogeverse has in-built cross-chain capabilities and, as a result, is generating considerable excitement in the market.Currently in presale, Dogeverse has raised over $15 million.Its X account has already garnered a following of over 21,200. The project’s Telegram, meanwhile, has close to 13,000 subscribers.Dogeverse seeks to be the multi-chain equivalent of Dogecoin and is launching on the six most popular blockchains (excluding Bitcoin).Dogeverse’s cross-chain bridging capabilities further enhance its appeal, making it a “Doge with superpowers.”Interested investors should get in quick ahead of the token’s official launch on the 5th of June. The presale will end on the 3rd.Visit Dogeverse Here

                        The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just approved eight spot Ethereum ETF applications through an omnibus order on Thursday in a landmark move signaling growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance.The decision arrived just four months after the regulator greenlit the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a rapid shift in the regulatory landscape.Ethereum ETF Approvals Follow Last-Minute Scramble
The SEC granted approval for 19b-4 forms submitted by prominent financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. Despite this initial hurdle being cleared, ETF issuers now face another: ensuring their S-1 registration statements become effective before trading can commence.Although the SEC recently initiated discussions with issuers regarding these S-1 forms, the timeline remains uncertain. Some analysts speculate a turnaround within weeks, while others point to historical precedents exceeding three months.SEC Faces Scrutiny Over Unexpected Shift
The SEC’s decision comes as a surprise to many market observers. Previous interactions between the regulatory body and ETF issuers gave little indication of impending approvals, leading to speculation about the catalyst for this sudden shift. Some sources point to recent bipartisan pressure from House lawmakers urging the SEC to align its treatment of Ethereum ETFs with its prior acceptance of spot Bitcoin ETFs.This unexpected move has already triggered notable market reactions. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust, for example, witnessed its discount shrink from 24% to 6% as its conversion to an ETF draws nearer. This conversion allows holders to exchange shares for the equivalent cash value of the underlying Ether.While Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed significant inflows since their approval, amassing an additional 207,000 Bitcoin ($14 billion) on top of the 621,000 Bitcoin ($42 billion) already held by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust pre-conversion, it remains to be seen whether Ethereum ETFs will garner the same level of investor interest.

FTX examiner recommends further investigation into shortfalls, S&C's legal representation

The court-appointed examiner, Robert J. Cleary, has released a detailed report recommending additional investigations into several aspects of the collapsed FTX Group, particularly focusing on FTX.US, its asset management practices, and its legal representation by Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C).Cleary’s report, submitted to the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, outlines the necessity of three primary investigations to further clarify the circumstances surrounding FTX Group’s downfall.ShortfallsThe first key recommendation centers on FTX.US balance sheet shortfalls. The report highlights significant concerns over recurring “holes” or shortfalls in FTX.US’s balance sheet.These gaps, particularly evident in November 2022, suggest possible commingling of customer and corporate assets — indicating a potential misuse of funds.The examiner emphasized the need for a comprehensive investigation to determine the causes, frequency, and resolution of these shortfalls, which may uncover additional misconduct and bolster public confidence in the bankruptcy process.The examiner also recommended a probe into the pre-bankruptcy sale of Ledger Holdings Inc. (LHI) to West Realm Shires Inc., seeking to identify potential avoidance actions against former shareholders who might still hold claims against the estate.The inquiry could provide deeper insights into the transactions leading up to the bankruptcy and uncover additional assets for recovery.S&C’s representationThe examiner called for a focused inquiry into the role of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP (S&C), the law firm representing FTX, particularly concerning its representation of Sam Bankman-Fried during his purchase of Robinhood shares.The investigation aims to determine whether S&C was aware of the fraudulent activities within FTX and whether there were any conflicts of interest that the court should have considered when approving their retention as counsel.If S&C’s representation of Samuel Bankman-Fried during his purchase of Robinhood Markets shares is found to be improper or conflicted, it could have legal and financial implications for Bankman-Fried and other individuals involved.This might include revisiting the transactions and potentially reversing or renegotiating terms. It would also disqualify the law firm from representing debtors further in the bankruptcy proceedings.S&C controversyS&C’s broader representation of FTX has generated significant controversy. Bankman-Fried claimed S&C pressured him into bankruptcy to earn legal fees in December 2022, while former FTX CTO Daniel Friedberg alleged misconduct in January 2023.Reports in 2023 indicated that S&C billed FTX approximately $70 million over five months of bankruptcy proceedings. As of April 2024, the firm has charged $170 million in cumulative fees, according to Bloomberg.The matter entered civil courts in February 2024, as former FTX investigators filed a class action suit alleging the firm aided FTX’s wrongdoing.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

AI tokens surge as whales dive in: What's next for RNDR, FET? - AMBCrypto



Whales began to accumulate AI tokens as Nvidia saw profits.
Declining network growth could impact these tokens negatively in the long run.

Interest in the AI tokens in the crypto space has grown significantly over the last few days. One of the main reasons for the surge in price for the AI tokens would be the behaviour of whales.
Whales move in
Santiment’s recent data revealed a notable increase in whale activity within the AI sector, and Render [RNDR] has been a significant part of this trend.
A prominent whale made a substantial move on the 23rd of May by transferring 4.89 million RNDR, valued at $52.1 million, to an unknown wallet. This transaction occurred amidst a period of price correction.
 
Source: Santiment
Nvidia comes to the rescue
One of the reasons for the surge in price for AI tokens such as RNDR was the success of NVDIA.
Chip-making tech giant Nvidia recently announced its Q1 earnings, revealing a record quarterly revenue of $26 billion, surpassing market expectations by 5.5%.
The rise in AI token prices coincides with investor anticipation for Nvidia’s quarterly earnings report. The success of Nvidia is perceived as the AI sector making progress. Hence, AI tokens have gained significantly after the Nvidia earnings call.
But it wasn’t just RNDR that had benefited from this. Other tokens such as Fetch.ai [FET] and Bittensor[TAO] also witnessed a massive surge in interest and surged by 20% and 5% respectively over the last week.

Read Render’s [RNDR] Price Prediction 2024-25

Even though the price of these tokens surged, there were some problems that persisted. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data indicated that the network growth for FET and RDNR fell significantly.
This meant that the number of new addresses interacting with these tokens had plummeted. If the trend continues it can cause major price corrections for these tokens in the future.

Why Dogecoin Founder Billy Markus Believes That Ethereum Will Reach $100,000 | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus (also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto) has given an interesting prediction into how high Ethereum (ETH) could rise. He made this statement while suggesting that he invested heavily in the second-largest crypto token. 
Ethereum To Rise To $100,000
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Markus raised the possibility of Ethereum rising to $100,000, remarking that he needs the crypto token to reach this price level so he can finally purchase a house in Los Angeles. Markus’ prediction for ETH is undoubtedly one of the most ultra-bullish predictions for the crypto token and ETH reaching this price mark will be huge.

For one, Ethereum rising to $100,000 will give it a market cap of $12 trillion based on its current circulating supply. That will place the crypto token way above the most valued companies in the world based on their market cap. Meanwhile, it will also mean exponential growth for the crypto market as a whole, given that other crypto tokens like the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, will see their prices also rise significantly. 
Meanwhile, several factors will have to contribute to ETH reaching such heights. Firstly, the crypto token will have to enjoy mainstream adoption on an unprecedented level. That means that the crypto token will be widely adopted not just by retail or even institutional investors but also by different countries and their central banks.
Furthermore, the Ethereum network will have to address scalability in its entirety, as it could be a major stumbling block to its adoption. Ethereum’s development team has undoubtedly made progress, especially with the recent Decun upgrade. However, there is evidently room for more improvement if the network is to be adopted by people from all walks of life. 
In the meantime, ETH is still expected to experience significant growth, although nowhere close to $100,000, given how it has firmly established itself as the second-largest crypto token. Recent developments like the potential approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs also paint a bullish outlook for ETH. 
How High Can ETH Rise In This Bull Run?
Crypto analysts like Altcoin Daily and CrediBULL Crypto have given insights into how high Ethereum could rise in this bull run. Altcoin Daily mentioned that Ethereum’s rise to $10,000 is “programmed.” Interestingly, he alluded to the Spot Ethereum ETFs as one of the factors that will drive this price surge. 

CrediBULL Crypto gave a more bullish prediction, stating that Ethereum could hit a market peak of almost $20,000. He explained that this price target was attainable based on his belief that Bitcoin can still see a 2x increase from its current price level. 
At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,790, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe price of Ethereum has has largely remained flat following the historic approval of eight spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that give investors exposure to the second-biggest digital asset by market cap.Ethereum's price hit $3,856 within minutes of the confirmed approval, per data from CoinGecko, then dipped down to $3,771. It's up to $3,825 as of this writing, but so far, the moves have been relatively minuscule.ETH is up a little more than 1% on the day, but over the past seven days, the asset is up a massive 30%.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had been quiet on the products for months, leading industry observers and analysts to expect the regulator to say no to them.But things changed this week when rumors dropped claiming that the SEC was expected to say yes to the funds. Fund managers started refiling paperwork and making amendments to important forms—signs that the products were about to be approved.And today, they got the green light. The products allow ordinary investors to buy shares that trade on a stock exchange and track the price of the digital asset.Ethereum—and other digital coins and tokens—can be daunting for traditional investors to buy, sell, and store. Popular, recognized, and regulated investment vehicles like ETFs simplify the process and allow people to get involved in the crypto world without being tech savvy.The SEC in January reluctantly gave the green light of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.

Phantom Wallet Rises to Third in Apple App Store Utilities, Signaling Potential Solana Surge



                    

Phantom Wallet has achieved the third position in the utility category on the Apple App Store, trailing only behind Google and Google Chrome. 



This surge has ignited speculation among crypto enthusiasts that it could be a bullish signal for Solana’s token, as Phantom Wallet originally launched exclusively as a Solana wallet.




“Seems like the SOL season is going to be Big! What SOL coins shall I buy?” crypto entrepreneur Evan Luthra asked his 413,900 X followers on May 19.



“Phantom wallet is the 3rd top utilities app I’m so bullish on crypto and Solana,” added crypto influencer Borovik.



This comes after Phantom Wallet reached seven million monthly active users, according to an April 29 post on X.




The crypto community often views a rise in any crypto wallet’s monthly users as a sign of broader adoption.



In the overall Apple App Store, Phantom Wallet now holds the 32nd spot across all categories, behind X and the AI chatbot, ChatGPT.



Initially a Solana-only wallet, Phantom has expanded its support to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon blockchains as well.



As of this publication, Solana is trading at $174.11, marking a 25.13% increase over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap.

Crypto trader Shear suggests that if Coinbase — currently ranked 288th — and Phantom Wallet both reach the top 10 on the Apple App Store, it could indicate a market peak.



“These are my favorite indicators, I will be selling everything when they are both top 10,” Shear stated in a May 18 post.



An app’s ranking on the App Store depends on various factors, not just download numbers. 



Despite MetaMask holding the 75th position in the same category, it reported 10 million monthly active users as of February 2024.



Rankings also consider factors such as monthly uninstalls, in-app transactions, and user sentiment in reviews.



Phantom Wallet, being a self-custodial wallet, allows users to maintain control over their keys. 



This feature offers an alternative to storing assets on exchanges, a shift potentially driven by the high-profile collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, prompting users to seek more secure storage options for their crypto assets.

SEC rule approvals set stage for spot ether ETF launches - Blockworks


The Securities and Exchange Commission signed off on ether ETF proposals Thursday, bringing their potential launches one step closer.
The US securities regulator approved 19b-4 proposals submitted by the Cboe, NYSE Arca and Nasdaq exchanges “on an accelerated basis,” according to a notice posted on the agency’s website just after 5 pm ET.
Those three exchanges seek to list spot ether ETFs by VanEck, Ark Invest, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, Grayscale and Invesco. The SEC order is one step toward those planned funds hitting the market.
“After careful review, the commission finds that the proposals are consistent with the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,” the Thursday SEC order states.
The Exchange Act is designed to “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” as well as “protect investors and the public interest,” the SEC notes.
Prior to any spot ether ETFs being able to trade, however, the SEC must also approve S-1 registration statements filed by the fund issuers. 
Industry watchers have noted the S-1 approvals could take time.
“There will be days (at a minimum), likely at least weeks, and potentially months between approval and launches here,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in a Tuesday X post. 
A winding road
Movement toward possible ether ETF approval accelerated earlier this week when Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas upped the 19b-4 approval odds from 25% to 75% — citing increased engagement between the SEC and fund groups.
The SEC had until May 23 to rule on a proposal by fund group VanEck, and until May 24 to decide on another by Ark Invest and 21Shares. Still, it was expected the regulator would approve or deny the full slate of ether ETFs before them.

Some have said the SEC’s seeming change of heart to get ether ETFs approved could be linked to recent political developments just months ahead of the presidential election. 
Read more: Politics, amendments, staking: Making sense of the ether ETF developments
To that end, the House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act on Wednesday. That same day, five congressmen penned a letter to Gensler urging the SEC to approve spot ether ETFs.   
Others interpreted the lack of SEC engagement with issuers (until the last few days) differently.
Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said in a series of March posts on X that the SEC had ironed out many details — related to custody, authorized participants and creation-redemption procedures, for example — in the lead-up to spot bitcoin ETF approvals in January.
Indeed, 21Shares co-founder Ophelia Snyder said in a March interview with Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz that because of overlap with the bitcoin and ether ETF proposals, there was “less to look at” for the SEC.
One of the main differences between spot bitcoin ETFs and the ether fund proposals, however, involved issuers looking to stake their ETH holdings.
Staking ether involves depositing ETH to help secure the Ethereum blockchain — and earning yield in exchange for doing so.
Stock exchanges and issuers amended their filings in recent days to remove language around staking — a feature of the planned funds that segment observers predicted the SEC would oppose.
Despite many increasing their odds on SEC approval of ether ETFs in recent days, questions remained around the status of ether as a security or commodity, for example.
Variant Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted that SEC approval of spot ether ETFs would likely mean the agency does not view unstaked ETH a security, calling such a scenario “a major policy move.”

Ethereum ETFs Approved in Abrupt SEC Policy About-Face - Decrypt

In a stunning reversal, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Thursday that it has approved eight applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, effectively green-lighting Ethereum trading on Wall Street.The following funds were approved in the filing: the converted Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, ARK/21 Shares Ethereum ETF, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Franklin Ethereum ETF.When will the spot Ethereum ETFs begin trading? It won't be tomorrow. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart suggested in a tweet that it could be a "couple weeks" before the fund managers' S-1 documents are approved to enable trading.Just one week ago, most financial experts and crypto industry leaders had written off such an outcome as increasingly unlikely. For one, the SEC had offered little indication that it planned to move forward with any spot ETH ETF applications prior to a looming May 23 deadline.What's more, just weeks prior, a lawsuit filed by Ethereum software company Consensys against the SEC alleged that the regulator has secretly considered ETH to be an illegal, unregistered security for over a year. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) If the SEC formally labeled ETH a security, then Ethereum ETFs would need to be approved via a different process than the one currently underway. Thus, in approving spot ETH ETFs today, the SEC has tacitly conceded that ETH is not a security in and of itself. Such an outcome is a major victory for crypto advocates, given ETH’s crucial role in underpinning the Ethereum network—upon which many of the industry’s most prominent projects and services are built.  Crucially, however—in a bid to get over the finish line—several ETH ETF issuers dropped language from their applications this week regarding the staking of customer ETH. Ever since Ethereum transitioned to a proof of stake system in September 2022, ETH holders have been able to deposit their funds with the network to accrue rewards. The SEC has long taken the view that when a financial intermediary offers staking services, it is engaging in an illegally unregistered securities scheme.Spot Ethereum ETFs—unlike ETH futures ETFs, which track derivatives contracts and were approved by the SEC in October—involve issuers actually buying and storing ETH on behalf of their clients. Now that spot ETH ETFs have gained approval, traditional financial institutions and investors will soon be able to gain exposure to ETH without holding any crypto themselves. Today’s historic action follows the SEC’s approval of eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications in January. Since then, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted nearly $13 billion in net in-flows. “I always called the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, Bitcoin’s IPO,” Cody Carbone, chief policy officer at the crypto lobbying group Digital Chamber of Commerce told Decrypt. “This is ETH’s IPO. That is a massive stamp of approval.”Edited by Andrew HaywardEditor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ether (ETH) ETFs Clear Major Hurdle, Though SEC Hasn't Cleared Them for Trading Yet

"The introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs in January has already demonstrated significant benefits for the digital assets and ETF space, and we believe that spot Ether ETFs will similarly provide safeguards for U.S. investors, allowing them to gain Ether exposure in a transparent, well-regulated and easily accessible structure," he said.

Bonk Inu (BONK) Flips Floki Inu (FLOKI) Following a 15% Daily Surge: Details


																TL;DR

Solana-based meme coin Bonk Inu saw a 15% daily and 45% monthly price increase. Its market capitalization is nearing $2.5 billion, surpassing Floki Inu.
Pepe (PEPE) is another meme coin making the headlines, hitting a new all-time high after a 110% monthly ascent. Its market cap exceeded $6 billion, making it the third-largest in its cohort.


BONK Surpasses its Rival
The cryptocurrency market has been booming lately amid expectations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will give the thumbs up on Ethereum ETFs before the end of this week. Somewhat expectedly, Ethereum (ETH) is among the best performers, registering a 6% increase on a daily scale and 30% over the past month. 
However, it is not the only one well in the green, with other assets even outperforming its gains. An evident example is the Solana-based meme coin Bonk Inu, whose price jumped by 15% in the last 24 hours and 45% on a 30-day basis. The token currently hovers around the $0.00003683 mark, which is its highest level in almost three months. 
BONK’s market capitalization is inching toward $2.5 billion, surpassing Floki Inu as the fifth-largest meme coin. FLOKI has a current market cap of $2.2 billion.

BONK Market Cap, Source: CoinGecko
According to some analysts, BONK’s rally is nowhere near its end. The X user Crypto Chase claimed the asset is currently experiencing a “bullish breakout” after two months of consolidation. In their view, a potential correction could offer a great buying opportunity. 




PEPE is the Rock Star
BONK is not the only meme coin making the headlines recently, with Pepe (PEPE) claiming much of the glory. The frog-themed asset hit an all-time high on May 22 only to see that record beaten today (May 23).
It is currently worth around $0.00001438 (per CoinGecko’s data), a whopping 110% jump on a monthly scale. PEPE’s market capitalization exceeded $6 billion, making it the third-biggest meme coin and the 24th-largest cryptocurrency. 
Spiking by double digits in a short period of time is part of the meme coin’s nature. However, they can also be quite dangerous, with their infamous volatility leading to crucial losses for inexperienced traders.

SEC Approves Spot Ethereum ETFs in Landmark Decision - The Defiant

The SEC has issued an omnibus approval for eight ETH ETF issuers.Just over four months after Bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has greenlit trading of eight exchange-traded funds backed by spot Ether.The agency issued an “order granting accelerated approval of proposed rule changes, as modified by amendments thereto, to list and trade shares of ether-based exchange-traded products.”Exchanges NYSE Arca, Nasdaq and Cbose BZX Funds which applied for a rule change to list and trade ETH ETFs, received approval to trade the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust, the VanEck Ethereum Trust, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Franklin Templeton's Franklin Ethereum ETF.The Commission said it found that the the Proposals are consistent with rules designed to “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” and, “in general, to protect investorsand the public interest.”ETH Price VolatilityIt’s been a volatile day for ETH, which has soared nearly 30% in the past week in anticipation of today’s landmark decision. The second-largest cryptocurrency traded as high as $3,960 earlier today before briefly dipping under $3,600. ETH is currently changing hands for $3,720.Ethereum ETFs will provide ETH exposure to financial institutions that want to use traditional financial rails and avoid using crypto exchanges, custody, and private keys.Ethereum bulls will hope that these new ETFs see comparable levels of interest from TradFi investors who have plowed more than $13 billion into Bitcoin ETFs to date.Before Ethereum ETFs start trading, the SEC has to approve two forms filed by applicants, 19b-4 and S-1.Today’s decision comes after a whirlwind week in which analysts’ approval odds swung from 25% to 75%. The shift left exchanges and issuers scrambling to update filings to meet the agency’s demands.

Intro to BLASTR | Bankless


Blast is currently the only Layer 2 (L2) that offers native yield via ETH staking and real world assets (RWAs).The idea? Holders of ETH and stablecoins on Blast automatically earn interest simply for holding their assets on the network. One project that’s built an interesting creator monetization avenue around this model is BLASTR, a platform that makes it easy to create and collect “unruggable” NFTs. via BLASTRThat’s because BLASTR integrates with Blast’s yield system to offer a secure and profitable environment for NFTs. Here’s how it works:Collection Setup: Creators can set up their NFT collections by defining mint prices, supply, and time lock durations. Each collection launches its own ERC721 smart contract, ensuring DIY control over funds and decisions.Minting Process: When an NFT is minted, the ETH used is locked in the smart contract for the specified duration. This ETH generates yield through Blast’s native yield system.Refundable NFTs: Post-lock period, NFTs can be refunded. If a holder opts for a refund, the NFT is burned, and the ETH is returned.Revenue Generation: Creators earn BLAST native yield from the ETH locked in their contracts, not to mention Blast Points and Blast Gold. For example, BLASTR’s calculator estimates ~22.22 ETH in yearly revenues for a 5,555 collection minted at 0.1 ETH a pop. via BLASTRThat said, collectors can also earn Points and Gold rewards by collecting NFTs on BLASTR. Simply browse the existing collections, find one whose price and benefits suit you, and then mint your desired amount. As mentioned before, the ETH you use for minting will be locked, accruing yield over time for the NFT creator. Once the lock-up period ends, you can keep your NFT or get a refund, ensuring a risk-free collecting experience. On the flip side, creating an NFT collection on BLASTR is also straightforward. It just takes a handful of steps:Initiate Your Collection: Connect your wallet on blastr.xyz/create and start a new collection by filling out the main details such as name, description, mint price, and supply.Customize: Stylize your collection with images, banners, and social media links as you see fit.  Prep Your Contract: Define your smart contract details and prepare your artwork. BLASTR has created a helpful guide on uploading art to IPFS if you need help here. Finalize: Customize your public and private minting phase settings and then press the “Deploy” button. Launch: Once deployed, your collection page will be live. Here you can edit your collection as needed or press “Launch public mint” to kick off your drop. Note, the first 5 minutes will be reserved for BLASTR Keys holders. via BLASTRLooking ahead, if BLASTR has continued success, it could inspire more platforms to adopt similar models, i.e. integrating native Blast yield into their apps. In the meantime, BLASTR’s use cases are wide open, from DAO memberships to onchain subscription services, so keep an eye on it as a novel onchain way for creators to monetize their work.

SEC approved eight Spot Ether ETFs

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has approved eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the country. In a landmark decision on Thursday evening, the financial watchdog approved 19b-4 forms for the ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton.Nvidia earnings stun the street and the stock is soaringBlackRock, Bitwise, Grayscale, Van Eck, Ark 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin, and Invesco had previously amended their 19b-4 filings with the SEC to eliminate provisions for staking, a crypto rewards system. By doing this, these financial companies hoped to obtain approval more easily. The 19b-4 filings are documents that national exchanges like the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) submit to the SEC to request approval for listing new products on their trading platforms.The crypto industry has welcomed the SEC’s decision, hailing it as a groundbreaking development.Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink, a decentralized blockchain oracle network built on Ethereum, said in an email that the decision proves that the capital markets are now getting involved in the crypto industry.“One of the most important aspects of this ETF approval is the spotlight it places on the potential of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), which are critical use cases for Ethereum,” he said.Similarly, Paul Marino, Chief Revenue Officer at GraniteShares, said in an email that the approval from the SEC is another validation that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are real, a big part of the future of investing, and here to stay.“Those who make ‘pet rock’ statements regarding Bitcoin and others who continue to say ‘I just don’t get it’ when referring to crypto would benefit from doing some research to learn how the tokenization of assets will change what we know about investing today,” Marino said.The latest move follows the SEC approval earlier this year of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which pushed Bitcoin to an all-time high. The approval of the spot Ether ETF application is a historic moment for the crypto industry, as financial giants have been waiting for it for years.Crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital had predicted earlier in the day that there could be a potential 60% increase in the price of Ether. It suggested that Ether could surge to around $6,000 if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves spot Ethereum ETFs.Meanwhile, the crypto market didn’t jump immediately after the news. Bitcoin was down 2%, trading around $67,000, while Ether was up 1%, hovering around $3,800 on Thursday evening.The SEC’s approval follows the United States House of Representatives voting in favor of the crypto bill called “The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.” The bill would effectively classify cryptocurrency as a commodity, not a security, and therefore exempt it from securities regulations. It would also determine the oversight of cryptocurrencies and whether they should be regulated by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, it still needs to be passed by the Senate and signed into law by the president.

Ethereum ETF Proposals Clear Key SEC Hurdle in Sudden Crypto Turnaround - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission appears ready to pass eight spot Ethereum ETFs after expectations on their approval flipped overnight.
The agency just approved form 19b-4 filings from BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, Ark, Franklin Templeton and Invesco Galaxy simultaneously.










Although the products have nearly obtained the full go-ahead, the SEC must approve the firms’ S-1 registration filings before trading can begin.
Expectations on the approval of the ETFs turned on a dime when the agency reportedly changed its tune on the filings and began following procedures that preceded the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.
Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas cautions that trading for the Ethereum ETFs is likely weeks away.
“TO BE CLEAR: This does not mean they will begin trading tomorrow. This is just 19b-4 approval. Also needs to be an approval on the S-1 documents which is going to take time. We’re expecting it to take a couple weeks but could take longer. Should know more within a week or so!”
The second-largest crypto asset is up 1.5% in the last 24 hours, at $3,804.

Bitcoin Price Explosion Incoming? History Hints at $140,000 After $70,000 Breach | Cryptoglobe


                                
Historical data suggests that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) could soon explode upward to near the $140,000 mark after it recently moved strongly upward to touch the $70,000 level for the first time in a month.



Bitcoin’s surge above its 2021 peak around $69,000 has kindled speculation about its potential next move, and analysts are drawing parallels too its past bull cycles, where the cryptocurrency’s price moved sharply upward after hitting new highs.



Historically, Bitcoin has seen substantial price increases following breaches of all-time highs. After its 2013 peak of roughly $1,130, the price didn’t surpass that level until 2017, however, within three months of breaking the record, Bitcoin’s value doubled. Similarly, when the 2017 all-time high of $20,000 was eclipsed in December 2020, Bitcoin’s price doubled again within a month.



This historical trend has some analysts predicting a potential doubling of Bitcoin’s current price in the coming months to near $140,000.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The analyst noted that while the 2021 high was surpassed back in March, previous rallies also saw multi-week declines before resuming their upward trajectories. The current market seems to be mirroring this behavior, with a 23% correction in early May followed by a period of relative stability.



As reported another cryptocurrency analyst, Wily Woo, has said the price of BTC could soon see a short squeeze that would see the price of the flagship cryptocurrency moves to a new all-time high. Bitcoin, it’s worth noting, is currently very close to its all-time high, which was slightly above the $73,500 mark.



Notably, data shows that institutional investors have entered the cryptocurrency space with force, with data suggesting that deep-pocketed investors gained interest in the space after the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, leading to whales accumulating over $16 billion in BTC since.

Bitcoin (BTC) saw a similarly hectic episode sinking to the low-$66,000s, then spiking to $68,300 before paring gains below $68,000. However, ETH performed stronger, advancing 1.5% over the past 24 hours, compared to BTC's almost 3% decline during the same period. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index was down 1.6% during the day.

AI Pioneer Geoffrey Hinton Advises UK Government to Consider Universal Basic Income to Combat Job Losses



                    

Geoffrey Hinton, a prominent figure in artificial intelligence (AI) often dubbed the “Godfather of AI,” recently advised the United Kingdom’s government at Downing Street to consider adopting a universal basic income (UBI) to mitigate the anticipated job losses due to AI advancements.



Until recently, Hinton was employed at Google, working on sophisticated AI features for neural networks.




These networks form the backbone of modern generative AI systems like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.



Hinton asserts that the AI revolution will disproportionately benefit the wealthy. 



He warned that common workers and those in automatable jobs will likely lose their livelihoods, which he believes “is going to be bad for society,” as he explained in a recent BBC interview.




“I was consulted by people in Downing Street,” Hinton stated, “and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea.”



Hinton is not alone in this belief. Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI and a former student of Hinton, is also a strong advocate for UBI. 



Altman, who helped pioneer neural networks, is now known for his leadership at OpenAI and his vocal support for UBI.



Altman’s venture, Worldcoin, aims to provide UBI through a cryptocurrency token, given free to those who enroll and complete a retinal scan for identity verification.

Both Hinton and Altman believe that UBI is crucial to counter the economic disruption caused by automation. 



Additionally, they have expressed concerns about AI posing an existential threat to humanity.



Hinton left Google to openly discuss his apprehensions about AI’s future impact on society. 



Altman, on the other hand, claims that his primary motivation for co-founding OpenAI with Elon Musk and others was to ensure that advanced AI systems are developed responsibly and beneficially for humanity.



In his BBC interview, Hinton emphasized the urgency of addressing these issues, predicting that within five to 20 years, there’s a significant chance that society will face the challenge of AI attempting to assert control. 



“My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over.”

                        In a dramatic turn of events, Tigran Gambaryan, a detained executive of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, collapsed in court due to alleged ill health during his ongoing money laundering trial on May 23, as reported by Vanguard. The incident occurred at the Federal High Court in Abuja shortly after the case was called for continuation before Justice Emeka Nwite.Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen, and British-Kenyan national Nadeem Anjarwalla face charges of laundering over $35 million and engaging in specialized financial activities without a license. Both executives have pleaded not guilty.Detained Binance Executive Slumped During Trial
The courtroom drama unfolded when Gambaryan, Binance’s head of financial crimes compliance, did not immediately step forward to the dock when the case was called. Seated in the back row, he was assisted by his lawyer towards the dock but collapsed en route and had to be sat in the front row.Gambaryan’s lawyer informed the court of his client’s deteriorating health and the submission of a written application notifying the court of his condition.“My lord, the case may not certainly proceed today,” Mordi stated, explaining that Gambaryan had been indisposed and required medical attention.Since February, Gambaryan’s health issues have reportedly worsened. A letter presented to Judge Emeka Nwite highlighted that Gambaryan had broken down and received intravenous treatment for malaria the previous day. Consequently, he was also absent from a tax evasion trial held the day before.Judge Nwite ruled that Gambaryan should receive treatment at the hospital recommended by his lawyer or another designated by prison authorities. The trial has been adjourned to June 20 and 21 to allow Gambaryan’s medical treatment.The case has attracted considerable attention, especially given Nigeria’s ongoing economic challenges. The country has accused Binance of contributing to its currency woes, as Binance and other cryptocurrency platforms have become famous for trading the Nigerian naira amid severe dollar shortages and a plummeting currency.Throughout the proceedings, Gambaryan was visibly weak, leaning on the armrest of his seat. Tax Evasion Charges Against Binance
The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has filed tax evasion charges against Binance Holdings Limited and Gambaryan. Due to his absence, however, the trial could not proceed on Wednesday and has now been moved to June 14.Gambaryan, reportedly held at Kuje Prison, did not appear for his scheduled arraignment, confusing the lawyers. Justice Emeka Nwite, overseeing the case, had previously denied Gambaryan’s bail application due to new money laundering charges filed by the EFCC and deemed him a flight risk. The prosecution and defense argued over the failure to ensure Gambaryan’s presence, leading to the adjournment.Gambaryan’s absence from the arraignment session highlighted procedural issues, as his lawyer argued that the prosecution should have ensured his presence given his federal custody status.Anjarwalla, who escaped custody in March, is still involved in the case but has not been officially marked as “at large,” which could complicate proceedings since Nigerian law requires all parties to be served for the case to move forward.

                        The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just approved eight spot Ethereum ETF applications through an omnibus order on Thursday in a landmark move signaling growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance.The SEC’s decision arrived just four months after the regulator greenlit the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a rapid shift in the regulatory environment.Ethereum ETF Approvals Follow Last-Minute Scramble
The SEC granted approval for 19b-4 forms submitted by financial giants, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. Despite the initial hurdle being cleared, ETF issuers now face another: ensuring their S-1 registration statements become effective before trading can commence.Although the SEC recently initiated discussions with issuers regarding these S-1 forms, the timeline is currently uncertain. Some analysts speculate a turnaround within weeks, while others point to historical precedents exceeding three months.SEC Faces Scrutiny Over Unexpected Shift
The SEC’s decision comes as a surprise to many market observers. Previous interactions between the regulatory body and ETF issuers gave little indication of impending approvals, leading to speculation about the catalyst for this sudden shift. Some sources point to recent bipartisan pressure from House lawmakers urging the SEC to align its treatment of Ethereum ETFs with its prior acceptance of spot Bitcoin ETFs.The unexpected move has already triggered notable market reactions. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust, for example, witnessed its discount shrink from 24% to 6% as its conversion to an ETF draws nearer. The conversion allows holders to exchange shares for the equivalent cash value of the underlying Ether.While Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed huge inflows since their approval, amassing an additional 207,000 Bitcoin ($14 billion) on top of the 621,000 Bitcoin ($42 billion) already held by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust pre-conversion, whether Ethereum ETFs will receive the same level of investor interest is unclear.

SEC Approves 8 Spot Ethereum ETFs, ETH Market Rejoices


In a landmark decision, the U.S. SEC has approved eight spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity. 
This approval follows the first spot in Bitcoin ETFs, marking another milestone in the cryptocurrency market.
SEC Approves 8 Ethereum ETFs 

The SEC has given the green light to the 19b-4 forms for these ETFs. However, issuers still need approval for their S-1 registration statements, which might take weeks or months. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that this process has historically taken over three months.
The SEC’s approval was unexpected due to the lack of prior interaction with the ETF issuers. The SEC’s sudden request for the 19b-4 forms has sparked speculation about the reasons for this shift.
Some insiders suggest political pressure might have influenced this decision. Before the approval, a bipartisan group of lawmakers urged the SEC to approve these ETFs, arguing that the Bitcoin ETF approval set a precedent for Ethereum.
In response to the news of the approval, ETH’s price increased from $3,675 to $3,856. However, at the time of writing, it is now trading at $3,816.

Following this announcement, stakeholders have expressed their expectations for further industry growth. Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, commented on the spot Ethereum ETF approval.


“The Ethereum ETF approval is a second large step forward for the crypto industry. It proves that the capital markets are now getting involved in the crypto industry in earnest for some of their largest user bases and most widely used products,” Nazarov told BeInCrypto.

He also pointed out the significance of assets utilizing smart contracts being officially approved by the SEC.

“One of the most important aspects of this ETF approval is the spotlight it places on the potential of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), which are critical use cases for Ethereum. In our daily work with global banks, asset managers, and financial market infrastructures, we continue to observe increasing interest in smart contracts, the adoption of blockchain technology, and a growing interest in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class,” Nazarov added.

Analyst Predicts An "Ultra Bull" Scenario For Bitcoin That Could Send Price To $80,000


																A crypto analyst has forecasted an “ultra bull scenario” for Bitcoin, highlighting key support levels and technical patterns that suggest a price rally above $80,000 in this market cycle. 
Bitcoin Could See Upside Above $80,000
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, a crypto analyst identified as ‘CrediBullCrypto’ has doubled down on his previous prediction of an ultra-bull scenario for Bitcoin in the future. The analyst’s insights on Bitcoin’s recent activities suggest that the downside risk may be less significant than previously anticipated, paving a bullish path for a massive upside for Bitcoin. 

	Related Reading


Sharing a graphical chart of Bitcoin’s price actions from April to May 2024 in a YouTube video, Credibull Crypto predicted that Bitcoin could see its price rising above $100,000 in this projected ultra-bull scenario. The focal point of his analysis was based on the Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin’s perpetual futures on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.
Source: X
According to the crypto analyst, Open Interest has reached 78,000 BTC, significantly higher than its baseline of 64,000 BTC. CrediBull Crypto revealed that this current Open Interest was in a danger zone. This is because the 14,000 BTC difference typically indicates elevated market activities, which often precede volatile price movements. 
Additionally, the CrediBull Crypto revealed that a single unidentified Bitcoin whale was responsible for approximately 10,000 BTC of the increased 14,000 BTC Open Interest. This means that the anonymous whale controls 70% of all the added Open Interest on Binance perpetual futures since the baseline. 
He also disclosed that in the scenario where the anonymous whale can withstand 10% to 15% downward pressure without liquidating their assets, the actual available Open Interest that would be vulnerable to a decline would be only 4,000 BTC, instead of the initial 14,000 BTC addition. The analyst revealed that out of the 4,000 BTC, some would be directional shorts, noting that the net long positions at risk would be even lower.  
Given this theory, CrediBull Crypto argued that the potential for a downside is more limited. As a result, the ultra bull scenario where Bitcoin’s price surges to new all-time highs was worth considering. 
Potential Retracement Towards $60,000
In his YouTube video, CrediBull Crypto also highlighted a potential retracement slightly above the $60,000 price mark. The analyst predicted a bearish scenario, where Bitcoin could see its price falling significantly towards $62,000 to $63,000.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $69,774, reflecting a 0.08% decrease in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. CrediBull Crypto disclosed that Bitcoin had failed to break through key resistance levels above $70,000. 
He predicts that consistent declines and liquidations could potentially trigger a bottom below $60,000. However, he also revealed that such a bearish turnaround was highly unlikely at this time, as Bitcoin’s price movements currently indicates an ultra bullish scenario.

XRP Golden Cross Denied, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Got Saved, Ethereum (ETH) Ready to Continue Rally?

XRP's recent performance has been under intense scrutiny, especially with its inability to break through the 50 EMA and establish a foothold above it. This situation is critical for XRP as failing to overcome this resistance level raises the risk of a further correction, potentially halting the current rally.XRP's inability to break through the 50 EMA certainly raises some concerns as, at this point in time, the asset is clearly struggling to maintain the current momentum.The 50-day Exponential Moving Average is acting as a good resistance to the price with the blue trendline. The fact that XRP struggles to float above this line adds some negativity to the mix, meaning one can read that bulls are not strong enough to hold on given the existing momentum. It has to be convincingly across this 50 EMA to have any hope of a continuation rally.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewFurther complicating matters, the Bollinger Bands are showing absolutely no expansion right now — generally a leading indicator for rising volatility and more room for price action to develop. In fact, they are barely tight, suggesting more consolidation for the time being than any kind of clear bullish breakout.However, there is that possible watershed level around $0.53. Here, if XRP manages to cross over this level, then it could light up new buying interest. But trading should be focusing on the $0.55 and $0.61 price thresholds. These are resistance points to get past before confirming the XRP trend and nullifying the potentially bigger price correction.The Relative Strength Index is at 52.31, showing neutrality on the market. This would suggest that XRP could break either way, something that will depend on market sentiment and other extraneous factors. Levels above 70 would indicate overbought conditions, and a drop below 30 would point toward oversold conditions.Shiba Inu's promising pictureLately, Shiba Inu has been showing a lot of promise for investors, managing to hold above the 50-day exponential moving average, thereby signifying strength. This is the level of the EMA that has been acting as the support level giving birth to the current price levels, thereby filling buyers with more confidence. Worthy of focus is the fact that an ascending channel has developed, which typically signals a consolidation phase just before a breakout. This also forms a good base for bulls, with additional support from the 50 EMA. The challenges in price within this channel show that SHIB can be preparing for something more valuable on the upside if current conditions hold.Even more encouraging is that the current price action has consistency in volume. Normal volume will help the current, prevailing trend to be sustained and further make it potentially lasting. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) resides at 50.98, thus leaving some room for the price to test higher levels before it can make a top.Look for key resistance levels. SHIB, breaking above recent highs with continued momentum, will have to target much higher levels. On the other hand, holding supports above the 50 EMA will help avoid bearish reversals.Ethereum to $4,000?Ethereum remains resilient, extricating itself very slowly but surely from bears, but at this point it cannot manage to break above $3,800. Price data reflects the belief that the indication of strength emanating from the hints to the upcoming price rally is after a correction toward $3,600.The price action on Ethereum looks good for now. The ETH/USD pair has had to struggle quite a bit to the upside, finding major support around the $3,600 level. This bounce is an important move and should stamp the level as one that is key to a reaction point going forward for Ethereum investors. Trading volume has also soared, making the market even more bullish.But in terms of technicals, the moving averages are a key indicator: the 50-day moving average (in blue) is now near the 200-day moving average (in orange). Once the 50-day moves above the 200-day, it will have completed a "golden cross," a classic bullish continuation sign. The last time this golden cross took place, it was accompanied by a huge uptick in price for ETH.If Ethereum can maintain the current momentum and exceed the resistance level at $3,800, it might jump to over $4,000 in its next target. All of this is supported by increased trading volumes and general positive market sentiment.

Wells Fargo Accused of Draining Customers' Accounts Without Notice or Authorization in 'Blatant Disregard' of Consumer Loan Protections: Class-Action Lawsuit - The Daily Hodl


								A Wells Fargo customer in California just filed a proposed class-action lawsuit accusing the bank of draining customers’ accounts in blatant violation of consumer protection laws.
The plaintiff, piano teacher Helen Palma, alleges Wells Fargo unlawfully seized funds from her bank account after she fell behind on credit card payments, reports ClassAction.org.










According to the filing, the bank won a judgement against Palma for outstanding credit card debt.
But the lawsuit claims Wells Fargo then abruptly drained Palma’s checking and savings accounts without obtaining a required bank levy – allegedly violating state laws that require banks to give customers proper notice, offer a chance to file a claim of exemption as well as leave a minimum balance of $1,900 in customer’s accounts.
“In blatant disregard of these rules, Wells Fargo skipped the legal process for a bank levy, which would have prevented it from taking any money out of [the plaintiff’s] accounts, and instead unlawfully helped itself to her funds and leave [sic] her with only $102.74 to her name.”
Palma’s class action seeks to protect all residents of California who may have had their funds illegally withdrawn by Wells Fargo within the last four years.
To date, Wells Fargo has not returned the funds to Palma and has never proved that it had authorization to seize them, according to the suit.
Specifically, the lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of violating the Truth in Lending Act, Rosenthal Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and California Unfair Competition Law.

And given that it will probably soon blast above $4,000, Ethereum could easily be the best crypto to buy right now.Ethereum ETFs could start trading as soon as next week. And if demand is stronger than expected, as happened with Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, ETH could soon hit all-time highs.While Ethereum’s prospects look good right now, smaller altcoins might be a better way to express Ethereum ecosystem growth bets.Let’s take a look at some candidates for the best crypto to buy today.Best Crypto to Buy TodayPepe (PEPE)
The third-largest meme coin Pepe (PEPE) has been pumping all week traders bet it will benefit from Ethereum ecosystem growth.PEPE reached new all-time highs of nearly $0.000016 earlier today and was last up 11% at $0.00001485.The meme coin’s market cap is currently $6.26 billion, leaving plenty of room for further growth.Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have market caps of $14.4 billion and $23 billion respectively after all.Despite recent upside, Pepe could still be the best crypto to buy now.Arbitrum (ARB)
Layer-2 Ethereum scaling blockchain Arbitrum could soon see a lot more liquidity in wake of Ethereum ETF approvals.Last up 5% on Thursday, Arbitrum (ARB) is trying to set the foundations for a rebound.It was last trading near $1.20. Importantly, that leaves it above its 21 and 50DMAs, suggesting bullish momentum may be seeping into the market.Arbitrum could soon power up towards earlier yearly highs. That could mean quick 2x gains for the crypto, making it potentially the best crypto to buy today.Arbitrum could soon power up towards earlier yearly highs, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewIn wake of news breaking that the SEC has proved eight Ethereum ETFs, crypto markets are experiencing volatility and investors are hunting for the best crypto to buy right now to benefit from Ethereum ecosystem growth.Bonk (BONK)
Bonk (BONK) isn’t a direct beneficiary of Ethereum ecosystem growth bets, as it’s based on Solana, but it’s nonetheless pumping.That’s probably as a result of a generalized pick-up in risk appetite, which tends to lift meme coins.With a market cap of around $2.36 billion, BONK is cheap compared to some of its major meme coin competitors.As mentioned, Pepe has a market cap of around $6.3 billion and Dogwifhat of around $3 billion.Bonk could be somewhat of a value play right now. That’s why it could be the best crypto to buy now.

Top Trader Reveals ‘Obvious’ Altcoin Play Amid Potential Spot Ethereum ETF Approval - The Daily Hodl


								A top crypto trader thinks one Ethereum (ETH)-based decentralized finance (DeFi) token is an “obvious play” amid recent ETH developments.
The pseudonymous analyst known as the Flow Horse tells his 216,500 followers on the social media platform X that the governance token of Ethena (ENA) looks promising.










“Looking to go for round 2 of a shift in the pace downward and possible turnaround.”
Source: TheFlowHorse/X
The Ethena Labs project includes the yield-earning “synthetic dollar” token USDe. The project aims to create a stable and scalable form of money in the crypto space without relying on traditional banking systems.
ENA is trading at $0.848 at time of writing. The 83rd-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 15% in the past week.
The Flow Horse notes that he primarily plans to focus on Ethereum, however.
“On a real note. I already see a ton of people talking about ETH beta. Do you know what most of my ETH beta will be? Leveraged ETH.
Think of the dirt that ETH was dragged through over the last year, and how unexpected this was. There is a lot of catching up to do, this is not priced in.”
This afternoon, the SEC approved Ethereum ETF form 19b-4 filings from BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, Ark, Franklin Templeton and Invesco Galaxy.
However, the approval of the firms’ S-1 registration filings remains outstanding.
ETH is trading at $3,738 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 24% in the past seven days.

Forget Equities? Crypto Analyst Predicts Boom for Hard Assets Like Bitcoin, Gold and Silver | Cryptoglobe


                                
Popular cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe has recently suggested that so-called hard assets, including cryptocurrencies, gold, and silver, are all currently “extremely” undervalued when compared to the U.S. dollar and equities, meaning we could be on the “edge of a big bull cycle” for these assets.



In a post shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) with his over 700,000 followers, van de Poppe noted these hard assets, including commodities, are a “must-have in the portfolio” given their potential to enter this “big bull cycle.”







Notably the stock market’s benchmark index, the S&P 500, has recently hit a new all-time high after rising more than 27% in a year, while BTC also moved to a new high above $73,500 before enduring a strong correction that saw it test the $58,000 mark before recovering, to now trade at $70,000.



Meanwhile, other metals, including gold and silver, have also been surging. Earlier this month, gold topped the $2,450 mark for the first time ever, and silver moved to an 11-year high above $32 as well.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Precious metals have been boosted by growing geopolitical tensions amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas. Moreover, these hard assets saw a boost after lower-than-expected inflation data in the U.S. boosted expectations the Federal Reserve could soon start cutting its benchmark interest rate.



Gold, in particular, has been seeing growing demand from central banks throughout the world, with China driving a significant part of that demand. Aside from central banks, demand for gold in China also comes from everyday investors collecting it in the form of “beans” meant to store value.



In the cryptocurrency space, a recent surge was triggered after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.

Ethereum Price Prediction as SEC Approves Ethereum ETFs – Where is ETH Headed Next? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Ethereum (ETH) price is trading choppy in late Thursday trade as in wake of news dropping that the US SEC has approved spot Ethereum ETFs, a spectacular u-turn that has shocked the market that, up until one week ago, was betting that Ethereum ETFs would be rejected this week.The Ethereum price was last trading around $3,800. That’s down sharply from earlier session highs near $4,000, but also up sharply from earlier session lows at $3,520.The Ethereum price has been choppy on Thursday in wake of spot Ethereum ETF approvals. Source: CoinMarketCapOn the week, the Ethereum price is up 24%. Rumors of an SEC u-turn first started on Monday.In the subsequent days, this was followed up by a flurry of engagement between ETF issuers and the SEC.All the while, traders aggressively bid up the Ethereum price on bets that ETFs will foster ecosystem growth.Everything culminated on Thursday when the SEC approved 8 spot Ethereum ETFs.Why Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Matters
Spot Ethereum ETF approvals in the US will push up the Ethereum price as institutional investors enter the market.Traders will recall Bitcoin surging to fresh record highs following spot Bitcoin ETF approvals earlier this year.Well, the Ethereum price could soon follow suit. Its current record highs are near $4,900, 28% up versus current levels.That will bring more liquidity to the Ethereum ecosystem, which should spur more adoption, activity and development.Ethereum ETFs should help solidify Ethereum’s status as the king of smart-contract-enabled blockchains.Ethereum Price Prediction – Where is ETH Headed Next?
Confirmation of the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could result in some short-term sell pressure.That would be reminiscent of what happened when spot Bitcoin ETFs garnered approval earlier this year.Some traders wait for confirmation of a positive market catalyst before taking profit.Assuming there is decent demand for Ethereum ETFs when they go live, ETH could soon go above $4,000.Uncertainty regarding Ethereum’s regulatory situation in the US prompted a lot of traders to short ETH versus other cryptos.The SEC was thought to have been campaigning to classify ETH as a security earlier this year.But now that spot Ethereum ETFs have been approved, that pretty much clears things up. ETH is a digital commodity like Bitcoin.Many shorts need to be unwound and that could be an ongoing tailwind for the market.And cryptocurrencies technicals suggest that since breaking its March to mid-May downtrend and above its 21 and 50DMAs, a retest of March highs near $4,100 is likely.The Ethereum price is likely to soon vault to the north of $4,000. Source: TradingViewthereumOnce this level goes, a quick push higher to 2021 highs near $4,900 is likely.

                        South Korean police have arrested 19 people on fraud charges in a swoop on a social media “crypto reading room.”Police think the international gang ran an “open chat room,” likely a crypto Telegram group or a KakaoTalk open chat, which pretended to offer bona fide crypto trading tips.Instead, officers said, the gang “defrauded 308 investors” out of some $18.8 million.Reading Room – ‘Crypto Fraud Gang Preyed on Victims’
Police spokespeople said some gang members posed as crypto experts in chat groups. Others pretended to be ordinary investors.These members allegedly claimed to have made money by following tips they learned in the “reading room.”Per Global Kyungjae Shinmun, the Daegu Police Agency’s criminal task force announced it had made the arrests on May 21.However, the task force thinks at least six suspects are still at large. Police said these individuals are “still overseas.”The task force said it had asked Interpol to issue red notices for all six. This would require overseas police officers to arrest the suspects on sight.Police said the group sent out invitation links to “an open chat room,” hoping to ensnare potential victims.This room, police added, was populated with gang members who claimed they had made “big profits” by following advice posted in the room.A police station in Daegu, South Korea. (Source: hyolee2 [CC BY-SA 3.0])Victims Lured onto Bogus Crypto Exchanges, Say Police
Officers explained that the gang tried to convince room members to download apps connected to crypto exchanges, where they could buy and sell unlisted coins.The group then tried to build trust by ensuring potential victims made moderate gains when they invested minimal amounts of money in these allegedly bogus platforms.In many cases, this convinced victims to increase the value of their stakes. However, when victims tried to make withdrawals from the platforms, gang members told them to pay “withdrawal fees.”When they refused, the gang members would then break off contact, police officers explained. The task force said it was trying to locate the stolen funds.‘Gang Used Pig-butchering Tactics’
Police said the gang’s ringleader used so-called “pig-butchering” recruitment tactics to increase the size of the gang.Officers said the ringleader promised several individuals employment in Myanmar. When they arrived in the country, however, the ringleader allegedly stole their passports and cell phones – and forced them to join the ring.The media outlet quoted a lawyer named Kwak Joon-ho as saying:“There has been a sharp rise in fraudulent schemes that make use of open chat rooms, including reading rooms. Perpetrators are likely to face both fraud and organized crime charges.”Earlier this week, police in Gwangju arrested 28 people on suspicion of duping about 50 crypto-keen South Koreans out of $1.3 million.

Dfinity's new API boosts Internet Computer smart contracts with cross-chain prowess

Dfinity Foundation has introduced a new API called EVM RPC to enhance cross-chain interoperability for Internet Computer (ICP)  smart contracts, according to a May 23 press statement shared with CryptoSlate.EVM RPC allows ICP smart contracts to read and write on any Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chain, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base, without relying on intermediaries. The API also supports the Bitcoin blockchain and will soon expand to Solana.This API simplifies multi-chain dApp development and eliminates the need for bridges and wrapped tokens. It allows native chain interactions and liquidity facilitation through the network API keys.Dfinity highlighted the significance of this innovation, stating:“This way, DFINITY’s Chain Fusion technology enables true multi-chain interoperability, allowing developers to write a single ICP smart contract that can custody Bitcoin, for example, and programmatically trigger sending it based on events observed on an Ethereum DeFi smart contract.”Interoperable stablecoinDfinity Foundation explained that the new API has facilitated the deployment of ckUSDC, an interoperable stablecoin pegged 1:1 to Circle’s USDC stablecoin, on the ICP network.USDC is the second-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of $32.83 billion, according to CryptoSlate’s data.The ckUSDC token, a multi-chain “twin” of USDC, leverages chain-key cryptography and ICP smart contracts that directly hold original assets. It operates similarly to ICP’s other inter-ecosystem tokens, like ckBTC and ckETH.Since its launch, ckUSDC has gained traction with notable projects such as IC Lighthouse, ICPSwap, and Helix Markets, reflecting growing demand for this type of token.Lomesh Dutta, DFINITY’s Growth President, remarked that the launch of ckUSDC and the new read/write APIs will foster further development within ICP’s ecosystem. He said:“With the addition of ckUSDC and read/write APIs, dozens of different chains can now leverage ICP smart contracts to freely interact with other networks, making the Web3 ecosystem massively more interoperable and unified.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Internet Computer StoriesLatest Alpha Market Report

US court rules crypto influencer conducted unregistered offering of crypto asset securities

the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against crypto influencer Ian Balina.The court ruled that Balina offered and sold SPRK Tokens as securities in unregistered transactions, affirming that US securities laws apply to his activities.SPRK deemed securityThe SEC’s complaint, filed on Sept. 19, 2022, alleged that Balina purchased $5 million worth of SPRK tokens from Sparkster, Ltd. in May 2018. He then allegedly organized an investment pool of about 68 individuals, to whom he offered and sold SPRK tokens without registering the offering with the SEC as mandated by federal securities laws.The SEC also claimed that Balina promoted SPRK tokens on YouTube, Telegram, and other social media platforms from May to July 2018 without disclosing a 30 percent bonus provided by Sparkster as compensation for his promotional efforts.The SEC charged Balina with violating the offering registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and with violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act for failing to disclose consideration received for his promotions.The regulator had sought partial summary judgment on the unregistered offering violation and requested a ruling that SPRK Tokens were offered and sold as securities.Alongside its charges, the SEC also issued a cease-and-desist order against Sparkster Ltd. and its CEO, Sajjad Daya. The company contributed over $35 million to a fund for harmed investors and paid various other fees and penalties.Promotion charges remainThe SEC additionally alleged that Balina promoted SPRK tokens on YouTube, Telegram, and social media between May and July 2018. He allegedly failed to disclose that Sparkster Ltd. offered him a 30% bonus on his token purchases in exchange for his promotions.The promotional charges fall under Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.Balina moved for summary judgment on both SEC claims. The court denied his requests and did not decide on Section 17(b) claims as a matter of law, leaving the promotional charges in play.Latest Alpha Market Report

Is This MEV Trading Firm Responsible For Ethereum's Drop Below $3,800?


								Ethereum is firm, trending higher, and outperforming the world’s most valuable coin, Bitcoin. Earlier today, Ethereum prices broke $3,900 before retracing sharply below $3,800 and bouncing back to spot rates.
In an attempt to explain the unexpectedly high volatility, especially with prices rapidly dropping from $3,900 and sinking below $3,800, some analysts claim that a large sell order by a Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) trading firm, Symbolic Capital Partners, might be responsible.
Ethereum Is Volatile Above $3,800: Possible Explanation
In a post on X, one crypto journalist, citing another source, said Symbolic Capital Partners offloaded 6,968 ETH, worth over $27 million, with an average selling price of $3,930 in one minute. Notably, one of these transactions involved selling 3,497 ETH simultaneously, with a “high bribe fee” of 90 ETH. 
While the exact motive behind this bulk dump remains unclear, their action seemed to have impacted prices, causing volatility.

At spot rates, Ethereum is up 30% from May 2024 lows. Technically, the uptrend remains as long as prices are trading above $3,700. On May 20, ETH prices broke above $3,300 and $3,700. These were two key resistance levels that are now supported.

As long as prices trend above $3,700, bulls might have a foundation for another leg up, taking them to March highs of around $4,100.
Even with ETH volatility being high, overall sentiment remains positive. One analyst on X notes that over the past three weeks, open interest in Ethereum futures across multiple exchanges, like Binance, OKX, and even Bybit, rose to over $4.6 billion.

Open interest is a metric that shows the number of open leveraged positions, long or short. When the number increases, traders are confident in the coin’s prospects.
Spot ETH ETF Fueling Interest
So far, the excitement about Ethereum is related to the positive progress in approving spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). When writing, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been actively communicating with potential issuers. Changes have been requested, particularly concerning ETH staking.
Some analysts believe the lack of staking capabilities for spot Ethereum ETFs is positive overall. In a post on X, the analyst argued that if spot Ethereum ETF issuers are allowed to stake, yields will drop, reducing returns for solo stakers. This, in turn, will make individual staking less attractive, impacting network decentralization.

U.S. Authorities Arrest Two in $73 Million Crypto Money Laundering Scheme



                    

U.S. authorities have apprehended two individuals accused of orchestrating a significant money laundering operation. 



This scheme allegedly funneled over $73 million through American financial institutions, ultimately converting the funds into the cryptocurrency Tether (USDT).




The U.S. Justice Department reported that Daren Li was arrested at Atlanta’s airport in Georgia on April 12, while Yicheng Zhang was taken into custody in Los Angeles on May 16. 



The indictment against the pair, unsealed in a California court on May 16, details their purported involvement in the scheme.



Li, Zhang, and their associates are accused of managing an international criminal network that laundered millions of dollars from “pig butchering” crypto scams. 




In these scams, fraudsters build victims’ trust, persuade them to invest large sums, and then abscond with the money.



The defendants allegedly directed accomplices to open U.S. bank accounts under shell company names. 



Victims were tricked into transferring millions into these accounts, which were then used to launder the illicit proceeds.



The DOJ explained that the money was dispersed to various domestic and international accounts, stating:




“The fraud scheme involved more than $73 million laundered through U.S. financial institutions to bank accounts in the Bahamas and converted to the virtual asset USDT, or Tether. 



“A cryptocurrency wallet involved in the scheme received more than $341 million in virtual assets.”



Li and Zhang face charges of conspiring to launder money and six counts of international money laundering. 



If convicted, they each could face up to 20 years in prison for each count, amounting to a potential total of 140 years.

Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco recognized the challenges posed by cryptocurrency fraud but emphasized the commitment to hold offenders accountable.



Pig butchering scams have become increasingly profitable for cybercriminals. 



In November 2023, the DOJ seized $9 million from a similar scheme that victimized over 70 Americans. 



The rising frequency and severity of such scams have alarmed lawmakers and regulators.



Regulators have intensified efforts to combat crypto scams, as seen in new regulations and industry guidelines. 



While these measures aim to protect investors and safeguard digital assets, some fear they may hinder the sector’s growth.

Ethereum ETFs Approved by the SEC? Yes-But Don't Bet On It - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsNow that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs, another crypto battle erupted over what “approved” actually means.That was the debate raging on Polymarkets, at least, after crypto degens bet over $13 million that the SEC would approve a spot Ethereum ETF by May 31.The open wager went live on January 9 as anticipation of the SEC approval for the first Bitcoin ETFs reached a fever pitch. The fundamental question driving any potential Ethereum ETF approval was whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity—and whether Bitcoin had cleared the path for Ethereum to follow.Financial analysts and crypto commentators regularly weighed in with their predictions, which grew increasingly pessimistic amid aggressive moves by the SEC against other crypto projects. As a May deadline solidified for a decision, some proposed that a delay would actually be a good thing. Last month, JP Morgan put the odds of approval at 50%.Polymarket users bet on the question, “Ethereum ETF approved by May 31?” Image: PolymarketBut last week, the mood started to shift: Coinbase opined that an Ethereum ETF would become reality last week, and when two Bloomberg ETF analysts revised their own odds of approval from 25% to 75% on Monday, the price of ETH started to soar.Polymarket bettors were also watching closely. The collective odds of SEC approval shot up from 13% to over 50% on the site on Monday. When the SEC announced Thursday that it was approving applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, optimistic wagerers were jubilant. Surely the answer to whether an Ethereum ETF would be approved before May 31 was "yes"?Not so fast, many argued.“Too bad they didn’t define the terms of the actual bet, there was $11M at play,” Twitter user Observoor wrote. “I checked this afternoon and thought, ‘This doesn’t even define what ETF approval means…it’ll end in a big fight.’”Technically, the SEC had approved rule changes allowing major investment firms like Grayscale, BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck to proceed with submitted and amended plans to offer spot Ethereum ETFs. But those specific funds have not yet been approved, a process that could take more than a week—and push past the May 31 Polymarket deadline.With some calling the bet "rigged," nearly 1,000 comments were posted to the event page.“Let's be real: lots of people got overconfident that the SEC would deny and are now crying foul that the SEC did a U-turn and rugged them,” a Polymarket user wrote. “ETH ETF approved... [by] consensus of credible reporting.”“The best resolution would be to make it a 50/50 split and clarify that the rules were not sufficient to select a clear winner,” another Polymarket user proposed.On the other hand, the wording of the SEC decision was clear: “This order approves the proposals on an accelerated basis.”“For all you who have no shares and are salty: bring the rules of the market and polymarket's resolution to ANY SAT/GMAT verbal professor and see what they say. Hint: everyone will agree with Polymarket because it's basic reading comprehension,” a Polymarket user wrote.Polymarket users were given a chance to dispute the outcome of the bet, but by 8:18 p.m. ET, the yes vote had been solidified. For many, the simplest answer was always the best answer.“I’m just an investor in Polymarket and general prediction market lover, so have zero impact here on final resolution,” Polymarket investor Nick Tomaino wrote on Twitter. “But in my opinion, for a prediction market platform to succeed long-term it’s important to resolve according to the spirit of the market. Otherwise, the masses won’t trust it.”With the big bet settled, the broader crypto market simply carried on. The price of Ethereum barely budged upon news of the approvals, although it is up nearly 30 perccent for the week, spiking to $3,937 intraday and trading at $3,819 as of this writing.Launched in 2020, Polymarket is a blockchain-based prediction market platform that allows users to stake tokens and earn on the outcome of current events like elections, sports, and current events. Earlier this month, Polymarket announced raising $70 million with funding participants, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Donald Trump's Presidential Campaign Now Accepting Donations In Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, XRP, Ethereum, Among Others | Bitcoinist.com


								In a strategic move, former United States President, Donald J. Trump has announced that his presidential campaign will be accepting donations in various cryptocurrencies. Supporters of the Trump campaign can now contribute using popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) becoming accepted.
Trump Campaign Embraces Bitcoin And Dogecoin Donations
In an official statement released on May 21, Trump’s presidential campaign announced the launch of an official fundraising page where federally permissible donors can contribute to the campaign using cryptocurrencies. The statement disclosed that only cryptocurrencies accepted through Coinbase Commerce products can be donated.

Trump’s new decision to embrace crypto donations is seen as a strategic and political move that is set to significantly transform how supporters can contribute to the campaign in anticipation of the forthcoming election on November 5. Additionally, it would also make the Trump Campaign the first ever major party Presidential nominee to embrace cryptocurrencies for donations. 
Some of the products supporters can use to make donations include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, XRP, DAI, Tether USD, and numerous other cryptocurrencies. This development is a positive step forward for the crypto industry, as it encourages greater recognition and adoption of digital currencies for real-world applications. 
Additionally, it underscores the rising mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, positioning the Trump campaign at the forefront of modern financial trends and signaling the former US President’s support of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. 
Trump’s Surrogate, Vivek Ramaswamy, also disclosed in an interview with Fox Business News that cryptocurrencies currently symbolize an alternative financial service from a financial system that has been corrupted by the Federal Reserve (FED) for the last 20 years. 
He disclosed that cryptocurrencies serve as an “opt-out” that holds fiat currencies, especially the United States Dollar (USD), accountable and encourages greater transparency and responsibility in financial systems. 
Political Implications For Trump’s Crypto Support
In the official statement, the Trump Campaign emphasized the former US President’s continuous efforts to reduce government regulations and promote innovation in the financial sector. 
Recently, Trump has emerged as an advocate for cryptocurrencies despite his earlier aversion to these digital assets. The campaign disclosed that the former US President was currently working towards minimizing the government’s influence on financial decision-making. 

Additionally, Ramaswamy also revealed in the aforementioned interview that Trump was strongly opposed to the Federal Reserve’s development of a Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), highlighting the financial limitations and privacy risks these assets would have on US citizens. 
The campaign also highlighted Senator Elizabeth Warren’s negative stance on cryptocurrency, noting her intention to create an anti-crypto army to impose more regulatory restrictions on the developing industry. In response, the Trump Campaign has suggested that they will establish a crypto army of their own to back Trump’s election bid, leveraging cryptocurrencies as a symbol for financial freedom.

Solana ETFs Next? Spot Ether Approval Paves Way for Broader Recognition, Analysts Say | Cryptoglobe


                                
The potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States has helped boot the cryptocurrency market significantly and is a significant step forward in cryptocurrency regulation, according to brokerage firm Bernstein, which suggested that Solana ($SOL) exchange-traded funds could follow.



According to a recent research report from the brokerage firm, which comes ahead of an expected spot Ether ETF application from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), similar treatment could come to other cryptocurrencies.



In the report, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra noted the see the potential approval as a sign of softening regulatory stance, possibly influenced by the upcoming November elections, adding bey believe that if Donal Trump is elected “crypto could see significant legislative and agency support” with a shift to the SEC’s leadership.



More immediately, the report highlights the potential precedent set by a spot Ether ETF as it would mark the first time a non-Bitcoin blockchain asset is classified as a commodity, potentially opening the door for similar treatment of Ethereum’s rivals, particularly Solana.



Notably, CNBC “Fast Money” trader Brian Kelly has also suggested that a spot Solana ETf could follow, saying that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana “are probably the big three for this cycle.”







He added that Robinhood and Coinbase now have “some clarity on what a security is and what a security isn’t,” suggesting these two firms are the largest beneficiaries from regulatory clarity.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Bernstein predicts a price surge for Ether similar to the 75% increase witnessed by Bitcoin after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, while earlier this week the price of ETH already surged over 20% as optimism surrounding the potential approval of these funds grew.



The report cites Ether’s free float and supply as particularly attractive – with 38% locked in staking and decentralized finance protocols, and a significant portion of the supply remaining inactive for over a year.



As reported, the number of small ETH  investors, those holding 10 ETH or less (around $37,500), has recently climbed to a new all-time high while larger investors are seemingly still lagging behind after divesting most of their funds over the last few months.



According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, smaller Ethereum wallets hits a new all-time high of 121.74 million after the recent ETH price surge, while those holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH  – between $37,500 and $37.5 million – are still down around 5.8% this year.



Notably larger whales, those that have over $37.5 million worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in their wallets, are down 10.6% in terms of total holdings after divesting of their ETH over the last few months.

								In a surprising turn, Tigran Gambaryan, a detained executive from the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, collapsed during a court session at the Federal High Court in Abuja, Nigeria. 
Gambaryan, facing money laundering charges, experienced a health episode that intensified the complex legal battle between Binance and Nigerian authorities.
Trial Of Binance Executive Takes Unexpected Turn
As the trial was about to resume before Justice Emeka Nwite, Gambaryan remained seated instead of stepping forward to the dock when called by the court registrar. 

A lawyer from the defense team, sitting beside Gambaryan, assisted him in walking towards the dock. However, as they made their way, Gambaryan fell, prompting the lawyer to help him sit in the front-row seat.
Gambaryan’s attorney, Mark Mordi, informed the court that his client was “indisposed” and had filed a written request to inform the court of his condition. Mordi explained that due to Gambaryan’s health problems, the trial could not proceed that day.
On May 16, Justice Nwite denied Gambaryan’s bail application, citing concerns that the defendant might flee if released. As a result, Gambaryan has been remanded at the Kuje Correctional Centre.
Trial Has Rescheduled For June 
The ongoing legal troubles faced by Binance in Nigeria are part of a broader crackdown by the government on the cryptocurrency platform. 
Nigerian authorities have accused Binance of facilitating illicit funds transfers totaling over $26 billion without proper oversight. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has further alleged that Binance engaged in tax evasion, currency speculation, and money laundering, amounting to $35.4 million.

Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance’s former regional manager for Africa, was also charged alongside Gambaryan. However, in March, Anjarwalla managed to escape from the custody of Nigeria’s National Security Adviser. He was subsequently traced to Kenya, where local authorities reportedly arrested him.
Amidst the legal battle, Judge Nwite ruled that Gambaryan should receive medical treatment at the hospital recommended by his lawyer or as suggested by prison authorities. The trial is now set to continue on June 20 and 21.

The native token of the exchange, Binance Coin (BNB), is trading at $597, reflecting a 4% decline in price over the past 24 hours. This downward movement aligns with the broader market correction triggered by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the leading cryptocurrencies.
On Tuesday, BNB, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reached a two-month high of $632. However, it failed to attempt a retest of its yearly high of $644, achieved on March 14, and its all-time high of $686, recorded during the bullish market phase of 2021.

Analyst Says "Only A Matter Of Time" Before Bitcoin Flies Past ATH


																An analyst explained how Bitcoin’s availability for trading has quietly declined during the asset’s recent consolidation phase.
Bitcoin May Be In A Good Position To Set New All-Time Highs
In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo discusses the recent trend in the Bitcoin inventory sitting on centralized exchange platforms.

The chart below shows how the spot and paper BTC reserves have changed over the past few years.
Looks like both of these metrics have registered a decline recently | Source: @woonomic on X
As the graph shows, the Bitcoin sitting in spot wallets has been declining over the last couple of months. The total amount of such BTC in the custody of central entities has now dropped to just 2.3 million.
It’s also apparent that the total sum of the spot and “paper” BTC (highlighted in purple) has declined at the same time. Paper BTC here refers to derivatives products related to cryptocurrency that don’t actually require investors to own the asset.
Thus, given that the combined sum of the exchange inventory has gone down for the cryptocurrency, it would appear that the decrease in the spot BTC isn’t because paper BTC has replaced it.
Generally, the supply of exchanges is considered part of the Bitcoin supply, which is “available” for trading. As such, due to how supply-demand dynamics work, less of this available supply may be a constructive sign for the cryptocurrency.
From the graph, it’s visible that this decline in the exchange inventory has come during a period where the price of the cryptocurrency has struggled after setting a new all-time high (ATH). As Woo notes,
While everyone was freaking out that Bitcoin price was not rising the last 2 months, available BTC was quietly being scooped up, and importantly without paper BTC printed in its place.
Thus, the fact that the available supply has gone down during such a period could be a bullish sign for the coin. “It’s only a matter of time before BTC squeezes past all-time highs,” says the analyst.

In another X post, Woo also discussed how capital inflows into Bitcoin have just started to pick up again after registering a steep drop earlier.

As the chart shows, network inflows spiked alongside the all-time high, but they observed a major slowdown in the consolidation that followed.
The inflows from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), highlighted in light green, also disappeared earlier, but they have now made a comeback alongside these fresh capital inflows.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had recovered as high as $71,000 earlier but appears to have slipped off over the last few days as it has now returned below the $68,000 level.

Puell Multiple Says Bitcoin Is Trading At A 'Discount' Now


								On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has dipped into the “undervalued” territory for the first time in more than a year.
Bitcoin Puell Multiple Has Observed A Plunge Recently
As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post pointed out, the BTC Puell Multiple has fallen recently. The Puell Multiple refers to an on-chain indicator that tracks the ratio between Bitcoin miners’ daily revenue and the 365-day moving average (MA).
Miners earn their income through two means: block rewards and transaction fees. The former is what they receive as compensation for adding a block on the network, while the latter is a payment they get through all the individual transactions part of the block.
In the context of the Puell Multiple, though, only the block reward is included in the miners’ revenue. The block rewards almost always remain fixed in terms of BTC value, so the only variable related to them is the USD value of the rewards.

As such, the indicator measures revenue in USD. Thus, there is a connection between the cryptocurrency’s price (which guides the block reward’s value) and the Puell Multiple.
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the miners have earned more than the average for the past year. In such a condition, the price of the asset may be considered overvalued.
On the other hand, the indicator is lower than this threshold, suggesting that miners are currently making less than usual. Naturally, the coin may be considered undervalued when this happens.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day MA Bitcoin Puell Multiple over the past few years:

The value of the metric appears to have taken a plunge in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant
The graph shows that the 7-day MA of the Bitcoin Puell Multiple was at relatively high levels earlier when the rally toward the new all-time high occurred.
Recently, though, the indicator’s value has plunged sharply. At the same time, however, cryptocurrency’s price has been consolidating sideways.
So, what has changed miner revenues if the price hasn’t dropped? As mentioned before, block rewards almost always remain constant. Almost. The one exception is the Halving event, which occurs approximately every four years.
During this event, the asset’s block rewards are permanently slashed in half. The latest Halving occurred last month, so the Puell Multiple has registered such a steep drop.

With this drawdown, the indicator’s 7-day MA is now below 1. “Investors may interpret the fall in the Puell Multiple as a sign that the market is adjusting to a new phase of scarcity, potentially preparing for a rally,” says the quant.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,800, up 5% over the past week.

Ethereum Classic, Often Considered A Cheaper Play, Outshines ETH On Spot ETF Approval Day: What's Going On? - Benzinga

On a day when the first-ever Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETFs have been approved in the U.S., Ethereum Classic ETC/USD seems to be stealing the spotlight from its sister chain.What Happened: Ethereum Classic racked up gains of nearly 9% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro, positioning itself as the marker's second-best performer. Counterintuitively, Ethereum was trading at just a 1.56% premium, despite a major bullish trigger in the form of its spot ETFs approval by the SEC earlier today. ETC's trading volume also swelled, more than tripling in the last 24 hours to over $1.5 billion. Ethereum’s volume increased by only 85% in contrast, although overall volumes remained much larger because of the higher market cap.ETC's current performance was reminiscent of its moves following Bitcoin BTC/USD spot ETF approvals earlier this year.Why It Matters: The original Ethereum Chain was split into two separate blockchains back in 2016 over disagreements within the community following a hack. The newer chain inherited the name Ethereum as we know it, with ETH as its token, while the immutable original chain was renamed Ethereum Classic, with ETC as a token.Ethereum Classic was created as a hard fork of the original Ethereum chain back in 2016 over disagreements within the community following a hack. The new chain inherited the name Ethereum as we know it, while the original one functions as Ethereum Classic.While fundamentally different from each other, a lot of retail investors perceive ETC to be a cheaper alternative to ETH. ETH's market cap of $4.84 billion was a fraction of Ethereum's whopping $454 billion valuation.A widely-followed X user Eugene Ng Ah Sio, recently picked ETC as the beta for Ethereum owing to specific advantages like less inflation, no unlocks, and a halving which was due in a week. Photo Courtesy: Shutterstock.comPrice Action: At the time of writing, ETC was trading at $32.86, up 8.85% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Bitcoin, Dogecoin Dip, Ethereum Shows Momentum On Approval Of Ether Spot ETFs, Analyst Expresses Confidence In King Crypto’s Rebound

Gold Rush: Private Investors and China's Central Bank Drive Record Price Surge | Cryptoglobe


                                
Gold market analyst Jan Nieuwenhuijs has recently examined the state of the precious metal market, revealing a significant surge in gold prices owes much to the dual engines of demand: the private market and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).



According to Nieuwenhuijs, the Chinese private sector’s gold imports accounted for 543 tons in the first quarter of the year, a figure that was built upon by the country’s central bank, which added 189 tons to its reserves over the same period.



Private gold demand in the country represents a start 74% increase from the last quarter of 2023, while the People’s Bank of China’s accumulation rose 38% from the preceding quarter.



Both of these factors helped the price of the precious metal hit a new all-time high and surpass the $2,450 mark for the first time in history, before enduring a slight correction to now trade at $2,340.

Data shows that gold demand from central banks in the first quarter of the year was of 290 tons, with the People’s Bank of Chia making up for the majority of that figure as it boosted its reserves to 5,542 tons according to the analyst.



These acquisitions, according to analysts, are being made as China moves away from its U.S. debt holdings in a bid to be less reliant on fiat currency foreign reserves after the European Union blocked €200 billion ($around $216 billion) worth of Russian central bank assets after the country launched its invasion of Ukraine.



Private demand for gold in the country, according to the New York Times, is coming from consumers who have been buying and collecting small “gold beans” as an affordable way to invest in the precious metal.



In China the precious metal has been an attractive investment alternative amid a slump in traditional options like real estate and equities. The analyst wrote:



The Chinese public, which doesn’t have many investment options due to capital controls, will continue to invest in gold and support the price.



Nieuwenhuijs predicts that the gold market will remain red-hot, citing reports that Beijing has recently sold $53 billion worth of US Treasuries and agency bonds in a move that will further strengthen gold as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical tensions.

Failure to Present Binance Executive for Arraignment: FIRS Shifts Blame to Correctional Service


																The Nigerian Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has pointed fingers at the Nigerian Correctional Service for failing to produce detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan at the Federal High Court in Abuja on tax evasion charges.
Reportedly, Gambaryan was a no-show in court on May 22, slated for arraignment on tax evasion accusations by the FIRS.
FIRS Points Finger at Correctional Service
In March 2024, Binance and its executives faced four counts of tax evasion each, as charged by the tax authority. Gambaryan was then moved to Abuja’s Kuje Correctional Centre in April after pleading not guilty to money laundering charges filed by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission and seeking bail. The Binance exec was denied bail and remains in custody.
During court proceedings on Wednesday, prosecution counsel Moses Idehu expressed confusion about Gambaryan’s absence and mentioned several instances of unsuccessful attempts to reach the correctional center. He also requested a brief delay in the case to address the matter later that day.
Meanwhile, Gambaryan’s lawyer, Chukwuka Ikwuazo, asked the judge to tell FIRS to take another detained Binance exec Nadeem Anjarwalla’s name off the new charges because he’s been declared “at large.” The FIRS lawyer also agreed to remove Anjarwalla’s name from the charges.




Both Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were arrested during a public inquiry and were charged with involvement in Nigeria’s economic problems and funding terrorism. The duo were transferred to a secure facility after their passports were seized.
Dangerous Precedent
While advocating for the release of Gambaryan, who was head of Binance’s Financial Crime Compliance team, the CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange, Richard Teng said that the move by the Nigerian authorities has set a “dangerous” new precedent for all companies across the world.
Teng had also added that Gambaryan’s visit to Nigeria was not for decision-making or negotiations but solely to provide expertise in financial crime, participating in policy discussions, and capacity building. Despite repeated assurances from Nigerian authorities for safe passage, the arrests were still made.
Subsequently, Gambaryan was held at Nigeria’s Kuje prison, which gained notoriety after an Islamic State attack in July 2022 as part of a jailbreak. It has even housed several prominent inmates, including the former central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele.

Ethereum Spot ETF's Approval Highlights Its 'World Of Warcraft' Origins: Created Because A Character Had Its 'Warlock Powers Nerfed' - Benzinga

The cryptocurrency industry might be celebrating the greenlighting of the first-ever spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs in the U.S., but very few of them might be aware of the amusing origin story of the world's second-largest digital asset project. What Happened: Ethereum's creator and one of the poster boys of the industry, Vitalik Buterin, has been a lifelong advocate of decentralized systems—the technology forming the basis of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. But as eccentric or funny as it may sound, his closeness with the narrative began in his school days, when he was a passionate World of Warcraft gamer. Trung Phan, who co-hosts the Not Investment Advice podcast and authors the SatPost newsletter, posted on X, formerly Twitter, about the events from those days."I happily played world of warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's siphon life spell," Buterin wrote. This very event proved to be the turning point in his career. "I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit."Why It Matters: This incident may appear frivolous, but there's no denying the fact that it unintentionally paved the way for one of the most disruptive technologies in the world.Ethereum today is one of the world's most-invested projects, with a total locked value of more than $65 billion, according to DeFiLlama. Furthermore, it is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market cap higher than top-tier public companies like Mastercard and Oracle.Earlier today, it reached a new milestone after getting approval to list its spot ETFs in the U.S., the world's largest financial market.While Ethereum may continue to increase its footprints in the near future, it won't be surprising to see the World of Warcraft story getting a legend status within the industry. Price Action: At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,800.76, following a 1% increase in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Photo by Kanchanara on UnsplashRead Next: Ethereum Classic, Often Considered A Cheaper Play, Outshines ETH On Spot ETF Approval Day: What’s Going On?

All Spot Ethereum ETFs Officially Approved



	

Key Points:




US SEC approves Spot Ethereum ETFs.



Approval expands institutional access to Ethereum.



Issuers await clearance for Ether-based ETFs.




The SEC has approved the issuance of Spot Ethereum ETFs, expanding access to the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Several issuers await clearance of their individual filings.





The US Securities and Exchange Commission has cleared the path to allow the issuance of Spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), a major development in the nation’s crypto landscape. The decision arrives within five months of the SEC’s clearance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs.



SEC Approves All Spot Ethereum ETFs



Spot Ethereum ETFs stand as the second crypto-based ETF cleared by the SEC, paving the way for expanded access to the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization for institutions.



Watcher.Guru recently reported that BlackRock’s Spot Ethereum ETF has been registered with the DTCC under the ticker ETHA.






Although the initial decision was to put off the approval due to the earlier negative sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, the SEC has expanded the ETF market to include both Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, issuers would need to wait for the clearance of their individual filings.



The market was expecting the introduction of another cryptocurrency following the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs at the start of 2024. Predictions were most pegged on Ethereum. However, the overall sentiment of the SEC dampened such optimism.



Impact of SEC’s Decision on Crypto Market



In mid-May, a surprise move by Bloomberg shifted the approval odds from 25% to 75%. The market began readying itself for the introduction of an Ethereum-based investment product.



The approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC now means the United States hosts crypto-based ETFs for the two largest digital assets worldwide. The move greatly impacts reshaping the nation’s stance on such assets.





Several issuers, including VanEck, ARK21 Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock, have applied for the listing of Ether-based ETFs. Among these, VanEck is facing the most imminent deadline for approval.

Ethereum’s Potential Market Trajectory



The issuers now only await the clearance of their S-1 forms after the SEC has approved the Ethereum ETF 19b-4 forms. The SEC may require more time to process each filer, especially if the regulator retains any skepticism towards the Ethereum ETFs.



The effect these developments will have on the markets remains to be seen. In the three months after Bitcoin’s listing, the asset would go on to realize an all-time high. 




Many have said that Ethereum will follow the same trajectory, as the ETF anticipation has already propelled the asset nearly 30% over the last week.

Spot Ethereum ETF Decision Approved Is Not By SEC Chair - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets approved spot Ethereum ETFs for several major financial firms.



Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that the spot Ethereum ETF decision using delegated authority is standard practice.




The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Division of Trading and Markets has approved a series of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from prominent financial firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton.





Spot Ethereum ETF Decision Made Using Delegated Authority



The spot Ethereum ETF decision, outlined in an order approving 19b-4 forms, was made by the division rather than the SEC’s commissioners.



The order clarifies that the approval was granted “by the Division of Trading and Markets, pursuant to delegated authority,” indicating that SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the four other commissioners did not directly vote on this matter. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that using delegated authority for such spot Ethereum ETF decisions is standard practice, explaining that requiring a formal vote for every decision would be impractical.



This procedural approach contrasts with the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, which involved a formal vote by the commissioners. In that instance, Gensler and Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda voted in favor, while Democratic Commissioners Jaime Lizárraga and Caroline Crenshaw opposed. The SEC has stated it will not comment further on the Ethereum ETFs beyond the issued order.




Regulatory Uncertainty Surrounds Ether’s Classification as a Security



The approval of these ETFs may have broader policy implications. SEC Chair Gensler has not clearly defined whether Ether is a security, raising concerns among crypto enthusiasts about the regulatory future for Ethereum and related projects. A critical issue is staking, which involves earning rewards for participating in network validation and has led to debates about Ether’s classification as a security. Last year, the SEC accused Coinbase of violating securities laws by offering staking services.



In contrast, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees derivatives, does not view Ether as a security and has permitted trading in Ether futures by CME Group for several years.

Will Crypto Markets March Higher When $1.4B Bitcoin Options Expire?


																Crypto markets have largely held on to gains this week, buoyed by Ethereum and the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot exchange-traded funds.
However, around $1.4 billion in notional value Bitcoin options contacts will expire on May 24.
The 21,000 contract expiry is a relatively small event compared to the month-end May 31 expiry which will see a whopping $4.3 billion worth of options expire, according to Deribit.
Bitcoin Options Expiry
The put/call ratio for this week’s Bitcoin options contracts is 0.88, which means that long and short-contract sellers are relatively evenly matched with slightly more calls expiring. The max pain point, or the price at which most option contract buyers lose their premium, is $67,000.
The longs are also dominating in open interest (OI) with around $830 million at the $70,000 strike price. Higher strike prices also have a lot of OI, with around $843 million at $100,000, according to Deribit.




The $60,000 strike price has the highest amount of OI for put contracts with $388 million. Open interest refers to the number or value of contracts that have yet to be settled, so the bulls expect much higher BTC prices.

In addition to today’s Bitcoin options there are around 354,000 Ethereum contracts expiring today. These have a notional value of $1.5 billion and a put/call ratio of 0.57 with more calls expiring than puts.
Derivatives traders have been speculating on ETH in the run-up to the long-awaited SEC deadline. There is around $515 million in OI at the $4,000 strike price as bulls expect more momentum.
“BTC pulled back as expected, compared to the very strong support for ETH’s price, with ETH’s current weekly weighted IV still exceeding 100%, while BTC’s current weekly IV is only 50%,” commented crypto derivatives software provider Greeks Live.
Crypto Market Impact
Almost $3 billion in BTC and ETH options will expire today, but the impact on spot markets is usually muted. Total capitalization has dropped 1.3% to $2.68 trillion, primarily due to a 2.3% dip in Bitcoin prices as the asset fell to $67,400 at the time of writing.
Ethereum faced tons of volatility ahead of yesterday’s decision but now stands calmly at $3,730.
The altcoins were a mixed bag with gains for Chainlink (LINK), PEPE, and Ethereum Classic (ETC), but losses for Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Toncoin (TON).

Newly-Approved Spot Ether ETFs Could Start Trading by Mid-June: Analyst

                        Newly-approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could potentially hit the market by mid-June.Following the successful 19b-4 filings for spot Ether ETFs, which allow them to be listed on exchanges, the next step is to obtain approved S-1 registration statements before trading can commence.Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart predicts that the S-1 approvals could be granted in a “couple of weeks,” although he acknowledges that the process may take longer, typically spanning up to five months.However, fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that a mid-June launch is certainly possible.Balchunas expects a single round of comments to the S-1 amendments, similar to the feedback provided for spot Bitcoin ETF applicants, which could facilitate a quicker approval timeline.VanEck Files Amended S-1
VanEck, one of the applicants, wasted no time and filed its amended S-1 shortly after receiving approval for the 19b-4 filings. Other applicants are anticipated to follow suit in the near future.However, Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, points out that the SEC’s approval was granted by its Division of Trading and Markets unit under delegated authority. He suggests that one of the five SEC Commissioners could challenge the decision within the next 10 days.Nevertheless, digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare believes that such a challenge is unlikely, stating that passing it through the trading and markets division indicates no opposition from the Commissioners.Regarding market expectations, Seyffart predicts that spot Ether ETFs could attract approximately 20% of the flows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen.On the other hand, Balchunas offers a more conservative estimate of 10-15%.Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs approximately four and a half months ago, they have accumulated $13.3 billion in net inflows, according to Farside Investors.Even capturing 20% of that figure would result in spot Ether ETFs amassing a combined $2.66 billion in inflows over a similar timeframe.Grayscale Ethereum Trust Could See Outflows
However, concerns have arisen around potential outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust if investors shift their holdings to spot Ether ETFs, mirroring the outflows witnessed with the conversion of Grayscale’s Bitcoin investment product.The Grayscale Ethereum Trust currently holds over $11.3 billion in assets, as reported by Arkham Intelligence.On May 23, regulatory approval was granted to eight applicants, including VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Bitwise, and Invesco Galaxy.One ETF issuer, Hashdex, did not receive approval on that particular day, standing as the exception.As reported, Singapore-based QCP Capital believes the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States could potentially trigger a substantial rally of up to 60% in the price of ETH.QCP Capital pointed out that when spot bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, Bitcoin experienced a significant surge from $42,000 to over $73,000 within a two-week period after the ETFs began trading.“With Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,” QCP Capital stated.

Bitcoin set for a new peak? U.S. trading volumes hit 2-year high - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin volumes in U.S surged and reached 2022 levels.
The profitability of holders grew along with the velocity of BTC.

Bitcoin [BTC] witnessed a massive surge in price over the last few days, causing a spike in optimism for BTC during this period. Due to this surge in price, there was a massive spike in terms of volume for BTC as well.
Volumes on the rise
According to new data, BTC trade volume during US hours had returned to 2022 levels. The high volume of BTC transactions in America indicated that the U.S market was showing massive interest in BTC and may have even reached saturation.
However, on APAC (Asia Pacific) front, it wasn’t the case. The volume during APAC trading hours were significantly lower. This meant that there was a large cohort of people that had still not interacted with BTC.
As the popularity of BTC grows, traders operating during APAC hours may soon invest and trade BTC which may drive the price of BTC to new heights.
Source: X
As BTC began to reach its previously established all time highs, many old holders were observed to be moving their holdings. Recently, an on-chain movement of over 10-year-old Bitcoin was recorded.
A transaction involving 2,000 BTC was sent in block 844625, marking a significant shift in long-held assets.
Whales make moves
This whale behaviour could cause a rise in FUD amongst holders and traders alike, and may cause a negative impact on BTC’s price.
At press time, BTC was trading at $69,750.53  and its price had grown by 0.04% in the last 24 hours.
Moreover, the velocity at which it was trading at had grown, implying the frequency at which BTC was trading at had also increased.
Coupled with that, the MVRV ratio for BTC had also significantly grown, implying that most addresses were profitable at the time of writing. Even though this is positive for the holders, it could mean trouble for BTC’s price.
As profitability rises, so does the incentive to sell. If holders begin to indulge in profit-taking, BTC’s price can be negatively impacted. A factor that can determine the likelihood of an address selling their BTC is the Long/Short ratio.

The Long/Short ratio showcases the number of long term holders compared to short-term holders on the network.
At press time, this ratio was declining, indicating a prevalence of short term holders who are more likely to sell their holdings.

Low Ethereum Gas Fees Inflate Supply By 50k ETH In One Month - The Defiant

$238 million worth of ETH has entered circulation since April 14.A spate of unusually low Ethereum gas fees resulted in Ether’s supply growing by 50,550 coins over the past 30 days.Data from Etherscan shows average gas prices dropping below $2 during four days this month to tag a low of $1.70 on May 18. The dip marked the lowest gas price recorded since October 2023.Ethereum gas prices. Source: Etherscan.According to Ultra Sound Money, Ethereum’s supply has grown by 62,646.61 ETH ($238 million) since Ether’s burn rate flipped inflationary on April 14, pushing the number of circulating coins up to its highest level since March 4.Low gas prices threaten Ethereum deflationEthereum gas prices plummeted following the activation of Ethereum’s long-awaited Dencun upgrade on March 13.Dencun introduced proto-danksharding, which drastically reduced the costs associated with Layer 2 transactions by replacing gas-intensive calldata with lightweight Binary Large Objects (blobs) via EIP-4844 — also known as proto-danksharding. Gas fees on top Layer 2 networks dropped by more than 90% following the upgrade, also reducing the burden placed on Ethereum’s mainnet by finalizing L2 transaction bundles.But while the reduction in L2 transaction baggage precipitated Ethereum gas prices falling by up to an order of magnitude from $21.58 on March 13, Dencun also appears to have undermined Ethereum’s deflationary narrative.Still, Ether’s supply has dropped by 394,678 ETH ($1.5 billion) since The Merge transitioned the network to Proof of Stake in September 2022. If the network maintained its former Proof of Work consensus and issuance model, 6.376 million coins worth $24.2 billion would have entered supply since September 2022.Ethereum supply since The Merge.

Winnie The Pooh-Themed Coin Soars 46% As Memecoins Continue To Soar Despite Bearishness Seen In Bigger Cryptos Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin - Benzinga

A cryptocurrency themed around the adorable Winnie the Pooh character has boosted the fortunes of its holders after raking in big gains lately.What Happened: POOH POOH/USD, created solely for entertainment purposes, jumped 46% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Over the past week, its value has more than doubled. With the parabolic lift, the token's market cap surged past $17 million. Around $3.42 worth of trades involving POOH were executed in the last 24 hours, marking an increase of 17.66%. The surge comes at a time when the more popular currencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD, and Ethereum ETH/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD exhibited sluggishness. Despite having a substantially lower valuation when compared to top meme coins, the Ethereum- based coin’s trajectory over the year piqued interest. POOH exploded immediately after its launch last year but crashed soon after. It survived the bear market with little to offer until March's memecoin frenzy roused it from hibernation. Since then, it has surged more than 5X in value. Currently, the enthusiasm in the community is soaring over a proposal to burn 13 Ether worth of POOH, worth about 4.4% of its total supply. Typically, such events deflationary pressure to the asset. Why It Matters: Memecoins have had a field day in 2024, as overall sentiment for the cryptocurrency market improved drastically, POOH seems to be cashing in on the frenzy, supported by a loyal community and a general likeness for the legendary animated character.The coin specifically states that it is "useless," with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. That said, a coin of a similar nature, Pepe PEPE/USD, has returned 842% to its holders over the year.Memecoins have had a history of wild fluctuations, hence DYOR before investing. Price Action: At the time of writing, POOH was trading at $0.00000004187, up 46% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.Photo Courtesy: Raul Pongasi Berame On Shutterstock.comRead Next: Ethereum Spot ETF’s Approval Highlights Its ‘World Of Warcraft’ Origins: Created Because A Character Had Its ‘Warlock Powers Nerfed’

SEC Ethereum Classification Attracts Special Attention Despite ETFs Approval - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The SEC has approved a spot Ethereum ETF, which ConsenSys welcomes but criticizes as highlighting the SEC’s inconsistent approach to digital assets.



The debate over SEC Ethereum classification remains unresolved despite progress, with further clarification expected from the agency and its commissioners.




In a surprising move, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a spot Ethereum ETF, a decision welcomed by ConsenSys.





SEC Approves Spot Ethereum ETF Amidst Regulatory Criticism



Despite acknowledging the approval as a positive step, ConsenSys criticized the SEC’s approach to digital assets, describing it as arbitrary and unfair. The development underscores the ongoing debate over SEC Ethereum classification as either a commodity or a security, a distinction with far-reaching regulatory implications.




ConsenSys stated: “Today’s approval signals that the SEC views ETH as a commodity, contrary to its previous stance, as highlighted in our recent lawsuit against the SEC. We will continue to fight for clear regulatory guidelines and support the bipartisan Congressional efforts aimed at achieving sensible regulation.”




The distinction between commodities and securities is significant for the crypto industry. Commodities, which include assets like gold and oil, are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), focusing on market stability and fraud prevention. In contrast, securities representing ownership in corporations or creditor relationships fall under the SEC‘s purview, with an emphasis on investor protection and disclosure requirements.



Ongoing Uncertainty in SEC Ethereum Classification Despite ETF Approval



The CFTC has long viewed Ether as a commodity, permitting trading in Ether futures by CME Group. However, the SEC’s historical caution has left Ethereum in a regulatory gray area. The approval of the Ethereum ETF by the SEC could shift this perspective, particularly if S-1 registration statements for the ETFs from firms like VanEck, BlackRock, and Fidelity are signed off.




Justin Browder, a digital asset lawyer, suggested that S-1 approval would conclusively determine Ether’s status as a non-security. Despite this progress, finance lawyer Scott Johnsson noted that the approval order did not explicitly address SEC Ethereum classification, leaving some ambiguity.



Earlier this year, ConsenSys received a Wells notice from the SEC, primarily concerning its Metamask trading and staking services. The SEC and its commissioners are anticipated to make further statements on Ether’s classification soon.

Top Ethereum Challenger Could Skyrocket by Over 2x, According to Crypto Analyst Michaël van de Poppe - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst believes one Ethereum (ETH) competitor could more than double in price.
Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 718,900 followers on the social media platform X that interoperability blockchain Polkadot (DOT) is poised to rally due to major network advances.










He also says DOT is likely to see a boost from ETH’s upward momentum as well.
“Polkadot did a retest at the crucial levels and wakes up slowly. Given their Polkadot 2.0 release and the JAM ( Join-Accumulate Machine) white paper and the correlation with ETH, I’m expecting a lot from them. Next target is likely $18.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Polkadot is trading for $7.14 at time of writing, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours.
The analyst also believes the broader altcoin market is entering a bullish phase after correcting.
“The altcoin market capitalization has finished its correction. The next step: reaching all-time high, which is ~60%-70% from here. I think Ethereum is likely reaching that in the next two-four months.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
He says alts could outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the months ahead.
“The altcoins are still heavily undervalued. Most of them are down 70% against Bitcoin. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be having any correction, but feeling fear of missing out (FOMO) here is the wrong emotion to have. In the coming months, I expect altcoins to do way better.”
Lastly, the analyst says he is bullish on Bitcoin but expects the crypto king to retest the $68,000 level on the 12-hour chart before continuing upward.
“Bitcoin slowly consolidating. Expecting a retest at the $68,000 mark, before a continuation upwards. The trend is clearly upwards.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Bitcoin is trading for $67,553 at time of writing, down more than 2% in the last 24 hours.

SEC In 'Deep Trouble' With Crypto Post-Ethereum ETF Approval


								On Thursday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a landmark decision by approving eight spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) from leading financial institutions and crypto firms, including Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, and ARK. This historic approval, which consolidated proposals from the Nasdaq, NYSE, and CBOE, marked a significant shift in the regulatory landscape of digital assets.
Why The SEC Is In ‘Deep Trouble’ With Its Crypto Cases
However, this decision comes with its complexities, particularly in light of ongoing legal challenges involving the classification of other cryptocurrencies. Prominent crypto lawyer James “MetaLawMan” Murphy commented, “I believe the SEC is in deep trouble with some of its crypto cases in light of its determination that ETH is a commodity.”
He emphasized that the SEC repeatedly argued in the Coinbase case “that crypto tokens that operate within an ‘ecosystems are securities.’ I believe the SEC will have difficulty explaining how ETH, which operates within a giant ecosystem, is a commodity, but SOL and ADA are securities when traded on Coinbase.”

This statement encapsulates the core of the issue: Ethereum operates within a robust ecosystem that includes not just investment and trading but also decentralized applications and smart contracts, similar to other blockchains like Solana and Cardano. The distinction made by the SEC might complicate its stance in ongoing and future litigation, particularly cases involving other cryptocurrencies that operate under similar paradigms but are classified differently.
Murphy also suggested potential legal maneuvers by affected parties: “Coinbase is due to file a Reply Brief tomorrow on its Petition to Certify Interlocutory Appeal. It would not surprise me if they also filed a request for rehearing of their motion to dismiss in light of the fact that the SEC now concedes that ETH is a commodity.”
He also refers to Judge Failla’s earlier ruling in the Coinbase case where she bought into the SEC’s ecosystem argument and used it as a basis for her ruling. “When a customer purchases a token on Coinbase’s platform, she is not just purchasing a token, which in and of itself is valueless; rather, she is buying into the token’s digital ecosystem, the growth of which is necessarily tied to the value of the token.”

Consensys, a major Ethereum software developer, also expressed concerns with the SEC’s decision-making process, suggesting it reflects an inconsistent and ad hoc approach to digital asset regulation. In a statement, the company said: “This seemingly last minute approval is yet another example of the SEC’s troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets. No other industry, market, or asset is subject to such deliberate regulatory abuse. It is unfair to market participants, antithetical to the rule of law, and handcuffing innovation.


Sam Callahan, a senior analyst at Swan, noted a key omission in the SEC’s approval document: “Interesting paragraph in the SEC’s Ethereum ETF approval document. The SEC basically looked at the ETF products and whether they could adequately protect investors and maintain fair markets, and that’s about it. No mention of securities laws or ETH classification. No mention of the Howey Test.”
Thus, the absence of a clear stance on Ethereum’s classification under securities laws still raises questions about future regulatory challenges and implications for other digital assets. “We may have to wait for a statement from Gensler, and even then, he could sidestep the topic altogether,” Callahan remarked.
At press time, ETH traded at $3,686.

SEC's Ethereum ETF Approval: A Game-Changer for Crypto Markets


							

The SEC greenlights eight spot Ethereum ETF applications.



Launch timeline uncertain, pending further approvals.



The decision signals a potential shift in crypto regulation.




In a landmark decision that could reshape the cryptocurrency landscape, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, May 23rd, greenlit eight applications for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a major shift in regulatory stance towards the second-largest digital asset.



This move paves the way for mainstream investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency.



The 19B-4 submissions detail proposed rule changes and regulatory compliance necessary for listing and trading new ETFs. In its statement, the SEC highlighted the consistency of the proposals with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, adding:




“After careful review, the Commission finds that the Proposals are consistent with the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.”




19B-4 filings for the following firms were approved by the SEC:




BlackRock Inc.



Fidelity



Grayscale Investments Inc.



Bitwise Asset Management Inc.



VanEck Associates Corp.



Ark Investment Management LLC



Invesco Capital Management LLC



Franklin Templeton




Despite this approval, the process is not yet complete for these firms, as they still await a nod from the SEC for their S-1 filings. An S-1 registration statement is crucial because it details the financials and business operations of the ETF providers. As a result, it helps potential investors make informed decisions.



However, the timeline for listing these ETFs remains uncertain. ETF analyst Nate Geraci pointed out the possibility of the SEC delaying the S-1 approvals, given the reported lack of engagement on this front. Conversely, according to a tweet by Bloomberg’s James Seyffart, if “they work extremely hard,” this process could take a matter of weeks. However, historically, it has taken over three months in some cases.









Whereas the SEC’s approval marks a significant milestone, the ultimate launch of these spot Ethereum ETFs hinges on the pending S-1 approvals, leaving the exact timeline uncertain. Despite this, the regulatory nod has ignited optimism within the crypto community, with many viewing it as a pivotal step towards broader acceptance and adoption of Ethereum in traditional finance.

                        A U.S. district court has found crypto influencer Ian Balina guilty of violating U.S. securities laws.According to recent court filings, Judge David Alan Ezra ruled that Balina was guilty promoting and selling SPRK tokens without proper disclosure. the judge ruled that SPRK tokens met the criteria of the Howey Test, making them securities.Unlawful Promotion without Proper Disclosure
Balina faced charges in September 2022 due to his participation in the unregistered initial coin offering (ICO) of SPRK tokens. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contended that these tokens necessitated appropriate registration and disclosure.The court found that Ian Balina engaged in promoting and selling SPRK tokens through various social media platforms, including YouTube and Telegram.Balina did not disclose that he was receiving compensation of a 30% bonus for these promotions, which the court determined was a violation of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.Balina organized an investment pool where he offered SPRK tokens to investors. The SEC highlighted that he failed to properly disclose his financial interest in the tokens he received from Sparkster, the company behind SPRK.The SEC stated that the token offering raised approximately $30 million from nearly 4,000 investors located abroad and in the U.S. from April to July 2018.Ian Balina’s Response to SEC’s Charges
Balina’s website posted a response to the SEC’s “baseless” charges, saying, “This is the first time a private pre-sale purchase of a digital asset token has been accused of being ‘compensation’ in exchange for publicity.”“The Security and Exchange (SEC) Enforcement Division’s proposed charges against Mr. Balina are an unfounded effort based upon multiple misconceptions of fact and law, enumerated below,” the post reads.The response asserted that Balina did not receive any compensation, and there is no evidence to support such allegations. It also claimed that he did not profit from his purchase, suggesting that he might be a victim of fraud by the Sparkster team, similar to other investors.

                        The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act’s (FIT21) approval on Wednesday would align the US with other nations in terms of its regulatory framework for crypto, according to Kyle Bligen, director of financial policy at the Chamber of Progress.Bligen told Cryptonews in an interview Thursday that if the FIT21 bill passes the Senate and becomes law, it would stop crypto companies from leaving the US for countries with clearer regulations.The legislation would provide increased freedoms to cryptocurrency operators in the US. Additionally, it would shift more regulatory responsibility for digital assets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).It would also make it clear which businesses the SEC and CFTC regulate and would create a system for registering these businesses. This would allow them to legally serve customers who want to buy and sell digital assets. The SEC would oversee digital assets that are considered securities, while the CFTC would oversee things like commodities and derivatives related to digital assets.Outdated Law Hinders US Crypto Regulation
Bligen pointed out the fact that the US has been using a nearly century-old law, the Howey Test, from the SEC to regulate cryptocurrency that was invented just a few years ago. He argued that the current system is outdated and doesn’t work for this technology.“Hopefully this [bill] establishes the US as a regulatory leader that wants strong consumer protections,” he said. “We already have the most liquid, most attractive capital markets in the US. There’s no reason why we can’t have the best cryptocurrency markets as well.”FIT21 Seen as Crypto Talent Retainer
Harry Sudock, chief strategy officer at Bitcoin miner GRIID, agrees that the bill would propel the US to a competitive position in the international crypto scene. Additionally, he believes FIT21 would incentivize the brightest minds in crypto to come to and stay in the US.“We’ve seen a number of businesses either leave the US or decline to do business here thanks to regulatory uncertainty,” he said. “FIT21 will help those businesses return to the US, but the bill is really only just the start.”FIT21’s House Hurdle Cleared, Senate Showdown Looms
FIT21’s journey to becoming law isn’t over yet. While it successfully cleared the House, it still faces an uphill battle. The bill needs to be approved by the Senate and then signed by the President before it becomes law. Whether the Senate will give it the green light remains to be seen.Ronen Cojocaru, CEO of automated crypto trading platform 8081, highlighted the unique challenges crypto bills face in the Senate. Some senators are familiar with the technology and may be vocal supporters or opponents of the FIT21 Act. However, others might lack a deep understanding of the intricacies of cryptocurrency, making them undecided on the bill’s merits.“Public opinion and upcoming elections influence Senators’ decisions, aligning them with their party’s agenda and voter interests,” he said. “Senators can use a filibuster, requiring 60 votes to advance the bill, which is tough without strong bipartisan support.”Cojocaru also explained why the US is currently lagging behind other countries. He pointed to Switzerland, nicknamed “Crypto Valley,” as a prime example. Switzerland’s financial regulator, FINMA, fosters innovation by providing clear guidelines for crypto businesses, making it a global hub for the industry.Singapore has also attracted many crypto companies with its well-defined regulations and supportive policies. Its central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has struck a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding consumers. Similarly, Malta, known as the “Blockchain Island,” has become a magnet for crypto businesses with its comprehensive and crypto-friendly regulations.CFTC vs. SEC in Regulating Crypto
Meanwhile, James Koutoulas founder at Typhon Capital Management, said FIT21 needs some work, especially for DeFi. Additionally, he highlighted the unprecedented power it gives the CFTC to regulate crypto as a spot commodity, which falls outside its usual domain of regulating commodity derivatives.“But, at least at the present time, the CFTC is infinitely less hostile to crypto than the SEC and seems focused on implementing regulatory pathways instead of maliciously attacking market leaders without the statutory authority to do so like the SEC,” Koutoulas said.

Ripple CEO signals potential for an XRP ETF following Ethereum ETFs approval - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Ripple CEO hints at potential XRP ETFs following Ethereum ETF approvals by SEC.
Brad Garlinghouse’s endorsement aligns with his optimistic outlook for XRP in 2024.
Regulatory challenges and Ripple’s SEC lawsuit impact the timing of potential XRP ETFs.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has indirectly hinted that XRP could be the next cryptocurrency to see the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
This follows the recent approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Spot XRP ETF prospects post Ethereum ETFs approval
Garlinghouse’s subtle nod to the possibility of XRP ETFs came via his reaction on X (formerly Twitter) to a comment on his post celebrating the US SEC’s approval of all Ethereum ETF applications. Among the approved ether ETF applications were those from prominent financial entities such as BlackRock, Grayscale, VanEck, and Fidelity.
Describing the week’s events as “momentous” for the crypto industry, Garlinghouse likened the SEC’s approvals and the passing of the FIT21 crypto bill to a “hell freezes over” scenario, a sentiment that resonated with many in the community, who have long anticipated similar advancements for their favored cryptocurrency.
Earlier on in an interview in February, Garlinghouse had expressed his belief that an XRP spot ETF was inevitable.
He emphasized the importance of such an investment product for diversification purposes but refrained from committing to a specific timeline, citing regulatory uncertainties as a major factor.
When questioned about potential collaborations with asset managers like BlackRock for an XRP ETF, Garlinghouse remained non-committal, acknowledging the complexities involved.
Ripple legal battles standing in the way of an ETF approval
Despite Garlinghouse’s enthusiasm, the path to an XRP ETF is fraught with challenges.
The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC, which has accused Ripple of selling unregistered securities, remains a significant hurdle. The outcome of this legal battle will likely play a crucial role in determining the feasibility and timing of an XRP ETF.
While Ripple CEO is optimistic of an EXP ETF approval, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that Solana (SOL) might be a more probable candidate than XRP.
Seyffart argued that Solana’s market position and broader appeal make it a strong contender, though he cautioned that a Solana ETF might not materialize until 2026, contingent upon regulatory developments and the establishment of a CFTC-regulated futures market.

I'm sorry you're simple minded. Ill dumb it down for you. 
Based on current regulatory framework I don't think Solana will be in an ETF for multiple years. Likely beyond 2026 at earliest.
But Congress can theoretically accelerate that timeline.
— James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 22, 2024

While no other crypto ETF applications have been made so far, the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and the legislative advancements marked by the FIT21 crypto bill signify significant progress for the cryptocurrency sector.

The odds of BNB breaking its ATH in 2024 are... - AMBCrypto



BNB recently bounced from the support line of a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating bullish sentiment.
A close above $635 could lead to a rally to $692, breaking the ATH.

Binance Coin [BNB] has been a standout performer in the cryptocurrency market over the past few years. But the question on every investor’s mind is: Can BNB break its all-time highs this year? 
Even as the rest of its peers rally on, the altcoin has remained moderately bullish.
A quick look at BNB’s current standing
Over the past year, BNB has experienced some major price fluctuations. At press time, BNB is trading significantly below its all-time high of $690, reached in May 2021. 
The altcoin turned up from the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 20 and rose above the resistance line, meaning that the bulls still have the upper hand. 
BNB reached the critical overhead resistance of $635 on 21st May. This level will likely act as a stiff block, but if the bulls do not cede ground to the bears, it will improve the prospects of an upside breakout. A close above $635 could clear the way for a rally to $692.
 
Source: TradingView
The 20-day EMA, around $590, is also an important support level. Maintaining above this level will allow BNB to sustain bullish momentum. 
Derivatives data shows a noticeable decline in trading volume by 16.69%, meaning there is less trading activity and reduced interest at the current price levels.

Potential catalysts and outlook
Despite some contrasting signals from search activity and whale actions, the overall market sentiment towards BNB is strongly positive, as indicated by the Greed level on the Fear and Greed Index. 
It clearly shows that the market is bullish on BNB, potentially anticipating a massive rally.

Given the very positive volume, dominance, and impulse, along with the positive social sentiment and order book condition, the short to medium-term outlook for BNB looks bullish.
Historically, BNB has been the most stable cryptocurrency. Even during a severe crypto winter last year, the coin didn’t plunge as much as the other cryptocurrencies. Its potential for a massive bull run this cycle is generally agreed on by the community.

Ouch! Solana Meme Coin Developer Burned in Bizarre Promotional Stunt


								The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to the bizarre, but this week, a Solana memecoin developer took things to a fiery new extreme. Mikol, the founder of the newly launched “Truth or Dare” (DARE) token, is recovering in a Miami hospital after suffering third-degree burns during a livestreamed stunt gone horribly wrong.
This incident casts a harsh light on the escalating tactics employed by memecoin projects in a bid for viral fame and fortune.

From Fireworks To Fiascos: The Solana Dev’s Thirst For Attention
Memecoins, known for their mascot-driven popularity and often erratic price fluctuations, thrive on attention. Projects compete in a saturated market, resorting to increasingly outlandish tactics to grab headlines.
In 2022, a memecoin project sent a giant Elon Musk rocket-statue on a truck to Tesla headquarters, hoping to spark a tweet from the crypto influencer. While such stunts can generate a buzz, Mikol’s fiery performance has sparked outrage and concern within the crypto community.
Livestream Inferno: When Hype Goes Up In Flames
Mikol’s ill-conceived marketing strategy involved dousing himself in isopropyl alcohol and inviting a friend to light fireworks in his direction during a livestreamed launch event for the DARE token. The chaotic 30-minute broadcast captured the horrifying moment when Mikol became engulfed in flames.


His friends, unprepared for such a disaster, attempted to extinguish the fire with water, but the damage was already done. With burns affecting nearly a third of his body, Mikol was rushed to a trauma center.
This incident raises serious questions about the ethics and legality of such promotional stunts. Financial markets, especially the often-unregulated cryptocurrency space, require a degree of responsible marketing. Encouraging risky behavior not only puts the developer in danger but also sets a potentially dangerous precedent for future marketing campaigns.
Solana is now trading at $166. Chart: TradingView
The Aftermath: Regulation, Reputation, And Responsibility
The “Truth or Dare” stunt has sparked discussions about potential regulatory interventions. If dangerous stunts become a normalized marketing tactic, watchdogs might be forced to step in and establish stricter guidelines for cryptocurrency promotions.
Furthermore, the Solana dev incident tarnishes the reputation of the entire memecoin sector. The cryptocurrency market, already grappling with issues of volatility and legitimacy, can ill-afford such negative publicity.

Coinbase NY’s XRP Trading Aligns with Whales’ Massive XRP Moves


							

Coinbase resumes XRP trading in New York, boosting the digital asset after recent price volatility.



SEC lawsuit against Ripple for unregistered securities casts shadow, but recent court ruling favors XRP.



Action aligns with whales’ massive XRP moves and XRP’s notable price changes.




In a move likely to buoy XRP’s price, Coinbase, the large cryptocurrency exchange, has resumed XRP trading for users in New York. The decision comes amid significant price volatility for XRP, which reached a weekly high of $0.5535 on May 21st.



The announcement was made public by Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, via his social media page. In a brief statement, Mr. Grewal wrote, “XRP trading on Coinbase is now available in New York.”







Also, Whale Alert’s revelation of the massive move of XRP totaling more than 55 million has created a buzz in the community. In two separate X posts, Whale Alert shared insights on the strategic moves of large XRP holders or whales, which in turn saw a slight surge in XRP’s price.



According to Whale Alert, an unknown whale address transferred a massive 30,080,000 XRP tokens, worth 15,634,673, to Bitso. Yet another involved the transfer of 25,800,000 XRP tokens, valued at $13,407,670, to Bitstamp.







This follows a period of uncertainty for XRP, delisted from several exchanges, including Coinbase, in 2020 after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP. The SEC alleged that XRP was an unregistered security.



Despite a recent ruling in favor of Ripple, by Judge Sarah Netburn, declaring XRP not to be a security, the final judgment in the case is still pending. The legal battle has undoubtedly contributed to XRP’s price fluctuations. However, the recent surge in trading activity, coupled with Coinbase’s decision to resume trading in New York, suggests a renewed sense of optimism among XRP holders.









As of the press time, the token is trading at $05302, with a slight increase of 0.53% over the last day. In the last week, XRP had a more notable surge of 2.60% despite a monthly decline of 2.91%.



While the long-term impact of Coinbase’s decision remains to be seen, it is a significant development for XRP. The resumption of trading in a major financial hub like New York could provide much-needed stability for the digital asset.

The enigmatic leader of the Shiba Inu team known by the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama sends congratulations to the Ethereum community on the recent spot ETF approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.He touched on the potential opportunity for the same happening to a SHIB spot exchange-traded fund in the future.SHIB ETF prospects and Shytoshi's current focusThe SHIB lead published a post in which he congratulated the friends of SHIB and Shibarium at Ethereum on the spot ETH ETF finally receiving the green light from the SEC regulator. He wondered if that could pave the way for SHIB, perhaps also hinting that a SHIB ETF is likely to be approved in the future.However, without spending much time discussing this hypothetical event, without further ado, he stated that this is something for the community to discuss, but he will stay focused on what the SHIB team has coming. He concluded his message with an intriguing hashtag, #staytuned. SEC approves Ethereum ETFsOn Thursday, May 24, the SEC finally issued approval for the spot Ethereum ETF filings submitted by several Wall Street companies earlier this year. The ETFs were approved six months after the regulator greenlit spot Bitcoin ETFs in the middle of January.Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, and this approval marks a crucial pivot for the crypto industry after BTC spot ETFs. Venture investor Anthony Pompliano has recently tweeted that this step would be the last dam to be broken before the Wall Street totally accepts crypto assets.Among the approved Ethereum ETFs were those submitted by BlackRock, Grayscale (a converted spot ETF from their Ethereum Trust), VanEck, Bitwise, Fidelity and Ark Invest.These spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to be much smaller in terms of assets under management. For example, Grayscale’s ETF holds approximately $11 billion in ETH, which is much smaller than its Bitcoin Trust held before it was converted into the spot ETF.Earlier this month, Ark, Grayscale and Fidelity were driven to adjust their ETF filings to remove staking from them since the SEC recently sued two U.S.-based exchanges (Coinbase and Kraken) for their crypto staking services, referring to staked assets and unregistered securities.

Solana DePIN gains traction in 2024, led by Render and Helium - AMBCrypto



Solana-based DePINs like Render and Helium recorded massive growth on key metrics
New entrants have entered the Solana DePIN ecosystem. 

After dominating the memecoin trading segment, Solana [SOL] seems set to lead the DePIN (Decentralized Public Infrastructure Networks) sector.
One of the leading decentralized computer networks, Render [RNDR], recorded a remarkable 66% growth in node operators since migrating from Ethereum [ETH] to Solana last November. 
According to a report by crypto analytics provider Flipside, the growth isn’t restricted to Render but was evident across the Solana DePIN sector in the first half of 2024 (H1). 
Render moved to Solana because of its speed, scalability, and low cost. New DePIN entrants, like io.net, cited the same reasons for choosing the network. Reinforcing Solana’s capacity, Garrison Yang, chief strategy at io.net, told Flipside that, 
“With advantages in retail liquidity, speed, scalability, cost, and mindshare, Solana has become a natural choice for many web3 projects, including the DePIN category.’
State of Solana DePIN sector in H1 2024
According to the Flipside report, four major DePIN sub-categories have matured within Solana – compute, connectivity, data/sensor, and storage networks. 
Render led the decentralized computing segment, hitting a record high of 1920 node operators in January 2024, a 66% increase post-Solana migration. 
Source: Flipside
Node operator rewards spiked in January, with a 34% average in the first half of 2024. 
Render offers a Web 3 alternative to AWS or Google Cloud through its peer-to-peer compute power (GPU) marketplace. Per the report, Render pivoted to AI/Machine Learning and could be an outlier in the segment if the AI narrative extends.
Part of the report read, 
“As global GPU demand continues to outstrip supply, investment in, and adoption of, decentralized compute solutions will likely outpace other DePIN sectors.’
The report noted io.net and Nosana as the latest projects in the compute segment worth tracking. 
Solana’s next hottest DePIN category was connectivity, and the Helium Network was the leading project amidst surging subscribers. Wife Dabba and Pollen Mobile are new projects within the category. 
The decentralized sensor and data storage segments are the third and fourth largest, respectively. These categories are dominated by Hivemapper (a Google Street View rival) and Shdwdrive, respectively. 
Overall, the Solana DePIN ecosystem has over 25 projects led by the three known ones: Render, Hivemapper, and Helium. 
On the performance front, the DePIN narrative was in the top five after DeFi and posted 85% in Q1, per the Coingecko report. 
The best performer was the memecoin sector, which Solana dominated. It remains to be seen how the DePIN narrative will play out at the end of Q2.

Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG) to Explode 14,000% Before KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Biden in a Dogs World (BIDDOG), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BIDDOG will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Biden in a Dogs World.



Currently, Biden in a Dogs World can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BIDDOG on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Biden in a Dogs World by entering its contract address – bUv1o6DFK5Wa7V1SY2HoFTUmaZSQ58eKqk5rKxvWuZr – in the receiving field.




BIDDOG currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Commodity Nod for Ethereum in ETF Saga Won't Halt SEC's War on Crypto


																Industry experts and executives have been discussing the implications of the SEC’s apparent U-turn on Ethereum.
Its approval of spot Ether ETFs on May 23 may be a signal that the regulator now views the asset as a commodity and not a security.
The regulator officially approved 19b-4 applications from VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise to issue spot Ethereum ETFs.
However, not all are convinced this is also a signal that its war on crypto could be coming to an end any time soon.






ConsenSys Not Convinced
On May 24, Ethereum software solutions provider ConsenSys said it welcomes the decision as a step in the right direction but added:
“This seemingly last-minute approval is yet another example of the SEC’s troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets.”
The company noted that the SEC’s “regulatory abuse” is “unfair to market participants, antithetical to the rule of law, and handcuffing innovation.”


ConsenSys is one of several crypto companies embroiled in legal battles with the SEC, which maintains its position that they have been offering unregistered securities. The agency’s decision on Ethereum is “contrary to the position it continued to take prior to the events of this week,” said ConsenSys.
Meanwhile, financial services lawyer James Murphy said that “the SEC is in deep trouble with some of its crypto cases in light of its determination that ETH is a commodity.”
The regulator has argued repeatedly at the hearing on Coinbase’s motion to dismiss that crypto tokens that operate within an “ecosystem” are securities, he added. The exchange’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, echoed the sentiment in a post on X on May 24, questioning the SEC’s perplexing U-turn.


More Smoke and Mirrors
Finance lawyer Scott Johnsson observed that the SEC “completely sidestepped” the clarification of ETH in its approval orders. ETF Store President Nate Geraci said something similar on May 24.
“Zero statements from SEC Commissioners on spot eth ETFs… Silence speaks volumes.”
Meanwhile, crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky was optimistic that a change was in motion:
“Today’s expected ETH ETF approval will hopefully provide a clue as to how real this pro-crypto pivot might be.”
ETH prices spiked to $3,933 when the news broke but returned to yesterday’s levels shortly after and were trading at $3,670 at the time of writing.

Spot Ether ETF Approval Proves ETH is Not a Security: Expert

                        The recent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) potentially confirms Ether’s status as a non-security, according to industry experts.Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, speaking on the Bankless podcast with Ryan Sean Adams, emphasized that the approval of these commodity-based trust shares implies that the SEC explicitly recognizes Ether as not being a security. Seyffart further suggested that this recognition could extend to other tokens as well, solidifying their classification as commodities.S-1 Approval Would End Debate for ETH Status
Digital asset lawyer Justin Browder echoed Seyffart’s sentiment, stating that if Ether ETFs receive S-1 approval, which is the final requirement for them to begin trading, it would settle the debate once and for all, affirming that ETH is indeed not a security.Adam Cochran, a partner at venture capital firm Cinneamhain Ventures, took the argument a step further, suggesting that this line of thinking could be applied to tokens of other projects as well.“ETH is a commodity, even with its current attributes. That means we can extrapolate to *A LOT* of other projects what elements matter in security,” Cochran said.“Today a lot of things probably clearly became commodities, even if they don’t know it yet.”While the approval of spot Ether ETFs reinforces the non-security status of Ether, Seyffart and other experts anticipate that the SEC may still focus on actors involved with staking Ether.Seyffart speculates that the SEC might distinguish between Ether itself, which they would not consider a security, and staked Ether, which could potentially fall under the definition of a security.Digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare shares this view, suggesting that the SEC could pursue individual actors and staking-as-a-service despite the ETF launch.It’s worth noting that the SEC’s approval order did not explicitly confirm Ether’s non-security status, leading finance lawyer Scott Johnsson to comment that the issue was “completely sidestepped.”However, an official statement from the SEC and its Commissioners is expected to provide more clarity in the future.SEC Approves 19b-4 Applications
On May 23, the SEC officially approved 19b-4 applications from VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise for issuing spot Ether ETFs.Notably, several ETF issuers removed staking from their final amendments.Hashdex was the only issuer that did not receive regulatory approval on that day.However, all eight approved ETF issuers must await the SEC’s approval of their S-1 registration statements before launching their ETFs.Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart predicts that the S-1 approvals could be granted in a “couple of weeks,” although he acknowledges that the process may take longer, typically spanning up to five months.However, fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that a mid-June launch is certainly possible.As reported, Singapore-based QCP Capital believes the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States could potentially trigger a substantial rally of up to 60% in the price of ETH.

Analyst Bets on ADA & AVAX After SEC's Ethereum ETF Approval


							

Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello believes ADA is ready for an uptick.



Gambardello has predicted bullish cases for ADA and AVAX.



Gambardello states that ADA and AVAX can be the top performing altcoins this cycle.




Dan Gambardello, a leading market analyst and founder of CryptoCapitalVenture, highlighted Cardano (ADA) as a potential beneficiary following the recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Mr. Gambardello, in an X video, cited Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, who noted that Ethereum is now classified as a commodity. Mr. Gambardello argued this classification could extend to Cardano, stating:




“ADA has its own narrative I think in terms of the ETFs for being as decentralized as it is for being built in the way that it is. AVAX also has its own narrative, that is to say its own president of Ava Labs is out there fighting for the AVAX ETF.”




Mr. Gambardello expressed his belief that both Cardano and AVAX are “extremely well positioned to be top performers among blue-chip altcoins.” He predicted that ADA will “make its move out of nowhere,” despite currently testing the patience of its holders.









Additionally, Mr. Gambardello emphasized that the approval of ETH ETFs is a positive development for all altcoin holders, including those of Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). He concluded that the “anti-crypto army” was losing ground.

The SEC approva gli ETF su Ethereum spot, il prezzo reagisce

La SEC degli Stati Uniti ha finalmente approvato la quotazione degli ETF spot su Ethereum, la notizia ha influito anche sul prezzo della crypto. Inoltre, il responsabile legale di Coinbase afferma che Ethereum è ufficialmente considerato una commodity.
Let’s see all the details below. 

New ETFs on Ethereum receive the green light from the SEC, how did the price react?
As anticipated, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States has approved the requests of Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE to list exchange-traded funds (ETF) linked to the price of Ethereum. 
Thus opening up the possibility that these products will start to be traded by the end of the year. 
Sebbene gli emittenti di ETF debbano ancora ottenere l’approvazione finale prima del lancio, la decisione rappresenta una vittoria inaspettata per le aziende coinvolte. Infatti, l’intero settore delle criptovalute fino a lunedì temeva un rifiuto della SEC.
Nine issuers, including VanEck, ARK Investments/21Shares, and BlackRock, hope to launch ETFs linked to Ethereum, the second cryptocurrency by market capitalization. 
Especially after the approval of the ETF su Bitcoin in January, which marked a crucial moment for the sector. 
“This is an exciting time for the industry as a whole,” said Andrew Jacobson, vice president and legal head of 21Shares, calling the approval “a significant step” towards trading these products.
Approval and adjustment of the documents
Thursday also represented the deadline for the SEC’s decision on VanEck‘s request. Market operators were expecting a rejection, as the SEC had shown no signs of accommodating the applications. 
Tuttavia, con una mossa sorprendente, lunedì i funzionari della SEC hanno richiesto agli exchange di aggiornare rapidamente i documenti, costringendo l’industria a completare settimane di lavoro in pochi giorni. 
The sources were unable to determine the reason for this change in position by the SEC. Rob Marrocco, global head of ETP listings at Cboe Global Markets, commented: 
“The introduction of spot ETFs on bitcoin has already demonstrated significant advantages for digital assets and the ETF space, and we believe that spot ETFs on ether will provide similar protections for U.S. investors.”
When asked about ether ETFs during an industry event on Thursday, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, a well-known skeptic of cryptocurrencies, declined to comment. 
 A spokesperson for the SEC confirmed via email the approval, adding that the agency would not comment further.
Coinbase: the approval of Ethereum ETFs confirms its status as a commodity
Dopo l’approvazione degli ETF Spot su Ethereum, il Chief Legal Officer di Coinbase, Paul Grewal, ha dichiarato che Ethereum è effettivamente considerato una commodity. In un post su X, Grewal ha affermato che ETH è una commodity “come l’abbiamo sempre saputa”.
The approval of the 19b-4 forms for Spot ETFs on Ethereum represents the first steps towards the official approval of all ETFs on ETH. Coinbase, one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, is a strong supporter of cryptocurrency ETFs. 
Ethereum will join Bitcoin as the only crypto ETF available on the market, paving the way for additional candidates in the future.
Now that the Ethereum ETF 19b-4 forms have been approved, the issuers must wait for the approval of their S-1 forms, necessary to publicly offer new securities and start trading. 
The SEC could take weeks or months to process the S-1 forms, especially if it remains dissatisfied with the ETFs. Experts like Grewal express enthusiasm for this first step towards a broad approval. 
It is expected that the price of Ethereum will increase significantly, following the example of Bitcoin after the approval of its ETF. At the moment, ETH is traded at over $3,800, up 4% in the last 24 hours and over 25% in the last week.

Coinbase: il crypto-exchange reintroduces the trading of Ripple (XRP)

Paul Grewal, responsabile legale di Coinbase, ha annunciato che anche per i clienti di New York è tornato ora disponibile il trading di Ripple (XRP) sul crypto-exchange. 

Coinbase: the crypto Ripple (XRP) is available for trading again in New York
Coinbase has reintroduced the trading of the crypto Ripple (XRP) also for its customers in New York. This was announced by Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, with a tweet: 

The trading of XRP on @coinbase is available again in New York. We have listened to you and worked closely with the State. And now it can be said that we are operational again.
Grewal emphasized the collaborative effort with the State to succeed in the endeavor of bringing XRP back among its crypto offerings, even for New York. 
E dunque, da ora, i residenti potranno tornare a effettuare trading e/o conservare XRP sulla piattaforma web di Coinbase e su tutte le applicazioni mobili iOS e Android. 
Coinbase: Ripple (XRP) returns to the crypto-exchange after 3 and a half years
It was January 2021 when Coinbase had officially removed Ripple (XRP) from its crypto-exchange, exactly 3 and a half years ago. 
 The reason was the endless cause “SEC vs. Ripple” which saw the regulatory body accuse the crypto company of offering unregistered security. 
Ecco perché Coinbase e altri crypto-exchange come OKCoin, Crypto.com e OSL avevano cominciato il delisting di  XRP dalle loro piattaforme. 
This is why Coinbase and other crypto-exchanges like OKCoin, Crypto.com, and OSL had started the delisting of  XRP from their platforms. 
Such operations had led the market cap of what has been for a long time the third crypto in the ranking to collapse. And indeed, in the following months, XRP saw its market cap drop from 70 billion dollars to 29 billion dollars. 
Despite this decision, Coinbase has always sided in support of the crypto colleague and against the Securities and Exchange Commission of the USA, also filing a motion to support Ripple, which was also accepted by the judge. 
Only in February 2023, the community started to make itself heard by asking Coinbase to relist XRP, especially after the SEC had officially ruled that sales on the secondary market are not equivalent to securities. 
Eppure, la causa Ripple vs. SEC ha avuto fine nel luglio 2023, con la vittoria parziale della società crypto e la sentenza ufficiale che XRP non è una security. 
The price of XRP
The news of Coinbase resuming the listing of XRP in New York, did not register significant price movements for XRP, at least in the last 24 hours. And indeed, at the time of writing, XRP is worth $0.52 just like yesterday. 
Eppure, dando uno sguardo ai volumi di scambi di XRP nelle ultime 24 ore, pare ci sia stato un aumento del 106%. 
In any case, the current seventh crypto in the ranking still holds today a total market cap that is close to 29 billion dollars.

Which Cryptos Will Come Along For The Ride?


SPONSORED POST*
Render (RNDR) has seen a major month for its price, as it has gone upwards following Apple’s Keynote Event, on top of which OctaneX was featured. Alongside this, Core (CORE) has also seen a price rally as they introduced Ignition Drop Tier Multipliers and Badges on top of the ecosystem. 
However, all traders are now moving towards KangaMoon (KANG) as its nearing $7 million raised and has increased in value by 400%. Bitcoin on the other hand has risen in value significantly, and based on the price prediction can reach $123,939 by the end of 2024. To see which crypto can follow in its footsteps, we will take an in-depth look at CORE, RNDR and KANG. 

Core Crypto Spikes 122.6% – Price to Reach $2.77
Core (CORE) is heading upwards on the charts especially after it introduced the Ignition Drop Tier Multipliers and Badges. The heightened Core crypto circulation could soon result in major price increases as interest and demand in the project increase. 
Moreover, the Core price has gone up 122.6% on the annual chart, and the MACD data points to future upwards momentum as-well. According to the Core price prediction it can end 2024 at $2.77, making it the best cryptocurrency to invest in.
Render (RNDR) Climbs 363.8% YTD – How Far Can It Climb?
Render (RNDR) on the other hand has seen a major 363.8% year-to-date (YTD) climb, and spiked 22% in the past month alone. The key catalyst for this major level of the growth in the Render crypto value is due to OctaneX getting featured on Apple’s Keynote Event. This way, any user with M4 chips can gain access to near-unlimited high performance decentralized GPU compute power through its ecosystem. 
The Render price could see an even further uptrend during the upcoming trading sessions as its RSI is above 50, and according to the Render price prediction the crypto can end 2024 at $14.56, positioning it as a solid crypto to buy.
KangaMoon Price Jumps 400% – To Climb 100x Following Its Launch
KangaMoon (KANG) breaks the mold of traditional meme coins through forging a powerful fusion between Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming, Social-Fi mechanics, and its native KANG token. Here, it provides major utility to its native crypto, and this differentiates it from otherwise hype-driven projects. It has captured the attention of over 32,000 users, raising over $6.9 million with projections that it can exceed $7 million by the end of the month. The KANG token is now listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which can drive interest further, alongside its anticipated BitMart listing.
The unique Social-Fi model also incentivizes pre-launch social media engagement and fosters strong community engagement as the most active users get rewards in the form of KANG tokens. Moreover, the project also establishes a sustainable economic model, positioning KANG as a top contender for diversification. Historically, the value of the crypto has risen from $0.005 to $0.025, a climb of 400%, and according to analysts, following its launch and major exchange listings it can rise by 100x, positioning it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in.
Which Crypto Will Follow BTC’s Momentum?
It’s clear that both Core and Render have showcased remarkable growth on the charts. Yet, the most significant gains have been made by the KangaMoon token as it’s up 400% and this has made it a top crypto to buy. At this rate of growth it is likely to follow in the footsteps of BTC, which could reach $100,000 soon.

Pepe 69 (PEPE69) Will Surge 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe 69 (PEPE69) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe 69 (PEPE69), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe 69 presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe 69 has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe 69 could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Pepe 69 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe 69 on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe 69 by entering its contract address – EvevUFVUUFR2NZVSkVzRTj1SQ6KRKdsZqdkpWinkh8m1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPE69.

Tons of Volatility Amid SEC's Ethereum ETF Approval: BTC and ETH Drop by 4% (Market Watch)


																The crypto market is quite susceptible to ETF approvals, as it seems, and the past 24 hours brought even more enhanced volatility for the entire sector.
After the hype from the start of the business week settled, the largest cryptocurrencies, including the one that got the green light from the SEC, have turned red.
BTC Drops Below $67,000
The start of the current business week couldn’t really foresee what was going to happen. BTC had calmed at around $67,000 after the quiet weekend, but it all changed on Monday evening when reports emerged that the SEC could actually greenlight a spot Ethereum ETF by the end of the week.
Bitcoin, alongside most of the crypto market, went on a wild ride and soared by five grand in hours. This resulted in tapping its highest price tag in almost two months of nearly $72,000.
The rally came to a halt at that point and BTC started losing value gradually. Still, it traded in a range around $70,000 until yesterday evening when it slumped by a few grand to under $68,000. This came hours before the SEC’s deadline to make a decision on whether it will approve or reject all ETF applications.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


More volatility ensued when the regulator actually approved eight Ethereum ETFs, and BTC went down to $66,400 before it shot up by two grand. However, it has lost some ground once again and now struggles below $67,000.
Its market cap is down to $1.310 trillion, and its dominance over the alts is 50.2%.
Bitcoin/Price/Chart 24.05.2024. Source: TradingView
Alts in Red
The aforementioned developments around the Ethereum ETFs impacted the underlying asset’s price the most, as expected. ETH skyrocketed by over 20% on Monday to a six-week peak of its own at over $3,900. It also went down and up yesterday ahead of the SEC approval but now sits 4% down on the day at $3,655.
The rest of the larger-cap alts are in no better state. Solana, Dogecoin, Toncoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Shiba Inu have all dumped by 5-8%. BNB, XRP, TRX, and BCH are also in the red.
The total crypto market cap has lost over $100 billion since yesterday and is down to $2.617 trillion on CG.

From Crypto King's Perch to Auction Block: FTX Bahamas Penthouse for Sale


							

FTX’s $30 million Orchid penthouse is now up for sale.



FTX overpaid for its Bahamian properties, creating a bubble market.



Liquidation hopes to recover losses for FTX creditors.




A lavish penthouse atop the Orchid building in Nassau, Bahamas, is set for sale as part of the ongoing liquidation of assets belonging to bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. This opulent property, once the headquarters of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, stands as a symbol of the company’s meteoric rise and swift downfall.



Real estate experts believe FTX overpaid for its Bahamian properties, creating a bubble market. Nassau’s developer, Jason Kinsale, and real estate appraiser, Robin Brownrigg, anticipate challenges in recouping the original investments. For example, a similar apartment in the same building recently listed for $29 million, indicating losses after taxes and fees.



FTX’s liquidation involves $255 million worth of properties, including 52 apartments and lots in luxury developments like Albany, a high-end enclave home to celebrities like Tiger Woods and Justin Timberlake. FTX’s real estate spree included $140 million for 15 apartments and a villa in Albany alone, with the Orchid penthouse as its crown jewel.



Despite rising luxury real estate prices in the Bahamas, agents are skeptical about achieving the initial purchase prices. Earlier assessments, like the $8.8 million Honeycomb property now valued at $5.9 million, suggest significant overpayments.



FTX’s asset liquidation, managed by PwC, aims to recover losses for creditors. As sales commence, the Bahamian community looks forward to moving past the Bankman-Fried saga, with hopes of a fair market resolution for these high-profile properties.









According to the Bureau of Prisons website, the FTX co-founder is now at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison by Judge Lewis Kaplan, had been preparing for his trial from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. 



Judge Kaplan said on Wednesday that he stayed in Brooklyn to facilitate access to his appellate counsel. Mark Botnick, Bankman-Fried’s spokesman, expressed hope that the Bureau of Prisons would follow the court’s recommendation to ensure proper legal access. Bankman-Fried had requested to remain at MDC, despite his complaints about the facility last year. 



He may eventually serve the rest of his sentence at a prison closer to his family in California. The Oklahoma facility is designated as a transfer center and is intended to hold inmates for four-to-six weeks.

When Spot Ethereum ETFs Go Live 'Expect A Bloodbath': Expert


																Thomas Fahrer, co-founder of Apollo, a firm focused on Bitcoin adoption, has issued a stark warning regarding the potential market dynamics following the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. As the market anticipates this new development, Fahrer suggests that the transition might not be smooth for Ethereum.
“The Grayscale Ethereum Trust launched in 2017 and accumulated most of its $9 billion dollars worth of ETH well before staking existed. These funds will be unlocked now. Expect a bloodbath. It will accelerate the ETH -> BTC Trade. Hold me to account if I’m wrong. But I doubt it,” Fahrer declared via social media platform X.
Spot Ethereum ETFs – A “Sell The News” Event?
The imminent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, similar to earlier this year’s launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, is expected to convert the $9 billion (approximately 2.94 million ETH) locked in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into one such ETF. Historical precedent with Bitcoin suggests potential volatility; after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin experienced more than a 20% drop in value within 12 days amid significant sell-offs from similar conversions.

	Related Reading


One of the main reasons the spot BTC ETF approval turned out to be a “sell the news” event was Grayscale’s transition from an Ethereum Trust to a spot ETF. Until now, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw outflows of more than 50% of its BTC holdings. And the ETHE could be reinforced by the fact that ETH staking is a lucrative option to earn an additional yield.
Currently, Grayscale holds over $9 billion in locked Ethereum that cannot be sold or traded until the ETF is operational. Should the approval go through, this large amount of Ethereum will suddenly become liquid, potentially leading to substantial market sell-offs if initial demand does not meet the volume of outflows from Grayscale’s new ETF.

	Related Reading


Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, highlighted a critical market indicator that could suggest the market has already begun to react. “Seems like the market has already priced the Ethereum spot ETF approval. Grayscale’s ETHE discount to ETH has significantly narrowed in the last few days. The same happened between GBTC and Bitcoin as the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval was nearing,” Moreno noted via X.
While the short-term impact might mirror the turbulent times seen during the Bitcoin ETF launch, the long-term implications for Ethereum could be different. Observers note that despite the initial downturns seen in Bitcoin’s valuation post-ETF, the introduction of a spot ETF was eventually beneficial, leading to greater market acceptance and a price surge.
“BTC rallied 75% in 63 days after the spot ETF was approved. If ETH follows the same trend (if approved), this would take it to $6,446 by July 23,” crypto analyst Miles Deutscher noted.
At press time, ETH traded at $3,676.

Active Hours in Hong Kong ETF Market! What About Entries and Exits for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Hong Kong's cryptocurrency market experienced notable movements on Thursday, with three spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recording net outflows of 25.63 BTC. In contrast, the region's spot Ethereum ETFs remained stable, reporting no new inflows or outflows.
Hong Kong's Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Outflows, While Ethereum ETFs Remain Stable
The total net assets of Hong Kong's three spot Bitcoin ETFs stood at $254.74 million as of Thursday, according to SosoValue data.


In the Ethereum market, Hong Kong's three spot Ethereum ETFs remained unchanged with zero flows on Thursday. This was followed by an entry of 62.8 ETH on Wednesday. The combined net assets of these Ethereum ETFs were worth $50.83 million.
Meanwhile, in the United States, the cryptocurrency ETF landscape has shown opposite trends. The 11 spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. reported their ninth consecutive day of inflows on Thursday, attracting a significant $107.91 million.






This influx of investment coincided with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs and reflected changing political dynamics among lawmakers.
Justin d'Anethan, head of APAC business development at crypto market maker Keyrock, commented on the divergent performance of ETH spot ETFs.


“Admittedly, the ETH spot ETF in Hong Kong accounts for approximately 15% of the total local spot ETF AUM, with the remainder allocated to BTC. A similar proportion can be expected in the US or abroad,” he said.
“This is likely due to the fact that no staking rewards have been offered so far, making spot ETH ETFs an inferior investment product compared to native tokens.”

Why Is The Crypto Market Down Today?


The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) fell below the crucial support of $2.50 trillion, along with Bitcoin, which is currently trading at $67,300. The mixed signal arose from the bearish macro and bullish crypto market developments, impacting BTC and altcoins, of which Ordinals took the biggest hit.
In the news today:-

Today, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved all eight spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF filings. However, the S-1 registration approval is still pending, so it will be a while before these ETFs can be listed.
The US House of Representatives voted to pass the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. This amends the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 to prohibit Federal Reserve banks from offering and using CBDCs for monetary purposes.


The Total Crypto Market Cap Dips
The total crypto market cap has slipped below the $2.50 trillion support floor. This is a crucial psychological level, and losing it is not a good sign for the market. Given the rather bearish macro conditions, the chances of a decline are much higher.
Due to the higher real interest rates, even the news of the spot Ethereum ETF approval could not counter the bearishness, resulting in an overall decline in the market. This drawdown could extend, with TOTAL falling to $2.39 trillion.

However, if $2.50 is reclaimed, the winds could shift in favor of a rise, pushing TOTAL to $2.60 trillion.
Bitcoin’s Price Loses Key Support Level
Bitcoin’s price registered a red candlestick for the fourth day in a row, falling from the high of $71,800 to $67,293 at the time of writing. As BTC fell below the support of $68,500, it extended the bearishness among investors, which could potentially drag Bitcoin down to the next crucial support of $64,883.

On the other hand, despite the decline, BTC is moving within the flag pattern it has been in since early February. Reclaiming the $68,500 support could resume this bullish incline, potentially sending BTC back to $71,800.

Ordinals Loses the Uptrend
Ordinals’ price had been in an uptrend for the past ten days but fell through the line over the past 24 hours. The altcoin noted a 10% decline in this duration, resulting in ORDI changing hands at $37.4 at the moment.
As a result, the potential for breaching the critical resistance of $44 seems to have been delayed, as ORDI would need to note a 12% recovery in order to reach this price.

But if it does manage to, it will not only successfully invalidate the bearish thesis but also increase ORDI holders’ profits.
