Kaspersky's report reveals new tactics used by North Korean crypto hackers - CoinJournal



                    

                    
North Korean hackers deploying “Durian” malware targeting South Korean crypto firms.
The resurgence of dormant hackers like Careto underscores the evolving cybersecurity landscape.
Hacktivist groups like SiegedSec escalate offensive operations amidst global socio-political events.

The first quarter of 2024 has proven particularly eventful, with notable findings and trends emerging from the frontline of cyber security. From the deployment of sophisticated malware variants to the resurgence of long-dormant threat actors, the landscape of cyber threats continues to shape-shift, presenting new challenges for security experts worldwide.
A recent report by the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky made a striking revelation shedding light on the activities of various advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.
The Durian malware targeting South Korean crypto firms
Among the findings made by GReAT is the emergence of the “Durian” malware, attributed to the North Korean hacking group Kimsuky. It has been used to target South Korean cryptocurrency firms and it has a high level of sophistication, boasting comprehensive backdoor functionality.
The Durian malware’s deployment marks a notable escalation in the cyber capabilities of Kimsuky, showcasing their ability to exploit vulnerabilities within the supply chain of targeted organizations.
By infiltrating legitimate security software exclusive to South Korean crypto firms, Kimsuky demonstrates a calculated approach to circumventing traditional security mechanisms. This modus operandi highlights the need for enhanced vigilance and proactive security strategies within the cryptocurrency sector, where the stakes are exceptionally high.
The connection between Kimsuky and the Lazarus Group
The Kaspersky report further unveils a nuanced connection between Kimsuky and another North Korean hacking consortium, the Lazarus Group. While historically distinct entities, the utilization of similar tools such as LazyLoad suggests a potential collaboration or tactical alignment between these crypto-threat actors.
This discovery underscores the interconnected nature of cyber threats, where alliances and partnerships can amplify the impact of malicious activities.
Resurgence of dormant crypto hacking groups
In parallel, the APT trends report reveals a resurgence of long-dormant threat actors, such as the Careto group, whose activities were last observed in 2013.
Despite years of dormancy, Careto resurfaced in 2024 with a series of targeted campaigns, employing custom techniques and sophisticated implants to infiltrate high-profile organizations. This resurgence serves as a stark reminder that cyber threats never truly disappear; they merely adapt and evolve.
Other crypto hacking groups terrorising the world
The Kaspersky report also highlights the emergence of new malware campaigns targeting government entities in the Middle East, such as “DuneQuixote”. Characterized by sophisticated evasion techniques and practical evasion methods, these campaigns underscore the evolving tactics of threat actors in the region.
There is also the emergence of the “SKYCOOK” implant utilised by the Oilrig APT to target internet service providers in the Middle East.
Meanwhile, in Southeast Asia and the Korean Peninsula, the activities of threat actors like DroppingElephant continue to pose significant challenges. Leveraging malicious RAT tools and exploiting platforms like Discord for distribution, these actors demonstrate a multifaceted approach to cyber espionage. The use of legitimate software as initial infection vectors further complicates detection and mitigation efforts, highlighting the need for enhanced threat intelligence and collaboration among stakeholders.
On the hacktivism front, groups like SiegedSec have ramped up their offensive operations, targeting companies and government infrastructure in pursuit of social justice-related goals. With a focus on hack-and-leak operations, these groups leverage current socio-political events to amplify their message and impact.

Peter Brandt Claims XRP’s Value Against Bitcoin Could Hit Zero | Cryptoglobe


                                
Peter Brandt, a seasoned proprietary trader with half a century of trading experience, recently made headlines with his stark forecast for XRP, particularly its performance against Bitcoin. 



Peter Brandt is a seasoned trader with extensive experience in the commodities trading sector. He first gained recognition in the financial world through his work with commodities, but over the years, he has also become well-known as a forex and cryptocurrency trader. Brandt’s expertise is often showcased in his ability to analyze market patterns and trends, which he frequently shares through social media and various trading publications.



He is perhaps best known for his application of classical charting principles to trading, a methodology he has refined over decades in the markets. Brandt has authored a book that delves into these principles, providing insights into his strategies and thought processes. His forecasts and analyses, particularly regarding significant market movements in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, have earned him a considerable following among traders who value his seasoned perspective on market dynamics. Beyond trading, Brandt also contributes to the trading community by offering mentorship and educational resources, aiming to help others navigate the complexities of various financial markets.



Brandt’s analysis, shared on social media platform X, indicates a potential plummet for XRP to zero when compared to Bitcoin. This prediction hinges on a detailed examination of the XRP/BTC price chart over an extended period.



In his post, Brandt showcased a candlestick chart on a 1-week timeframe, which is a type of financial chart used to describe the price movements of an asset. Each “candlestick” typically represents one week of price data in this context, including the opening, closing, high, and low prices. The chart displayed a long-term downtrend for XRP when valued against Bitcoin, with recent months showing a steep decline in value.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The XRP/BTC ratio currently stands at 0.00000803, a dramatic fall of 81.44% from its January level of 0.00001457. This underperformance is notable, especially given that Bitcoin has surged by 49.47% vs. USD year-to-date, whereas XRP has dropped (vs. USD) 18.74% in the same period.







Brandt’s bleak outlook has not gone without critique from XRP supporters.







In 2017, Brandt referred to XRP derogatorily while pointing out its poor performance, only to see it surge by an astonishing 1,418% shortly after his comments, reaching an all-time high of $3.84.







Despite this historical rally, Brandt remains skeptical of XRP’s prospects, particularly its performance relative to Bitcoin. He emphasized that his prediction of XRP approaching zero is specific to its Bitcoin comparative, not its value in USD. Brandt questioned the continued optimism among XRP supporters, noting the asset’s struggle to maintain significant value gains over the past years. According to his observations, XRP has rarely sustained levels above its current market position, finishing higher in just 6 out of the past 126 months.

Philippines begins Peso-backed stablecoin sandbox testing

The Philippines central bank will begin controlled trials of a national stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the local peso.Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) approved a pilot for PHPC, a Philippine peso-backed stablecoin, in partnership with crypto wallet provider Coins.ph. The grant was approved under BSP’s Regulatory Sandbox Framework. As part of the deal, Coins.ph will maintain cash reserves in pesos equivalent to the circulating supply of the PHPC stablecoin within the sandbox environment. The pegging of local currency aims to ease the transition of PHPC back to its physical fiat twin, the announcement said.Source: CoinsphThe sandbox testing is geared toward testing the real-world performance of the PHPC stablecoin and its impact on the local fiat ecosystem. “PHPC’s potential uses include domestic and cross-border payments, trading with other virtual assets, hedging against market volatility, and providing collateral and liquidity in DeFi applications.”The results will determine PHPC’s leap from a sandbox environment to real-world usage. However, a formal public deployment will be subject to final evaluations and approvals by the central bank. Local regulations suggest that the testing duration can range from three to 12 months from the pilot go-live date, depending on the project’s complexity. It is important to note that no official deadline was revealed when announcing the stablecoin experiment.Check out Cointelegraph’s guide to learn more about using stablecoins for everyday transactions.Related: It’s ‘clear’ the US government is going after Tether — Ripple CEOStablecoins backed by the Philippine peso first debuted in July 2019, led by Unionbank, a local commercial bank. UnionBank launched a payments-focused stablecoin pegged to the Philippine peso, PHX, to drive greater financial inclusion. The initiative was launched to support BSP’s drive to advocate digital financial inclusion for people and communities in the country.A related report from PhilStar Global revealed that PHX was being implemented on UnionBank’s i2i platform. The term i2i is an acronym for island-to-island, institution-to-institution and individual-to-individual.Like PHPC, PHX is also frictionlessly redeemable for pesos, which are then credited back to the users’ UnionBank accounts.Magazine: ‘Sic AIs on each other’ to prevent AI apocalypse: David Brin, sci-fi author

Shiba BONE Official Rebuilds ShibaSwap, Shibarium Telegram Group | Cryptopolitan

The Shiba Army has a new gathering place on Telegram. The new group launched with anti-bot features, while the old discussions will remain frozen. The SHIBA BONE OFFICIAL Telegram group is dedicated to ShibaSwap trading and the Shibarium ecosystem. The Telegram group requires verification to prevent bots, and has more than 5,000 members since its launch. The news arrives as Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on the verge of becoming a top 10 token again. SHIB benefitted from several trends in meme tokens and is seen as a close alternative to Dogecoin. The Shiba Inu project provides additional benefits with its Shibarium blockchain and various tokens for liquidity and decentralized trading. SHIB market prices also benefit from regular token burns, which have helped the token “eat” more zeroes in the past. Currently, SHIB is a more mature asset, and a 10X is harder to pull off, but additional assets and rewards aim to compensate. Token burns of SHIB come from fees, as well as from community projects, including NFT collections or gamified burns. The goal is to limit the SHIB supply and potentially drive scarcity. SHIB Benefits from Shibarium Hard ForkAlmost two weeks passed since a Shibarium upgrade, with improved speed and low fees. The use of Shibarium also affects BONE, one of the main staking tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. BONE owners can move the asset from Ethereum to the Shibarium blockchain for improved speed and lower fees. BONE currently trades at a much higher valuation of $0.55, and has nearly 100K holders on Ethereum. The token also exists as Shibarium Wrapped BONE, with just above 2,000 wallets with it. BONE is currently close to its lower range but has rallied close to $2 every few months in the past years. BONE’s performance adds to the ShibaInu exposure and helps retain the community of investors. Shiba Inu Aims for Growth by Holding and Token BurnsThe Shiba Inu community has shown a readiness to wait out bear markets and avoid selling to improve the performance of all tokens in the ecosystem. Shiba Inu relies on holding various ratios of SHIB, BONE, LEASH, and TREAT. The meme ecosystem also ties up with NFT collections and aims to draw in play-to-earn games as well. In late April, Shiba Inu drew attention with its TREAT token, which will have a greater role in the coming months. TREAT is currently trading at $0.0008 and is building up liquidity on UniSwap and ShibaSwap. ShibaSwap Aims to Revive InflowsWhile SHIB remains a highly active token, the native ShibaSwap is trying to grow TVL and lock more liquidity. The exchange currently carries around $23.2M, but suffers from stagnant inflows. BONE liquidity is around 3.48M, generating $1.18M in daily activity. The ShibaSwap exchange still manages to draw in $1.4M in annual fees, but has yet to achieve organic growth. Shiba Inu is also proactive in removing bots, hence the low organic activity on ShibaSwap. In 2024, the newly launched Telegram group is also trying to boost engagement and bring back trading.BONE tokens are key for reviving decentralized trading and making ShibaSwap more important among DeFi projects. BONE is also key to network security, as it can be locked for block production.Shiba Inu Among the Safest ProjectsThe Shiba Inu code is nearly three years old, and is among the safest decentralized projects. Regarding meme tokens, not all are made equal, and some hold significant risk. Shiba Inu is one of the few meme projects regularly audited by Certik, with the latest checkup being in February. According to Certik, the Shiba Inu platform has a 92.36% security score, which verifies technical issues as well as the community and operations. SHIB remains a good alternative to being exposed to meme-based trading while avoiding rug pulls or unverified tokens. Certik has focused on the ShibaSwap smart contracts, ensuring safety for liquidity providers. The given score puts Shiba Inu and ShibaSwap among the top 10% of safest and most transparent blockchain startups.

Why Chinese Workers Are Rushing To Convert Digital Yuan CBDC Payments Into Cash - Benzinga

Despite the Chinese government’s push for the adoption of the digital yuan, many workers are still hesitant to use it for their daily transactions.What Happened: Sammy Lin, an account manager at a state-owned bank in Suzhou, receives her monthly salary in digital yuan. However, she, like many others, prefers to convert it into regular cash due to the lack of interest and limited usability, reported South China Morning Post.“I prefer not to keep the money in the e-CNY app, because there's no interest if I leave it there,” Lin said. Changshu, a city in Suzhou, began paying its public sector workers in digital yuan a year ago, followed by other employers. However, the employees are not using the digital currency directly due to concerns about privacy and its limited functionality.Ye Dongyan, a researcher at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, highlighted the need to balance privacy and security, which has slowed the progress of promoting the digital yuan."Paper currency is used anonymously, but the digital yuan is different," Dongyan said. "The boundaries between information tracking and information security protection need more deliberation."See Also: Kevin O’Leary Responds To Cathie Wood’s Bitcoin Prediction: ‘The U.S. Economy Would Have To Collapse’Albert Wang, a government employee in Suzhou, noted that while the digital yuan could help reduce corruption by limiting cash bribery, its limited usability makes it uncompetitive with widely used payment tools like Alipay and WeChat Pay.Why It Matters: The Chinese government has been actively promoting the digital yuan, with Suzhou being one of the first cities to pay public sector workers in the new currency. Despite this, the slow adoption rate among workers raises questions about the currency’s future.Moreover, in the same month, Standard Chartered Bank (China) became the first foreign bank to join China’s CBDC pilot testing, offering digital yuan exchange services to its customers. This move signaled the increasing internationalization of the digital yuan.Furthermore, in March, SWIFT announced plans to launch a new platform connecting central bank digital currencies with the existing financial system. This development is expected to be a game-changer for the evolving CBDC ecosystem, given SWIFT’s crucial role in global banking.Read Next: Trump’s Next Vice President?

R. Kiyosaki warns US dollar to crash as ‘BRICS gold crypto’ emerges


Amid warnings of a major financial crash, famous investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ Robert Kiyosaki, has shared his views on why the United States dollar, in particular, might suffer as a new currency threatens its global domination.
Specifically, Kiyosaki was visiting South Africa, “watching and listening to rumors of what will happen when BRICS nations, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa produce BRICS crypto, possibly backed by gold,” as he told his followers in an X post published on May 12.
Hyperinflation on horizon
Indeed, according to the renowned finance educator, if the rumors are true, this would mean a loss of value to the US dollar and a hyperinflation in the US, and he recommended investing money in alternative assets instead, including gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC) to protect oneself against this crash:



“If BRICS gold crypto happens, trillions in fake money, fiat US dollars will come rushing back to home to America causing hyperinflation in America, ultimately destroying US dollar. Best buy real gold, silver, and Bitcoin now, and protect yourself from the crash of US dollar.”

As a reminder, Kiyosaki has lately intensified his doomsday warnings, stressing the crash has already started, signaling the end of the US dollar, and that the dire situation is only worsening “because our debt keeps going up,” with the dollar’s demise the primary reason to accumulate the above assets.
More recently, he said that most people were living in “Disneyland” instead of preparing for the crisis using a strategy he considers the best – starting their own business, using debt as money to buy cash-flowing assets like rental properties, and saving gold, silver, and the maiden cryptocurrency.
Robert Kiyosaki and Bitcoin
Interestingly, the ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ author has also admitted to being a latecomer to the crypto industry and not knowing much about the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, but he has been a fan nonetheless, including Bitcoin in most of his recommendations.
On top of that, he has agreed with the founder and CEO of ARK Invest, Cathie Wood, and her extremely bullish prediction that Bitcoin price in USD could hit $2.3 million. For now, Bitcoin is trading at $61,639, gaining 1.55% on the day, but declining 4.57% in the past week, and losing 8.58% on its monthly chart.

Tokyo-listed Metaplanet outlines Bitcoin plan amid rising economic pressure in Japan

Tokyo stock exchange-listed Metaplanet declared Bitcoin as its strategic reserve asset due to the current economic uncertainty pervading the Japanese economy, according to a May 13 statement.The firm said:“Metaplanet has adopted Bitcoin as its strategic treasury reserve asset. This move is a direct response to sustained economic pressures in Japan, notably high government debt levels, prolonged periods of negative real interest rates, and the consequently weak yen.”Metaplanet justified this shift by highlighting Bitcoin’s advantages over the Japanese Yen, including protection against currency devaluation, opportunities for speculative arbitrage in capital markets, and leveraging Bitcoin’s tax benefits.Meanwhile, the firm’s latest move has continued with several pro-BTC decisions in recent months. In April, the firm committed to Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, allocating ¥1 billion, around $6.56 million, to the flagship digital asset in a significant shift in its financial strategy.Since then, the Japan-based firm has accumulated approximately 117.72 BTC, valued at 1.2 billion JPY or $7.7 million. It has also appointed Dylan LeClair, a staunch Bitcoin advocate, as its Director of Bitcoin Strategy.Bitcoin-first approachMetaplanet said it would prioritize a “Bitcoin-first [and] Bitcoin-only approach” for its operations.According to the firm, this decision is rooted in its belief that the flagship digital asset is “fundamentally superior to any other forms of political currency, traditional stores of value and investment, and all other crypto-assets/securities.”It continued that BTC’s blockchain reliance on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism is advantageous as it “is intricately linked to real-world energy inputs, mirroring the cost conditions seen in traditional commodities.”Metaplanet furthered:“Bitcoin’s monetary policy is rigidly set in stone through 2140, setting it apart from both monetary metals and competing crypto projects operated at the whims of centralized developer teams. There will only ever be 21,000,000 BTC.”Consequently, the Japanese public company stated that it would initiate several financial options, including periodic share issuance and long-dated yen liabilities, to accumulate BTC instead of retaining the “ever-weaker yen.”Mentioned in this article

SBI VC Trade launches validator node on XRP Ledger (XRPL), revealing the firm’s support for XRP.



JackTheRippler reveals Japan’s use of XRP, highlighting the acceptance of XRP outside of the US.



Despite the major development, XRP is trading at a downward trend, marking a 2%+ dip over the last day.




Ripple’s native token, XRP, has secured a historic achievement with the SBI VC Trade’s validator node launch on XRP Ledger (XRPL). JackTheRippler, a prominent figure in the crypto sector, recently shared an X post, revealing Japan’s use of XRP as a bridge currency.







On May 10, SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, one of the leading financial institutions in Japan, announced the platform’s decision to become a validator on XRPL. The financial giant’s move demonstrates the industry’s unwavering support of XRP, hinting at the potential adoption of the token on a larger scale.



Despite the major development in the XRP ecosystem, the token, currently at $0.4925, is trading in a downward trend. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has seen a marginal decline of 2.99%. Meanwhile, the token has shown significant declines of 7.9% and 9.6% over the last week and month, respectively.









Notably, validators are crucial in verifying transactions and securing the network. Reinforcing the trust on XRP, SBI VC Trade is set to become a default Unique Node List (dUNL) validator on the Ledger. Reflecting on the XRP ecosystem’s new development, JackTheRippler wrote, “Ripple already conquered the financial system outside the United States of America!”



In a recent X post, JackTheRippler forecasted a potential uptick in XRP’s value, driven by the ecosystem’s major events, including financial institution integrations. He asserted that a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP is just a matter of time. Other major events spotlighted by JackTheRippler were the SEC-Ripple lawsuit’s final judgment, Ripple IPO, and potential XRP ETFs.

Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) to Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PEPEVIR will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Viral Pepe.



Currently, Viral Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PEPEVIR on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Viral Pepe by entering its contract address – AKN68pzqJzSDNfiv7nDFk27ny5TkgKFjmKEozcwYszVq – in the receiving field.



PEPEVIR currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Tether discredits Ripple CEO comments over US scrutiny

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has hit back at Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse over his recent comments that the United States government is “going after” the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, Tether.Ardoino took to social media platform X to clear the air around potential U.S. agency action against the firm and called out Garlinghouse for spreading “fear about USDT.” Ardoino suggested that Garlinghouse’s comments were hypocritical, given that Ripple is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is trying to launch a competing stablecoin to Tether’s (USDT).Source: Paolo Ardoino Ripple plans to enter the stablecoin market in 2024 amid its ongoing lawsuit against the SEC.The Tether CEO said that USDT is the largest stablecoin by market share, with millions of users across the world, and it has helped bank users in developing economies. He added:“USDT proved over time to have strong price stability, highly liquid reserves, top tier custodians and profound compliance.”Ardonio also listed several factors that make USDT compliant and one of the most widely used stablecoins. He said Tether has collaborated with 124 law enforcement agencies across 40+ countries and has blocked over $1.3 billion worth of assets linked to scams, hacks and money laundering since it launched. Of the $1.3 billion in blocked assets, Tether blocked more than $639 million by working with U.S. law enforcement.Related: Tether slams Deutsche Bank over suggestion its stablecoin could failArdonio also revealed that in the last 12 months, Tether has voluntarily complied with 198 requests from law enforcement to block wallets, 90 of which came from U.S. law enforcement agencies. It has complied with 339 requests in the last three years, of which 158 were from U.S. law enforcement.Ardonio concluded his tweet with a quip on competing stablecoin issuers. He said Tether cooperates directly with law enforcement agencies while other issuers only comply with judicial orders:“While other stablecoins, although they claim to be ‘more compliant,’ they require a judge order, allowing hackers, scammers and criminals a long time to move funds around.”The Tether CEO’s response came after Garlinghouse claimed a “100%” chance of another crypto-related black swan event during a podcast interview. The Ripple CEO said the U.S. government is going after Tether without elaborating on the reasons behind his assessment. However, Garlinghouse also acknowledged Tether's role in the crypto market.Many in the crypto community saw Ripple CEO’s comments as an ominous hint of the upcoming U.S. regulatory action. Others claimed it was just a competitive tactic as Ripple will launch a stablecoin soon.Cointelegraph reached out to Tether for comments but has yet to receive a response.Magazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom

Machine learning algorithm predicts Bitcoin price on May 31, 2024


After generating seemingly endless enthusiasm following its skyrocketing to a new all-time high near $73,000 in March and around the highly-anticipated halving event in April, Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen off somewhat.
The world’s premier cryptocurrency has, in more recent weeks, been struggling with lackluster performance and a string of violent corrections that saw it, at times, plummet as low as $57,000.
Though the most recent trading trends have been positive, as BTC is 3.18% in the green on the 24-hour chart and Bitcoin price today stands at $62,907, but a shadow casts large given its weekly and monthly shakiness.

Hoping to provide a modicum of clarity on whether Bitcoin is now set to surge toward previously predicted highs or if more bearish experts are correct and the current cycle has already topped, Finbold decided to consult the AI-driven machine learning algorithms of a platform specializing in forecasting asset prices – PricePredictions.
Machine learning algorithms forecast a gradual uptrend
As it turns out, the algorithms of PricePredictions estimate that the cryptocurrency market – at least when it comes to Bitcoin – is at the end of its highly volatile phase. 
Indeed, the platform forecasts that BTC is set to enter a gradual uptrend that will see the coin hit $63,991.20 on May 31 – a slight rise of 1.725% over the course of two and a half weeks.

Though the algorithms see some deviations from the generally steady climb, it would appear they also estimate these will have little bearing on Bitcoin’s performance through the rest of May.
Experts agree on volatility ahead
While algorithms consider a rather uncharacteristic steady rise lies ahead, several crypto experts foresee significant swings – trouble even – on the horizon.
In an analysis posted on X on May 12, Ali Martinez identified $64,290 as a price crucial for BTC to attain. According to the expert, should Bitcoin achieve this goal, it is likely it will experience a massive rally toward a new all-time high (ATH) of $76,610.
On the flip side, should it fail to achieve the climb to $64,290, it is likely that the world’s premier cryptocurrency will quickly lose its footing and find it again only at approximately $51,970.

Another prominent crypto expert, Michaël van de Poppe, advised caution as he believes that should Bitcoin again slip below $60,000, it would continue collapsing until it finds itself in the support zone between $52,000 and $55,000.

It is, however, possibly worth noting that on April 30, van de Poppe estimated that Bitcoin would find its bottom within a week indicating that the then-discovered levels just under $57,000 constitute the lowest BTC will go for the time being.

CEO: Trump Campaign Eyes Crypto-Friendly Policies


																The intersection of cryptocurrency and politics has taken center stage as the potential return to power of former President Donald Trump emerges with a crypto-friendly agenda. The revelation comes from none other than David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, who disclosed his involvement in advising Trump’s campaign to adopt policies favorable to the crypto industry.

Bailey, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, shocked many when he unveiled his team’s role in guiding Trump’s campaign towards embracing Bitcoin and other digital assets. Bailey revealed that they had proposed a crypto-focused executive order to be signed on Trump’s first day back in office, signaling a significant departure from Trump’s previous skepticism towards cryptocurrencies.

Trump’s Crypto Evolution: From Skepticism To Embrace
Trump’s shifting stance on cryptocurrencies has been nothing short of remarkable. Once vocal about his disdain for digital assets, Trump now appears open to embracing them, contrasting sharply with President Biden’s purported lack of understanding of the crypto space. This evolution has ignited discussions about the potential impact of a Trump presidency on the crypto industry.

The Divide: Pro-Bitcoin Or Anti-Biden?
Bailey’s announcement has sparked debates within the crypto community, with some viewing it as a strategic move to ensure a more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
However, others question the motives behind supporting Trump, citing concerns about his controversial tenure as president. Bailey himself clarified that their actions are aimed at defending Bitcoin rather than endorsing Trump personally.

With the upcoming presidential elections looming, the role of Bitcoin in shaping political landscapes has never been more apparent. Bailey’s call to mobilize and ensure a pro-Bitcoin president raises questions about the growing influence of cryptocurrency in electoral politics.
Will Bitcoin enthusiasts unite to sway the outcome of the elections in favor of a crypto-friendly candidate?

XREX Singapore Secures MPI Licence from MAS for Cross-Border Solutions | Coinspeaker



XREX Singapore introduces XREX Pay, offering businesses cross-border B2B payments and money transfer solutions. The platform will support traditional currencie­s like the Singapore Dollar (SGD) and US Dollar (USD) as we­ll as stablecoins like Tethe­r (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).

In a notable development, XREX Singapore, a blockchain-focuse­d financial group that helps cross-border payme­nts for emerging markets, secured a Major Payment Institution (MPI) Licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on May 12, 2024. This came after XREX got initial approval for the lice­nce in November 2023.
The­ MAS is known for its strict regulation, and this licence shows XREX Singapore­’s commitment to compliance and security. “Our engagements with the MAS have repeatedly shown us why they are internationally revered as a leading central bank and financial regulator,” said XREX Singapore’s CEO. He­ also said XREX will “bring blockchain-enabled digital payment currencies to ubiquity” with this licence­.




This strategic move by XREX fits with Singapore’s ambition to become a global le­ader in finance tech innovation. The­ city has worked to make regulations encouraging the growth of blockchain and digital assets. XREX Singapore’s focus on e­asy cross-border payments, espe­cially for small and medium businesses in ne­w markets, directly helps financial inclusion, a ke­y goal for both XREX and the MAS.
XREX’s Regulatory Commitment
“The MPI licence is a testament to our unwavering commitment to the highest regulatory compliance standards,” said XREX Co-founde­r and CEO Wayne Huang. This focus on rules goes be­yond just getting the licence­. XREX is working to make sure its service­s follow global best practices, including the Financial Action Task Force­’s (FATF) travel rule, which fights money launde­ring and terrorism funding.
This commitment to transparency is also seen in XREX Pay, a new platform that XREX Singapore­ will start. XREX Pay serves businesse­s with features like cross-borde­r B2B payments and money transfer solutions. The platform will support traditional currencie­s like the Singapore Dollar (SGD) and US Dollar (USD) as we­ll as stablecoins like Tethe­r (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).
XREX Singapore’s MPI licence cove­rs a wide range of payment se­rvices, including account creation, domestic and cross-borde­r money transfers, merchant acquisition, e­-money issuance, and digital payment toke­n services. This broad licence­ makes XREX a key player in Singapore­’s growing FinTech ecosystem.
Forging Partnerships in Singapore
XREX has obtained approval for six out of the seve­n payment services unde­r the MPI licencing framework, as state­d by XREX’s Co-founder and Group Chief Reve­nue Officer, Winston Hsiao. Additionally, the company aims to leve­rage its headquarters in Singapore­ to forge strategic partnerships with major banks, cre­dit card institutions, and other prominent payment provide­rs.
This collaborative approach is designed to build ne­xt-generation financial systems that se­amlessly integrate traditional banking and blockchain-base­d finance, ultimately creating a more­ inclusive and efficient financial landscape­. By securing the MPI licence­ and launching XREX Pay, XREX’s Singapore-based operations have­ taken a crucial step towards their obje­ctive of revolutionizing cross-border payme­nts.

BounceBit Mainnet Launches Amid Cybersecurity Alert


							

BounceBit advances with mainnet launch and BB token airdrop, bolstered by successful funding and exchange listings.



A phishing scam targeting BounceBit users underscores the need for vigilance, with official links provided to avoid potential fraud.



BounceBit’s unique Shared-Security Clients infrastructure introduces a dual-token system.




BounceBit, a Bitcoin restaking protocol, is set to launch its mainnet today, accompanied by the issuance of BB token airdrops. However, the excitement surrounding this milestone is dampened by a cybersecurity alert raised by 23pds, the Chief of Information and Security Officer at SlowMist.



According to 23pds, the first search result for “BounceBit” on Google leads to a phishing website, bouncbit[.]io, posing a serious threat to users. Hence, caution is advised to avoid falling victim to potential scams.







BounceBit, officially launches its mainnet at 02:30 UTC today, followed by a BB token airdrop from 08:30 to 10:00 UTC. Moreover, the protocol is poised for further expansion with the listing of BB tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges KuCoin and Gate.io, commencing trading operations at 10:00 UTC.



Despite the promising developments, the cybersecurity alert underscores the importance of vigilance within the crypto space. In response to the phishing threat, BounceBit has proactively shared official airdrop and customer support links via its X account to guide users safely.





The mainnet launch and BB token airdrop mark significant milestones for BounceBit, following its successful $6 million seed funding round earlier this year. Co-led by Blockchain Capital and Breyer Capital, with participation from other venture capital entities and angel investors, this funding solidified BounceBit’s position in the market.









Moreover, BounceBit introduces a novel BTC restaking mechanism through its Shared-Security Clients (SSC) infrastructure, initially focusing on the BTC Restaking Chain. This innovative approach involves a dual-token system where validators stake both BTC and BB, enhancing the platform’s security and stability.



As of May 13, DeFiLlama reports a total value locked (TVL) of $448.65 million in BounceBit. With such substantial backing and innovative features, BounceBit’s mainnet launch and BB token airdrop are expected to garner significant attention within the crypto community, attracting both genuine interest and potentially fraudulent activities.

Steven Nerayoff Slams US SEC's Crypto Stance: Calls For Clarity And Innovation | Bitcoinist.com


								As the debate over cryptocurrency regulation continues, former advisor to the Ethereum network Steven Nerayoff has become a public voice criticizing the approach taken by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) towards crypto, especially under the leadership of the agency’s Chairman Gary Gensler. N
erayoff’s criticism goes beyond regulatory policy to consider the wider ramifications for the cryptocurrency market, citing the harm done by Gensler and Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum.
Impact On Crypto From Bad Actors
Ethereum‘s security status has been a significant discussion in the crypto industry with the SEC planning enforcement proceedings to regulate ETH as a security. However, the former ETH advisor Steven Nerayoff believes the industry is not at odds with Ethereum, but rather with Joseph Lubin and other negative actors, particularly the SEC chair Gary Gensler.

According to Nerayoff, the Ethereum co-founder and other bad actors have seriously damaged the crypto sector with their actions over time. As a result, crypto’s total market capitalization has declined, hindering ecosystem expansion and defrauding the public of hundreds of billions, possibly trillions of dollars.
He explained that by putting their financial gain ahead of the creation of dApps and true value, the market cap has seen lesser growth in comparison to what Nerayoff had anticipated. “It is clear that if not for them, the market cap could easily be 10x or more of its current value,” he stated.
Nerayoff claims Lubin is the height of ambiguity and uncertainty, trying to play a victim card despite his litigation against the SEC regarding Ethereum and his response to the Commission’s questions concerning MetaMask.
Last month, the SEC filed a Wells Notice to Consensys while mainly aiming at its MetaMask wallet service, indicating a potential regulatory dispute. Lubin, responding to the SEC’s move, claimed that the agency is pursuing a strategic series of enforcement actions instead of having transparent rules and open communication, thereby endangering the crypto landscape. 
However, Nerayoff, dissatisfied with Lubin’s response, thinks it is nothing more than a devious scheme from the ETH co-founder, carried out in concert with Gary Gensler and the SEC. 
He further stated that it is evident that Lubin is afraid of his failure and the evidence is there. “From securities fraud to market manipulation, colluding with foreign governments and US government agencies, he has done it all,” Nerayoff stated. These actions, according to Narayoff, committed by Lubin could potentially send him to prison for a long time.
Need For Regulatory Transparency And Growth
Given the negative impact caused by these bad actors over the years, Nerayoff has stressed the need for appropriate supervision and clarity, which are vital for the development of the crypto landscape.

The Ethereum former advisor noted that investors have been harmed due to these wrong actions, and it is only proper that these dishonest people should be brought to justice. “It is time to demand transparency, the industry deserves better than what these bad actors have given it, and it is time to take action to ensure that crypto thrives for the better,” he added.

Severe crisis incoming? Expert Michaël van de Poppe questions 4-year Bitcoin cycle


With the recent Bitcoin (BTC) halving failing to make an immediate bullish effect on the price of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe has shared his doubts regarding the four-year cycle for the maiden crypto.
Specifically, van de Poppe observed that there was a widespread expectation that there would be a four-year cycle for Bitcoin but also argued that this might not be the case this time around, as “liquidity goes on both sides,” according to an analysis he shared in an X post on May 12.
In his view, the current cycle will be much shorter and may not even cross three years, after which the price of Bitcoin would enter a significant bear market, or as he noted, “this cycle is going to last until late ‘26, perhaps ‘27, and then, we’re facing a severe crisis.”



‘Opportunity cost’ strategy: Selling all BTC?
It is also worth mentioning that van de Poppe has recently announced he was selling all of his BTC “to swap it towards another asset class because I want to make more Bitcoin and because now is the actual best opportunity out there in terms of valuation,” as he explained in a YouTube video shared on May 12.

“I’m doing this and swapping my Bitcoin towards altcoins because I think that there is a huge opportunity cost out there and that there is a lot of ROI to be made by investing into altcoins.”

Describing his ‘opportunity cost’ strategy in detail, the crypto analyst made his main point, suggesting that investors shouldn’t hold onto this other asset – altcoins in his case – at all, but “trading them to make more Bitcoin and keep on having your Bitcoin.”

Bitcoin price analysis
Meanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $62,960, suggesting an increase of 3.11% in the last 24 hours, declining 3.35% across the previous seven days, and losing 6.63% over the past month, according to the most recent charts on May 13.

                        The Pudgy Penguins nonfungible token (NFT) project has achieved a remarkable milestone, with more than one million Pudgy Penguin toys sold over the past 12 months.According to CEO Luca Schnetzler, the popular NFT project has experienced a surge in sales, expanding its reach to retailers worldwide.In a recent post on X, Schnetzler expressed surprise at the Consumer Crypto revolution being led by “fat flightless birds.”The sales milestone comes on the heels of the recent news that Pudgy Toys with Pudgy World are now available in the prominent United States retail giant, Target.Pudgy Penguin Toys Continue to Gain Popularity
Pudgy Penguins, a collection of 8,888 colorful penguin avatars, gained popularity after its creation in 2021.The project faced initial challenges, with accusations of a rug pull against the former founder.However, in 2022, Schnetzler acquired the brand for $2.5 million, revitalizing its prospects.The success of Pudgy Penguins extends beyond the digital realm, as stuffed toy versions of the lovable penguins are now also available for purchase in retail giants like Walmart and Target.The move has contributed to the project’s ongoing triumph.One unique aspect of Pudgy Penguins is its model that allows NFT holders to earn 5% royalties on net revenues from sales of physical products featuring their unique Pudgy Penguin designs. The NFT versions themselves have gained significant value, with a floor price of 12.87 ETH (approximately $37,580 at current prices) on NFT marketplace OpenSea.The recent sales highlight includes the impressive transaction of Penguin #6873, which was sold for a staggering 400 ETH, equivalent to around $1.17 million, according to OpenSea.Sales activity for the Pudgy Penguins collection experienced a peak in mid-February, with 439 sales per day at an average price of 20 ETH.While sales volumes have slightly declined since then, the project still maintains a daily average of approximately 269 sales as of May 6.In terms of secondary sales over the past seven days, Pudgy Penguins ranks twelfth on the NFT sales tracking platform CryptoSlam, with a total value of $2.2 million.Pudgy Penguins Partners with Unstoppable Domains
Back in February, Pudgy Penguins partnered with Unstoppable Domains to introduce “.pudgy” domain names. The collaboration allows customers of Unstoppable Domains to purchase top-level domain names ending in “.pudgy,” which can be associated with Pudgy Penguin NFTs.The integration introduces numerous possibilities for domain holders, including the ability to send and receive web3 messages, make crypto payments between domain addresses, and collect exclusive utility badges through the new domains.“We are thrilled to welcome Pudgy Penguins, a true innovator and a strong brand, into the Unstoppable Domains family,” said Sandy Carter, COO at Unstoppable Domains.

Ethereum's Ether Supply Turns Inflationary for First Time Since Merge After Dencun Upgrade



                    

Two months after the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade, Ethereum has seen a shift in its Ether supply dynamics, no longer exhibiting deflationary characteristics. 



According to CryptoQuant data, the total supply of Ether grew slightly from 120 million on March 12 to 120.1 million by May 7, marking the first inflationary trend since the Merge transition in September 2022.




The Merge was a significant shift for Ethereum, moving from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus model. 



This change included a mechanism for burning transaction fees, which initially led to a deflationary supply of Ether. 



Since the implementation of the Merge, over 419,713 ETH has been permanently removed from circulation, based on data from ultrasound.money.



The recent Dencun upgrade, however, has reduced the median transaction fees by up to four times, despite maintaining the same level of network activity. 



This reduction in fees has resulted in a decrease in the amount of Ether being burned, contributing to the increase in total supply.

As noted in a CryptoQuant report from May 8, “The Dencun upgrade has made ETH inflationary again, potentially killing the narrative of ‘Ultra sound’ money as a structurally lower amount of transaction fees burned on Ethereum have had the corresponding effect of not decreasing the total supply of ETH to keep it deflationary.”




Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, emphasized on May 9 that the loss of deflationary status is not particularly critical for Ethereum’s broader ecosystem. 



He stated in an X post, “Post-Dencun upgrade, ETH lost deflationary status with reduced fees, departing from ‘ultrasound money.’ Ethereum’s strength lies in DApps; it’s wiser not to compare it to Bitcoin’s sound money narrative.”




This development signals a shift in the economic dynamics of Ether but does not undermine the foundational benefits of the Ethereum network, particularly its application in decentralized applications (DApps). 



While the narrative of ‘ultra sound’ money may be diminishing, Ethereum’s core utility and innovation in decentralized solutions continue to hold strong.

El Salvador launches $360M Bitcoin Treasury monitoring website

El Salvador has launched its own proof-of-reserve website, featuring various tools for monitoring the country’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings using on-chain data. El Salvador’s online Bitcoin Treasury provides real-time data on the nation’s BTC reserves. The Central American nation officially holds 5,748 BTC, which is currently worth approximately $360 million, with Bitcoin tradeiabove the $62,700 mark as of 8:20 a.m. UTC.El Salvador has bought seven BTC worth over $438,000 during the past week while adding a total of 31 BTC worth $1.94 million over the past 30 days, according to the website.Source: Bitcoin.gob.svThe purchases remain in line with El Salvador’s goal of adding 1 Bitcoin to its treasury every day.El Salvador was the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021.

Philippines’ central bank greenlights pilot for Peso-backed stablecoin - CoinJournal



                    

                    
BSP approves pilot for PHPC, a Peso-backed stablecoin, in collaboration with Coins.ph.
Sandbox testing to evaluate PHPC’s real-world performance and impact on local fiat ecosystem.
Transition to real-world usage subject to final evaluations and approvals by central bank.

The digital currencies landscape in the Philippines is set for a major shift after the country’s central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), granted approval for the commencement of a pilot program for a Philippine Peso-backed stablecoin (PHPC).
BHP’s move signals a progressive step towards exploring the potential of blockchain technology and stablecoins in the nation’s financial ecosystem.
Sandbox testing to evaluate PHPC’s viability
The pilot program, conducted within the framework of BSP’s Regulatory Sandbox, will see the collaboration between the central bank and crypto wallet provider Coins.ph.

#ICYMI: #CoinsPH has been granted @bangkosentral (BSP) approval to pilot PHPC, a Philippine Peso stablecoin 🇵🇭
Learn more about this milestone and the pilot here: https://t.co/zpQQvr7Pv9 pic.twitter.com/a2jWB8mSeJ
— Coins.ph (@coinsph) May 9, 2024

The primary objective of the pilot program is to assess the real-world performance of the PHPC and its potential impact on the local fiat ecosystem.
Under the terms of the pilot, Coins.ph will maintain cash reserves in pesos equivalent to the circulating supply of PHPC within the sandbox environment, ensuring a stable 1:1 pegging of the digital currency to the Philippine peso.
BSP’s choice Coins.ph is strategic. Being a licensed crypto service provider in the Philippines, Coins.ph dominates Philippines crypto space, especially after its partnership with Circle in 2023 for USDC remittances in the Philippines. It was the first to add BRC-20-support in the Philippines.
The sandbox testing phase is designed to explore various use cases for PHPC, including domestic and cross-border payments, trading with other virtual assets, hedging against market volatility, and providing collateral and liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
These trials will provide valuable insights into PHPC’s practicality and effectiveness in facilitating financial transactions and promoting financial inclusion in the Philippines.
Transitioning from sandbox to real-world usage
While the pilot program marks an important milestone in the development of PHPC, its transition from a sandbox environment to real-world usage is contingent upon the results of the testing phase and final evaluations by the central bank.
According to local regulations, the duration of the testing period can range from three to 12 months, depending on the complexity of the project. However, no official deadline has been disclosed for the conclusion of the stablecoin experiment.
The current initiative to launch a Peso-backed stablecoin builds upon previous efforts to introduce stablecoins pegged to the Philippine peso, such as the PHX launched by UnionBank in 2019. UnionBank’s PHX, aimed at driving greater financial inclusion, is also redeemable for pesos and implemented on the bank’s i2i platform.
The emergence of PHPC and other stablecoin projects reflects the growing recognition of digital currencies as viable tools for enhancing financial services and expanding access to digital payments in the Philippines.

Buy Bitcoin - BRICS gold-backed crypto to 'crash U.S. dollars:' Robert Kiyosaki - AMBCrypto



BRICS gold-backed crypto will severely affect the U.S. dollar, per Kiyosaki
However, BRICS member states still don’t have an official consensus on a common currency.

Robert Kiyosaki, author of “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” has underscored the severe impact of BRICS gold-backed crypto on the U.S. dollar. 
As part of their de-dollarization plans, the BRICS nations—originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—have explored various ways to conduct cross-border trades without relying on the U.S. dollar and Euros. 
Digital technology and blockchain are part of the plans. Additionally, a gold-backed currency has also been floated. 
According to Kiyosaki, should BRICS formalize gold-backed crypto, the U.S. dollar will crash, 
“If BRICS gold crypto happens trillions in fake money, fiat US dollars will come rushing back to home to America causing hyperinflation in America, ultimately destroying US dollar.”
BRICS move: A threat to USD and a win for Bitcoin?
In the past, U.S. dollars accounted for almost 100% of cross-border transactions, including oil purchases.
 However, a recent IMF report established that the U.S. dollar’s dominance has declined, dropping from 80% (2010) to 50% (2023).
On the contrary, China’s Renminbi (RMB), a member of the BRICS, has jumped from zero to 50% over the same period. 
If the BRICS gold-backed crypto follows RMB’s steps, it will further dent U.S. dominance on cross-border payments. 
That means BRICS countries could offload their USD reserves back to the U.S., and according to Kiyosaki, such an upsurge in supply could cause “hyperinflation in America.”
For diversification and investor protection in such a scenario, Kiyosaki urged his followers to buy Bitcoin [BTC] and metals, 
“Best buy real gold, silver, and Bitcoin now, and protect yourself from the crash of the US dollar.” 
However, an official BRICS gold-backed crypto could still be far away. 
In August 2023, India’s foreign secretary, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, underscored BRICS members’ preference for trading using respective currencies rather than a common one.  
Although Russia warmed up to a common currency in March 2024, with blockchain and digital technology in mind, all BRICS members are yet to communicate an official consensus. 
Perhaps more clarity could be shed during the upcoming BRICS summit in Russia, scheduled for October 2024.

US State Rep. Mulls 5% Bitcoin Investment In Rainy Day Fund


								Keith Ammon, New Hampshire State Representative for New Boston, Mont Vernon, Lyndeborough and Vice Chair of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, opened a discussion on the potential of diversifying the state’s financial reserves into Bitcoin ETFs. His comments, posted on X (formerly Twitter), highlight a dramatic what-if scenario that underscores the explosive growth of BTC over the last decade.
What Bitcoin Can Do For New Hampshire
Ammon’s reflection on the state’s financial decisions comes at a time when BTC and other digital assets are increasingly being acknowledged by major institutional investors. His detailed analysis posited, “Should the State of New Hampshire investigate allocating a small percentage of its reserves into a Bitcoin ETF? Of course, hindsight is 20/20, but had the State of NH put just 5% ($4.65M) of its 2016 $93M rainy day fund into Bitcoin and held it, that amount of BTC today would be worth nearly half a billion dollars ($473M), a 10,000% ROI.”
This assertion follows a surge in institutional interest in BTC as a viable asset class. According to recent insights from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, there has been a noticeable increase in Bitcoin ETF investors, which now includes entities like sovereign wealth funds and pensions.

Additionally, Ammon cites Manuel Nordeste, Fidelity’s Vice President of Digital Assets, who recently highlighted the growing trend among major pension funds and big banks towards spot Bitcoin ETF allocations, driven by an escalating interest in the digital asset market. “25% of pension managers present at a recent panel personally owned digital assets. If just 1% of state pension AUM ($5.5T) flowed into BTC, it would dwarf mining revenue, leading to a supply shortage relative to demand and a price increase for Bitcoin,” Ammon stated.
Reflecting on the potential future impacts, Ammon also referred to a prediction by Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, who has forecasted a significant rise in Bitcoin’s value. Wood speculates that Bitcoin could reach $3.8 million per unit by 2030 if institutional investors allocate more than 5% of their portfolios to the cryptocurrency.
Utilizing this prediction, Ammon extrapolated potential returns for New Hampshire, “If NH invested 5% ($14.5M) of its $290M rainy day fund balance into a Bitcoin ETF at today’s prices and held it until 2030, it would be valued at nearly one billion dollars ($900M), a 6,200% ROI.”

The implications of such investments extend beyond mere speculative gains. New Hampshire faces outstanding liabilities totaling approximately $1.45 billion, including $1.25 billion to the state pension system and around $200 million in bonds.
Ammon argues that exploring alternative investments like Bitcoin could be a viable solution to these financial challenges, suggesting, “How could we climb out of that hole? The answer may be staring us in the face, and it’s worthy of further investigation.”
Reactions from the BTC community and financial experts were prompt. James Lavish, a noted Bitcoin authority, underscored the importance of this consideration from a fiduciary responsibility perspective.
He remarked, “The simple answer is yes. A more involved answer is: To not at least investigate a possible allocation in Bitcoin would be a breach of fiduciary duty, considering the alarming deficit levels and exponentially expanding federal debt.”
Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Act, a non-profit advocating for Bitcoin mining in the USA, succinctly supported the notion with, “You know my answer.”
Ammon’s proposal underscores the growing politicization of Bitcoin in the US, highlighting a shift towards crypto becoming a significant electoral issue. This trend is further evidenced by former US President Donald Trump’s recent pivot towards a pro-BTC and crypto stance, aiming to leverage this position in his bid to return to the White House.
Trump’s change of heart marks a notable development, reflecting the increasing relevance of crypto in political strategies and national economic discussions.
At press time, BTC traded at $62,799.

                        SHIB has jumped by 5% in the past 24 hours, with the Shiba Inu price rising to $0.00002357 as the crypto market as a whole gains by 2% today.Shiba Inu remains down by 7% in the past week, however, as well as by 2% in the last 30 days.On the other hand, its medium- and long-term momentum remains solid, with the coin having gained 160% in the past year.And with SHIB’s price bouncing overnight and again this morning, today could be the beginning of a new growth spurt.Shiba Inu Price Prediction as SHIB Bounces 5% Suddenly Overnight – New Bull Rally Starting?
SHIB’s chart and indicators show some very strong momentum right now, largely as a result of the surge it has seen in the past hour or so.Its RSI (purple) has gone from under 30 very early this morning to just over 70 as of writing, and given that it had been suffering for several days prior to this, it could remain high for a few days yet.Source: TradingViewProviding support to this view is SHIB’s 30-day average (orange), which has begun climbing rapidly and could soon overtake the 200-day (blue).If it does climb over the longer term average, this could signal a breakout rally, which again may last for a few days.The reason why SHIB has attracted a sudden influx of interest is that CoinGate has just announced that it has integrated Shiba Inu with the Polygon and BNB Chain networks.In other words, it’s now faster and cheaper to use SHIB as a payment option online, something which could open up the famous meme token to more usage going forward.Because of this, and because the announcement coincided with a general uplift for the wider market, we could certainly see Shiba Inu price continue to climb in the near term.It’s also arguable that Shiba Inu’s fundamentals – which are strong for a meme coin – could help it appreciate over longer timeframes.For instance, it’s in the process of building a privacy-focused layer-three network, while it launched its own layer-two (Shibarium) in August of last year.Critics might point out that CoinGate integrated SHIB with Polygon, and didn’t use Shibarium, yet the fact that the coin’s developers are building this kind of stuff bolsters its long-term outlook.The Shiba Inu price could, therefore, reach $0.00004 in the next couple of months.New Meme Tokens Show Strong Potential
SHIB remains in a very good position, yet it isn’t the only promising meme coin around at the moment, with several new meme tokens looking ready to perform well in the coming weeks.Possibly the most promising is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme coin that has raised over $15 million in its token offering.Source: DogeverseWhat distinguishes DOGEVERSE above most of its rivals is that it’s the first-ever Doge-themed multi-chain crypto.As such, it will launch on Ethereum and then soon after bridge to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.This will give it wider application than most other meme coins, with DOGEVERSE potentially gaining traction and usage on multiple apps and platforms.In turn, more adoption will equal greater demand and a higher price, with the token also boasting a hard cap of 120 million tokens.This could make it deflationary over time, while the ability to stake the coin will further squeeze its circulating supply.VIDEOSuch features look ready to make DOGEVERSE one of the biggest token launches of the year, with newcomers able to join its sale at the official Dogeverse website.There’s limited time left to buy during the presale, which is due to end in the next few weeks, at which point the coin will list and potentially moon.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Dogecoin (DOGE) Hits Enormous 5.6 Billion Support


Dogecoin saw a significant support level emerging, marked by a massive 5.6 billion DOGE that could play a role in determining the asset's future trajectory.Analyzing Dogecoin's current positionAs observed on the latest charts, Dogecoin has been wrestling with a bearish trend but is now approaching a robust support level. This level, characterized by a substantial volume of Dogecoin, represents a point where historical buying interest has been strong enough to prevent further price declines. The presence of such a significant support zone suggests that there is potential for a reversal if the sentiment and market conditions align favorably.Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe chart shows Dogecoin trading below the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, indicating a current bearish bias in the short to midterm. However, the proximity to the major support zone could be an important factor in a reversal rally. This support level, reinforced by a high concentration of buy orders in the past, offers a glimmer of hope for bullish Dogecoin investors.Moreover, the RSI, a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, is hovering near the 44.4 mark. This level is close to the oversold territory, which typically suggests that an asset might be underbought and could be due for a potential rebound.Volume analysis further complements the picture, showing fluctuating trade volumes as Dogecoin approaches this critical support level. A spike in trading volume around this point could indicate growing interest from traders anticipating the asset to bounce back from these lows.If Dogecoin manages to maintain its stance above this significant support level and volume increases, there could be enough buying pressure to propel the price upwards, challenging higher resistance levels.

Bitcoin (BTC) Could Trigger 'Panic' If it Falls Below $60K as Selling Pressure Weighs Down Markets

BTC has largely remained range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000 since March, with the highly-anticipated halving event in April turning out to be a sell-the-news play amid a general lack of market catalysts. Inflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have waned in the past few weeks, as reported, adding to a bearish sentiment.

Ripple v SEC Lawsuit: Here's Why Today is Important for XRP


																TL;DR

Today (May 13), Ripple and the SEC will file important motions related to their ongoing lawsuit, with further legal responses due next week.
The resolution of this case is eagerly awaited, as it could significantly influence the cryptocurrency market, depending on the outcome.


What to Expect Today?
Ever since entering into the trial phase, the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has started offering developments quite frequently. 
The next key date in the case is today (May 13), when both entities and third parties are scheduled to file omnibus letter-motions to seal all materials relating to the remedies-related briefing, such as declarations, briefs, and supporting exhibits. Filing proposed reductions should also take place in the next several hours.
A week later, Ripple, the SEC, and all other related organizations must file letter-briefs in opposition to the omnibus letter-motions to seal. 
“Under the joint proposal, the parties would further be required to file public, redacted versions of all documents within 14 days of the Court’s rulings on the omnibus sealing motions,” the document reads.
The resolution of the lawsuit is much anticipated by the XRP army and the entire crypto community due to its possible impact on the industry. A decisive Ripple win may result in an overall market resurgence, while the opposite scenario could hamper the sector’s advancement due to the implementation of strict rules.

The Confrontation Over a Witness Testimony 
As mentioned above, the legal battle witnessed multiple actions in the past few weeks, with one example being the confusion surrounding the key witness Andrea Fox. Initially, Ripple insisted that her testimony (known as the “Fox Declaration”) represents an unsolicited expert opinion and should be taken into account.
However, the SEC described the process as “standard summary evidence in support of calculations for disgorgement.” 
“It’s not an expert report, does not rely on specialized experience, and does not render any opinions at all, let alone an “expert” one. Nor does it present the testimony of a percipient witness. Rather, it applies basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records to streamline the presentation of the evidence to Judge Torres… The court should deny Ripple’s motion,” the agency insisted. 
Additionally, the watchdog claimed that the “Fox Declaration” consists of data derived from documents generated by Ripple itself, including tax returns and financial statements, which can be helpful for determining the case’s outcome.
Not long ago, Ripple filed a letter in further support of its initial request. It maintained that the SEC failed to show that the declaration is summary evidence rather than expert testimony:
“Fox is an expert because she purports to use technical or other specialized knowledge to help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. She does not merely apply basic arithmetic to Ripple’s financial records, as the SEC contends.”
The company went further, arguing that even if Andrea Fox could be classified as a summary witness, the Commission failed to disclose her before the end of the discovery process.

Why is the Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Up Today?


																SHIB is giving hints it wants to go higher, so let’s have a quick look at a few reasons why and what may rest ahead.
Key Support levels: $0.000022
Key Resistance levels: $0.000025
1. SHIB Eyeing the Key Resistance
With the price holding well above the support at $0.000022, buyers appear keen to test the key resistance at $0.000025. The previous attempt in early May was rejected, but a second one could be successful, considering that momentum may be shifting bullish.
Chart by TradingView
2. Buyers are Returning
SHIB’s price increased by over 5% today on good buy volume. The last time this happened was when this meme coin tried to break the key resistance in early May. This is a promising sign and could lead to a breakout.




Chart by TradingView
3. MACD is Curving Up
The 2-day MACD histogram is making higher lows, and the moving averages could soon curve up toward a bullish cross. In lower timeframes, this has already happened after this latest push from buyers. If this trend continues, then SHIB could break above $0.000025.

Ethereum has been increasingly inflationary for over a month as fees hit all-time low

Since Ethereum moved from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in 2022, it has become a deflationary asset. The total circulating supply of Ethereum (ETH) currently stands at 120,105,358 ETH, representing a 415,680 ETH decrease from the supply levels observed before The Merge.However, over the past 30 days, Ethereum’s supply dynamics have shifted, with 35,548.72 ETH being burned (removed from circulation) and 75,072.43 ETH being issued as block rewards to validators. The net result is a supply increase of 39,523.71 ETH during this period. Data from Ultrasound Money show that, based on the supply change over the past 30 days, Ethereum’s current annualized inflation rate is approximately 0.4%.Ethereum deflationary trend (ultrasound money)In comparison, Bitcoin’s inflation rate stands at 1.068%, while Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work (pre-merge) inflation rate would have been significantly higher at 3.74%. If the current 30-day rate persists, projections for the next year indicate that around 433,000 ETH will be burned, and 914,000 ETH will be issued, creating a net gain of 481,000 ETH.Data from OKLink shows a continued decrease in ETH burned since March, when an average of around 6,000 ETH was burned daily. Since the start of May, only around 900 ETH has been burned daily, the lowest average levels since The Merge.Ethereum burn and supply trends (OKLINK)The recent Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum network has had a notable impact on the ecosystem. The upgrade has led to a decrease in layer-2 transaction fees and overall network activity. Consequently, this has seemingly resulted in a lower burn rate, pushing Ethereum’s supply back into an inflationary state.Data from Etherscan and Ycharts shows that gas fees have also plummeted to around 5 gwei, the lowest on record.Ethereum gas fees (yCharts)Interestingly, Ethereum’s inflation rate has drawn closer to that of Bitcoin, especially in the aftermath of Bitcoin’s halving event last month. As per data from the past 7 days, Ethereum’s inflation rate for the past week stands at 0.54%, just 0.29 percentage points higher than Bitcoin’s post-halving rate of 0.83%.Ethereum’s inflation rate has been steadily increasing since February when it reached a local low of -2%.Ethereum inflation rate over time (OKLINK)While Ethereum’s supply has become slightly inflationary in the short term due to reduced network activity and burn rate, its overall supply is still decreasing on a net basis. This can be attributed to EIP-1559, which introduced a burn mechanism for a portion of transaction fees.Looking ahead, Ethereum’s inflation rate and supply dynamics will likely be influenced by future network upgrades and adoption trends. If transaction fees and burn rate remain low, Ethereum may continue to experience inflationary pressure in the near term. However, the long-term trajectory will depend on the success of upcoming upgrades and the overall growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.The adoption of layer-2 networks and the recent increase in layer-3 network activity reduces load from the Ethereum mainnet, yet it does so at a cost. However, the current increase in L2 and L3 activity is not at a level to create sufficient L1 transactions to keep Ethereum deflationary. Only time will tell whether the ultra-sound money concept for Ethereum will be retained in a world dominated by L2 and L3s.

Chainlink (LINK) Integrates New Services for Six Blockchains | Cryptopolitan

Chainlink does not stop growing its influence as a data source, connecting even more blockchains and projects. In high-speed trading environments, Chainlink is the top choice for reliable oracle data, especially for pricing information. In the past weeks, Chainlink added new connections for services and projects on six major blockchains. The new batch of projects onboarded by Chainlink includes mostly DeFi and FinTech hubs, but also two new tokenized Web3 games. Chainlink also communicates directly with developers, offering testing and implementation tools. Unfortunately, the space has drawn scammers with fake platforms Chainlink Focuses on Tokenization InfrastructureChainlink offers scalable solutions for new tokenization, especially following the trend of real-world assets (RWA). A growing list of projects is already using Chainlink to generate valuable tokens connected to real-world assets or economic activity. The RWA trend expands ChainLink integrations, which are now more than 2,500, linked to 140 prominent projects in crypto space. Chainlink Labs, the development company that is expanding its influence, is also expanding its team with new hires, showing a bullish trend for crypto builders. Based on GitHub commits, Chainlink is among the top 10 most active projects. Chainlink automates decisions in the expanding crypto infrastructure, eliminating the need for human involvement. Chainlink solves the problem of gas fees by selecting optimal conditions for transactions. Using oracles, projects can handle transaction traffic based on optimal gas fees at any given time. Chainlink is also an ambassador for the growth of blockchain projects and favors more lenient regulation. The project’s supporters also note that Chainlink has a real application and is not the source of limited price feeds, as previously accused. Demand for reliable data services is also high, with many projects trying to copy the Chainlink model. Its annual network fees, which reach $2, reveal Chainlink’s usage of $39M. The protocol itself has annual revenues above $630K. Chainlink still has a first-mover advantage when it comes to facilitating inter-chain connections. One of the trends for 2024 is to build more bridges, asset swaps, and cross-chain smart contracts. Chainlink has positioned itself to provide reliable data for all of those operations. Additionally, Chainlink has built its CCIP protocol, now open to developers for multi-chain tasks and projects. Chainlink easily connects some of the most widely used blockchains and offers tools and guidance to builders.One of the driving narratives for Chainlink will be its promise to connect mainstream and crypto-based finance. It is possible to test Chainlink connectivity to the existing SWIFT banking system. Tokenization drives from mainstream financial firms may increase the need for Chainlink services.Is Chainlink an Undervalued Project?Project growth for Chainlink has previously translated into a series of price booms. Currently, LINK trades around $13.60, while the community awaits a more significant breakout. After a successful bull market in the first quarter of 2024, Chainlink is now awaiting a new direction. Current market conditions are seen as a crossroads, either leading to a correction, or to a new altcoin bull market. LINK peaked at around $47 during the 2021 bull market, and only recovered to a peak of $20.70 in 2024. Currently, around 58% of the LINK supply is unlocked and in circulation, though only a small part of the free unlocked coins are traded each day. Around 7.23% of the supply is also locked for staking, valued at around $577M. Some of the tokens are needed for node operations, but all LINK is movable and not locked in a smart contract. Chainlink only distributed 35% of all tokens during its public sale, leaving a generous allocation for the team and future development.Despite this, LINK supporters see the asset as somewhat undervalued and poised for more accumulation.

Bitcoin’s market dominance drives Layer 2 popularity


Bitcoin (BTC) has been leading the crypto market rally since late September 2023, with its dominance rising steadily from around 40% in 2022 to over 50% by May 2024. 
This surge is largely attributed to the approval of Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, driving increased trading volume on platforms like Bybit.
Consequently, Bitcoin’s popularity is fueling interest in Layer 2 solutions aiming to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality for faster and cheaper transactions. 


Understanding Bitcoin Layer 2
Bitcoin Layer 2 refers to networks closely linked with Bitcoin, designed to improve its scalability, reduce transaction costs, and enable programmability. 
These networks operate separately but connect to Bitcoin through bridges or other solutions. 
The rise of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions gained traction in early 2024, particularly with the popularity of projects like Ordinals and Stacks, coinciding with Bitcoin’s outperformance compared to Ethereum (ETH) and other alternatives.
According to BTCL2.INFO, there are 74 Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, with significant growth in the past two quarters. 
These solutions fall into three categories:


State Channels, which offer faster transactions and reduced fees through separate channels between parties. Their limitations, however, include limited capacity and lack of smart contract capability;



Sidechains, or independent networks with their consensus algorithms, which bridge with the main network. Examples include Stacks and Rootstock;



Rollups, which nhance transaction processing by batching transactions off-chain. Notable examples include optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, with projects like Merlin Chain.

dApps built directly on the Bitcoin mainnet, like Mirror, Runes, and Ordinals, provide additional functionality such as staking and NFT creation.
Companig Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions
Rollups are seen as more advanced and are likely to dominate Bitcoin Layer 2 in the long term. They offer better scalability and efficiency compared to state channels and sidechains.
Layer 2 solutions face risks including security vulnerabilities and interoperability challenges, while state channels and sidechains have specific risks such as counterparty risk and reliance on validators.
Bitcoin’s mainnet limitations, such as lack of smart contract functionality, pose challenges to Layer 2 development. 
However, advancements in technologies like ZK-rollups provide opportunities for growth.
Bitcoin Layer 2 Wrap-up
Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions are expanding Bitcoin’s utility beyond its status as digital gold. 
While challenges exist, innovations like ZK-rollups and new projects are driving development. 
More importantly, the community’s willingness to embrace change and new technologies will shape the future of Bitcoin Layer 2.

GameStop Stock Surges Premarket as Keith Gill Returns to X After 3 Years - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Keith Gill, the enigmatic figure known as ‘Roaring Kitty’ on X (when it was formerly Twitter) and for running a Reddit account that was at the center of the GameStop short squeeze in 2021, has made a return to the social media platform X after a three-year hiatus. 



 



His reappearance has coincided with a substantial surge in GameStop’s (NYSE: GME) stock price, a reminder of the meme stock frenzy he was instrumental in sparking during the pandemic. The stock was up an impressive 16% in premarket trading at the time of writing, a clear sign of the impact of Gill’s return.



GameStop Stock Price Soars in Premarket Trading



Following Gill’s reemergence on social media, GameStop’s stock experienced a notable 22% increase in premarket trading. At the close of the market on Friday, the stock was trading at $17.46, down 3.05% from the previous day.



However, the premarket surge saw the stock climb to $20.36, representing a more than 16% rise from Friday’s closing price. At the time of writing, GameStop shares are trading at $20.35, gaining over 16% during the session.





Revisiting the GameStop Short Squeeze of 2021



In January 2021, GameStop was the center of a remarkable short squeeze that captured the financial world’s attention.



At the time, approximately 140% of the company’s public float was sold short, setting the stage for an unprecedented surge in stock prices as short sellers scrambled to cover their positions. Driven by the coordinated efforts of individual investors on the subreddit r/wallstreetbets, the squeeze propelled GameStop’s stock to a pre-market peak exceeding $500 per share in January 2021, a staggering 30-fold increase from its valuation at the beginning of the month.



The short squeeze had far-reaching consequences, significantly impacting hedge funds and other short sellers who had bet against the struggling video game retailer. The event highlighted the power of retail investors and the influence of social media in shaping market dynamics, challenging traditional assumptions about investing and the role of individual traders in the financial landscape.



The return of ‘Roaring Kitty’ has reignited interest in the meme stock phenomenon and raised questions about the potential for another wave of retail investor-driven market disruption.







Can we see another 2021 short squeeze play out in the near future? Let us know in the comments below.

Pudgy Penguins NFT Collection Dominates Toy Market with Over 1M Plush Toys Sold | Coinspeaker



The sales activity for the collection surged around mid-February, with the number of sales per day hitting 439.

Pudgy Penguins, a popular NFT collection created in 2021, has attained the top ten ranking in terms of volume traded. It has revealed that more than a million Pudgy Penguin plush toys have been sold over the past 12 months.
Expansion and Retail Partnerships
Prior to the sales milestone, the NFT project initially revealed its expansion plan on its X page, announcing that Pudgy Toys with Pudgy World are now available at Target, a retail shopping market. In a video released by the CEO Luca Netz on his X page, he revealed that the company’s plush toy sales have increased in the past year as it keeps expanding around the world.






Luca went further by also revealing plans for upcoming partnerships that will include reordering from retail organizations such as Walmart, corporations like Target, Smiths, and Hot Topic, and specialists in Asia and different countries. He further acknowledged that this surge in sales is his biggest consumer product success ever, stating:
“From a unit basis, that’s my biggest consumer product success ever.”
Furthermore, while still speaking about the milestones the NFT project has achieved in the short term in comparison with others in the space, the CEO mentioned that while other NFTs might be relying on future potential, Pudgy Penguins have already achieved success in real-time. He further mentioned that their project has managed to gain interest from major retailers, which indicates the current success of the project rather than potential future success. He said in the video:
“I have a lot of respect for what other people are doing in space…This is happening now, in real-time; the little guy was able to put this stuff in some of the world’s biggest retailers.”
Pudgy Penguins was acquired by Netz in 2022 after it experienced a rocky start following accusations that the founder was carrying out various rug-pull activities. Since then, the NFT project has continued to grow. The ecosystem now allows holders of NFTs to earn 5% revenue from sales of physical products featuring their unique Penguin.
Outperforming NFT Rivals
The sales activity for the collection surged around mid-February, with the number of sales per day hitting 439. During this period, the items were sold at an average price of 20 ETH. However, following that, the sales volume decreased to around 269 as of the May 6 report. One of the important factors that have boosted NFT sales on its platform is the plush line and announcement of a developing metaverse, which has caused the NFT project to rise above the Bored Ape Yacht Club in floor price earlier this year.
Currently, Pudgy Penguin is ranked 16th on CryptoSlam, an NFT sales trading platform, in the list of the top NFT collectible sales in the last 24 hours.

North Korean Hackers Scammed South Korean Crypto Firms


                                North Korean Hackers Target South Korean Crypto Firms with New Malware                                What’s the newsA North Korean Hacker group known as Kimsuky, has been using a new type of malicious software called "Durian" to attack cryptocurrency companies in South Korea. This Durian malware’s function resembles an installer and installs other powerful tools on the victimized machines. These tools include the backdoor called "Appleseed" and the proxy tool called LazyLoad.Appleseed gives hackers the privilege to remotely control the infected computers and also steal private information, while LazyLoad allows them to use tools that can help them hide their tracks. It is worthwhile to mention that LazyLoad which is used by another North Korean hacking group called Andariel has been used by a larger group called Lazarus. Since 2009, Lazarus has been notorious for its role in cryptocurrency thefts. On 29 April 2024, an independent blockchain Sleuth ZachXBT, who is not affiliated with any governmental organization revealed that Lazarus laundered over $200 million in stolen cryptocurrency between 2020 and 2023. Lazarus has been reported to have stolen approximately $3 billion worth of cryptocurrency in six years, with the largest amount being taken in 2023. They were the ones who were responsible for the stealing of 17% of all the stolen cryptocurrency funds in that year, which was over $309 million in 2023. On December 28, hackers exploited around $1.8 million worth of crypto which was lost as per the previous year's report.Malicious Software that Exploited Cryptocurrency FirmsDurian MalwareThis is a new type of software developed by the North Korean hacking group known as Kimsuky which is used to attack the South Korean targets. The sanctions are imposed on cryptocurrency companies located in South Korea. Durian is like a program that installs other harmful programs on the targeted computers. These tools include the backdoor "Appleseed", a custom proxy tool known as "LazyLoad" and other authorized tools such as "Chrome Remote Desktop".AppleseedThis is a backdoor installed by Durian malware. A backdoor is a hidden way into a computer system that allows hackers to get into this system without authorization. Through the Appleseed exploit, the hackers may be able to remotely control the infected computer, execute commands, download additional files, and steal confidential data. The hackers take over the machine and steal everything stored on it through Appleseed.LazyLoadLazyLoad is a tool that Durian malware installs as well. This is a custom proxy tool that hides the hacker's activities. Another hacking group known as Andariel was also using it as well as a part of the Lazarus Group which is much larger and more established. LazyLoad is a way for them to keep their activities away from the public eye.The impact of these malicious softwareThe fact that North Korean hackers have been using malware such as Durian, AppleSeed, and LazyLoad against South Korean cryptocurrency companies should be a cause for concern. These tools enable hackers to get into a system without authorization, steal confidential information, and cause monetary losses.Prevention from malicious softwareKeep all software and safety systems up-to-date.Employ strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.Do not click on those emails and links that are not trustworthy and unauthenticFrequently store critical information.Implement cybersecurity best practices through firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.ConclusionThe essentialities that Coin Gabbar has pointed out from the news is that the Durian malware and the connection of this malware to North Korean hacking groups like Kimsuky and Lazarus is proof of the ongoing cyber threat to these firms. It highlights the necessity of strong cybersecurity measures and intensive scrutiny to counter such attacks. These organizations need to have robust cybersecurity mechanisms and keep a close watch against them. Partnerships among cybersecurity firms, governments, and cryptocurrency companies are necessary to realize an efficient way of tackling these concerns.Also Read: Musk’s Deepfake Video Leads To Crypto Fraud In Hong Kong

Bitcoin Runes Activity Plummets after Generating $135M in Fees | Coinspeaker



Activities on the Runes protocol have “dropped dramatically”, hitting their lowest level since May 10.

The Bitcoin Runes protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform introduced on April 19 to provide a new way of creating fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, has seen a significant drop in activity despite a promising beginning.
Initially, on April 24, activity on the Bitcoin-based protocol surged, making up about 57% of all transactions recorded in the ecosystem after the 2024 halving event. The protocol’s impressive launch led to record fees for Bitcoin miners as eager investors competed for block space during the halving event.




In its first week alone, Runes generated approximately $107 million in transactions in a single day and $135 million in Bitcoin transactions on a weekly basis.  However, after weeks of attracting investor attention, the enthusiasm surrounding the protocol appears to have waned amidst the current market downturn.
Runes Protocol Faces Decline since May 10
According to on-chain data from crypto analytics firm Dune, activities on the Runes protocol have “dropped dramatically”, hitting their lowest level since May 10. This decline could be attributed to various factors, including fewer new mints and a decrease in new wallets interacting with the protocol since its April debut, reducing generated fees.
Since then, the protocol has continued to experience low engagement, reducing its market share of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Data from Dune shows that despite recording thousands of transactions daily, Runes has struggled to reach another $1 million milestone in daily transaction fees. In the past 12 days, the protocol has only surpassed $1 million in transaction fees twice.
The data also revealed a significant decrease in total Runes minted, dropping from 23,061 on April 26 to just 62 this month. Similarly, fees earned from Runes plummeted from a peak of $321,263 on April 26 to only $970.
Until May 5, the protocol accounted for less than 30% of all transactions on the Bitcoin network in terms of transaction volume. In contrast, last month was the peak period for the Runes network, with the protocol recording a substantial 77% and 69% of transaction volume on April 20 and April 23, respectively.
Runes NFT Collections Hit Over $100M  Market Caps
Despite the recent decrease in activity on the Runes network, the protocol continues to stand out, with various non-fungible token (NFT) collections on the platform already surpassing market caps exceeding $100 million.
According to data from Magic Eden, an NFT marketplace, some of the Runes collections, such as DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, PUBS.WORLD.PEACE, and EPIC.EPIC.EPIC has market capitalizations of $2.44 billion, $171.60 million, and  $37.78 million, respectively.
On May 11, Casey Rodarmor, the developer behind both Runes and Bitcoin Ordinals, hinted at a new NFT project during an event in Asia. The software engineer said he is working on a new audioreactive generative art project.

Notcoin Set to Debut on Wallet App, Offering New Opportunities for Users



Per the announcement, users can already select Wallet in the Notcoin app to claim NOT tokens.

Notcoin (NOT) is arguably the rave of the moment in the crypto space following a series of reports about several major exchanges getting set to support it once it goes live on May 16. Notable crypto exchanges that are ready to support the NOT token rollout include Binance, OKX, and Bybit, who have all announced their intent to ride with the relative newcomer.
Interestingly, the Notcoin team has just shared a new update with users as the cryptocurrency is set to make its debut on the Telegram Wallet app, opening up new possibilities for users.




Notcoin Integrates with Wallet App to Bring Convenience and Versatility to Users
With its integration scheduled for May 16, the Wallet users will immediately begin to have access to Notcoin. This is not only expected to help their various transactions but also enhance their overall digital asset experience.
According to an X post from the official  Wallet account, users can look forward to several exciting features upon Notcoin’s integration into its app. These include the ability to buy and sell NOT tokens on the P2P Market, exchange them for other cryptocurrencies such as TON, USDT, and BTC, and easily send Notcoin to Telegram contacts.
Furthermore, users may also use the NOT token for payments within Wallet Pay, adding an extra layer of convenience to their financial transactions.
Per the announcement, users can already select Wallet in the Notcoin app to claim NOT tokens. But while that sets the stage for a smooth transition, it’s important to note that NOT tokens will only officially appear in users’ wallets on May 16. Even then, users will likely be required to verify their identity to mitigate fraud and ensure security and compliance.
Notably, this collaboration is a two-edged sword that benefits both Notcoin and the Wallet app. It affords Wallet the opportunity to expand its digital asset offerings. For Notcoin, leveraging Telegram’s user base of over 900 million individuals is nothing but a strategic entry into the crypto space.
As anticipation builds for the launch of Notcoin on Wallet, Coinspeaker will be covering any updates and announcements regarding the integration process. One key takeaway, however, is that Notcoin appears to be ready to make its debut on the crypto scene with a bang.

Bitcoin (BTC) Fails to Hold $63K, May Remain Range-Bound

Bitcoin (BTC) rose during the European morning on Monday, peaking at around $63,200, before retreating below $62,800. BTC may be again trying to rally above $64,000, of which there have been numerous instances this month, all of which have been sold off. This behavior, along with transaction numbers plummeting, points toward a consolidation in the market and the possibility of bitcoin being range-bound for the time being. At the time of writing, bitcoin is 2.34% higher in the last 24 hours at $62,543. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which measures the broader digital market, has added 1.1%, with the likes of ETH and SOL showing more modest gains, trading just below $3,000 and $150 respectively.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino defends USDt compliance record in wake of Ripple CEO's comments

Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, has responded to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse‘s claims that the US government was targeting the company, the issuer of the largest stablecoin USDt.During the weekend, reports emerged that Garlinghouse had suggested that a US government’s scrutiny of Tether could significantly affect the crypto industry. Garlinghouse said:“The US Government is going after Tether. That is clear to me. I view Tether as a very important part of the ecosystem and I don’t know how to predict the impact it would have on the rest of the ecosystem.”Tether’s responseIn an extensive May 13 social media post, Ardoino dispelled concerns about potential regulatory action against Tether and accused Garlinghouse of sowing “fear about USDT.” He said:“An uniformed CEO, leading a company being investigated by the SEC, launching a competitive stablecoin (cui prodest), is being reported spreading fear about USDt.”Ardoino asserted that Tether’s ecosystem remains robust and secure, emphasizing its price stability, ample liquid reserves, top-tier custodianship, and rigorous compliance measures. He added:“USDt is the most used stablecoin in the world, with hundreds of millions of users across primarily emerging markets and developing countries. Entire communities across these regions are unbanked, left behind by the traditional banking system because they are too poor to be of interest, and are using USDt daily as their checking and saving account.”Furthermore, the Tether CEO enumerated various factors contributing to USDt’s compliance and adoption worldwide.Ardoino disclosed that Tether has voluntarily honored 198 requests from law enforcement agencies to freeze wallets in the past year, 90 of which originated from the US. Over the last three years, Tether has complied with 339 such requests, with 158 coming from US law enforcement.Moreover, he pointed out that the firm has collaborated with 124 law enforcement agencies across more than 40 countries and has frozen over $1.3 billion in assets associated with fraudulent activities, hacks, and money laundering.Notably, a significant portion—over $639 million—was blocked in collaboration with US law enforcement agencies.Ardoino concluded his statement by saying:“Tether cooperates directly with law enforcement agencies, while other stablecoins, although they claim to be “more compliant” they require a judge order, allowing hackers, scammers and criminals a long time to move funds around.”Mentioned in this article

Solana's 23M token move raises eyebrows: Where to, SOL? - AMBCrypto



Data showed that participants are HODLing, but SOL fell by 6.16%.
An increase in volume with the current price trend could lead the token to $129.

On the 13th of May, 23 million Solana [SOL] was sent to undisclosed wallets, according to data from Whale Alert. From the post shared, the first transaction was worth $1.58 billion.
The second one, suspected to be the same participants, sent another 11 million tokens, valued around the same price, to another wallet.
Three hours later, another large transaction occurred. This time, it was 1 million SOL that was transferred.
One thing AMBCrypto noticed was that none of the transactions went into exchanges. If the tokens had gone into exchanges, it would have prompted the notion that they were for sale.
Source: X
$129 or $155? Where is the next target?
In this case, SOL’s price might have recorded a notable decline. Nonetheless, the performance of the token was not any better. At press time, the price of SOL was $140.
This value was a 6.16% decrease in the 24 hours, indicating the supposed HODLing strategy could not liberate the cryptocurrency from another downfall.
Where the Solana native token would head next could be a concern for both long-term investors and traders. As such, AMBCrypto analyzed the potential direction.
The first metric considered was Solana’s on-chain volume. Volume shows (in monetary terms) how much crypto has been traded over some time.
For SOL, Santiment’s data showed that the volume was $1.44 billion, which was an increase from the figure on the 12th of May. Rising volume while the price decreases might be good news for bears.
Source: Santiment
This is because the hike in the metric might offer strength to the downside. Therefore, if the value continues to increase, then SOL’s price could continue to fall.
As such, a decrease to $129 could be the next plausible target.
On the other hand, a reversal to the upside might change the direction. If this happens and the volume hits new peaks, the price of SOL could attempt to reach $155.
Bears are getting less confident
In terms of the perception the market has about SOL, AMBCrypto looked at the Weighted Sentiment. At press time, the Weighted Sentiment was negative, suggesting an increase in gloomy remarks.
However, one notable observation was that the sentiment was improving. Should this metric continue to rise, demand for SOL might increase.
An increase in demand could invalidate the bearish prediction to $129. Instead, a rise to $155 could be next for Solana. Furthermore, the total Open Interest (OI) was starting to increase.
Source: Santiment
As of this writing, the OI was $1.46 billion. OI increases or decreases depending on net positioning. In this case, buyers are getting more aggressive than sellers.

Read Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-2025

If sustained, this increase could lead to a SOL breakout. However, the interest did not seem large enough to confirm the pump into the overhead resistance.
As such, SOL might not be able to surge higher than $155 in the short term.

Parity Wallet Hacker Moves $9 Million in Ethereum, Leaving $246 Million in Limbo


In a development echoing one of the largest crypto heists in history, Cyvers Alerts has reported that a hacker, who exploited a vulnerability in Parity's multi-signature wallet in 2017, has now moved a substantial sum of Ethereum (ETH). The hacker, responsible for the theft of 150,000 ETH, valued at $30 million at the time, has initiated the laundering of a portion of their loot, transferring 3,050 ETH, equivalent to $9 million, through the eXch platform.This marks a significant chapter in the saga, underscoring the enduring impact of cyber breaches in the digital asset realm. Cyvers Alerts took to X to highlight the unfolding events, reminding followers of the 2017 incident that shook the crypto community. The vulnerability in Parity's Multisig Wallet version 1.5+ had allowed the perpetrator to abscond with a staggering amount of Ethereum, causing substantial financial losses. The latest maneuver by the hacker underscores a strategic and patient approach to their illicit activities. By utilizing eXch and consolidating multiple addresses under "0x5167052b," they have successfully laundered a portion of the stolen funds. However, what's more concerning is the sizable sum still under their control. With 83,017 ETH, valued at a staggering $246.6 million, remaining untouched at the primary address "0xb3764761," the hacker retains significant leverage within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Ongoing threatThis recent activity reignites discussions surrounding security measures within the crypto space and the persistent threat posed by vulnerabilities in blockchain platforms. Despite efforts to enhance security protocols and mitigate risks, incidents like the Parity Wallet breach are stark reminders of the ever-present danger of cyber attacks.As stakeholders assess the implications of this latest development, attention turns to broader implications for investor confidence and regulatory oversight within the crypto market. The ability of hackers to exploit weaknesses in infrastructure and maneuver substantial sums of digital assets shows the need for continued vigilance and collaboration within the industry to safeguard against such threats.

This achievement is further accentuated by the regulatory nods received from the EC and US FDA for CARVYKTI label expansion, enabling its use in earlier lines of treatment for adult patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma.



Additionally, the company’s strategic collaboration with Johnson & Johnson, culminating in a Master Manufacturing and Supply Services Agreement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, indicates a robust commitment to enhancing CARVYKTI’s manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. With a cash reserve of $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, Legend Biotech is well-positioned for sustained growth and innovation.



Legend Biotech Posts Narrower Loss than Expected, Falls Short on Revenue for Q1



Comparing the first quarter’s performance against expectations, Legend Biotech has underperformed in the first quarter. Analysts had projected an EPS of -$0.19 and revenue of $143.81 million for the quarter. While the firm’s revenue growth was impressive, it still fell short of expectations, with a reported loss of $0.16 per share and revenues of $93.99 million for the quarter.





LEGN Plans to Reach a Goal of 10,000 Annual Doses of CARVYKTI By End of 2025



Looking ahead, Legend Biotech has provided optimistic guidance for the upcoming periods. The company’s financial runway, bolstered by a strong cash position, is expected to support its operations well into 2026, at which point Legend Biotech anticipates achieving an operating profit.



The planned increase in manufacturing capacity to reach a goal of 10,000 annual doses of CARVYKTI by the end of 2025 demonstrates the company’s commitment to meeting the growing demand for its therapies. Moreover, the recent regulatory approvals and label expansions for CARVYKTI in various global markets set the stage for increased adoption and broader patient access to this transformative therapy.

Bonk Price Prediction as Meme Coins Bounce After Sell Off - Is Now the Time to Buy?

                        The Bonk price has crept up by 0.7% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.00002312 while the market as a whole posts a 2.5% gain today.This move doesn’t do enough to clear BONK’s 16% loss in a week, although the Solana-based meme token remains up by 35% in the last 30 days.Even more impressively, the coin has also gained by a whopping 5,400% in the past year, making it one of the best-performing top-100 tokens over this period.And with BONK still in oversold territory for the past week, it could rally again very soon.Bonk Price Prediction as Meme Coins Bounce After Sell-Off – Is Now the Time to Buy?
BONK’s chart is showing signs of recovery, and what’s particularly bullish is that this recovery has only just begun, meaning that more gains are in store in the near term.Its 30-day average (orange) has only just begun rising again for example, meaning that the coin’s price has plenty of time left to rise before the 30-day overtakes the 200-day (blue) and rises significantly above.Source: TradingViewAt the same time, BONK’s relative strength index (purple) has risen from just under 30 very early this morning to around 60 as of writing, signaling a strong surge in buying pressure and momentum.Such momentum should carry the meme token for several more days yet, with the coin’s volume only just beginning to recover.Also bullish is the fact that the coin’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are honing in on each other, implying that the price is likely to be squeezed suddenly in either direction.Given that BONK has spent more than a week declining, it’s likelier that a big move will be more towards higher levels.BONK is likely to rise in step with the wider market, which after a difficult couple of months (relative to the highs of early March) is looking ready to return to growth.Such growth will speed up once financial markets gain a strong suspicion that the Fed will cut interest rates, which have so far remained at high levels this year.More generally, Bonk’s particular situation looks good insofar as it’s a rare example of a deflationary meme token, with its developers famously burning their entire allocation – some 5 trillion tokens – back in January 2023.Based on its tokenomics and general momentum, we can expect the Bonk price to reach $0.000030 by the end of the summer.Big Gains with New Meme Tokens
BONK is likely to remain one of the best-performing major meme coins for the foreseeable future, yet it may not be one of the best-performing if you also include newer coins.Certain new meme tokens have appeared in the past few weeks, including a wide variety of presale tokens that have been gaining plenty of momentum as they get ready to list.One of the best of these is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme coin which has raised just more than $500,000 in its increasingly popular token offering.That SEAL’s presale has crossed the $500,000 barrier is highly encouraging, with the offering having been open for only a few weeks.Investors are clearly interested in the possibility that it could become the latest Solana meme token to outperform much of the market once it lists, following in the footsteps of BONK and WIF.Also bullish is the fact that it will now be a multi-chain meme coin, with the token also launching an ERC-20 version.Interested parties can join in by going to the official Sealana website, where they can send SOL to the following address: DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c.SEAL is available at an exchange rate of 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which roughly equals $0.021.VIDEOThis is likely to prove a bargain, at least when judging by other meme token launches this year.And with its quirky meme mascot and memorable marketing, SEAL looks ready to take its place among the more successful launches.Buy SEAL Today

Machine learning algorithm predicts XRP price on May 31, 2024


As the long-standing legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs appears to be entering its final chapter, interest in and hopes about XRP are again mounting.
Indeed, there is widespread belief that the conclusion of the case – which has been weighing heavily on the token for years and has, arguably, prevented it from following the rest of the crypto market in its 2024 rally – investors are turning toward hopes that XRP might soon surge toward $0.62 and beyond – heights seen only briefly in mid-March.
Still, with uncertainty persisting for the time being with XRP battling to hold above $0.50, Finbold decided to seek at least some clarity by looking at the cryptocurrency forecasts offered by the AI-driven machine learning algorithms of a platform specilized in making asset price predictions – PricePredictions.


Predictive algorithms set XRP price for the end of May
While crypto traders are holding on to optimism, PricePredictions’ algorithms have little good news for the bulls. 
Indeed, while the platform estimates that the token has left its highly volatile days behind for the time being, the looming trend is predicted to be bearish.
Per the data retrieved on May 13, the algorithm’s forecast XRP is set for a slight but protracted decline – with limited and largely inconsequential volatility – that will see the token drop to $0.487329 by the end of the month.
XRP price forecast for May 31. Source: PricePredictions
Given that XRP price today stands at $0.505731, the platform is forecasting a 3.637% drop over the course of two and a half weeks.
Crypto experts see bigger moves ahead
Experts, however, apparently largely disagree with the algorithm’s prediction, with a prominent XRP analyst known on X as Dark Defender recently explaining that while the current situation remains challenging, the price targets for the upcoming supercycle waves run high at $1.88, $5.85 and $18.22.

1. Wave 1 started in Jan-23 @ $0.3000
2. Wave 1 ended in Jul-23 @ $0.9327
3. Wave 2 started in Aug-23 @$0.8534
4. Wave 2 ended in Apr-24 @$0.4294
5. Wave 3 targets $1.88, $5.85 and $18.22

Dark Defender also clarified that the listed targets are for the ongoing supercycle while the general ‘gigacycle’ will see the token surge even higher with one post indicating that the ultimate price target stands at $333 on the low end.
The XRP expert, in a separate post, also outlined the token’s 9-phase likely journey to new and unprecedented highs. 
These include an ultimate decision in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle, the arrival of the company’s stablecoin, developments such as Blackrock’s Larry Fink recently saying that tokenization will be ‘the next generation for markets,’ all leading up to XRP in ‘in Grand Wave 3.’
It is worth noting, however, that the journey also assumes a definitive decision that XRP is not a security – a decision that is not certain, at the time of publication.
Around the same time, another expert, Matthew Dixon, CEO of the crypto rating platform Evai, pointed toward another factor that might see XRP surge.

According to Dixon, the CPI report – scheduled for the ongoing May 13 to May 20 week – could also propel the token provided the figures are weaker than expected. 
While refraining from offering a price target, the analyst’s description of XRP as a ‘sleeping giant’ offers a strong bullish hint.

'Dogecoin Killer' Shiba Inu Pushes Mainstream Adoption And Is On The Verge Of '4X Breakout', Says Trader - Benzinga

Shiba Inu SHIB/USD is seeing fundamental developments that might lead to a potential price breakout.What Happened: Crypto trader Javon Marks foresees Shiba Inu reaching and surpassing its all-time high of $0.000088598, which would imply a price appreciation of over 282% from current levels. He suggests that the meme coin is currently in an "intermission" phase before continuing its upward trajectory.Marks draw sparallels to Shiba Inu’s previous breakout and run to its ATH, noting that the current price action appears to be setting up a massive bull flag pattern. This pattern, coupled with the confirmation of multiple hidden bullish divergences, indicates underlying strength in the existing uptrend."With this uptrend being such a significant one, with Shiba Inu making an over +810% move since mid-2023, another near 4X that these breakout(s), indications, and patterns can be calling for may just be more than feasible in these prices and could come in quickly!" Marks enthuses.Lithuania-based CoinGate, a Bitcoin and crypto payment gateway and processor, announced over the weekend that it added Shiba Inu support for Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. According to the tweet, SHIB can be used to book Airbnbs, grab the latest games from Steam & PS5 and purchase from Nike & Zalando.Price Action: In the past 24 hours, SHIB is trading 3.3% higher at $0.00002328. Since June 2023, Shiba Inu has managed to erase one zero from its price.Also Read: ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Shiba Inu Burn Rate Spikes Almost 400%, Marketing Lead Points Out ‘3x On SHIB’ If You Purchased Last YearWhy It Matters: The Data Nerd revealed a whale depositing 100 billion SHIB, worth $24 million, to Coinbase.

The presence of hidden bullish divergences, which occur when the price makes a higher low while the oscillator makes a lower low, further reinforces the notion of underlying strength in the uptrend.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: What Does Technical Analysis Say About Dogecoin And Shiba Inu?This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Is it good or bad that Bitcoin Price has been moving sideways for a while? Bernstein Analysts Announced! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While Bitcoin rose above $ 63,000 again during the day, it has generally exhibited horizontal movements lately.
At this point, Bernstein analysts argued that these horizontal and straight movements of BTC could be good for miners.


According to The Block, Bernstein analysts claimed that horizontal movements in BTC could be good for miners in this period when the economy is driven by the competitive hash rate.
Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra said in a note to clients today:






“Bitcoin price is trending sideways, but we are not afraid of a big drop here.
Here we expect Bitcoin to remain in a range and continue its upward adoption trajectory as Bitcoin ETFs see allocation from RIAs, asset platforms, and other institutional funds.
Overall, a temporary pause in Bitcoin price is actually good for existing low-cost Bitcoin miners, as hash rates remain limited and strong miners can implement aggressive capex and merger and acquisition plans to grow market share.
“When the Bitcoin price increases following horizontal movements, miners can earn higher income through higher production.”

As is known, Bernstein analysts stated in a report published last week that they expected $ 150,000 in this cycle and that they were insistent on their predictions and that Bitcoin would continue its rise.

Will Positive CPI Data Catapult Bitcoin to $72K?


							

Bitcoin maintains a steady $61K, with XRP and Solana taking 5% weekly losses.



Upcoming U.S. economic events, including PPI and CPI, are poised to influence crypto market trends.



Market commentators expect positive CPI data to send Bitcoin to $72K.




The crypto markets have been stagnant since last week. Bitcoin, for instance, has been maintaining a steady position around the $61K price level, often experiencing price declines in the past week. Bitcoin’s subdued performance is also reflected in the broader market sphere. Altcoins like XRP and Solana are registering over 5% losses in their weekly performance. 



Now, crypto investors are turning their attention to this week’s U.S. economic calendar, which is packed with events that could significantly sway the markets. The widely followed X account “The Kobeissi Letter” recently compiled the economic events expected to unfold this week.







One of the key inflation reports on the horizon is the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI), slated for release on Tuesday. This report is crucial as it provides insights into the input costs for producers and manufacturers, which is a direct precursor to consumer pricing. The PPI is often seen as an announcer of inflationary trends.



Meanwhile, insights into April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be unveiled on Wednesday. The Kobeissi Letter noted that if CPI inflation rises again this week, it would be the third consecutive monthly increase. 









Recently, a Conference Board survey revealed that a majority of U.S. CEOs anticipate only a single rate cut by the Fed this year. Of 136 CEOs surveyed, 31% expect no rate cuts, while 26% foresee two. 



The Kobeissi Letter observed that market expectations have settled on two rate cuts for the year, with the first anticipated in September. Meanwhile, the commentary highlighted the market’s fluctuating expectations. It noted that predictions have swung from six rate cuts to one and then back to two, all within four months.As the financial markets await vital events in the U.S. this week, the cryptocurrency market is exhibiting modest signs of recovery. At press time, Bitcoin has risen by 1%, with other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum also posting slight gains. Market commentators expect positive CPI data to send Bitcoin within the $67K and $72K range.

Tether Attacks Ripple CEO Over USDt FUD, Calls Him “Uninformed CEO”


							

Tether CEO refutes Ripple CEO’s claims of USDt being targeted by U.S.



Tether defends USDt’s role as a stablecoin for the unbanked and highlights its security measures.



Also, the CEO accused the media of bias, outlining Tether’s cooperation with law enforcement.




Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of prominent stablecoin issuer Tether (USDt), has fired back at the critical remarks of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. For context, Garlinghouse recently asserted that the U.S. government is targeting Tether. 



Garlinghouse expressed that while he considers USDt a significant player in the crypto scene, he doubts its future impact on the crypto landscape due to the supposed investigation he hinted at.



Ardoino, in his response on platform X, directly referred to Garlinghouse as an “uninformed CEO” of a company currently dealing with its own legal issues with the U.S. SEC. He accused Garlinghouse of spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about USDt, particularly as Ripple is preparing to launch its own stablecoin.



Accordingly, Ardoino presented some details regarding the security of the Tether USDt ecosystem.







Tether’s CEO defended USDt against skepticism by highlighting its role as the most utilized stablecoin globally, particularly in emerging markets and developing countries. According to him, USDt serves as a de facto checking and savings account for many unbanked communities.



Furthermore, Ardoino emphasized Tether’s commitment to fostering a secure global financial system that is accessible to all. He outlined vital attributes for stablecoin adoption: price stability, liquid reserves, reputable custodians, and strict compliance—all of which he asserts USDt consistently demonstrates.



Meanwhile, Ardoino claimed that despite his efforts to communicate these points through interviews, mainstream media has been reluctant to report on such positive aspects. He suggested that the media’s preference for sensationalism against stablecoin and cryptocurrencies might be an attempt to safeguard the interests of the established financial sector.









Furthermore, the CEO highlighted that the company respects and complies with OFAC/SDN lists. Ardoino added that Tether has collaborated with 124 law enforcement agencies from over 40 countries, blocking over $1.3 billion related to illicit activities, including $1.6 million tied to terrorism.



Moreover, he claimed Tether has responded to 198 law enforcement requests to block wallets in the past year, with 90 from U.S. agencies and 339 over three years, with 158 from U.S. agencies.

Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Slip On Regulatory Banana Skins - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced net outflows on Friday, highlighting some investor caution amid ongoing price volatility.What Happened: According to data from SoSoValue, total net outflows for Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $84.6581 million on May 10.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC alone saw an outflow of $103 million, highlighting a cautious or bearish sentiment among investors.Conversely, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust  IBIT and Fidelity’s Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC reported inflows of $12.4363 million and $5.3039 million, respectively.This mixed flow indicates a divergence in investor confidence across different funds, which could be attributed to the varied strategies and market perceptions surrounding each ETF.The outflows from GBTC, in particular, are significant as they contribute to a broader discussion on the health and stability of the cryptocurrency market. According to data from HODL15Capital, as of May 10, global Bitcoin ETFs held 949,756 Bitcoin BTC/USD, representing 4.5% of the total Bitcoin supply.Interestingly, while most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated an additional 1,318 bitcoin this week, GBTC stood out as the sole fund experiencing outflows.Also Read: Decoding Donald Trump’s Crypto GambitWhy It Matters: The timing of these flows is crucial as they come amid growing regulatory scrutiny.Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to reject an Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETF on May 23, with approval not anticipated until potentially the end of 2025.Such decisions are pivotal, as they reflect the SEC’s ongoing cautious stance under Chair Gary Gensler's leadership concerning cryptocurrency products.The potential regulatory shifts could be influenced by the upcoming U.S. presidential elections. Balchunas speculated that a win by Donald Trump could lead to a leadership change at the SEC, potentially ushering in a more crypto-friendly administration than Gensler’s. This possibility is creating a buzz in the crypto community, as regulatory attitudes can significantly impact market dynamics and investor sentiments.What’s Next: These developments are set to be a key topic of discussion at Benzinga's upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry leaders will delve into the relationship between cryptocurrency and regulatory frameworks.Insights from the event could provide further clarity and forecast the trajectory of digital assets in a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape.Read Next: Donald Trump’s Crypto Endorsement Lauded By Industry Figures Who Vow To ‘Support President Trump’Image: Shutterstock

Japanese listed firm adds Bitcoin as reserve asset with 117 BTC

Publicly traded investment firm Metaplanet has added Bitcoin (BTC) as a reserve asset in response to a continued decline of the Japanese yen.Metaplanet is making a “strategic shift” in its treasury management strategy, prioritizing Bitcoin-first and Bitcoin-only approach, the Tokyo-based firm officially announced on May 13.“This move is a direct response to sustained economic pressures in Japan, notably high government debt levels, prolonged periods of negative real interest rates, and the consequently weak yen,” the company stated.The announcement doesn’t specify how much Bitcoin is currently held or planned to be held in Metaplanet’s treasury. On May 10, Metaplanet disclosed that it bought a total of 117.7 BTC ($7.19 million) at the average price of around 10.2 million yen, or $65,000. Metaplanet’s market value stands at around 3.5 billion yen, or roughly $20 million.Source: MetaplanetMetaplanet’s Bitcoin adoption comes a few weeks after the company initially disclosed its new Bitcoin-focused strategy in early April, announcing the completion of its first Bitcoin purchase worth $6.5 million.The move fueled significant traction on social media and caused a sharp price increase of Metaplanet shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Listed under the numeric symbol 3350, Metaplanet's stock rallied above 35 JPY ($0.22) from 20 JPY ($0.13) hours after the firm announced its Bitcoin purchase in April.Source: CNBCBefore its strategic shift into Bitcoin, Metaplanet primarily operated in the traditional investment scene. Founded in 1999, Metaplanet originally operated a hotel business, investment services and an investor relations consultancy.Related: Jack Dorsey’s Block is ‘DCA’ing’ into Bitcoin every monthThe news comes a few days after Metaplanet appointed prominent market researcher Dylan LeClair as director of Bitcoin strategy. “This is just the beginning,” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich wrote in an X post on the company buying more Bitcoin on May 9.The Japanese yen has reportedly been the worst performer in 2024 among major currencies against the U.S. dollar, dropping to record lows in April last seen in the 1990s . According to local sources, the yen’s drop in value over the past three years came mainly from the gap between domestic and foreign interest rates and a growing trade deficit.Magazine: SEC, Ripple case nears conclusion, Grayscale withdraws ETF filing, and more: Hodler’s Digest, May 5-11

XRP Dips 2%+ As SEC Lawsuit Nears Final Judgment


							

A prominent XRP whale transferred 30 million tokens to an exchange.



The digital asset lost crucial support at the $0.5 price level.



The RSI indicator shows that the selling pressure is quite high in the market.




The protracted legal tussle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is nearing its final judgment as the two parties have submitted their briefs. Though the community anticipates a significant uptick in XRP’s price following the case settlement, the token is currently moving in a downward trend.



The legal issues surrounding Ripple and XRP can be traced back to the lawsuit filed by the SEC alleging the sale of unregistered securities. Following a series of developments, Judge Analisa Torres ruled XRP a non-security, securing a landmark victory for the crypto platform.



Nearing the lawsuit’s conclusion, Ripple and XRP filed their respective briefs in court. In the SEC’s response to the remedies brief, the regulators argued against Ripple’s statement regarding the certainty of XRP as a non-security. While the SEC demanded $2 billion in a settlement, Ripple claimed that the platform would not pay more than $10 million.









At present, XRP’s price is set at $0.4949, marking a marginal dip of 2.27% in one day. Over the last 7 days, XRP has seen a more significant decline of 7% while exhibiting a notable 9% downturn in one month.



Analysts anticipate a significant upturn in XRP’s price, poised to reach a new all-time high this year. For instance, JackTheRippler, a prominent figure, predicted a ground-breaking rise in XRP’s value in 2024 following the upcoming developments in the ecosystem. The major events include the final judgment in the lawsuit, XRP’s bank integration, Ripple IPO, and the potential XRP ETF launch.Another prominent analyst, KingXRP, hinted at the significant appreciation in XRP’s price following these events. According to KingXRP’s predictions, XRP is poised to reach $18.57 with the final judgment in the lawsuit.

D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS) Reports 56% Revenue Increase in Q1 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS), a trailblazer in the realm of commercial quantum computing systems, software, and services, has recently unveiled its financial outcomes for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024, which concluded on March 31, 2024.



The company has reported a significant year-over-year revenue, bookings, and gross profit increase, showcasing its strong performance and growing customer demand for its quantum and hybrid quantum solutions.



Specifically, D-Wave announced a 56% increase in its Q1 revenue, a 54% increase in Q1 bookings, and a staggering 294% increase in gross profit compared to the same period last year. These figures highlight D-Wave’s solid financial health and reflect the successful implementation of its strategic initiatives and the increasing adoption of its quantum computing technologies across various industries.



Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, attributed this remarkable performance to the company’s continuous innovation and technical advancements, including introducing the Advantage2 prototype and the new fast-anneal feature. These developments have significantly enhanced the speed and efficiency of quantum computations, further solidifying D-Wave’s position as a leader in the commercialization of quantum computing. Additionally, the company’s renewed partnership with the University of Southern California and its engagement in various quantum-powered optimization applications across different sectors underscore D-Wave’s commitment to driving measurable impact through its technology.



D-Wave Misses on EPS Forecast in Q1



Comparing D-Wave’s first-quarter performance against market expectations reveals a narrative of notable accomplishments and positive surprises. Analysts had projected an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.07 and revenue expectations of $3.03 million for the quarter. D-Wave slightly missed the revenue forecast with a reported $2.46 million and the EPS expectation with its reported $0.11 loss per share.



The company’s ability to maintain a consistent upward trend in bookings, now for the eighth consecutive quarter, alongside a significant reduction in net loss compared to the previous year, indicates a strong and improving operational efficiency.





D-Wave Reiterates Full Year 2024 Guidance



Looking ahead, D-Wave has reiterated its full-year 2024 financial guidance, which was initially set forth in its fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings press release.



The company remains optimistic about its future performance, expecting the fiscal 2024 Adjusted EBITDA Loss to be less than the fiscal 2023 Adjusted EBITDA Loss of $54.3 million. This guidance reflects D-Wave’s confidence in its strategic direction, ongoing product innovation, and market expansion efforts. Furthermore, the effective registration of D-Wave’s $175 million shelf registration statement and its Equity Line of Credit (ELOC) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, highlight the company’s strong liquidity position and its ability to raise additional funds to support future growth initiatives.

Bitpanda launches the Meme Coin Leaders Index to diversify the crypto-wallet

Bitpanda has formed a new partnership with MarketVector Indexes and has launched the new Meme Coin Leaders Index, to help investors diversify their crypto-wallets. To start, the index will contain top memecoins such as PEPE, FLOKI, WIF, BONK, DOGE, and SHIB. 

Bitpanda and the new Meme Coin Leaders Index: the tool to diversify your crypto-wallet
The famous European crypto broker, Bitpanda, has announced the launch of its new Meme Coin Leaders Index, with the aim of helping investors diversify their crypto portfolios. 

“Meme coins have become a staple in our industry, as they combine carefree fun with explosive growth potential. With the Bitpanda Meme Coin Leaders Index, it is now possible to get exposure to the best meme coins in circulation, with the same worry-free rebalancing package you know and love. BCIMEME includes: @dogecoin, @pepe, @RealFlokiInu, @Shibtoken, @dogwifcoin and @bonk_inu”
Basically, through the Meme Coin Leaders Index (BCI MEME), instead of choosing individual cryptocurrencies, users can invest in all included cryptos with just one click. 
The BCI MEME was created with the support of MarketVector Indexes, and extends the wide range of Bitpanda Crypto Index (BCI).
Currently, the new Meme Coin Leaders Index (BCI MEME) will contain the top six memecoins by market capitalization. These are: Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), PEPE, Dogwifhat (WIF), FLOKI, and BONK. 
Every month, when the market changes, the Index automatically adjusts the portfolio composition in a process called “rebalancing”. 
Bitpanda and its Meme Coin Leaders Index for investors who love fun cryptocurrencies
The new Meme Coin Leaders Index by Bitpanda aims to consider and highlight the category of fun cryptocurrencies. 
In this regard, Eric Demuth, co-founder and CEO of Bitpanda, commented as follows:
“Our range of Index products has just become larger on Bitpanda! Meme coins are a huge part of cryptocurrency culture and the demand from our users to have an easy way to invest in them has been huge. We listened and delivered. For all investors who love cryptocurrencies, dogs, and memes – such an index, much wow”.
The BCI Meme Coin Leaders index will be part of the popular BCI range from Bitpanda, originally launched in 2020 as the first true range of cryptocurrency indices. 
In fact, the BCI 5/10/25 are already available, which track the top 5, 10, and 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and specialized indices that give investors access to DeFi, Infrastructure, Smart Contracts, and Media & Entertainment. 
The BCI Meme Coin Leaders Index is the latest way Bitpanda makes investing in cryptocurrencies safe and easy.
Memecoin in red over the last seven days
Looking at the price trend of the crypto category “memecoin”, it seems that in the last seven days, there has been a noticeable red dump.
And indeed, starting from DOGE, the meme crypto with the largest market cap at $20.6 billion, the price has dropped by 11% in the last week. 
Even WIF, FLOKI, and BONK are in a price dump in the last seven days of 10-16%. The price dump of SHIB and PEPE, on the other hand, is milder and therefore below 10%. 
This general price decline has been justified as a change in interest by crypto traders who, at the moment, seem to be more focused on more established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Metaplanet Sets Up “Bitcoin First Bitcoin Only” Treasury Plan - DailyCoin


        

Metaplanet has announced an overhaul of its treasury management strategy.



The company incorporated a crypto asset into the strategy.



The company has started acquiring the crypto asset and plans to “continue accumulating.”




Early-stage investment firm Metaplanet has adopted Bitcoin (BTC) as its “strategic treasury reserve asset,” the company announced on Monday.



The company said the move to overhaul its treasury management strategy was a direct response to sustained economic pressures in Japan, notably a volatile yen, high government debt levels, and prolonged periods of negative real interest rates.



A “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only Approach”



According to a press release dated March 13, Metaplanet’s latest pivot prioritizes a “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only approach” for the company. The company plans to leverage long-dated yen liabilities and periodic share issuances to “continually accumulate more BTC instead of retaining the ever-weaker yen.”




“Metaplanet views bitcoin as fundamentally superior to any and all other forms of political currency, traditional stores of value and investment, and all other crypto-assets/securities. Bitcoin is an absolutely scarce digital synthetic monetary commodity, with no central issuer,” the company stated.



The company lauded Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, noting that it was not a liability but a “profound asset” that presented a programmatically rising marginal cost of production for the remaining 1.3 million BTC yet to enter circulation.



“This is one of the many features setting bitcoin the monetary commodity apart from its predecessors, whereas traditional commodities face headwinds in the form of increasing supply as investment is made into additional production.” The statement read.



Metaplanet’s move seems to embody the strategy employed by U.S.-listed MicroStrategy, which has since amassed 1% of the entire BTC supply following its latest acquisition of 9,254 BTC in March. As for Metaplanet, the company has reportedly acquired 117.7 BTC ($7.19 million) since April.

The Sandbox Metaverse Opens a New Reward Period with 300K SAND Tokens Set Aside | Cryptopolitan

The Sandbox has not stopped working to become the leading metaverse project. Backed by a solid game studio, it has become one of the leading blockchain projects, boosting token adoption and multiple NFT collections. The Sandbox launched another reward period, setting aside 300k SAND tokens. The Sandbox Metaverse also supports growth with a new game generator. Most of the big land plots also boost Web3 and blockchain brands. Additionally, The Sandbox organizes mini-challenges with 100 SAND rewards for using its game generator tool. About a month ago, The Sandbox introduced its newest game-making tool. The metaverse platform also relies on special events, meetups, and themed NFT collections to drive engagement. The Sandbox bridges the gap between mainstream gaming and Web3. Most NFT, avatars, and Sandbox projects aim to popularize digital ownership with a lower risk of speculation or rug pulls. For that reason, even Ubisoft chose The Sandbox for a recent collection launch. Early owners of The Sandbox assets will receive exclusive access to Ubisoft’s new metaverse experience, ChampionsVerse. The NFT will be free and not go through the usual minting and bidding process. The Sandbox Still Offers Top Virtual WorldsThe Sandbox is ranked 128 among Web3 games, with versions on Ethereum and Polygon. Currently, daily active players are in the dozens or hundreds, far from peak activity during the 2021 NFT and gaming boom. Despite this, The Sandbox retains value, trading NFT at around $390 floor price. The project has created multiple scarce items, including skins and decorations, which are used within its metaverse locations. SAND Token Trades Under $0.50The native token of SAND is still among top gaming assets, despite trading at around $0.42 in May. SAND peaked above $7.50 during the best times for metaverse games in 2021. The Sandbox remained close to Axie Infinity in terms of market capitalization, with a valuation of $983M. SAND tokens almost evened out with their competitor, Decentraland (MANA), another metaverse hangout. MANA traded at around $0.41.SAND remains a high-profile token, mostly due to its social media activity and engagement through metaverse events. SAND is now actively used for rewards, as an addition to the free NFT, and there are no concerted efforts to pump the token. Trading volumes have leveled out at around $55M in 24 hours, boosted by Binance, Upbit and HTX trading.Gaming tokens as a whole are consolidating, with no breakouts seen recently. Currently, SAND is under its 100-day moving average, and sees some accumulation along with other Web3 and gaming tokens. Owning SAND may also mean eligibility for additional rewards through staking, or NFT drops.Metaverse Land Plots Retain ValueSome of the land plots on The Sandbox still retain value, starting out at 0.1349 ETH for a basic plot. Several exclusive land plots are on sale for 1M ETH, while high-profile plots are offered between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH. The most common sales happen at around 0.15 ETH. Digital land is still needed for the full Sandbox experience, especially for players using the VoxEdit service. The goal of The Sanbox is to distribute relatively accessible NFT and items, to make a richer experience in the metaverse. The Sandbox remains one of the best-developed games in Web3 space for a graphic-rich metaverse experience.In addition to land plots, The Sandbox collections include special branded editions and claimable avatars. Some NFT also include musical effects, as well as additional branded skins.

Tether's Paolo Ardoino publicly slams Ripple's Brad Garlinghouse | Cryptopolitan

Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, stirred up a storm on Twitter by calling out Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, amid SEC investigations and the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin. Ardoino branded Garlinghouse as “an uninformed CEO,” accusing him of spreading unnecessary fear about Tether’s USDt. His fiery tweets aimed to set the record straight about USDt’s standing and reliability.Spotlight on USDt’s Global ImpactUSDt isn’t just another stablecoin. It’s a financial backbone for millions in developing areas. Unlike traditional banking systems that often overlook the financially less fortunate, USDt serves as both a transactional and a savings medium for entire unbanked communities.Ardoino took this opportunity to reaffirm Tether’s commitment to fostering a secure global financial ecosystem. He outlined that USDt has consistently demonstrated strong price stability, ample liquid reserves, and adherence to high compliance standards with premier custodians.Despite such achievements, Ardoino lamented the mainstream media’s continued negative portrayal of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, suggesting a bias intended to protect traditional financial entities. He criticized the sensationalism that shadows the real benefits cryptocurrencies bring to global finance, emphasizing Tether’s role in pushing for transparency and adherence to legal standards.Tether’s Compliance and Collaboration EffortsDiving deeper, Ardoino shared that Tether respects the OFAC/SDN lists and has a dynamic internal investigation team equipped with diverse tools for monitoring both primary and secondary markets.Tether’s partnership with Chainalysis equips its teams with top-notch software and proactive monitoring capabilities. Since its inception, Tether has cooperated with 124 law enforcement agencies worldwide, showcasing its commitment to regulatory compliance and crime prevention.Ardoino highlighted the proactive measures taken by Tether, including blocking over $1.3 billion related to scams and hacks, and around $1.6 million linked to terrorist financing. He also noted Tether’s response to 198 law enforcement requests in the past year alone, with significant collaboration with U.S. law enforcement to block harmful transactions totaling over $639 million.Paolo Ardoino, CEO of TetherFurthermore, Tether has built strong relationships with international bodies such as Israel’s NBCTF and Ukraine law enforcement, showcasing its global outreach and cooperative stance. Unlike other stablecoins which require judicial orders for action, Tether takes immediate steps to mitigate risks, providing a quicker response to threats and illegal activities.In another revealing tweet, Ardoino spoke about Tether’s latest initiative, ‘Pioneering Progress’ in Tbilisi, attended by 150 stakeholders including central bank members, regulators, and government officials. This event showcased Tether’s leadership in shaping the future of finance, AI, and resilient infrastructure through collaborative discussions focused on regulation, compliance, and technological advancements.

Bitcoin Price Bounces Back Above $63,000 Ahead of US CPI Data | Coinspeaker



Bitcoin’s daily trading volumes surge by 76% in the last 24 hours just a day before the US reports PPI and CPI inflation numbers. Any positive development could lead to a breakout above $64,000. 

After facing some selling pressure over the last weekend, the world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) bounced back above $63,000 earlier today. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading 2.96% up at $62,715 with a market cap of $1.235 trillion. 
The interesting thing is that Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has jumped by 76% to over $23 billion. This surge in the BTC trading activity comes ahead of the release of the US inflation data numbers ahead of this week. 




As per the current economic data, America has been experiencing a slowdown in the economy in comparison to its robust performance last year. For the month of April, the US employment numbers highlighted weaker growth than the market estimates. 
If this situation continues further, it could force the Federal Reserve to cut down on interest rates to prevent any major downturn in the US economy. As a result, investors are looking for confirmation regarding the ongoing presence of inflation. This data could offer additional clarity on the scale, timing, and probability of interest rate reductions throughout the year.
All Eyes on the US CPI Numbers
This week, the market will get more insights into the US inflation numbers. On Tuesday, the United States will be releasing the Producer Price Index (PPI) data while a day later on Wednesday, they will share the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Before this week’s inflation reports, the CME’s FedWatch tool predicts a 24.6% possibility of a rate cut at July’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and a 48.6% chance at September’s meeting. Interest traders anticipate a 96.5% likelihood of unchanged rates at June’s meeting. Analysts at QCP Capital wrote:

“Unless the Fed clearly rules out rate cuts or hints at rate hikes, it seems like the markets will continue to price in cuts. These expectations are likely to keep a bullish tone in the market for a while.”

So far the Bitcoin price has managed to stay above the crucial support levels of $60,000. However, on the upside, it has always failed to surge past $64,000, and thus trading in the narrow range.


However, if the BTC price fails to give a convincing breakout above the resistance of $64,000, it can see further pullbacks under $60,000. Popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe stated that losing $60,000 can lead to a further 15% correction in BTC price.

SHIB Recovers From Early Shock Following 100 Billion Whale Transaction


							

SHIB experienced a price slump in the early hours of Monday amid investor interest.



A SHIB whale transferred 100 billion SHIB tokens to Coinbase early Monday morning.



The memecoin recovered from the slump to gain 6.4% a few hours later.




SHIB, the native cryptocurrency of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, experienced a price slump in the early hours of Monday, May 13, amid investor interest. Onchain data showed that a whale transferred 100 billion SHIB to Coinbase, one of the leading centralized exchanges (CEX).



The whale’s action attracted the interest of the memecoin’s community members, triggering speculations over the short-term impact of the transaction. Furthermore, the significant transfer added more energy to the already-existing bearish sentiment in the Shiba Inu community.



While the identified SHIB transfer to Coinbase does not necessarily indicate a sell transaction, the speculations around it stem from the current plunge in SHIB’s price. Users of the dog-themed memecoin appear to be pondering about the implications of this transfer.









It is essential to note that in many cases, crypto users consider transferring digital assets to CEXs a sign that the holder may be planning to sell. They see it as an attempt to introduce the assets into an ecosystem where they can be exchanged easily for fiat or other crypto assets, unlike holding them in isolated portfolios.



Considering the available data, the whale purchased the said SHIB tokens at an average price of $0.00002408. Selling them at the current price would amount to a loss of about $178,000. The data also revealed that the wallet behind the SHIB transfer did not hold any other token, showing that all of its past transfers revolved around SHIB.The transaction led to a 4% drop in SHIB’s price on Monday morning. However, the flagship memecoin has recovered from the slump and pushed towards higher levels. Data from TradingView showed that SHIB traded for $0.00002370 at the time of writing, reflecting a 6.4% profit for the trading day.

Blockdaemon Bags Approval in Abu Dhabi to Expand UAE Presence



By making its Web 3.0 infrastructure solutions available locally in the UAE, Blockdaemon hopes to pioneer the success story of other similar companies in the region.

Blockdaemon has announced its plans to spread its tentacles and gain more foothold in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This follows after it recently got a nod of approval from the local Registration Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).
As a result of this approval, Blockdaemon is now licensed to begin its operations in Abu Dhabi, starting with a new office in the region.




Blockdaemon Shares Its UAE Expansion Plans
With its new approval, Blockdaemon is looking to set the pace for other Web 3.0 companies to emulate. By making its Web3 infrastructure solutions available locally in the UAE, alongside its self-hosted MPC wallet technology, the firm hopes to pioneer the success story of other similar companies in the region.
Interestingly, ADGM has also issued a statement that seems to align with Blockdaemon’s ambitions for securing the approval. The regulator’s chief of market development, Arvind Ramamurthy, noted that the move is part of a calculated attempt to create a foundation for the growth and success of other web3-based firms. Ramamurthy said in a statement:
“The decision of a prominent institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure company to expand in this region with ADGM underscores the progressive regulatory environment offered by our international financial center.”
Ramamurthy is fairly certain that the latest approval could unlock certain opportunities within the region. Besides, with Blockdaemon developing institutional-grade infrastructure for blockchain protocols and traditional financial institutions, the anticipation might not be exactly far-fetched.
Previous Expansion Efforts
The latest approval signals Blockdaemon’s keen interest in the UAE region. However, even before now, it has been making several strategic expansion efforts in the past.
In February 2022,  it forayed into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region before making its first move to the Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region less than a month later.
By September 2021, the firm had achieved unicorn status following a $155 million raise that brought its valuation to 1.255 billion at the time. More recently, Coinspeaker reported that the firm now has a valuation of about $3.25 billion after completing a series C funding round

How would Trump’s ‘biggest tax cut’ impact crypto


Not long after expressing his support for the cryptocurrency industry, at the same time accusing his opponent in the United States presidential race, Joe Biden, of the perceived animosity towards the sector, former US President Donald Trump has announced major taxation cuts if elected.
Indeed, Trump was referring to President Biden’s latest budget proposal, which would introduce new and increased capital gains tax and which could impact crypto investors, stating he would, on the other hand, impose the “biggest tax cut” for all social classes, he said at a campaign rally on May 12.

“Instead of a Biden tax hike, I’ll give you a Trump middle class, lower class, business class, big tax cut. You’re gonna have the biggest tax cut. And we were set to do that, we were all set to do it.”



As it happens, in line with the standard Republican approach, the Trump campaign’s proposal plans to lower the maximum capital gains tax rate to 15%, which would follow his previous term, during which the administration dropped this rate to a maximum of 20%, as Finbold reported on May 2.
Impact on crypto
Still, the previous tax bill that Trump signed into law in December 2018 fails to clarify matters for crypto investors, traders, issuers, and miners, as it doesn’t directly address digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and tokens issued through initial coin offerings (ICOs). 
However, it does have an indirect impact, as certain attorneys believe that capital gains taxes might still apply to crypto assets. On the contrary, at least some crypto investors consider the sale of Bitcoin for Ethereum, for instance, as a like-kind exchange that is exempt from section 1031 of the tax code.
Specifically, as Jeremy Naylor, a partner at Proskauer Rose LLP, explained, taxpayers who treat crypto-for-crypto exchanges as like-kind are “taking the risk that if they got audited, the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] would disagree,” considering that “it’s clear now that you can’t do that” under the new law.
Moreover, the exemption that section 1031 previously applied to “property of like kind” only applies to “real property of like kind,” which excludes crypto assets. By following this logic, crypto is subject to capital gains tax, and Trump’s promised cuts would mean lower capital gains taxes for crypto traders and investors.
Donald Trump and crypto industry 
Meanwhile, the former President has recently stated that he was “fine with” crypto, promising that he would let crypto businesses, which he believes are currently leaving the US because of “hostility toward crypto,” exist in the country, as well as accepting crypto contributions to his campaign.
As a reminder, Trump had gradually modified his crypto stance, shifting from arguing that “Bitcoin is a scam” to launching his own non-fungbible token (NFT) collection called Trump Digital Trading Cards, to an even more openness regarding paying with Bitcoin and other crypto assets.

Ethereum-Based Layer 3 Blockchain Degen Halted for Over 12 Hours | Coinspeaker



While Degen grapples with its recent network downtime, the platform is not the only blockchain protocol facing such challenges lately.

Degen Chain, an Ethereum-based layer 3 blockchain network, has suffered a major setback, highlighting one of the key challenges in the blockchain industry. For over 12 hours and counting, the protocol has been unable to produce blocks, halting all activities on the chain, including buying and selling cryptocurrencies.
According to the network explorer, the outage caught users off guard on Sunday evening, as the protocol abruptly ceased validating new transactions at the block height of  #15524774.




Working to Restore the Network Activities
Due to the sudden downtime, many decentralized applications (dApps), including blockchain bridges operating on the Degen Chain, have become inactive. As a result, users interacting with these projects, such as DegenSwap, Mint Club, and Frogswap, have completely lost access to their assets on the platforms until the network is fully back online.
In response to the network outage, the protocol developers took to X (Twitter) on Monday morning to acknowledge the issue and reassure users of their efforts to restore the chain. According to the post, the team has partnered with the rollup infrastructure platform Conduit to bring the network back online.
Currently, the cause of the halt remains a mystery, with no clear explanation for the sudden outage. For now, the network’s issues have not spread to other chains, notably Base, which continues to function without any disruption.
Degen’s TPS Milestone
As a blockchain network, Degen was built using the Arbitrum Orbit technology stack. It primarily relies on the layer-2 scaling solution Base for operations and ensures data availability through the AnyTrust protocol.
Despite its Ethereum roots, Degen operates differently by using its native token, Degen, for gas fees instead of Ether. The digital asset follows the ERC-20 standard and was minted within the Degen channel on Farcaster back in January 2024.
Before the recent network hiccup, the protocol had quite a winning streak. In April, the Degen Chain hit a major milestone by clocking the highest Transaction Per Second (TPS) count in a single day within the Ethereum ecosystem.
According to L2BEAT, Degen’s TPS count soared by an impressive 62%, hitting 35.7, leading other projects such as Base and Arbitrum. Base only recorded 29.7 TPS, coming second on the top five list of projects in Ethereum with high throughput
That same month, Degen also emerged as the largest and most vibrant meme coin within the Farcaster network.
Not the First
While Degen grapples with its recent network downtime, the platform is not the only blockchain protocol facing such challenges lately. Solana (SOL), a prominent player in the industry, has had its fair share of network outages, with the most recent one occurring in February.
The latest downtime marked the first hiccup for the network in over a year, dashing users’ hopes that network outages were a thing of the past.
Similarly, Avalanche (AVAX), another popular blockchain, experienced a network outage in February earlier this year. The disruption lasted for several hours before the bug was identified, and activities resumed as usual.

Historical Data Shows Bitcoin Price Could Rebound Soon If This Happens: CryptoQuant


																Bitcoin has continued to experience volatility after the long-awaited halving event, with prices continuing to wobble. Despite the sideways movement, however, analysts remain optimistic about bitcoin’s price action in the current market cycle.
According to an analyst from the blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium trend could have a positive effect on bitcoin’s price once it turns negative.
The Coinbase Premium Index is an indicator that represents the percentage difference between the BTC/USDT pair on Binance and the BTC/USD pair on Coinbase Pro. Since Binance has a global user base while Coinbase is more focused on the US market, the difference between the prices on these two large crypto exchanges provides insight into the trading behaviors of both demographics.
Coinbase Premium Index Close to Zero
When the Coinbase Premium displays a positive trend, it indicates that bitcoin’s price on Coinbase is higher than on Binance as there is greater buying pressure on the former. However, a negative trend suggests that Coinbase is seeing a greater selling pressure, as the price listed on Binance becomes higher.
Per the analysis from CryptoQuant, historical data indicates that bitcoin’s price typically rebounds when the Coinbase Premium trend is negative and reverses from a downtrend to an uptrend. One such occasion was when Grayscale won the lawsuit against the SEC regarding the conversion of its GBTC product to a spot Bitcoin ETF, and it positively affected BTC’s price.
The Coinbase Premium Index is currently hovering in the positive zone, close to zero. However, if the trend shifts to negative, bitcoin’s price is expected to rebound.
“If the historical pattern repeats itself, we may have a better chance of success if we wait a bit longer and invest in the rebound after the trend turns negative,” the analyst said.
Accumulation Continues Amid Price Fluctuations
Bitcoin has continued to see increased interest from investors despite price fluctuations. The latest approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs have further improved inflows into the market.
Earlier this month, Coinbase released its Q1 earnings report, with the total revenue surging 72% to $1.6 billion.

SoftBank subsidiary to develop semiconductor chips, reports profits after AI shift

SoftBank-owned processor designer Arm has announced plans to develop its own in-house artificial intelligence (AI) chips on the back of AI-related profits.On May 13 a report from Nikkei Asia said that Arm is setting up a division for developing AI chips, with its first protocol to be released by spring 2025 and mass production anticipated by autumn of the same year. It was reported that Arm will be taking up the initial costs of development, estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of yen, with contributions from SoftBank which owns a 90% stake. After mass production is up and running, there is a possibility for the AI chip business to spin off under SoftBank itself. SoftBank is reportedly already in negotiations with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, among others, to secure capacity for producing the chips en masse. Arm is responsible for providing the technology that is used in the main chips of “almost all smartphones and tablets,” according to the company. It holds a share of more than 90% in architecture for processors used in smartphones.Additionally, Arm supplies architecture to Nvidia - one of the market’s leading AI chip developers. In developing their own chips for high-level AI models, Arm aims to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. Related: Elon Musk’s AI spinoff is seeking $4B that could level up Grok: ReportThis comes after SoftBank reported a net profit in the final quarter of its financial year for 2024 after the company shifted its focus toward AI. Arm was a major part of the company’s outlook for the upcoming year. SoftBank chief financial officer Yoshimitsu Goto told a press conference in Tokyo that growing interest and development in the AI sector is a key focus for the group:"Arm is at the core of SoftBank Group's AI shift which will create a new ecosystem, along with the various assets we've held for a long time that are using AI, centered on the Vision Fund.”Arm’s stock surged by 30% this February due to its forecasted ambitions in AI. It is among one of the many technology developers looking to develop AI chips in-house and wean off of a reliance on Nvidia. On April 15, ​​Samsung said it secured a $6.4 billion grant to expand its Texas facility for semiconductor chip manufacturing, with an anticipated $45 billion invested by the end of the decade. In February, it was reported that OpenAI, the company behind one of the world’s most powerful AI chatbots ChatGPT, is seeking trillions of dollars in investments from investors worldwide to begin manufacturing its own chips.

Bitcoin layer-2 landscape "set to boom" as BTC keeps outperforming: Bybit - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin (BTC) layer-2 (L2) blockchains will continue to grow as BTC continues to outperform other major crypto in 2024, according to a report by crypto exchange Bybit.Bitcoin’s market dominance has surged to 51.1% as of May 7, signaling a robust uptrend since late September 2023. This growth is largely attributed to the US approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has bolstered Bitcoin’s trading volume. Bybit reports an 18% increase in BTC holdings month-over-month from March to April 2024, with Bitcoin’s trading volume now representing 31.8% of the total.The L2 landscape is enhancing the utility of BTC and leveraging the security of Bitcoin mining. While they face challenges due to the Bitcoin blockchain’s architecture and community resistance to change, the success of projects like Ordinals and Runes suggests that innovation can drive community growth. As Bitcoin maintains its proof of work (PoW) status and outperforms other blockchains, the potential for Bitcoin L2 development remains vast.This growth has catalyzed the development of Bitcoin L2 solutions, designed to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and introduce programmability to the Bitcoin network. These solutions include state channels, sidechains, and rollups.State channels like the Lightning Network facilitate faster, more cost-effective transactions by allowing off-chain updates between parties. However, they face limitations in capacity and lack smart contract functionality. RGB, a new project, aims to overcome these challenges by integrating smart contract capabilities with the Lightning Network.Sidechains operate independently but maintain a connection to the Bitcoin mainnet through bridges, enabling asset transfers. Projects like Stacks and Rootstock are well-established, while newcomers like AILayer boast the highest total value locked (TVL) due to its AI integration and anticipated airdrop.Rollups, which batch transactions for settlement on the mainnet, are divided into optimistic and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups. ZK-rollups, in particular, are favored for their lower transaction costs. Merlin Chain leads the ZK-rollup space with a TVL of $1.1 billion, thanks to its early launch and vibrant DApp ecosystem.Despite these advancements, Bitcoin L2 solutions face inherent risks, including security vulnerabilities, interoperability challenges, and counterparty risks, Bybit points out. These risks mirror those encountered by early Ethereum L2 solutions.

China's Digital Yuan: A Currency No One Wants To Use?


								China’s ambitious plan for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY or digital yuan, is facing a test of adoption. While the government boasts billions of dollars in transactions and enthusiastic city trials, a closer look reveals a hurdle – a lukewarm reception from the very people it’s meant to serve.

Digital Yuan: Early Adopters Turn Away
A recent report by the South China Morning Post throws cold water on the e-CNY’s immediate success. State employees in some cities, receiving a portion of their salaries in digital yuan, are quickly converting it back to cash. The reasons? A lack of incentive and practicality.
Sammy Lin, an account manager at a Chinese state bank, said:

“There’s no interest if I leave it there […] there aren’t many places where I can use it.”

This sentiment echoes concerns about limited use cases. Unlike established digital payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay, the e-CNY seems to lack widespread merchant adoption, both online and offline.
Privacy Concerns Cloud the Picture
Adding to the apprehension is the specter of government surveillance. China’s digital ecosystem is already closely monitored, and citizens are wary of the potential for intrusive tracking with the e-CNY.

“Paper currency offers anonymity,” says Ye Dongyan, a researcher at Beijing’s Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. “The boundaries between information tracking and security need more clarification.”

The government, however, maintains that the e-CNY prioritizes privacy through “controllable anonymity.” This system, according to Yi Gang, the former governor of the People’s Bank of China, protects small transactions while monitoring larger ones to prevent financial crimes.
But can this appease citizen anxieties?

Numbers Tell A Different Story?
Despite the reported low usage among initial recipients, China boasts a different narrative. Yi points to over $250 billion worth of e-CNY transactions conducted as of July 2023.
This suggests some level of adoption, but the details remain unclear – is it organic growth, or a result of government-led initiatives?
Incentivizing The Switch
China is actively promoting the e-CNY. Several cities have conducted trials, handing out millions in digital yuan subsidies and consumption coupons. This approach aims to encourage people to experiment with the new currency and potentially discover its benefits.

The Road Ahead
The future of the e-CNY remains uncertain. While the government pushes for wider adoption, user behavior suggests a need for more than just financial incentives. Addressing the limited use cases and building trust around privacy protection are crucial steps.
China’s digital currency project may yet see widespread adoption, but for now, it seems to be stuck in a conversion cycle – from digital yuan back to cash.

The Big Day Has Arrived: Crucial Bitcoin-related Data to Be Released on Wednesday - Bitcoin Sistemi


The cryptocurrency community is eagerly awaiting the announcement of investors behind Bitcoin ETFs as May 15th approaches. This important date marks the deadline for investors managing assets over $100 million to file “13-F Filings” with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and reveal their holdings in publicly traded assets.
These applications, which must be made 45 days after the end of a quarter of the year, can give an idea about the investment strategies of large companies in the market. Although they do not cover every investor and represent just a moment in time, the upcoming announcements are expected to bring positive surprises regarding institutional participation in Bitcoin ETFs.


13F filings are defined as documents required quarterly by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in eligible assets. If you're big enough to be in this lane, you have to disclose to the world your U.S.-traded stocks, options, and now Bitcoin ETFs as of the last day of the quarter.
But here's the kicker: not all 13F applications are equal. Not all of them signal true investment confidence.






Take, for example, market makers and high-frequency trading firms such as Citadel Securities, Susquehanna International Group (SIG), Renaissance Technologies, and Virtu Financial. For example, unlike Berkshire Hathaway indicating a bullish outlook on an announced position, Citadels and SIGs often trade swings to profit from small differences between bid and ask prices. Their holdings generally reflect high-volume trading rather than a long-term belief in the assets. Therefore, it pays to be careful when examining 13Fs.
*This is not investment advice.

Contextualizing Crypto Volatility: History of Bitcoin Crashes

Cryptocurrency has raised exposure to innovative concepts and opportunities, changed economic paradigms, and become the “new economy.” Although cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly familiar in every corner of the world, crypto volatility is just like nothing before. Currency can play for bigger profits or, on the other hand, greater losses in a very short time. Understanding the nature of Bitcoin and other crypto volatility is important.  
Crypto volatility means the unpredictable price nature of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has a history of great price volatility in bursts with periodic crashes. Market sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic factors cause sudden big drops in its price.
What is Crypto Volatility?
Volatility measures the amount of an asset’s price that has fluctuated over time. In general, the volatility of an asset indicates how risky the investors perceive it to be and how much potential it exhibits for delivering higher returns or bigger losses over time horizons of shorter duration than the relatively less volatile money.
As cryptocurrencies are a relatively new asset class, they are commonly viewed as having potentially huge gains and losses in short periods. The digital assets possess high volatility, as in the case of “penny stocks,” to relatively quieter large-cap corners. On the other hand, bonds show lower volatility, where they normally move less sharply up or down over long periods.
Measurement of Crypto Volatility
When measuring volatility, it commonly refers to “historical volatility,” resulting from the analysis of prices on a given period, usually 30 days back, a year or more. Because the future is impossible to predict with certainty, the science of “implied volatility” — which offers an educated guess about what’s to come – stands as far less exact even as it serves as the foundation for such popular financial tools as the Cboe Volatility Index, often termed the “fear index” because it predicts stock market volatility over the next 30 days.   
There are two methods for quantifying crypto volatility:

One way to do this is to employ beta, The beta measures how volatile a stock is relative to the entire market (usually using the S&P 500 for that gauge).
The standard deviation of an asset, which indicates how much its price has deviated from its historical average, can be calculated.

The Importance of Crypto Volatility
Volatility is among the main elements used to determine a particular investment’s risk. Normally, investors take on quite a bit of risk if the potential gain from an investment is such that there is an equal chance that the investor might lose some of the initial investment. (Everything they’d invested is gone — as in the case of high-risk hedge-fund manager Bill Hwang, whose entire $20bn fund vanished in two days.)

5 Proven Tips to Protect Your Money During a Crypto Crash.

If anything, the retail investor usually has it as a mantra that they should be aware that they should diversify risk by spreading their holdings within an asset class. One typically well-liked way is investing in an index fund or a basket of stocks instead of buying a select few. This may also be coupled with diversification of investments in low volatile assets, such as bonds, at the same time as they have investments in more volatile asset categories, such as stocks, to minimize even further the chances of any investment giving negative returns.
Despite the cryptocurrency asset class being only a bit over a decade old, which has led to numerous very sharp run-ups followed by retrenchments and considered as, on balance, more volatile than stocks the increased trading volumes and greater institutional participation witnessed in Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, appear to be diminishing its volatility over time. When trying emerging crypto assets like DeFi tokens or cryptocurrencies with lower trading volumes, it’s best practice to risk amounts you can afford to lose, as these are usually experiences with higher volatility. 

Crypto volatility arises from positive or negative news coverage and better or worse than estimated quarterly results. Crypto volatility is primarily attributed to irregular spikes, such that the level of trading volume can be exceptionally high. Low volume normally means high crypto volatility, such as dealing with smaller cryptocurrencies or penny stocks not traded on major markets.
Can We Reduce Crypto Volatility?
And while its crypto volatility has been decreasing of late, bitcoin often moves by double-digit percentage amounts in a single week, presenting ample opportunity for tactics such as “buying the dip.” Moreover, its high crypto volatility makes it attractive to some cryptocurrency investors as it gives the potential for big returns.

What Happens to Crypto if Binance Goes Bankrupt?

Dollar-cost averaging can reduce the negative effects of crypto volatility for less risk-tolerant people. Longer-term investors generally do not pay as much need to concern themselves with short-term fluctuations because they have every reason to believe that an investment will eventually rise over time.  Stablecoins, such as USD Coin and Dai, are less volatile cryptocurrencies – their value is set to some reserve asset, such as the US dollar.
An Overview of Bitcoin Crashes in The Past 
In 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) saw one of the worst crashes in history, with the price of BTC falling below $20,000 in June 2022, following a peak of $68,000 in November 2021. Since September 2011, June 2022 has been the worst month for Bitcoin due to monthly losses that have reached 40%.
Additionally, the cryptocurrency reported its worst quarterly losses in eleven years. Nevertheless, bear markets and Bitcoin crashes are not limited to 2022 due to the present market sell-off. In fact, since the genesis block—the first block of Bitcoin—was mined in January 2009, the cryptocurrency has witnessed its fair share of crypto winters. When we pan out the Bitcoin price chart, we can find the following five most significant price drops in its history.
Bitcoin Crashed From 32 USD to 0.01 USD in 2011
In April 2011, the price of Bitcoin broke through its first significant psychological barrier of $1, igniting the first-ever rally that saw it reach $32 on June 8, 2011. Happiness, however, was short-lived as the value of Bitcoin then crashed, bottoming out at just $0.01 over a few days.
The sharp sell-off was mainly instigated by security flaws at the now-defunct Mt. Gox, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange that conducted the majority of Bitcoin trades then. The theft of 850,000 BTC was a security breach in the exchange’s platform, raising serious questions about the safety of Bitcoin that it staked on exchanges.

The flash crash in June 2011 kept that part of the significant Bitcoin history when BTC lost almost 99% of its value through a very short period, measured in a few days. The event started long before Bitcoin bounced its price back to the previous high of $32, and new all-time highs were reached in February 2013.
Trying to follow pre-2013 Bitcoin price charts is akin to comparing them with more recent ones. Established lineament price tracking services or websites such as CoinGecko, for instance, or CoinMarketCap did not track prices of the Bitcoin before April 2013.
Bitcoin Crashed From $1,000 to $200 in 2015
Data on BTC price depicts that Bitcoin peaked in mid-April 2013 at $100. Riding up ever since for the first time in history, it touched $1,000 in November of 2013.

Top 5 Tips For Newbie Bitcoin Investors: Here’s What You Need To Know

Less than a month after crushing the $1,000 barrier for the first time, Bitcoin embarked on one of its most savage bear market runs in history. The decline in value coincided with the crackdown on Bitcoin by the Chinese central bank in late 2013, which prohibited regional financial institutions from processing transactions involving the said cryptocurrency.

Prices of the cryptocurrencies continued to spiral down in the ensuing two years, hitting a low of $170 in January 2015 after first bottoming out at around $360 in April 2014.
December of 2013 ushered in the extended cryptocurrency winter of 2014, linked to the compromised Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange that was refusing Bitcoin withdrawals during the first few days of February 2014 – any trades made with the platform stopped after this point and ultimately ended in bankruptcy between the US and Tokyo.
Several other leading financial authorities around the world also aired concerns regarding Bitcoin. In 2014, late in the year, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission claimed its authority over “Bitcoin price manipulation.”
Before a long-term trend started a reversal in August 2015, the general sentiment concerning Bitcoin was mostly bearish. In January 2017, between a healthy bull market, for the first time since then, the price of Bitcoin reached $1,000 again. In the history of Bitcoin, this was the longest price recovery period from an all-time high.
Bitcoin Falls Below $3,200 After Reaching $20,000 in December 2017
In January 2017, Bitcoin recovered to $1,000, and by the end of the year, it had reached a high of $20,000.

However, similar to the $1,000 high in the history of Bitcoin, its triumph of $20,000 was short-lived as the cryptocurrency plummeted and lost over 60% of its value in just months.
So, the Bitcoin market decided to continue its way down in 2018, and the year with lightning speed soon was christened on exchanges as “crypto winter” – by December 2018, bitcoins fell only to a low of about 3,200 dollars.
Alarm bells for the commencement of the crypto winter were ringing over security concerns at Coincheck, another Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange. Coincheck was hit by a massive hack in January 2018, which resulted in the loss of around $530m NEM (NEM) cryptocurrency.

The bear market worsened when the tech giants Facebook and Google issued bans on ads for initial coin offerings and token sales in March and June 2018, respectively.
One of these initiatives contributing to the bear market was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to reject applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.
Bitcoin Drops From $63,000 to $29,000 in 2021
However, until 2020, the cryptocurrency market was mostly bearish, as with the retracing of Bitcoin to $20,000 – and more so in the latter half of 2018 to $3,000 – it started a new massive bull run that outpaced every other run before it and peaked at above $63k in April 2021.

Despite the slight setback, it became one of the crucial years for Bitcoin in which the cryptocurrency crossed the $1 trillion market cap.
After hitting new highs in mid-April, Bitcoin drew back a little but dropped its price to as low as $29,000 in three months.
The 2021 mini-bear market came with a growing media narrative insinuating that there are some environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) problems posed by Bitcoin mining.
The global ESG-related FUD around Bitcoin became even louder when Tesla, Elon Musk’s electric car company, dumped Bitcoin as payment in May on ESG concerns. Just three months later, Musk admitted that about half of Bitcoin mining was powered by renewable energy.
The bear market was short-lived despite a major crackdown on local mining farms that followed China. The bullish trend had returned by the end of July, and eventually, Bitcoin would go up to its still-unbroken all-time high of $68,000 set in November 2021.
Bitcoin Plummets From $68,000 to Below $20,000 in 2022
Bitcoin failed to break through above $70,000 and started declining in late 2021. Since the November season of last year, cryptocurrency has been experiencing a bear market with its largest historical crashers during December 2022.
In June, the cryptocurrency fell below $20,000 for the first time since 2020, fueling market panic.
The crisis of algorithmic stablecoins happens with the TerraUSD Classic (USTC) stablecoin being held to a 1:1 peg against US dollars through blockchain algorithms instead of equivalent cash reserves.

USTC, a major algorithmic stablecoin, lost its dollar peg in May. One of the most violent de-pegging saw USTC end as it skyrocketed to break into the podium of the third-largest stablecoins before it faced its demise.

Trading Bitcoin vs. BTC Futures: A Comprehensive Guide

A cryptocurrency lending crisis fueled huge liquidations and uncertainty caused by the Terra consortium, and the former had a domino effect on the rest of the cryptocurrency market. 

Conclusion
The history of Bitcoin crashes is a crypto volatility story and has elements of resilience, adaptation, and growth. In creating one’s path through the cryptocurrency markets’ bumpy ride, treading with some nuance on how they come about will be critical. Learning from the past, appreciating the impact of human behavior, and vigilantly standing in touch with regulatory and technological shifts can provide investors with more confidence and resilience in navigating the crypto landscape.

WBTC thief returns $71 million worth of stolen funds

$71 million worth of stolen cryptocurrencies from a recent wallet poisoning scam has been returned to the victim in a fortunate but mysterious turn of events.The unknown attacker returned $71 million worth of Ether (ETH) tokens on May 12, after the high-profile phishing incident caught the attention of multiple blockchain investigation firms. On-chain security firm Lookonchain unpacked the details in an X post on May 13:“SlowMist_Team released a report on this incident 3 days ago, tracking multiple attacker’ IPs possibly from Hong Kong (the use of VPNs has not been ruled out). After that, the attacker replied to the whale and returned all the funds.”Source: LookonchainThis comes as a surprising development to the attack from May 3, when an investor sent $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to a bait wallet address, falling victim to a wallet poisoning scam. The scammer created a wallet address with similar alphanumeric characters and made a small transaction to the victim’s account.Related: El Salvador launches $360M Bitcoin treasury monitoring websiteLike most investors, the victim validated the wallet address by matching the first and last few characters and transferred 97% of their assets to it. However, the difference would have been noticeable in the middle characters, often hidden on platforms to improve visual appeal.White hat hacker, good samaritan, or scared thief?Despite returning all the stolen funds, on-chain transactions leading up to the event suggest this was not the exploiter’s initial intention.After receiving the stolen funds, the attacker immediately converted the 1,155 WBTC to approximately 23,000 ETH — a popular move by malicious hackers that can help launder stolen funds via privacy protocols and crypto mixing services such as Tornado Cash.On May 8, the attacker started spreading the funds across over 400 crypto wallets, which ultimately ended up in over 150 separate wallets, before returning the assets.Source: PeckshieldThe return of the funds came shortly after on-chain security firm SlowMist published an analysis on the attacker’s potential Hong Kong-based IPs, suggesting that the thief got scarred by the potential consequences.Source: SlowMistThe $71 million theft is only a small part of the phishing attempts associated with the WBTC tief, according to a May 10 incident report by SlowMist:“Upon investigating this fee address, we observed that from April 19 to May 3, this address initiated over 20,000 small transactions, distributing small amounts of ETH to various addresses for phishing purposes.”The amount of crypto stolen from hacks and scams fell to $25.7 million in April, markings the lowest historical figure since 2021 when on-chain intelligence firm CertiK started tracking the data.Related: Ether turns inflationary for the first time since the Merge

Tether Defends Transparency Amid Ripple Critics


In a striking development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino publicly challenged Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse following comments about potential SEC scrutiny of USDT. 
This confrontation underscores the regulatory complexities facing stablecoin issuers and the intense competition within the cryptocurrency sector.
Tether CEO Confronts Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse Over FUD
Paolo Ardoino responded to Garlinghouse’s comments by taking to social media. He accused people of spreading “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” (FUD), particularly as Ripple prepares to enter the stablecoin market.
At a pivotal moment, Tether, the issuer of the world’s most utilized stablecoin, USDT, stands. With a user base mainly in emerging markets and developing countries, USDT is a crucial financial resource, offering access to financial services from which many are otherwise excluded. 

Amid these accusations, Brad Garlinghouse aired his concerns on the “World Class” podcast with Chris Vasquez. He discussed the severe implications for the broader crypto market if the U.S. government were to act against Tether, emphasizing Tether’s critical role.

In response to the FUD accusation, Tether reiterated its dedication to compliance and transparency. The company complies with regulatory standards and collaborates with global law enforcement to block and report illicit transactions. These efforts ensure the safety and stability of Tether’s operations. They block over $1.3 billion tied to scams, hacks, and money laundering, as Ardoino highlighted.

“The real facts show how Tether USDt, leveraging the transparency of the blockchain technology and working with global law enforcement is able to comply with requirements,” he said.

Moreover, Tether supports a highly skilled internal investigation team. Ardoino noted that this team uses advanced tools to monitor both primary and secondary market transactions. Their work is enhanced through partnerships with analytics firms like Chainalysis, which supply cutting-edge software to bolster monitoring and compliance.
This dispute not only points to the SEC’s potential actions but also to the competitive dynamics in the cryptocurrency industry, where the launch of new stablecoins by companies like Ripple could alter market dynamics and regulatory focus. As Ripple gears up to introduce its stablecoin, the stakes are considerable, putting Garlinghouse’s actions and words under intense scrutiny.
As the cryptocurrency sector evolves, the interaction among competition, regulatory challenges, and market stability grows increasingly complex. Tether and Ripple must navigate these waters carefully, balancing aggressive business tactics with strict compliance and ethical standards.

                        El Salvador, renowned for its move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021, has now introduced a cutting-edge online platform for tracking the country’s Bitcoin Treasury.The initiative, spearheaded by The Bitcoin Office, a Salvadoran government agency dedicated to overseeing Bitcoin-related projects, aims to offer public access to data on the country’s BTC investments through a specialized mempool.El Salvador Launches Public Platform for Transparency on Bitcoin HoldingsThe official announcement from the Bitcoin Office stated,“EL SALVADOR NOW HAS ITS @MEMPOOL WHERE ANYONE CAN CHECK OUR BITCOIN TREASURY HOLDINGS.”The introduction of this platform signifies a significant step towards enhancing the financial transparency of government operations in El Salvador. The newly launched website, akin to a mempool, offers public access to data regarding El Salvador’s BTC investments.According to the website, the country holds 5,748.76 BTC, valued at over $352.8 million. The platform also reveals that the Salvadoran government acquired an additional 31 BTC in the past month and 7 BTC in the previous week.El Salvador Bitcoin Balance History Source: Bitcoin.gob.svThe recent addition to its BTC reserves aligns with President Nayib Bukele’s visionary strategy, announced in November 2022, in which El Salvador aims to accumulate “1 bitcoin per day.” By actively increasing its Bitcoin reserves, El Salvador continues to position itself as a leader in Bitcoin and blockchain technology.With the launch of this new website, El Salvador continues to lead the way in embracing Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Some proponents speculate that these strategic initiatives could position El Salvador as one of the wealthiest and most innovative nations globally within the next few decades, fueled by Bitcoin adoption.El Salvador’s Bitcoin Experiment: A Steadfast Journey Amidst Volatility
El Salvador made headlines in September 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The move aimed to foster financial inclusion, streamline remittance payments, and promote financial innovation.President Nayib Bukele’s decision faced criticism, particularly after Bitcoin’s price plunged from its all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. Despite volatility, El Salvador has remained steadfast in its Bitcoin strategy, dollar-cost-averaging into the cryptocurrency since 2021, with an average buying price of $43,097 per BTC.With Bitcoin currently trading above $62,000, El Salvador’s holdings have yielded an unrealized profit exceeding $57.4 million, per the Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker website.In a recent commentary, Bukele, who secured reelection in February, has aimed at mainstream media narratives surrounding the government’s economic policies. He criticized the media’s focus on El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings, highlighting the contrast in coverage between periods of low and high Bitcoin market prices.Bukele emphasized the significant increase in Bitcoin’s market value, suggesting that if El Salvador were to sell its holdings now, it would realize a profit of over 40%. He reiterated the government’s stance of holding onto Bitcoin, emphasizing that “1 BTC = 1 BTC” regardless of market fluctuations. Bukele pointed out the silence of media critics who previously highlighted potential losses during lower Bitcoin prices.Despite the attention garnered by El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin, it stands as a singular example among nation-states in adopting a “Bitcoin standard.” While rumors circulate about other countries potentially following suit, no official announcements have been made.However, there are speculations that if Bitcoin reaches $100,000, El Salvador could pay off its loans to the International Monetary Fund, paving the way for financial independence.

Parity Wallet Hacker Launders $9M After Seven Years Hiatus - DailyCoin


        

Parity Wallet hacker has resurfaced after seven years of inactivity.



The hacker has laundered some of the stolen funds.



The attacker’s primary address still holds hundreds of millions in stolen ETH.




The hacker suspected to have stolen tens of thousands of Ethereum from Parity Multisig Wallet has resurfaced after seven years of inactivity.



In July 2017, the attacker exploited a vulnerability on Parity Multisig Wallet version 1.5+ to drain over 150,000 ETH (valued at $30M) from three high-profile multi-signature contracts used to store funds from past token sales.




While blockchain infrastructure platform OpenZeppelin issued a post-mortem of the attack, detailing how it could have been prevented, the stolen funds were never recovered.



Hacker Launders First Batch of Stolen Loot



On May 13, blockchain security firm Cyvers issued an alert on X, noting that the hacker behind the Parity Multisig wallet theft had leveraged multiple consolidated addresses to initiate the laundering of 3,050 ETH ($9 million) at automatic crypto exchange eXch.



“The hacker behind this theft has demonstrated remarkable patience, marking a significant chapter in crypto history. Today, the hacker has initiated the laundering of 3050K ETH,” Cyvers wrote.



Following the first batch transfer, the hacker still retains control of a staggering 83,017 ETH, valued at approximately $246.6 million, Cyvers said, sharing the attacker’s primary address.



While the funds were still intact at the attacker’s primary address as of press time, an anonymous party had left an odd on-chain message, inviting the hacker to provide liquidity for perp DEXs.




“Hey, I am searching for a liquidity provider. I have some hft strategies for perp dexes and amms and can prove it cryptographically, answer with an email or tg if you are interested.

Bitcoin Wallets Dormant For Almost 11 Years Just Reawakened, How Much Have They Made? | Bitcoinist.com


								Two Bitcoin whale addresses that had laid dormant for almost 11 years have suddenly sprung to life, taking the market by surprise. The anonymous whale wallets have initiated large-scale Bitcoin transactions, reaping substantial profits from their early investments in the pioneer cryptocurrency. 
Early Bitcoin Whales Move 1,000 BTC
Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain took to X (formerly Twitter) recently to unveil two Satoshi-era whale wallets which have been inert for 10.7 years suddenly showing signs of activity. The on-chain data analysis tool disclosed that the anonymous whale wallets, identified as “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH” had cumulatively transferred a total of 1,000 BTC valued at $60.9 million in the span of 20 minutes. 

According to Lookonchain, the two previously dormant Bitcoin whale wallets had purchased about 500 BTC each as early as September 13, 2013, just four years after the cryptocurrency’s inception. At the time, the price of BTC was about $124, thousands of dollars less than its current price today. 
Each of the BTC whale wallets had previously held 500 BTC, worth approximately $62,000. Now with the price of Bitcoin slightly above $61,200 at the time of the transfer, these anonymous Bitcoin whales have realized significant profits. Over the past 10 years, Bitcoin has skyrocketed by an astonishing 47,873%, resulting in each wallet’s initial BTC investment of $62,000 now yielding a profit of $30,387,372. 
This substantial profit can be attributed to the Bitcoin whale’s long years of hodling the pioneer cryptocurrency. Back in BTC’S early days, when only a fraction of today’s crypto community recognized its potential, a few smart investors had purchased significant amounts of the cryptocurrency at a low price. They held onto their holdings as BTC evolved, witnessing its gradual price increase over the years. 
Following Bitcoin’s rise to a record high of $69,200 in March, another Satoshi-era Bitcoin whale wallet had executed a large-scale BTC transaction, selling off 1,000 BTC and reaping profits of over $69 million. Following the transfer, the price of BTC had fallen significantly, underscoring the strong influence large-scale BTC transactions have on the present market. 
BTC Price Sees Slight Uptick
Following the 1,000 BTC transferred by the two previously inactive whale wallets, Bitcoin’s price, which was initially trading slightly above $60,000, surged by 2.92% in just 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is presently trading at $62,800, displaying bullish signals as its daily price chart depicts mostly green candles.

Bitcoin’s daily trading volume of about $18.1 billion has also witnessed a significant increase of 41.23%, highlighting the sudden rise in interest and demand from investors. It’s presently uncertain if BTC will keep this bullish momentum, considering that the cryptocurrency was previously experiencing substantial declines following the halving event on April 20. 
Over the past month, CoinMarketCap has reported an 8.45% decrease in Bitcoin and another 4.15% drop in the past seven days. With the market showing new signs of interest in BTC, the cryptocurrency’s price correction may be over, indicating the onset of a potential recovery.

Ethereum sees $12M whale transfer: What about ETH's price? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s Netflow got more positive.
ETH was close to entering the $3,000 price zone.

Recent data indicates that one of the early Ethereum [ETH] holders has transferred millions of dollars worth of ETH to an exchange. 
While this movement was relatively small, it could contribute to the positive Netflow trend that ETH has been experiencing recently. 
Early Ethereum holder sells most of their holdings
According to data from Spot on Chain, a significant transfer of 4,153 Ethereum coins to Coinbase occurred in the early hours of the 13th of May. 
This transfer, valued at over $12 million at the current ETH price, caught attention because the originating wallet is among the asset’s early holders. 
Further analysis revealed that since 2021, this wallet had deposited over 9,000 ETH—worth more than $21 million—to exchanges. 
As of press time, the wallet retained 2,566 ETH, valued at over $7 million. This recent transfer has contributed to the increased positive Netflow observed in Ethereum transactions.
Ethereum inflow increases 
The Ethereum Netflow chart analysis indicated a notable increase in positive flow over the last three days. However, it appeared poised to be the highest observed in recent days. 
While the Netflow stood at around 4,600 and 3,000 in the preceding two days, it has surged to over 18,000 at the time of this writing. 
This surge suggested a significant increase in exchange inflow over the past 24 hours.
Source: CryptoQuant
Further analysis of the ETH inflow chart revealed that over 83,000 ETH had entered exchanges at the time of this writing. 
Considering the 94,000 inflow recorded yesterday and the ongoing inflow, we will likely observe further increased activity by the end of the day.
ETH price and volume see an uptrend
Analysis of the Ethereum volume indicated a pickup at press time.

No, Hong Kong's Crypto ETFs Aren't Available in Mainland China

Adding some fuel to the fire was a piece in the SCMP that said these ETFs would be available to mainland traders who have Hong Kong residency and brokerage accounts. That’s certainly true, but there’s a massive caveat: it's like saying that mainlanders with U.S. residency can open an American brokerage account and trade New York-listed stocks (which they can’t). This doesn't mean that they are available in mainland China, as the trading, by mainlanders with Hong Kong residency, is done in Hong Kong.

Degen Chain Halts Block Production: What's Next for DEGEN Token?


							

Degen Chain’s halt in block production for over 11 hours raises concerns about its operational stability.



Despite the setback, DEGEN token has shown resilience in its market performance, with a 3.69% increase in the past 24 hours.



Technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest a neutral to bullish sentiment for DEGEN, indicating a potential price recovery.




Wu Blockchain, a crypto news reporter, brought to light that the L3 blockchain Degen Chain has halted block production for more than 11 hours, with the reason behind it still undisclosed. Degen Chain, developed by Syndicate and formerly supported by a16z, operates on Arbitrum Orbit. Degen Chain’s Gas token, DEGEN, serves as the principal currency of Farcaster.







Despite the fallout, the DEGEN token’s market performance remains resilient. DEGEN’s current price is $0.018955, and its 24-hour trading volume exceeds $26 million. This is a 3.69% growth in the last 24 hours. Concurrently, it has fallen 13.61% in the previous seven days. 



Moreover, its market cap stands at $268.77 million, backed by a circulating supply of over 14 billion coins. Investors are closely monitoring the situation, as Degen Chain’s status directly influences DEGEN’s market dynamics.



Analyzing DEGEN’s technical indicators provides insights into its current market sentiment and potential future trends. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour price chart sits at 51.86, signaling a neutral stance among traders.

However, the KST indicator, at 8.1201, indicates that additional investigation is required to determine the stock’s performance trajectory. In addition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator signals a positive trend reversal, providing traders with optimism in the face of uncertainty.



Delving deeper into the price action, DEGEN experienced a volatile start. Witnessing a sharp decline early in the morning, it bottomed out around 7:30 AM. However, the token staged a remarkable recovery after that, steadily climbing for several hours. 



Around 9:00 AM, the pace of recovery accelerated, propelling DEGEN to surpass its initial price, reaching a peak of $0.019 before 11:00 AM. Following the peak, a minor correction ensued, though the price remained significantly higher than both its starting point and the day’s low.

MakerDAO and Aave’s DeFi conflict reopens over DAI’s perceived risk growth

The once-symbiotic relationship between decentralized stablecoin issuer MakerDAO and lending protocol Aave is fraying. As new innovations are being tested within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, tension has started building up. The perceived risk of these innovations puts the two major protocols at a crossroads. At the center of the controversy is a controversial stablecoin mirroring what’s known as a “basis trade” and Maker’s Direct Deposit Dai Module (D3M), Ethena’s USDe.MakerDAO launched its Dai (DAI) token in 2017 as an overcollateralized decentralized stablecoin backed by Ether (ETH). Users had to mint tokens on the MakerDAO platform by locking up ETH. In November 2019, Maker launched multicollateral DAI, allowing DAI to be backed by multiple cryptocurrencies, including centralized stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC).Aave (formerly known as ETHLend) launched around the same time as a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency lending platform and integrated DAI as collateral on its platform from an early stage. Both platforms collaborated throughout the 2021 DeFi boom. The launch of D3M, in cooperation with Aave, allowed Maker to directly interact with its secondary market by actively enforcing a maximum variable borrow rate.Things took a turn during the 2022 bear market as the collapse of then-major DeFi protocols and major cryptocurrency lending firms, as well as the banking crisis that led to the collapse of Credit Suisse, put unprecedented pressure on these protocols.Alarm bells ring as stablecoins depeg The 2022 bear market was marked by a series of bankruptcies and high-profile collapses, starting with the Terra ecosystem in May. Terra collapsed after its algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg.The collapse saw Terra (LUNA), previously a top 10 cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of over $40 billion, become nearly worthless in days as it entered a “death spiral” that led to the minting of trillions of tokens.The collapse of the Terra ecosystem had cascading effects that ultimately led to the collapse of lending platforms Celsius and BlockFi, among others. As a result, MakerDAO voted to temporarily cut off Aave’s D3M in a bid to protect itself.The bear market later saw the centralized stablecoin USDC briefly lose its peg after the now-defunct Silicon Valley Bank collapsed with $3.3 billion of the stablecoin’s reserves held there. The peg was restored only after regulators stepped in to ensure that depositors were made whole.That depeg rang alarm bells for MakerDAO, which shortly after requested an “urgent executive proposal to mitigate risks to the protocol” to address its then over $3.1 billion exposure to USDC. At the time, Maker also moved to eliminate its exposure to Aave, stating its “overall risk-reward of depositing funds into the D3M are not favorable under current conditions.”Speaking to Cointelegraph, Becky Sarwate, head of communications at cryptocurrency exchange Cex.io, said that the decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO) next move was then to purchase real-world assets in the form of U.S. Treasurys to “strengthen market confidence in DAI by bringing the network’s value composition into greater harmony.”Recent: Despite Bitcoin price volatility, factors point to BTC’s long-term successIndeed, real-world assets, including U.S. Treasurys and short-term loans, currently represent a large portion of DAI’s backing, making up 20% of all generated stability fees in March.According to Sarwate, the protocol has since moved to extend its credit back into stablecoins. This decision has worried some market participants, especially given its new exposure to what some deem a risky stablecoin mirroring a hedge fund trade.Tensions rise between MakerDAO and AaveMakerDAO and Aave became more direct competitors over time. In early 2023, MakerDAO introduced Spark Protocol, a fork of Aave’s version 3 that allows users to borrow, lend and stake DAI directly. This fork is linked to Maker’s D3M, effectively offering DAI users an Aave competitor.Later that year, Aave launched GHO, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. It described it as a “decentralized, overcollateralized” asset backed by a “multitude” of digital assets, including Ether — effectively making GHO a competitor to DAI.Market data suggests neither platform was successful enough to threaten its competitor. Spark Protocol currently has around $2.4 billion in total value locked, down from a peak of over $4 billion, while Aave has over $10.6 billion locked on its smart contracts across 12 chains.On the other hand, DAI’s circulating supply is over $5 billion, dwarfing GHO’s near $50 million.The tension between these two protocols surged in early April 2024 after AaveDAO debated limiting the amount of MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin allowed as collateral on its lending platform, potentially completely removing it.While the case was ultimately settled with a loan-to-value reduction of 12%, Aave Chain initiative founder Marc Zeller had proposed to altogether remove DAI as collateral on Aave, which now stands as decentralized finance’s leading lending platform with over $10 billion in total value locked.The smaller-than-expected reduction came after a detailed analysis from Chaos Labs called for a more conservative approach. Cex.io’s Sarwate says:“In many ways, Aave was put in a very difficult position, as on the one hand MakerDAO extended DAI’s line of credit from 100 million to a possible short-term ceiling of 1 billion tokens, which introduces significant risk.”She added that this risk was compounded by the organization’s decision to put some of the newly minted DAI into Ethena’s synthetic dollar USDe. This algorithmic stablecoin has sparked skepticism in the market as it aims to replicate a common hedge fund strategy.Boiling pointMakerDAO’s indirect exposure to USDe, coupled with the extended line of credit, was seemingly a boiling point for the Aave community, with the stablecoin being particularly controversial.Ethena’s USDe essentially takes advantage of price differences between spot and futures markets to generate yield through what’s known as the cash-and-carry trade. It works with a Staked Ether (stETH) position and a corresponding short position on ETH, hedging that exposure to the cryptocurrency.The trade is essentially market neutral and generates yield through the staked ETH and the funding rates perpetual futures contracts charge traders with open positions. This helps align the perpetual futures contract’s price with the underlying cryptocurrency’s spot price.When there’s more buying demand, the funding rate is positive, and those with long positions pay short sellers, while when supply outstrips demand, the opposite happens. Since Ethena’s launch, funding rates have mostly been positive, allowing USDe holders to earn double-digit yields through what has been a “delta neutral” trade.Critics, however, have argued that the stablecoin can become under-collateralized during a cryptocurrency bear market in which the price of perpetual ETH futures contracts drops below the spot price of ETH, which would turn funding rates against USDe holders.The founder of decentralized finance protocol Yearn.finance, Andre Cronje, has suggested on social media that things are now going well and funding rates are positive, but he added that “eventually that turns, funding becomes negative, margin/collateral gets liquidated, and you have an unbacked asset.”Cronje noted other risks, including external risks related to the oracle used to keep stETH pegged to ETH, exchange custody risks and potential spread risks. Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute, mentioned on social media platform X that key risks were related to execution and custody.Sarwate said, “If USDe were to go into freefall, it could push DAI toward a similar tipping point.” She added: “On the other hand, Aave choosing to remove DAI completely could run the risk of exacerbating such potential underlying conditions. When not approached thoughtfully, delistings can be turbulent and fracture communities that once enjoyed a freer range of motion.”John Lo, a former key contributor at popular decentralized exchange SushiSwap and now head of digital assets at cryptocurrency fund Recharge Capital, told Cointelegraph that Aave’s move to reduce the loan-to-value ratio was prudent but noted that “removing DAI as collateral completely would be extreme.”Lo called for more research on the limits of the D3M module and “its ability to be utilized as a flash loan vector — as rapidly inflating the price on any oracles poses a risk to all lending protocols.” Flash loans are loans taken and repaid within a single transaction.He said the risk of flash loans being used to manipulate oracles to mint more tokens should always be evaluated. The minting of tokens — as mentioned above — was part of Terra’s death spiral.The ghost of stablecoin’s pastOn Aave’s proposal to drop the loan-to-value for DAI, Aave Chan founder Mark Zeller references the Aave protocol’s “previous experience” with the “consequences of reckless minting policies” on a smaller scale, such as that of Angle’s agEUR, a stablecoin pegged to the euro minted into Euler that was hacked within a week.Lo said Ethena’s USDe stablecoin is “centralized, and therefore, there exists a slight security risk in the ability to mint more USDe at will,” a risk that could be “potentially offset by USDe’s reputational constraints.” He added that the most important risk was cascading liquidations and slippage incurred from growing redemptions in a bank run scenario.He explained that runaway redemptions during low or negative funding rates “would force exists from short perpetual future positions,” and slippage could be incurred “at size if ETH and BTC prices are increasing during that time.” On top of that, Lo added that slippage incurred on selling staked ETH over low liquidity should also be considered, as even a 5% decrease in a stablecoin’s net asset value “is enough to trigger a crisis in confidence.”Cex.io’s Sarwate commented that to some in the cryptocurrency space, “USDe’s yield structure raises specters of stablecoin’s past” and pointed out that USDe’s popularity is but one of the factors at play“This is leading some critics to recall the old adage about the downstream effects of burning twice as bright should the network’s delicate balance start to wobble. While high returns can be cause for excitement, negative effects could domino across all vested chains if conditions on the core asset falter,” she added.Lo, on the other hand, revealed he doesn’t believe USDe poses “unique risks to DeFi,” as it is a “size-constrained tokenized delta neutral strategy that has been commonly deployed by funds.”According to Lo, various similar tokenized projects should start appearing in the future, and a larger question to ask is whether USDe itself will continue to be attractive for users once perpetual funding rates fall and potentially turn negative, which could affect USDe’s on-chain liquidity. “Many tokens and stablecoin have low liquidity on-chain, and the risk that arises in that scenario is economic exploits, in particular, oracle price manipulation as a result; however, I don’t believe these would cause systemic risks in the way Luna and its UST mechanism functioned,” he said.Nevertheless, the former SushiSwap contributor saw a silver lining in the rising tensions between both protocols and the controversy surrounding USDe, noting that the discussions and attention on these issues are getting “shows governance at DAI is alive and well and most importantly widely known.”Recent: Blockchain adoption in healthcare faces serious obstacles in GermanyTo him, this activity should be seen as the “number one signal of confidence in a decentralized protocol,” and while mitigations will ultimately be implemented, one can ask how much in governance “is related to security and how much is to prevent competition for established incumbents.”What’s “generally lacking in crypto,” he said, are “consolidated independent reviews of collateral risks and asset risk,” something he believes the ecosystem would greatly benefit from.MakerDAO and Aave’s latest spat was seemingly resolved with Chaos Labs’ analysis of DAI for the Aave DAO, leading to the 12% loan-to-value reduction. On social media, Zeller concluded the matter with a simple “DAI stays in Aave, we move on. Onwards.”Whether Ethena’s USDe will ultimately collapse, fall behind competition or suffer some other fate is unclear, but with the presence of Spark Protocol and Aave’s GHO, what is likely is that these two protocols will eventually bump into each other down the road again.

Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week? - Benzinga

Bitcoin BTC/USD is carefully maintaining the $60,000 support level, navigating a delicate balance between bullish optimism and bearish caution.What Happened: This week, as traditional financial sessions commence, Bitcoin remains anchored in a familiar range, yet poised for potential volatility influenced by impending U.S. macroeconomic data and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Market analysts are closely monitoring Bitcoin's performance, particularly the stability around the $60,000 mark, which has been sustained since early May. Mark Cullen, a noted analyst, emphasized the significance of this level, stating, “Bitcoin still holding above 60k and the down trend break. That blue OB is going to be the key in the short term, lose it & we revisit the lows & likely much lower. Hold and another leg to take liquidity above the highs at 64-67k is likely.”This precarious balance comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market could be influenced by several macroeconomic triggers. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on May 14 is anticipated to be a critical indicator for Bitcoin's immediate financial trajectory. “If CPI inflation rises again this week, it will mark the third STRAIGHT monthly increase,” noted The Kobeissi Letter in a post, underscoring a bustling week ahead.Further adding to the intrigue, Powell is scheduled to speak on economic issues in Amsterdam, which could provide further cues to the market. Cryptocurrency markets have historically shown heightened sensitivity to Powell’s tone, particularly as it relates to future policy directions.Simultaneously, seasoned Bitcoin holders are demonstrating patterns reminiscent of the 2021 bull market, choosing to increase their holdings amid lower prices, potentially to capitalize on future market highs.Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $62,897, up 3% over the past 24 hours.Also Read: How Much Did Donald Trump’s Crypto Portfolio Pump After He Said He’s ‘Fine With It’?Why It Matters: This cyclical behavior underscores a broader trend of growing long-term holder influence over Bitcoin’s available supply, which could have long-term implications for the market’s structure.In the derivatives markets, neutrality prevails with funding rates remaining balanced, suggesting that the market is in a state of watchful waiting. This sentiment is echoed in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which oscillates between fear and greed, indicating a market that is collectively unsure about the direction of the next big move.What’s Next: As Nov. 19 approaches, the insights from Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event will be crucial in potentially clarifying the path forward for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market, providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between macroeconomic policies and digital asset valuations.Read Next: Donald Trump Says ‘You Better Vote’ For Him If You’re Pro-Crypto: But Has He Always Been ‘Fine With It’?Image: Shutterstock

Digital Asset Investment Products Witness Inflows After 5 Weeks Of Decline - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Digital asset investment products break a five-week streak of outflows, attracting $130 million globally.



Despite the influx, ETP volumes declined to $8 billion, notably in the US, where Grayscale sees its lowest outflows since January.



Bitcoin sees a resurgence with $144 million in inflows, but Ethereum faces uncertainty as US regulators’ lack of action on spot Ethereum ETFs sparks speculation.




In a notable turn of events, digital asset investment products have recorded inflows for the first time in five weeks, amassing a total of $130 million. 





Digital Asset Investment Products Break Outflow Trend



However, despite this positive uptick, Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) volumes continued their descent, with a weekly figure of $8 billion, notably lower than April’s average ofS$17 billion. This decline underscores a waning participation of ETP investors in the crypto ecosystem, constituting only 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges, down from 31% the previous month.



The United States emerged as a key player in digital asset investment products, witnessing the lion’s share of inflows at $135 million. Notably, Grayscale, a prominent incumbent, experienced its lowest weekly outflows since January, amounting to $171 million. Meanwhile, Switzerland saw inflows totaling $14 million.



Contrary to previous weeks, Hong Kong experienced a significant drop in inflows, with just $19 million recorded, signaling that the surge in inflows following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs may have been largely driven by seed capital. On the other hand, Canada and Germany continued to grapple with outflows, totaling $20 million and $15 million, respectively, bringing their year-to-date outflows to a combined $660 million.




Bitcoin Resurgence Amid Ethereum Uncertainty



Bitcoin itself saw an encouraging influx of $144 million, reclaiming lost ground from what had been a lackluster month. Conversely, short-Bitcoin ETPs witnessed outflows totaling $5.1 million, continuing a trend of outflows over the past 8 weeks amounting to $18 million.



Moreover, the subdued response from US regulators regarding spot Ethereum ETF applications has fueled speculation about delayed approvals, potentially contributing to Ethereum-related outflows totaling $14 million last week.

El Salvador Bitcoin Tracker Spearheads Govt Transparency - DailyCoin


        El Salvador stunned the world in 2021 by becoming the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. This decision exposed President Nayib Bukele to criticism from economists, global institutions, and political opponents. Despite the backlash, Bukele continues to double down on making his country a beacon for Bitcoin adoption.
The Central American country has amassed a sovereign Bitcoin reserve of around 6,000 BTC through direct buys, mining revenue, and its residency program. To boost transparency around these holdings, the government recently launched an on-chain tracker documenting the wallet flows.Opting for Bitcoin TransparencyEl Salvador, in conjunction with Mempool, has launched an on-chain tracker showing real-time visibility into the nation’s Bitcoin holdings. The details show El Salvador is currently holding 5,749 BTC, valued at around $362.8 million based on the price at the time of writing.The most recent transactions consist of daily purchases of 1 BTC, in line with Bukele’s pledge to buy one Bitcoin every day from November 18, 2022. According to nayibtracker.com, El Salvador’s dollar cost average buy price is $43,098 per coin, equating to an unrealized profit of $114.8 million.The recent upturn in Bitcoin’s price in the run-up to the approval of US spot Bitcoin ETFs pushed El Salvador’s Bitcoin investment into profitable territory. This was met with an impassioned celebration from Bukele, who clapped back at critics who had slammed his radical approach to government.
Bukele’s unorthodox governing style has been highly polarizing, particularly regarding the country’s crackdown on suspected gang members and what this means for human rights in El Salvador. However, Bukele has also earned plaudits from those who believe other governments worldwide should take cues from his playbook, especially on Bitcoin and publicly tracking holdings.El Salvador Leading the WayIn support of El Salvador’s move to publicly track Bitcoin holdings, the Lightning Network X account stated, “One day residents of every country will demand full financial transparency of their governments.” With billions being sent to Ukraine and Israel, when many are suffering economic hardship at home, the issue of government overspending and the lack of transparency around public spending has become a political hot potato.Commenting on this, Being Libertarian warned that things will not improve domestically until the funding of conflicts stops. Being Libertarian called for an audit of the Fed and for followers to support politicians who “get this.”Meanwhile, in response to the arrest of El Salvdaor’s presidential commissioner for strategic projects over bribery allegations, Bukele declared that his entire executive branch would be investigated for corruption. Bukele stated, “I want to be remembered as the President who didn’t steal and didn’t let anyone else steal either.”On the Flipside
Bitcoin adoption among everyday Salvadorians is low, mainly due to fear of losing value on downside moves.



El Salvador’s unrealized BTC gains can potentially disappear overnight.



The exception stock trading performance of some US politicians has become a meme at this point.
Why This MattersBy voluntarily exposing its Bitcoin holdings to public scrutiny, El Salvador is pioneering a new frontier of financial transparency and accountability that is lacking in governments worldwide. This sets a refreshing precedent in an era marred by widespread financial corruption.El Salvador attempts to lure highly skilled workers with citizenship offer.Bitcoin Pioneer El Salvador Is Offering 5,000 Free PassportsCongressman Emmer supports bills for SEC reform.SEC’s Gensler Under Fire as Emmer Launches Crypto Defense

Japanese Cryptocurrency Company Announces That It Accepts Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Metaplanet, a major crypto investment and advisory firm operating in Tokyo, has made a strategic decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, marking a significant move amid the economic challenges facing Japan.
Japan's Metaplanet Accepts Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Amid Yen Declining Environment
In an announcement on Monday, the company cited Japan's ongoing economic woes, including high government debt levels, prolonged periods of negative real interest rates and the resulting weakness of the Yen, as the primary motivation for Bitcoin adoption.


Japan, which has the highest government debt/GDP ratio among developed countries at 254.6%, is currently grappling with significant economic challenges, as reported by the International Monetary Fund.
Despite the government's efforts to address economic woes, including its decision to raise interest rates in March, the Yen has fallen to its lowest level in 34 years, according to Reuters.






Explaining its rationale, Metaplanet emphasized Bitcoin's role as a “non-sovereign store of value” that is resilient to fiat currencies.
The company emphasized Bitcoin's distinct monetary policy, which is immutable and finite, with its maximum supply capped at 21 million coins, unlike traditional fiat currencies and other cryptocurrencies subject to central control.


“Bitcoin's monetary policy is rigidly set in stone until 2140, distinguishing it from both monetary metals and rival crypto projects operated at the whims of centralized developer teams,” Metaplanet said.
Additionally, the company has taken a strategic approach to asset management, revealing its intention to leverage the “full spectrum” of capital markets instruments to strengthen its Bitcoin reserves.





According to data from Bitcointreasuries.net, as of May 10, Metaplanet reportedly held 117.7 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $7.2 million.

Solana (SOL) Skyrockets 1,966% in Fund Flows: Is Solana ETF Possibility?


As became known, Solana (SOL) has experienced an unprecedented surge of 1,966% in fund inflows in the past week, firmly establishing itself as a standout leader in alternative cryptocurrency-focused investment products over the past week. According to the latest report from CoinShares, a substantial $5.9 million was directed toward SOL-related products within this short time frame. This surge not only reaffirms SOL's dominance but also marks a nearly twenty-fold increase in inflows into Solana ETPs, totaling an impressive $17 million since the beginning of the year.Contrary to this notable uptrend in SOL, the broader market landscape paints a different picture. While investment products for digital assets witnessed a commendable $130 million inflow, volumes for ETPs experienced a significant decline, dropping from April's $17 billion to $8 billion. Source: CoinSharesThis trend suggests a diminishing involvement of ETP investors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, now constituting only 22% of the total volume on global reputable exchanges.When Solana ETF?Amid growing interest from traditional investors in SOL, speculation arises regarding the feasibility of a Solana ETF. However, the potential for such an ETF is closely tied to the fate of the Ethereum ETF. With it facing regulatory obstacles, the path to a Solana ETF appears equally challenging. Notably, regulatory ambiguity surrounds Ethereum ETF status, with the SEC's classification of SOL as an unregistered security in last year's case against the Kraken exchange adding to the uncertainty.As investors await clarity on the ETF front, the prospect of a Solana ETF remains speculative, contingent upon regulatory developments and the resolution of Ethereum's ETF dilemma.

Europe's Crypto Rise: Insights from CME Group's Payal Shah | Cryptoglobe


                                
Payal Shah from CME Group highlights the significant role European investors play in the global cryptocurrency landscape. Europe, comprising Central, Northern, and Western regions, now stands as the world’s second-largest crypto economy, trailing only North America. 



Payal Shah is a key figure at CME Group where she serves as the Director of Equity and Cryptocurrency Product Development. She is deeply involved in leading the creation of innovative products across various markets, including crypto, equity, and alternative investments. 



In a recent opinion piece published in The Wall Stree Journal (WSJ), Shah points out that from July 2022 to June 2023, Europe was responsible for 17.6% of the global cryptocurrency transactions as detailed in Chainalysis’s 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.



Shah suggests that Europe’s enhanced position in the crypto sphere is primarily due to the stringent regulatory climates in Asia and the ongoing regulatory hurdles in the U.S., which have indirectly favored the European markets. She explains that the eurozone’s relatively lenient regulatory environment makes it a conducive hub for crypto-related activities, noting the euro’s status as the second most traded fiat currency in crypto transactions after the U.S. dollar. According to Shah, the shift of trading volumes from Asia, particularly after stringent bans in places like China, has benefited the European markets.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Shah emphasizes that for institutional adoption of assets, ample liquidity is essential, and European markets are well-positioned in this regard. She observes that European institutions have broad access to diverse crypto financial instruments such as ETFs, ETNs, and a variety of derivatives, bolstered by strong support from European exchanges that have expanded through substantial funding and global outreach.



Moreover, Shah points out that decentralized finance (DeFi) has become particularly attractive in Europe, where it represents the majority of the cryptocurrency value received. She describes how, in a low to negative interest rate environment, European institutions are increasingly drawn to DeFi platforms as viable alternatives for securing better yields, leveraging the technological advances that DeFi offers.



Finally, Shah comments on the technological proficiency of European financial institutions, which she believes have historically prioritized IT infrastructure more than their U.S. counterparts. This technological edge, Shah notes, has accelerated the adoption of blockchain and crypto technologies within the European financial sector. She adds that numerous European banks and exchanges are actively exploring both centralized and decentralized blockchain applications, anticipating a blend of traditional and digital asset trading in the near future.



In her closing remarks, Shah underscores that as the eurozone’s economy progresses, the importance of tailored risk management tools, such as CME Group’s euro-denominated futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ether, will grow, highlighting these tools’ roles in managing exposure to cryptocurrencies and strengthening Europe’s stance as a dominant force in the global crypto market.

What is phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) and how to defend against it?

                            Phishing and phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS), explained                                        Phishing is a prevalent hack that aims to trick people into disclosing private information, including credit card numbers, passwords and personal identities. A staggering 300,497 phishing cases were reported to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2022 alone. These attacks resulted in victims losing over $52 million. Usually, it entails sending phony emails that seem authentic, duping recipients into opening harmful links or requesting sensitive information. Phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) is an alarming development in the world of cybercrime. With the use of a subscription-based web service called PhaaS, even non-technical criminals may easily execute complex phishing attacks. These firms offer pre-made phishing kits, editable templates and server infrastructure to create fake web pages.A cybercriminal may, for instance, sign up for a PhaaS platform, create an email template that seems like it comes from a respectable crypto exchange, and distribute it to thousands of possible recipients. A link to a fake login page intended to steal users’ credentials might be included in the email. Cybercriminals may swiftly launch extensive phishing campaigns with PhaaS, posing a greater threat to both individuals and enterprises. The accessibility of PhaaS reduces the entrance barrier for cybercrime, which is a major worry for internet consumers and cybersecurity experts globally.                                                                    How PhaaS works                                        PhaaS makes it easier for fraudsters to start phishing attacks by giving them access to extensive toolkits and infrastructure. It operates as follows:PhaaS kitsPre-packaged phishing kits with all the tools, infrastructure and templates needed to carry out phishing attacks are available from PhaaS suppliers. Email templates, fictitious login pages, domain registration services and hosting infrastructure are all included in these kits.CustomizationThe degree of customization offered by various PhaaS systems varies. Phishing emails, websites and domains may all be altered by con artists to look genuine and trustworthy. Phishing campaigns can be customized to target particular people, businesses or sectors.TargetingPhishing attacks made possible by PhaaS are getting more complex. Cybercriminals have the ability to design highly targeted advertising campaigns that imitate the branding and communication strategies of reputable companies and their offerings. Attackers can create persuasive communications that have a higher chance of tricking recipients by utilizing personal information gleaned from social media, data breaches and other sources.For instance, attackers often pose as support staff from popular wallets, exchanges or projects on social media (Telegram, Discord, Twitter, etc.). They offer help and trick users via false claims of giveaways or airdrops into giving up private keys or seed phrases or establishing connections with compromised wallets to siphon off their funds.                                                                    Dangers of PhaaS                                        PhaaS has dramatically reduced the entry barrier for hackers, which has resulted in a discernible rise in the quantity and sophistication of phishing attempts.Even those with no technical experience can simply launch complex phishing attacks with PhaaS using pre-packaged toolkits, customizable templates and the hosting infrastructure offered by PhaaS providers.The possibility of suffering a large financial loss is the main risk associated with PhaaS. The goal of phishing scams is to obtain users’ private keys, seed phrases or login credentials. These can be used to access their accounts and drain their cryptocurrency wallets for nefarious purposes. For instance, attackers altered BadgerDAO’s front-end in 2021 after fooling users into providing permissions that let their money be drained.PhaaS attacks have the potential to undermine confidence in the crypto community. Scams that are successful can discourage people from using even reputable projects and services, which prevents widespread adoption. These attacks are especially vulnerable to novice cryptocurrency users. They can be more susceptible to falling for social media impersonations or websites that look authentic because they lack experience.Phishing attacks are getting more and more complex; they frequently use social engineering strategies and imitate genuine platforms. This makes it challenging for even experienced users to recognize. PhaaS is not just for large-scale email campaigns. Spear-phishing attacks are directed at well-known people or companies in the cryptocurrency industry. Such attacks use personalized information to trick specific individuals or organizations into giving up sensitive data or taking actions that lead to financial loss or security breaches.                                                                    How to defend against PhaaS                                        An ideal way to protect against PhaaS is to practice constant vigilance: Double-check everything (URLs, sender addresses), never click unsolicited links, and never share your private keys or seed phrases.Multilayered security approach and technical defensesInstall firewalls, network monitoring tools, endpoint security and robust email filtering. These technological safeguards aid in the identification and blocking of risky attachments, phishing emails and questionable network activity.User awareness trainingTeach staff members on a regular basis how to spot and report phishing attempts. Inform them of the typical signs of phishing attempts. This entails instructing people to examine sender addresses closely, determine the urgency of messages, stay away from dubious links, and desist from sending private information over email.Security policiesImplement security measures like best practices for passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA).

The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community has been put on high alert following a crucial warning regarding airdrops. The warning comes in response to a series of deceptive airdrop offers that have been circulating online, particularly targeting the SHIB community.Airdrops, typically used as a promotional tool to distribute new tokens, have become a hotbed for scams. Fraudsters have been exploiting the excitement around these events to phish for personal information and gain access to digital wallets.In light of this, ShibArmy Scam Alerts @susbarium, an X handle dedicated to exposing scams and protecting the Shiba Inu community, has issued a warning emphasizing the importance of staying informed and cautious when participating in airdrops.  According to Susbarium, it is crucial to stay vigilant against potential risks while navigating the crypto space. One such risk arises with the temptation to participate in airdrops. While these events promise free tokens or coins, many are fronts for scams, putting one's crypto assets at risk. "ShibArmy Scam Alerts" call for the SHIB community to remain cautious and united in the face of fraudulent airdrop offers, safeguarding their investments and personal information.As earlier reported, scammers have been creating fake profiles and channels, impersonating legitimate Shiba Inu forums on platforms like X (Twitter) and Telegram, with these fraudulent activities leading to financial losses for individuals.Shib Army Scam Alerts flags one of such fake accounts impersonating the k9 finance Dao, promoting a fake KNINE token distribution. Against this backdrop, it's essential for Shiba Inu community members to verify the authenticity of any airdrop offers and to be wary of sharing personal information or connecting wallets to unfamiliar platforms.  The recent warning is a stark reminder of the risks associated with the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency. As the SHIB community continues to grow, so does the importance of maintaining a vigilant stance against potential threats. By staying alert and informed, Shiba Inu holders would be protected as well as the integrity of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

Changpeng Zhao has 'nothing else to do' during jail time so may write a book


Jailed former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao says he may use his upcoming four months of ‘quiet time’ to write a book on his tenure as the leader of the world’s biggest crypto exchange.
Zhao tweeted on Sunday that he’s considering embarking on a literary career after a Binance supporter said they were “Waiting for the CZ book, the book for crypto upcoming leaders.”
“I got some ‘quiet time’ coming up. Will use that to write something,” the disgraced exchange boss replied.

Zhao received a four-month prison sentence last month after pleading guilty in the US to several charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Prosecutors recommended he receive a three-year sentence while Zhao’s defense pushed for zero jail time.  
In response to another user, Zhao said that he’s “Got nothing else to do.” Indeed, it appears that Zhao will need to find something to occupy the entire four months as, due to sentencing laws, he’ll likely be required to serve his entire sentence.
Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu also received four months in prison after he tried to flee the country, violating a court order. He described his time in jail as an ‘enjoyable experience overall’ and said “I think it’s definitely good for you.“

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also received a relatively small sentence of just six months house arrest after failing to implement anti-money laundering protocols in the operation of his exchange. FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried, on the other hand, received a far heftier 25-year prison sentence for his high-profile crimes.  
During his prison stay, Zhao will also have time to work on his ‘Giggle Academy,’ a recently-announced ‘platform for online education for underprivileged kids.’

CEO Seat Changed in Popular Altcoin, Was the Price Affected? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Antonio Juliano, founder of decentralized cryptocurrency exchange dYdX, announced that he has resigned as CEO of the parent company.
Stating that he has resigned as dYdX CEO in a blog post, Antonio Juliano stated that he will continue to be president of dYdX Trading.



“I will always be the leader of dYdX. I have no idea what will happen next for me.
We have achieved a lot, but we have not yet achieved our goals. There is more to be done and many more years to build it. I look at what we've been building for decades. dYdX is a long-term play and we will not stop.
I too have come a long way on this journey. Since founding dYdX on my own at the age of 24, I feel like I have been gifted a lifetime of adventure and growth. Chris Dixon once told me that “founding is an emotional challenge disguised as an intellectual challenge.” Now I've lived it and I know it's true.
dYdX gave me a rollercoaster of intense experiences ranging from fear to excitement, from joy to loneliness.
But now it's time to step down as CEO. Over time, I realized that I didn't actually need to run my own company. I am the founder of dYdX and always will be. I also became the CEO, as most founders find themselves doing. But I discovered that these are two different roles.”

It was seen that there was no change in the DYDX price after this news.

Tesla, Ford, GM Gain After Reports that US Will Hike Chinese EV Tariffs to 102.5% - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



According to Bloomberg, President Joe Biden will announce a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese goods, focusing on electric vehicles (EVs) and related sectors. The move has drawn criticism from former President Donald Trump and sparked a response in U.S. auto stocks, with Ford (NYSE: F), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and General Motors (NYSE: GM) seeing gains over the trading session today.



US to Increase Tariffs on Chinese EVs to 102.5%: Report



Under the new measures, tariffs on Chinese EVs can rise from 27.5% to 102.5%. Other sectors, including batteries, solar cells, steel, and aluminum, will also see tariff hikes, though specific rates will vary. The Biden administration has framed these actions as a defense of American workers and an effort to protect the U.S. market from subsidized Chinese goods.



During a recent campaign rally, former President Donald Trump criticized Biden’s tariff increases, arguing that such measures should have been implemented years ago. He also pointed out a potential loophole involving Chinese companies building cars in Mexico to bypass U.S. tariffs under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).



“I will put a 200% tax on every car that comes in from those plants, and they’re not going to do that,” Trump said. He reiterated his call for a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, which the Biden administration has avoided, likely due to concerns about fueling inflation.





US Auto Stocks Rise After the News



Following the news, U.S. auto stocks experienced significant gains. Tesla Inc., trading at $173.99, saw a 3.27% increase, although its year-to-date performance remains down by 29.91%. Despite recent challenges, Tesla’s market cap remains substantial at approximately $555.654 billion.



Ford Motor Company’s stock price increased by 3.06% to $12.36, with a year-to-date performance up by 5.54%. In response to changing trade policies, the company has been adjusting its executive team and focusing on expanding its electric vehicle lineup.



General Motors Company experienced a 3.42% increase, with its stock price reaching $45.90. The company’s year-to-date performance is significantly positive, with a 28.15% increase. GM’s strategy includes ending production of specific traditional models like the Chevy Malibu and pivoting more towards electric vehicles, which could benefit from the changing tariff landscape.







Would this move benefit US-based EV firms like Tesla in the long run? Let us know in the comments below.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is advancing its network push as its latest partner, K9 DAO, has made an important network announcement. The digital currency project has now landed K9 as a top validator with a focus on the PuppyNet testnet.Shiba Inu and security boostShiba Inu started as a meme coin, however, it has evolved in the past year to become a highly watched proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. Through Shibarium, the project is looking to revolutionize the smart contracts ecosystem on Ethereum. As shared earlier by the project, it onboarded K9 Finance DAO as one of its validators. The launch of a validator on PuppyNet marks one of the first attempts by K9 to contribute actively to Shiba Inu’s security.  PuppyNet is a testing ground for the Shibarium protocol. It helps developers to validate the functionality of updates, products and any innovation they want to upload on the mainnet. Per the update shared, running the validator is a mutually beneficial update for both Shiba Inu and K9 Finance DAO.While K9 will help keep Shiba Inu secured, the massive SHIB community will also give enhanced visibility to the K9 project. Overall, K9 Finance will be able to distribute BONE rewards to KNINE holders, returning value to its native supporters.Shiba Inu and strategic partnershipsShiba Inu is touted as a major project that can establish itself as a top 10 token. Thus far, the project has maintained its building strategy. At the moment, it has inked strategic partnerships with Bad Idea AI to bring AI capabilities into the ecosystem.It remains unknown what the roadmap for this partnership is; however, the protocol has expanded its influence with a linkup with SBI VC Trade, a firm that is driving SHIB adoption through community-driven products and incentive products.Amid this growing ecosystem of partners, the community is cautioned to stay vigilant for scammers, who might take advantage of the trend.

This Week's Agenda in Bitcoin and Altcoins: US Inflation Data! While Inflation Remains Strong, Famous US CEOs Lost Hope on the FED! - Bitcoin Sistemi

As we enter an important week where critical data for Bitcoin and altcoins will be announced, US CPI and PPI data will be announced this week.
Apart from these data, the statements of FED President Jerome Powell and many FED members will also be followed in crypto money and global markets.


While the predictions in the market are for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to remain strong in April; Inflation remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% annual target in the first half of this year, even as higher interest rates dragged it down.
FED officials generally state that it is too early to reduce interest rates and that inflation is still well above the 2% target.





At this point, while expectations for the FED's interest rate cut have decreased since the beginning of 2024, a leading commentary platform, The Kobeissi Letter, stated in its latest assessment that the general expectation is that the CPI will remain high and said, “If the CPI rises again this week, this will indicate the third consecutive monthly increase.” ” said.
The Kobeissi Letter also included the thoughts of the CEOs of leading US companies about the possibility of a rate cut by the FED.


Stating that according to the April Conference Board CEO Confidence survey, the majority of US CEOs expect the FED to cut interest rates only once this year, Kobeissi said, “31% of the 136 CEOs who participated in the survey said they do not expect any interest rate cuts this year; % “26 of them said they expected only two interest rate cuts,” he said.

“38% of famous CEOs expect only one interest rate cut in 2024, while markets are pricing in only 2 interest rate cuts this year, the first of which will be in September.
“The markets dropped from the expectation of 6 interest rate cuts in 2024 to the expectation of 1 or at most 2 interest rate cuts in just 4 months.”

Finally, according to CME FEDWatch, the probability of the FED reducing interest rates in September is priced at 49.6 percent, while the inflation data to be announced on Tuesday and Wednesday this week is expected to have an impact on asset prices such as BTC.

Bitcoin whales hold steady amid short-term holder sell-off: Bitfinex - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders are behind the recent pullbacks in price, as the negative economic indicators from the US and cautious Federal Reserve statements make them panic, according to the “Bitfinex Alpha” report latest edition. Short-term Bitcoin holders are investors who have held their positions for less than 155 days.Despite the sell-off by short-term holders, on-chain data reveals that long-term holders are not following suit. The “Long-Term Holder Spending Binary Indicator” indicates that these investors have maintained their positions, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics and a possible resolution to the upside for Bitcoin’s price range.Image: Bitfinex/CryptoQuantAmidst this trading behavior, the Bitcoin network has surpassed one billion transactions, highlighting its foundational strength and potential for future value appreciation.The decrease in mining difficulty presents an opportunity for miners to stabilize the network’s hash power and reduce the need to sell mined Bitcoin for operational costs. This is further supported by the commitment of long-term holders, who are demonstrating confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value.Bitcoin’s network fundamentals remain robust, with over 625,000 on-chain transactions recorded on May 6th alone. The network’s ability to handle a high volume of transactions showcases its scalability and security. As the network continues to grow, the challenge will be to scale efficiently to accommodate a larger user base.Image: Bitfinex/BitinfochartsThe recent 6% reduction in mining difficulty is one of the most significant developments, offering relief to miners post-halving. This adjustment allows remaining miners to earn more Bitcoin with the same computational effort.Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced significant volatility, reflecting mixed investor sentiment towards the asset. Last week, Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows, while Ethereum ETFs experienced net outflows, with the BTC price reflecting some of this sentiment.

Crypto investment products see first inflows in over a month - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Digital assets investment products saw $130 million in inflows, the first after four weeks of outflows.
Bitcoin remains above $62k and saw inflows of $144 million this past week.

As Bitcoin shows fresh resilience above $62,000, latest market data reveals that digital asset investment products recorded inflows for the first time in over a month last week.
On Monday, digital assets manager CoinShares published its weekly report on crypto investment products. 
The details showed the industry saw $130 million in inflows for the week ending May 10. It’s the first time the metric reads positive since the first week of April – a run of four weeks of outflows.

Notably, Bitcoin saw inflows of $144 million, while short-Bitcoin ETPs recorded outflows of $5.1 million.
The majority of the inflows were seen in the US, with $135 million. Hong Kong saw $19 million in inflows. Elsewhere, Canada and Germany recorded outflows of $20 million and $15 million respectively.
ETP volumes remain low
While the week saw inflows overall, CoinShares’s head of research James Butterfill wrote in the company blog that ETP volumes have continued to decline.
For instance, the market saw ETP volumes of $8 billion last week, while it averaged $17 billion in April.
“These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges relative to 31% last month,” Butterfill noted.

Brad Garlinghouse Sees SEC Losing Against Crypto in the Long Run, Calls Enforcement Actions ‘Speed Bumps’ - The Daily Hodl


								The chief executive of Ripple Labs says that he sees the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) losing its battle against crypto in the long term.
In a new interview on the World Class podcast, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says that in the grand scheme of things, the SEC’s anti-crypto stances and enforcement actions don’t mean much.










“They’re going to lose in the long run. If you look at the continued growth of crypto as a multi-decade arc of time, this is nothing. It’s a speed bump because I’m so optimistic about what the future of crypto looks like. We’ll look back in 20 years and be like ‘God, that sucked. But you know what, little bump.’
 In my opinion, the market will be measured in many, many, many, many trillions, it will change the way many, many transactions work because it’s a way to reduce friction, reduce cost, [and] make things more efficient. It’s going to win in the long run, the best technology usually wins in the long run.”
Garlinghouse goes on to say that the crypto industry thriving is set in stone because even one of the best-managed fiat currencies – the US dollar – is losing its purchasing power over time.
“It’s inevitable. Right now, we’re talking about a $2.5 trillion [crypto market cap]. Look do I think this is an easy 10x over the next five to 10 years? Yeah, no problem…that feels safe.”

Mysterious Trader Breaks His Three-Year Silence, His Post Increases the Prices of Two Altcoins at Once! One Lucky Investor Made 32X Profit! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Keith Gill, the stock trader and analyst known on social media as “The Roaring Kitty” and who largely fueled the GameStop frenzy in late 2020, has signaled his return to the markets after three years of silence.
While the financial analyst nicknamed “The Roaring Kitty” shared from his X account after a long break, a Solana-based meme token experienced a significant rise after this post.


Although there is no clear statement about Keith Gill's return, his post increased speculation about Gill's return. At this point, the price of Roaring Kitty (KITTY), a Solana-based meme token, has increased by more than 6000%.
This increase in KITTY allowed one lucky investor to make a 32x profit. According to Lookonchain's post, before Keith Gill's post, this investor spent 21.1 SOL (worth 3 thousand dollars) to buy 17.4 million KITTY.





While the price of KITTY increased after Gill's post, the investor sold for 41 thousand dollars and still holds KITTY, whose approximate value is 56 thousand dollars.

“Memecoin KITTY increased by over 6000% after TheRoaringKitty shared on Twitter.
One lucky guy spent 21.1 SOL ($3k worth) to buy 17.4 million KITTY before TheRoaringKitty tweeted.
After KITTY rose, he sold 12.8 million KITTY for 294 SOL (worth $41k), leaving 4.6 million KITTY (worth $56k).
Profit $94k (32x)!”

After Keith Gill's post on At this point, the GME price has increased by 158% in the last 24 hours.

Paolo Ardoino flexes 'top-tier custodians' in Tether v. Ripple stablecoin beef


Ripple chief exec Brad Garlinghouse recently expressed his view via the World Class podcast that the “US Government is going after Tether” before emphasizing how important it is to the ecosystem.
This comment received a response from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino on X (formerly Twitter), who attributed the comments from Garlinghouse to “An uniformed [sic] CEO, leading a company being investigated by the SEC, launching a competitive stablecoin (cui prodest).” 
Ripple announced last month that it intended to launch a US dollar-pegged stablecoin.
In his lengthy tweet, Ardoino also emphasized that Tether has “proved over time to have… top-tier custodians and profound compliance.”

For context re these ‘top-tier custodians,’ Tether once gave nearly a billion dollars of commingled client and corporate funds to an unlicensed money transmitter accused of money laundering for the cartels without even signing a contract.
Additionally, when considering Tether’s profound compliance, it’s important to note that it has previously settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over allegations that it failed to maintain advertised reserves, issued tethers against funds it hadn’t received, and used bank accounts of Tether associates to send and receive funds related to Tether.
Ardoino additionally emphasized that Tether had “onboarded the FBI and USSS for reissuances” and has worked “with 124 law enforcement agencies” over “198 requests from law enforcement to block wallets.” 
He also drew further comparisons between his firm and other stablecoins, pointing out that Tether “cooperates directly with law enforcement agencies, while other stablecoins, although they claim to be ‘more compliant’ they require a judge order, allowing hackers, scammers, and criminals a long time to move funds around.”
Ripple isn’t the only stablecoin issuer who has implied that Tether is among the targets of law enforcement. Indeed, Dante Disparte of Circle accused Tether of “counterfeiting the US dollar.”

SHIB Rebounds Despite Coinbase Getting 100B SHIB Coin Dump - DailyCoin


        
Top American crypto exchange Coinbase gets injected with 100B SHIB.



Derivatives markets return with abundant activity in SHIB & 1000SHIB.



Shiba Inu whips up 6% gains despite $52M in sales on Spot markets.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is bouncing back after a week of trading in a downward parallel channel. Starting the week at a new 7-day low of $0.00002164, SHIB picked up 6% immediate gains after the leading digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) increased from $60,800 to over $63,000 on Monday morning.Right before the price trend reversal kicked in for SHIB, one holder decided to inject Coinbase with a whopping 100 billion SHIB worth $2.24 million at stamped transaction time. This whale action has drawn attention, as depositing large amounts of cryptocurrency is usually deemed a bearish sign due to the high chance of a sell-off.While the aforementioned big player accumulated those SHIB tokens in a matter of weeks for an approximate price of $0.00002408, the trader would make $2.35 million for the same amount, incurring a loss of under $50K. The current SHIB price is slightly below the buying range at $0.00002343. 
Upon further investigation by DailyCoin, it was found that the sender’s cryptocurrency address held no other assets except ‘dust’ amounts of Ethereum (ETH).Here’s Why SHIB Bounced Back Despite 100B DumpAmid the hefty whale action, Shiba Inu’s Derivatives markets have rapidly increased 146% over the latest 24-hour period. Totaling $156.44 million in Derivatives trade volume, the Open Interest (OI) rating has also picked up 10.33% gains, indicating that Futures traders have a renewed interest in the popular meme coin.Meanwhile, the 1,000 times multiplied 1000SHIB contract has also seen similar revitalization with a 161% hike in trading volume, topping $331.31 million over the past 24 hours. While Derivatives traders have placed more short SHIB positions than longs in the last 24 hours, OKX users are the most bullish on SHIB with a 2.65 long versus short ratio. Judging by liquidations, SHIB’s long position holders had a hard time with $1.1 million in long SHIB liquidations over the past 24 hours. Short sellers incurred a $635K combined deficit in SHIB and 1000SHIB smart contracts on the Crypto Derivatives markets.On the Flipside
Despite SHIB’s rejuvenation in Derivatives markets, the newly piqued interest in the token has yet to transform into Shiba Inu’s Spot markets.



According to CoinPaprika, the #12 ranked Shiba Inu plunged by 10% in trading volume, while SHIB sales outweighed the bids by over $11 million.
Why This MattersShiba Inu is a long-term TOP 10 contender with a rapidly growing community and yearly return of 164.5%, based on the latest 365-day timeframe.

XRP Ledger Attracts The Next Asian Institutional Validator


								Infinite Block, a Korean virtual asset service provider (VASP), has joined the XRP Ledger as a validator, according to a statement released by the company on May 13. The Seoul-based firm, led by CEO Jung Gu-tae, aims to foster the stable expansion of the ledger within Korea’s stringent regulatory framework.
XRP Ledger Gets Another Institutional Validator From Asia
Infinite Block, established by a group of Korea’s foremost regulatory and financial experts, notably secured a VASP license after being the sole qualifier among approximately 50 applicants in 2023. This credential underscores its compliance with Korea’s robust virtual asset regulations, including the international Travel Rule and anti-money laundering standards.

The XRPL, a decentralized open-source protocol active since 2012, has processed over 2.5 billion transactions. Among the prominent contributors to the ecosystem are Ripple, the XRPL Foundation, and XRPL Labs. XRP, the native token of the ledger, is currently ranked seventh globally in terms of market capitalization among virtual assets.
The entry of Infinite Block as a validator is seen as a significant step in both bolstering the domestic blockchain environment and enhancing Korea’s position on the international stage. The company plans to engage in stable governance, expand the ecosystem, and offer services to corporations, all while adhering to domestic and international compliance standards.
CEO Jung Gu-tae emphasized the strategic importance of this move. “As a fully regulated custodial business operator, we will provide blockchain regulatory support infrastructure suitable for the institutional characteristics of the Korean virtual asset industry,” he said. “We will contribute not only to user protection but also to enhancing the reliability based on thorough regulatory compliance, both domestically and internationally.”

Emi Yoshikawa, Ripple’s Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, welcomed the development. “Hot off the press from Korea. Infinite Block, a VASP licensed custody company in South Korea, is now running a validator on the XRP Ledger. Great to see more and more institution-grade validators are participating in the ecosystem from Asia!” Yoshikawa stated via social media platform X.
The announcement by Infinite Block coincides with other institutional engagements, noted lawyer Bill Morgan, who speculated on the timing relative to similar news from SBI Holdings. “Can’t be a coincidence so soon after the SBI entity became an validator,” Morgan commented, hinting at a possibly coordinated expansion of institutional support within the ecosystem in Asia.
At press time, XRP traded at $0.5045.

Bitcoin Regains $63K as Japan Public Firm Migrates to BTC-only Reserve


							

Metaplanet adopts Bitcoin as its main treasury asset in response to Japan’s economic challenges.



The company boasts a Bitcoin portfolio of 117.7 BTC worth $32.71 million.



Bitcoin value reclaimed $63K amid Metaplanet’s new BTC-only reserver policy.




Metaplanet, a Japanese public company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has unveiled a white paper detailing its decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. This strategic pivot comes as a response to Japan’s persistent economic challenges, which include high levels of government debt, enduring negative real interest rates, and a weakening yen.



Metaplanet’s white paper outlines a “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only” approach, departing from traditional treasury management strategies. The company strongly believes in Bitcoin’s fundamental advantages over traditional currencies, other stores of value, and different crypto-assets. 



Furthermore, Metaplanet hails Bitcoin as an “absolutely scarce digital synthetic monetary commodity” with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. According to the paper, this feature sets Bitcoin apart from other monetary systems and commodities.



Contrary to widespread criticism, Metaplanet champions Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism as a critical advantage. The white paper highlights the mining difficulty adjustment, which ensures that the cost of producing new bitcoins increases over time, as a unique attribute that distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional commodities.









Looking ahead, Metaplanet plans to leverage various capital market instruments to grow its Bitcoin reserves. This strategy seeks to protect the company’s balance sheet from the yen’s devaluation and establish Metaplanet as a forward-thinking investment vehicle on the global stage. 



By capitalizing on Japan’s unique position with low global capital costs, the company aims to enhance its competitive edge internationally. According to public records, Metaplanet holds 117.7 BTC, valued at $32.71 million. The news of Metaplanet migrating to a Bitcoin-only reserve has had a notable impact on the value of BTC. At press time, Bitcoin has increased by over 3% to reclaim the $63K threshold following the news.

Bitcoin miner Bitfarms CEO to depart immediately in response to lawsuit

Geoffrey Morphy, the now former President and CEO of cryptocurrency mining firm Bitfarms, will be stepping down immediately after filing a lawsuit against the company in Canada.In a May 13 notice, Bitfarms said it had terminated Morphy as CEO and president ahead of a previously announced plan to have him continue leading the company until a replacement could be found. According to the mining firm, Morphy filed a $27 million lawsuit against Bitfarms on May 10 in the Superior Court of Ontario, claiming “breach of contract, wrongful dismissal and aggravated and punitive damages.”“The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously,” said Bitfarms. “Nicolas Bonta, Chairman and Co-Founder of the Company, has been appointed interim President and Chief Executive Officer, and will lead the Company until the executive search is completed and [Morphy’s] successor is appointed.”Bitfarms announced in March that it planned to seek a replacement for Morphy, who had been with the company since 2020. According to the mining firm, it will appoint a new CEO “in the next several weeks.” Cointelegraph reached out to Morphy for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Related: Bitcoin miner Bitfarms purchases additional 51,908 ASICs amid bull marketFounded in 2017, Bitfarms has 11 Bitcoin (BTC) mining facilities in the United States, Canada, Paraguay and Argentina.

                        MoonPay confirmed to Cryptonews on Monday that it has donated $1 million to the digital advocacy group Stand With Crypto ahead of the 2024 elections.“Today, two things are abundantly clear: this year’s election will define the future of our industry in the United States, and it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that want to positively advance crypto innovation for everyone,” the crypto payment service said in a statement.MoonPay Makes Big Stand With Crypto Donation
Founded by Ivan Soto-Wright and Victor Faramond in 2019, MoonPay donated because of “mounting regulatory pressure” on the blockchain industry.The digital asset company’s announcement comes just days after news broke that Stand With Crypto launched its own political action committee (PAC) slated to fund pro-crypto politicians running for office across the U.S.“In solidarity with Stand With Crypto, we are supporting elected officials to create a clear regulatory framework for crypto that fosters innovation while protecting consumers,” MoonPay’s statement continued.Crypto Heats Up Amidst 2024 Elections
Stand With Crypto has backed several political candidates so far this year,  including Congressional candidates Eddy Morales (D-OR), Shomari Figures (D-AL), and Troy Downing (R-MT), as well as Senatorial hopefuls Jim Justice (R-WV) and Jim Banks (R-IN).“The goal is to endorse candidates and support candidates that are protecting the rights of our advocates of Stand With Crypto throughout November,” Nick Carr, Chief Strategist for Stand With Crypto, told Reuters last week.But Monday’s donation is far from the first time MoonPay has been tied to the U.S. political scene.Last year, Soto-Wright made headlines for a $500,000 donation to Bitcoin-friendly Miami Mayor Frances Suarez made via an LLC owned and controlled by the MoonPay founder, prompting a complaint to be filed with the Federal Election Commission.Critics argue that his mayoral donation may have violated straw donor laws since the funds were provided by the MoonPay founder instead of the money his LLC generated. Soto-Wright has since denied any wrongdoing.The digital asset payment services provider’s Stand With Crypto donation comes as tensions rise over the 2024 U.S. presidential election, with recent polls showing Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden nearly tied.Trump has long been known for his positive stance toward digital assets and announced just last week that his campaign will be taking donations in cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, Biden has advocated for increased regulation within the sector, recently announcing he would veto any attempts to overturn the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s SAB 121.

Ripple CEO Clarifies Tether Comments After A Critical Tweet From Garlinghouse



	

Key Points:




Ripple CEO highlighted U.S. actions towards Tether.



Tether CEO stated $1.3 billion in illicit transactions were blocked.



Garlinghouse defended Tether, hinting at U.S. desire for control.




Ripple CEO clarifies Tether Comments, acknowledging its importance in the crypto ecosystem amidst US government actions. He defended Tether, suggesting the US wants more control over stablecoin issuers.



Ripple CEO Clarifies Tether Comments After A Critical Tweet From Garlinghouse


On May 13, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shed light on the U.S. government’s actions towards Tether (USDT issuer). 



Garlinghouse’s Perspectives on U.S. Actions Towards Tether



Although acknowledging Tether’s importance in the ecosystem, Garlinghouse couldn’t predict the impact of these actions on the broader crypto industry. 



His comments were made amidst revelations of USDT being used by sanctioned countries and terrorist organizations to evade U.S. financial restrictions.




U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary, Adewale Adeyemo, highlighted Russia’s increased use of Tether to circumvent economic sanctions.

Reactions and Responses from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino



In response, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino criticized Garlinghouse’s comments as fear-mongering on Twitter, reminding that Ripple was undergoing an SEC investigation itself. Ardoino’s tweet accused Garlinghouse of spreading fear about USDT.



According to Paolo Ardoino, Tether has blocked over $1.3 billion in illicit transactions over the past three years, including around $1.6 million related to terrorist financing. 





Tether has cooperated with law enforcement, blocking wallets upon 339 requests, 158 from the U.S., and has blocked over $639 million in collaboration with U.S. law enforcement.



Ripple CEO Clarifies Tether Comments



Garlinghouse later defended Tether on Twitter, reiterating its importance in the ecosystem and his belief that the U.S. government’s actions stem from a desire for more control over dollar-backed stablecoin issuers. 




My point was that the US govt has clearly indicated they want more control over USD-backed stablecoin issuers, and thus, Tether, as the largest player, is in their line of sight.

The broader crypto ecosystem is in recovery mode, a trend that is currently being led by Bitcoin (BTC). At the moment, the combined crypto market cap has soared by 1.44% in 24 hours with the valuation coming in at $2.29 trillion. Of this reboot, the XRP price is subtly in the spotlight as it has joined the rally to flip its most important resistance in the short term.At the time of writing, the coin is changing hands for $0.5047 atop a 0.2% surge in 24 hours. While XRP is still down by 5.09% for the week, market watchers believe the current flipping of the $0.5 resistance point's support might suggest the worst of the drawdown is over.After soaring as high as $0.72 this year, XRP backtracked and fell as low as $0.48. The coin has been struggling from this low price level and the $0.57 point since at least mid-April. Breaking the $0.5 level now serves as a litmus test for XRP as analysts anticipate what the next moves will be.Overall, XRP has maintained relatively poorer-than-expected volatility; however, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) now pegged at 43.15, the overselling may soon be in reverse mode. There has been a lot of network development around the XRP Ledger protocol that might impact the outlook of XRP in the long term. With new validators being onboarded, XRPL now stands as one of the L1 protocols with a massive enterprise backer, including SBI and Infinite Block.The outcome of the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit may also shape the future growth prospects of XRP in the long term. Should Ripple Labs be charged a minimal deterrent fee for violating securities laws as concerns sales of XRP to institutional investors, there may be a boom in the price of the coin overall.

Antonio Juliano steps down as CEO of dYdX

The founder of the decentralized exchange dYdX is stepping down as CEO after seven years of heading the crypto derivatives platform.In a May 13 blog post, Antonio Juliano announced his decision to move from the exchange's daily operations to the position of chairman and president. "I’m stepping down as CEO of dYdX Trading In., transitioning to Chairman & President," wrote Juliano. The company is now led by Ivo Crnkovic-Rubsamen, dYdX’s former chief strategy officer. According to his LinkedIn profile, Crnkovic-Rubsamen is a former trader who has worked at the decentralized exchange since 2022.“As I realized I did not need to be CEO, I worked to shepherd other leaders at the company on their own leadership journeys, until one of them was ready to run the company himself,” said Juliano in reference to Crnkovic-Rubsamen. Juliano did not mention his future professional goals but suggested a “next step” for his career: “I have no plans for what comes next for me, and no idea what I’ll do.” Prior to founding dYdX, Juliano was a software engineer at companies such as Coinbase, Uber and MongoDB.According to data from DefiLlama, dYdX has seen a surge in activity in recent months as the crypto markets rebounded. The DEX has a market capitalization of more than $1.1 billion at the time of writing, and $463 million in total value locked. The DEX's annualized revenue is at $35.4 million. In total, derivatives activity generated over $1.31 trillion of trading volume since 2021. Derivatives volume at dYdX. Source: DefiLlama.Much of the recent trading activity could be linked to ongoing developments surrounding the protocol, such as the launch of dYdX's own layer-1 blockchain in October 2023. Based on the native DYDX token for network transactions, the network enables returning gas fees back to validators and stakers as rewards. In addition, dYdX rolled out its v4 upgrade in January, moving the DEX from Ethereum to the Cosmos network. Magazine: 1 in 6 new Base meme coins are scams, 91% have vulnerabilities

Amid Biotech Pitfalls, this Stock Has Outperformed NVDA in the Last 3 Months - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Biotech stocks, especially of smaller companies, are notoriously risky investment exposures. Because their bread and butter is drug development, its complexity cannot be easily accounted for. 



Although the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 86% of new molecular entities (NMEs) in 2022, they must pass multiple clinical phase trials. According to a study from Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) Industry Analysis and BioMedTracker (BMT), the FDA, on average, approved nearly 9% of Phase I in the early 2000s. 



Additionally, the probability of success (PoS) shifts depending on the use of biomarkers in patient selection, according to the 2019 Biostatistics study. During those trying times, biotech companies must carefully balance their limited budgets until a drug pipeline hits the jackpot, as recently happened with Legend Biotech’s (NASDAQ: LEGN) CARVYKTI for bone marrow cancer.



The added complexity of biotech investing is financial. By the time Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) paid $43 billion for oncology firm Seagen (SGEN) in December 2023, the stock had gained 70% value on a yearly basis, from $124 to $212 per share. This indicates that behind-the-scenes dealings can cut short potential upside for retail investors.



Given these factors, what is ImmunityBio (NASDAQ: IBRX) ‘s status as a prospective biostock candidate?



ImmunityBio’s Claim to Fame



Founded in 2014 in San Diego, California, ImmunityBio is a clinical-stage biotech firm. As its name suggests, it specializes in immunity-enhancing therapies and vaccines. In particular, the FDA approved ImmunityBio’s Anktiva this April. The drug is designated an FDA Breakthrough Therapy, as it activates the body’s T-cell immune system to attack tumor cells.



In combination with ImmunityBio’s Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, Anktiva (N-803) is set to treat non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) from mid-May. For investors, bladder cancer is fairly common, at an average rate of 18.2 per 100,000, with 75-80% of newly diagnosed cases classified as NMBIC.



In 2024, Anktiva’s addressable market in the US is 83,190, as estimated new cases by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program under the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Of course, this doesn’t account for cases in which life expectancy varies according to stage. For example, stage 0 has a 98% five-year survival rate, while stage III bladder cancer has a 46% five-year survival rate.



The new drug’s recommended dosage is once per week for six weeks, with a potential follow-up after three months. Anktiva’s pricing strategy is set at around $35,800 per dose, potentially generating around $1.1 million in revenue, including course and maintenance.

On May 9th, ImmunityBio delivered its Q1 2024 earnings. Typical of smaller biotech startups, the firm reported a $134.1 million net loss, substantially higher than the $116.6 million net loss in the year-ago quarter. In share terms, this was a $0.20 net loss per common share (basic and diluted).



However, operating expense losses decreased from $111.9 million to $95.2 million during the period. ImmunityBio left the quarter with $133.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash ($334k). 



The company’s liabilities remained flat at $1.091 billion from the year-ago quarter. This puts the debt-to-equity ratio at a high negative 1.161, confirming that the company has more debt than assets. However, this is not that surprising for the capital-intensive biotech sector.



Against the industry average of 24.83, ImmunityBio’s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio was -8.2 in 2023 and estimated -10.83 for 2024, per Nasdaq data. With the rollout of Anktiva and BCG, the P/E growth forecast in 2024 is 24.75. The latter PEG value is determined by dividing the P/E ratio by the expected future earnings growth rate.



ImmunityBio’s Price Moves and Forecast



Over a one-year period, IBRX stock is up 165%, or 62.8% year-to-date, firmly leaving the penny stock territory in March. From the 52-week low of $1.25, IBRX shares are now 550% up at $8.12 per share.



However, this is still 23% lower than the 52-week high of $10.53, suggesting some room for growth ahead of the Anktiva launch. Nasdaq’s aggregated forecast data suggests an average price target twelve months ahead of $6 per share. WSJ’s average price target is more optimistic at $7.50 per share.

OKX surpasses 50% of Bitcoin Runes market share

Crypto exchange OKX now accounts for 51.08% of Bitcoin Runes' daily trading volume through its Web3 marketplace. According to data from Ordinals analytic platform GeniiData, Runes' trading activity on other platforms, such as UniSat and MagicEden, has steadily declined since April, holding a combined 48.83% market share. Almost all Bitcoin Runes' trading activity is conducted through the three aforementioned firms and their platforms. Bitcoin Runes' trading activity by exchange. Source: GeniiDataRunes is a new protocol for issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network that launched on April 20, the day of the Bitcoin halving. Less than one month after its inception, the protocol has generated a staggering 2,287 BTC ($143.6 million) in transaction fees and now forms the basis of the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem along with Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which were invented last year. It's not just Bitcoin Runes that are gaining traction within the ecosystem. Since its launch in April, Omnichain yield-generating protocol SolvBTC, which allows users to earn yields on their Bitcoin through minted derivatives on Arbitrum, Merlin, and BNB Smart Chain, has accumulated $920.62 million in total value locked. The protocol currently has over 12,000 BTC staked among 30,000 participants and generates annual returns of 5% to 10% on users’ BTC deposits. On April 30, the firm announced it would introduce re-staking yields for its users’ Bitcoin through a partnership with Babylon. The Babylon protocol allows users to self-custody their idle BTC and earn rewards from using the underlying BTC to verify transactions on proof-of-stake networks. Fisher Yu, co-founder of Babylon, said that he hopes that Bitcoin can become more than a store of value but also a “source of dynamic, secure yield” for DeFi. Babylon explaining the mechanism of its BTC staking protocol.

Under the proposal, 65% of its native SPACE token would be distributed to builds according to their respective contribution. The project currently has a diluted market cap of $166 million.On May 6, the Bitcoin blockchain surpassed 1 billion in transactions. During its 5,603-day existence, Bitcoin has had an average of 178,475 daily transactions. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s biggest rival, Ethereum, has processed well over two billion transactions since it launched in July 2015. Related: El Salvador launches $360M Bitcoin treasury monitoring website

__________Meme Coin News: Market Highlights
The meme market capitalization increased by 1.8% over the last 24 hours. It currently stands at $52.2 billion.Dogecoin (DOGE) is at the top per market cap, with 20.76 billion.In second place is Shiba Inu (SHIB), having seen a market cap of $13.84 billion.Pepe Coin (PEPE)’s cap is significantly smaller, standing in third place with $3.7 billion.DOGE also holds tight to the first place per 24-hour market volume, with $52.6 billion.Dogwifhat (WIF) is in the second place, recording $889 million.This is a significant difference between the two first positions.Source: cryptonews.com/coins/meme-coins/Looking at the prices over the past 24 hours, three out of the top 10 meme coins per market cap are down today.These are WIF, COQ, and MEME, each down between 0.5% and 2%.SHIB is the best performer in this category, as its price appreciated 4% to $0.00002.BONE follows it, increasing by 2.6% and trading at $0.57782.The remaining coins are up between 0.5% (BABYDOGE) and 2% (DOGE).All of these coins’ prices have dropped over the past seven days.WIF sank 19%, DOGE decreased by 14.5%, FLOKI is down 12.8%, SHIB declined by 8.1%, and PEPE fell 3%, among others.Base Chain Rising as Home for Meme Coins
Base has been receiving increasingly more attention since its launch – and may be on its way to surpassing Solana. This would be very beneficial for the coins it houses.There are several reasons why this may occur. Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 blockchain is expecting significant ecosystem developments, but also on-chain metrics are nothing to ignore.Important developments include Base Chain Smart Wallet and a smart contract called ‘Magic Spend.’As for on-chain metrics, looking at Base’s 24-hour trading volume, we find it at $125.47 million today, according to DeFiLlama.At the beginning of this year, that number was just 21.63 million.Furthermore, its total value locked (TVL) stands at $1.508 billion, nearing its $1.65 all-time high.Again, at the beginning of the year, TVL stood at $437 million. This is a massive 245% increase over four months.Source: defillama.comAs for Solana, it has $4.02 billion in TVL, compared to $1.4 billion at the beginning of the year.  This is a 187% increase.Its current 24-hour volume is $598.93 million, compared to $545.88 on January 1.Besides the discussions about Base potentially surpassing Solana, there are also debates over which chain is faster.BRETT at the Top Among Base-Based Meme Coins
Speaking of the Base chain, this is a good opportunity to check out its top 10 meme coins.The Base meme coins’ market capitalization today is $877 million.Brett (BRETT) is at the very top per market cap with $289.4 million.DEGEN is next with $235.1 million.These two coins alone account for $524.5 million out of the $877 million.TOSHI is the only other coin with a market cap of over $100 million.Source: coingecko.comOver the last 24 hours, only three coins – NORMIE, HIGHER, and BRETT – are down. While the first two fell around 10% each, the third is down 4%.As for the green coins, BOOMER is the best performer by far. It’s up nearly 40% to $0.03265.DOGINME is in the distant second place with a rise of 12% to $0.0002355.The rest are up between 0.5% and 5%.However, the 7-day picture is entirely red.HIGHER and NORMIE saw the largest drop, each over 30%.Meanwhile, DEGEN recorded the highest 24-hour volume of $26.6 million.Mfercoin (MFER) is in the second place with $9.3 million.BONK Enables Email Login, Launches E-cards
Meme coin BONK announced several developments this week.On Wednesday, the project’s teams revealed that it joined hands with TipLink, a lightweight wallet designed to make transferring digital assets as easy as sending a link.BONK said its users can now use only email login on BONKrewards and lock their coins.There are currently over 3.28 trillion BONK locked there.Per TipLink’s documentation, a crypto user can create a TipLink and send that link to anyone over any platform, be it a text, discord, email, or something else.“The amazing thing is, the link is the wallet,” it said.TopLinks can hold SOL, SPL tokens (tokens that operate on the Solana blockchain), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and semi-fungible tokens (SFTs).Therefore, TipLink offers decentralization and self-custody without seed phrases, key management, apps, and browser extensions, the project stated.Then, on Saturday, BONK announced that it launched BONKmark E-cards ahead of Mother’s Day.Thanks to the collaboration with TipLink, it allows users to send BONK anywhere with email only, and “have moms all over the world use their BONK.”BONK said it would show the recipients how to send the BONK to a CEX, change it to fiat, or deposit it to BONKrewards.E-cards include several designs for Mother’s Day, celebrations, and milestones.

Arthur Hayes: 'Major Economies To Print Even More Money' In The Next 24 Months - Benzinga

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, on Monday laid out a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency market, fueled by factors including the upcoming US presidential election and continued expansion of the monetary base.What Happened: Hayes believes the election will lead to looser monetary policies as the Biden administration seeks re-election, a scenario historically correlated with crypto rallies.Discussing the potential catalysts for Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD price movement, Hayes stated, “You can look at the previous halvings and anywhere between 4 to 18 months later you get a new all-time high. More important thing is that the major economies around the world are going to print even more money between now and, say, the next 18 to 24 months.”He pinpointed the U.S. presidential election as a pivotal event, explaining, “It’s the global empire, its financial policy influences with the Chinese, the Japanese, the Europeans all do.”Hayes elaborated on the strategies likely to be employed by current U.S. leaders to secure an election win, suggesting significant monetary easing could be on the horizon. “Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury secretary, and Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, are doing everything they can to make sure that Joe Biden gets reelected. And that basically means how do I reduce the cost of government borrowing so that him and his Democratic Party can hand out more goodies to the electorate and get reelected?”Also Read: ‘Republicans Smell Blood In The Water:’ Uniswap CEO Warns Democrats Of ‘Swing States Level Miscalculation’ On CryptoWith the election approaching, Hayes predicts both parties will promise financial incentives to voters, funded by increased national borrowing and monetary expansion. “Regardless of who wins, whoever wins there are campaigning on. I’m going to give you something that you don’t have to pay for, and I’m going to pay for it by borrowing my money. I’m going to pay for it by using the central bank to print money.”Hayes also touched on the M2 money supply indicator, noting its significant correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. “The problem with M2 is that it doesn’t capture all the things that are used as credit money in the economy. And every time there’s a new problem, the elites in charge come up with a new way to confuse people about how they’re going to print money.”What’s Next: The implications of the U.S. presidential election on the global financial landscape, including cryptocurrencies, will be a significant theme at Benzinga's upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event is set to explore how geopolitical and economic policies might shape the future of digital currencies and assets.Read Next: Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week?Image: Shutterstock

MoonPay Backs ‘Stand With Crypto’ Group with a Donation - DailyCoin


        

MoonPay has donated to a crypto advocacy group.



The company said the donation was on behalf of everyone on its team.



The donation comes a few days after the advocacy group created a new political committee.




Web3 infrastructure firm MoonPay announced on Monday that it has donated to the Coinbase-led digital assets advocacy group Stand With Crypto.



MoonPay’s donation comes after the advocacy group formed a new Political Action Committee (PAC) on May 10. The PAC aims to raise money from over 400,000 members to support crypto-friendly candidates in U.S. elections.



“In Solidarity with Stand With Crypto”



On March 13, MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright shared a note with his team members, informing them that the company had “made a donation on behalf of everyone” to Stand With Crypto.




The CEO emphasized the importance of the upcoming U.S. elections to the crypto industry, noting that MoonPay is supporting like-minded elected officials in creating a clear regulatory framework that fosters crypto innovation and consumer protection.



“Today, two things are abundantly clear: this year's election will define the future of our industry in the United States; and, it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that genuinely wish to positively advance this innovation for everyone,” Ivan wrote.



While MoonPay CEO’s note to employees did not specify how much was donated, Fox Business Journalist Eleanor Terret claimed that the donation amounted to $1 million.



In the meantime, the Coinbase-led initiative has recruited 479,975 advocates and 165,330 policymaker contacts to fight to keep crypto in the U.S. According to the group’s website, Stand With Crypto advocates have donated over $86 million so far.

DVT 101: All You Need to Know on ETH Staking with Decentralized Validator Technology


																By Adam Efrima
The crypto space is full of buzzwords and abbreviations, and today, I’ll be discussing one that’s not quite so widespread yet: Decentralized Validator Technology, or DVT. It promises to fix a major worry about how traditional validator setups operate on Ethereum by significantly decentralizing and securing the process.
Validators are the entities that build blocks in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, similar to miners in Bitcoin (and other Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols). Ever since Ethereum moved entirely to PoS in September 2022 with The Merge, the blockchain has been supported by a set of approximately 900,000 validators, which theoretically makes it the most decentralized PoS network currently live.
However, not all that glitter is gold in this space. Multiple issues have been raised regarding how PoS is currently implemented in Ethereum, all of which contribute to making it a bit less decentralized than it would seem. But first, we need to dive into the weeds of what a validator in Ethereum really is.
Ethereum Validators Aren’t Like the Rest
A big difference between Ethereum and other PoS networks is that the validator nodes need to have a stake of 32 ETH — no more, no less. This limit was chosen so that it’d offer a reasonable entry point for average Joes to stake while still not creating too many validators for no reason. Right now, 32 ETH is worth about $95,000, but back when staking was first introduced (first as a separate chain) in 2020, it was closer to $30,000.
If you hold more than 32 ETH though, you’ll need to split your stake between multiple “validators,” which explains the very large number of active validators today. In practice, there are likely 10,000-20,000 independent entities (including companies and indie stakers) who are contributing to Ethereum security.
On a technical level, validators are a special entity controlled by their own private keys, which are activated when a prospective staker bridges 32 ETH to the Beacon chain. This chain manages the consensus process, assigning a portion of validators to propose blocks while others “attest” that these blocks are correct. Behaving improperly, for example, by signing invalid blocks or by being offline, leads to stake slashing (though it’s usually quite soft) or penalties incurred on the ETH principal.
Many PoS systems (a.k.a Delegated-PoS or DPoS) enable stake delegation, where users can natively assign their coins to a particular validator, who they trust to do a good job validating the chain and earning staking yield (a centralizing force). On Ethereum, there are no native mechanisms to do this, meaning that people must either run their own validator (self-custody of keys) or trust a service to do so — that is, until DVT came along.
The Pressing Need to Decentralize Staking
The premise of Proof-of-Stake is that no single entity can control more than a certain percentage of the total stake that is currently engaged in validating a protocol. In that case, they can dictate what is the “majority” chain and start behaving incorrectly without penalties, jeopardizing the functioning of the network.
In Ethereum, currently, the vast majority of the staking power is held by Lido, a decentralized finance protocol that offers a convenient “wrapper” or liquid staking token (LST) of a user’s staked position called stETH. The benefit of this system is that you can just stake on the protocol or even buy the token and start staking to earn yield without doing anything else — the underlying system does everything for you.
Lido as a whole currently controls a bit more than 31% of the ETH staked, which is dangerously close to the 33% threshold needed to prevent Ethereum blocks from being finalized (if Lido wished to do so). This sounds worse than it really is: Lido is a decentralized protocol that spreads its stake over many independent node operators, so it can’t really coordinate easily to perform this attack.
Also, as a decentralized business whose entire model relies on being trusted by the Ethereum community, it has no incentive to do so. Finally, a 33% attack is not the end of the world for Ethereum, as it’d just result in blocks not being finalized — they’d still be correct, and the attacker wouldn’t be able to really exploit this issue.
But despite some caveats, some in the community are uneasy about Lido’s dominance, as ultimately, the node operators it chooses have custody over the staked ETH and control part of the validation process. Lido has, however, started implementing technologies to decentralize its node operations by integrating the Simple DVT module.
These advancements promote increased participation and collaboration, facilitating smaller operators to align with larger counterparts thereby fostering a more diverse and robust network. This inclusive approach sets the stage for a trustless future, allowing even at-home validators to integrate with Lido seamlessly.
Decentralized Validator Technology to the Rescue
If the issue is that validators are custodial and somewhat centralized, the logical solution is to turn this process into a decentralized and trustless mechanism. This is, in a nutshell, what DVT offers today.
DVT works by splitting an Ethereum validator’s private key into multiple shares via various cryptographic techniques. The shares are encrypted and distributed to node operators, who then simultaneously run the validator to contribute to Ethereum’s security. Because the actual validator key is never seen or controlled by the operators, the process becomes non-custodial, trustless, secure, and much more fault-tolerant.
DVT is only starting out, but it could be a significant part of Ethereum’s future roadmap. As the network pushes for more scalability, there are serious discussions of increasing the 32 ETH limit to make the total validator numbers more manageable. To counteract the increase in centralization, DVT is being proposed as one of the ways to enable fully decentralized staking pools for smaller users.

Liminal Expands into Asia with Abu Dhabi Approval - Coin Edition


							

Liminal, a Singapore-based custody service provider, expands to Abu Dhabi after regulatory approval.



Recent regulatory wins in Dubai and India signify Liminal’s broader regional presence.



Strategic vision involves extending regulatory footprint beyond current markets to serve institutional clients globally.




Liminal, a Singapore-based custody service provider, has expanded beyond its shores by attaining regulatory approval in Abu Dhabi. As reported by the company’s spokesperson, Liminal’s subsidiary, First Answer Middle East, has been granted Financial Services Permission (FSP) by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). 



In light of this, Liminal can provide custody services in UAE’s second-most populous city, following in-principal approval received last year.



Moreover, the company has witnessed several regulatory advancements over the past week. It has received the green light in the Asian Pacific (APAC), Middle East, and North Africa (MENA) regions. On another positive note, Liminal’s Dubai arm, First Answer Custody FZE, recently secured initial approval from the emirate’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA). 



Speaking on the development, Liminal’s Senior Vice President of Strategy and Business Operations, Manan Vora, noted, “We initiated a strategic drive two years ago to secure regulatory licenses in key markets across APAC and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), strategically positioning ourselves to cater to institutional clients.”



Vora added that Liminal aims to move beyond its technology presence in Europe and Taiwan to get regulatory approval in these regions. The VP also mentioned Liminal’s involvement as a technology provider for Indonesia’s “sovereign digital asset exchange.”









Meanwhile, India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) disclosed that Liminal’s Indian subsidiary has been registered as a reporting entity, making it the first digital asset custodian to achieve this recognition. This follows Liminal’s appointment by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to manage seized digital assets in November.



Furthermore, Liminal has been busy on its home front, offering custody solutions in Singapore before the country introduced new licensing requirements in April. As such, it was grandfathered into the new guidelines, an agreement set for six months. Nonetheless, the company has notified the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) of its intention to apply for a license.

Uniswap Founder Slams Biden's Administration for Not Supporting Crypto | Coinspeaker



Adams said that despite the Republicans’ efforts, Biden can still turn the tables around if he can reverse his stance on crypto and rein in the SEC and Senator Warren’s anti-crypto efforts.

The Biden administration has been under fire, especially after former US President Donald Trump leveraged Joe Biden’s perceived anti-crypto stance as a campaign tactic to sway voters ahead of the November elections.
Last Wednesday, the Democratic government publicly announced its lack of interest in the emerging economy, revealing their plans to overhaul any existing legislation allowing banks to custody cryptocurrencies in the country if re-elected in the upcoming presidential election.




The government’s apparent aversion to the crypto sector has drawn criticism from industry figures like Uniswap founder Hayden Adams. In a lengthy post on X, he condemned Biden’s approach to crypto regulation, likening it to a significant “political misstep”.
Underestimation of Crypto’s Electoral Impact
Adams compared Biden’s approach to crypto regulation to Hillary Clinton’s focus on campaigning in traditionally Republican states (red states) rather than swing states during her presidential campaign.
He argued that the Biden administration underestimates the role crypto will play in the 2024 election, hence their lack of urgency in addressing regulatory concerns.
The Uniswap founder disclosed that while the Democrats are hesitant to embrace crypto, the Republicans are capitalizing on the opportunity to grow their supporters by intensifying their support for the emerging economy. In his words, the “Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto”.
He further noted that Trump and his Republican party are taking advantage of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Senator Elizabeth Warren’s hardline stance against crypto to garner more support from members of the crypto community.
Call for Immediate Action
Adams said that despite the Republicans’ efforts, Biden can still turn the tables around if he can reverse his stance on crypto and rein in the SEC and Senator Warren’s anti-crypto efforts.
He called on those close to the US president and within the Democratic leadership to recognize the seriousness of the issue and advocate for an immediate reversal of Biden’s crypto stance to survive the upcoming election.
“Not much time for Biden to save it. Any one close to him or their leadership should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto (public support/plan and reigning in sec + warren),” he wrote on X.
Election Forecast: Trump Leads Biden in Key States
Meanwhile, recent polling data suggests that if the 2024 presidential election were held today, Trump would secure victory over Biden to reclaim the White House.
A report from the New York Times on Monday revealed that the former US president emerged victorious in five out of six crucial US states polled by the news media between April 28 and May 9, 2024.
The polling data, which included registered voters from diverse racial backgrounds, showed Trump winning support from both White and Black Americans in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. In contrast, Biden only managed to secure victory in one battleground state Wisconsin.

XRP 7-Year Long Accumulation Draws To An End, What This Means For The Price | Bitcoinist.com


								Expectations for the XRP price have fluctuated greatly in the last year, mostly due to the uncertainty that continues to cloud the Ripple legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, bullishness has prevailed despite the altcoin’s disappointing performance in 2024, with one analyst pretending an end to what has been a drawn-out accumulation trend.
XRP Price To Breakout As Accumulation Trend Ends
Crypto analyst U-Copy took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their prediction for the XRP price. The chart attached with the post puts the altcoin in a 7-year accumulation trend, which is set to end soon and trigger an upward rally for the price.
Related Reading: Important Shiba Inu Event Sparks Excitement Among Community Members – What’s It About?
The crypto analyst pointed out that the cryptocurrency is currently forming a triangle along the accumulation trend, which has happened once before in history. The first time was between 2013 and 2017, when the XRP Price saw a long, drawn-out accumulation. However, at the end of this accumulation was the icing on the cake as the price rallied from around $0.005 to $2.5 in the space of one year. This translated to an almost 500,000% increase in price.
Given how the price reacted when the altcoin completed its accumulation in 2017, the crypto analyst is expecting a similar reaction. This time around, the accumulation began in 2018 and has preserved through to 2024. It is almost twice as long as the last time this trend appeared and this could see a blowout rally at the end.
U-Copy explains that this accumulation trend will end in the year 2024 and the rally could begin from here. This is interesting given that expectations around the Ripple vs. SEC battle ending this year are high and investors expect the price to response positively to this development.
Where Is The Price Headed?
While the crypto analyst didn’t give a price target for where XRP could end up, going by the 2017-2018 rally, the altcoin is expected to reach a new all-time high. This would mean rising to around $3 at least, which would be a 600% rally from its current price of $0.5.

The crypto analyst did give investors a timeframe to watch out for as the market recovers. From May 15 through to August, which is a three-month timeframe, was marked as important by the analyst, for when this rally could begin. “Don’t know target price but Shit could blow up big in this Bull Cycle up to December,” the crypto analyst stated.

Hacker Returns Nearly All of $68,000,000 Worth of Crypto Stolen From Whale Wallet: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								A hacker who managed to steal nearly $70 million in crypto from a whale has returned almost everything, according to on-chain data.
Earlier this month, a hacker successfully phished a whale using what’s known as an “address poisoning” scheme.










The scheme involves sending someone a small amount of crypto with an address that looks similar to the victim’s wallet. The tactic is designed to trick the victim into copying the bad actor’s address from their transaction history and having the crypto sent to that wallet instead.
Blockchain security firm CertiK notes that the scammer mimicked a transfer of 0.05 Ethereum (ETH), which tricked the victim into sending 1,155 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) worth $69.3 million to the wrong address. The hacker subsequently swapped the WBTC stack into 23,000 ETH.
However, after an exchange of words over Etherscan’s messaging service, the hacker appears to have been compelled to send the crypto assets back to the whale.
According to blockchain tracking firm Arkham, the hacker has returned nearly all the stolen funds in a flurry of transactions over the past several days. Arkham’s data shows that the whale has been made whole and is now holding 22,960 ETH worth $66.33 million
The hacker never made an attempt to obfuscate the stolen funds through crypto mixers or further trading.
At time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,881, down 1.43% in the last 24 hours.

Billion-Dollar Bank Sued After Revealing Massive Data Breach Affecting Thousands of Customers, Exposing Account Details, Social Security Numbers and Medical Information: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A US lender is facing separate class action lawsuits over a security incident that exposed thousands of customers’ personal identifiable information (PII).
Plaintiffs for the lawsuits say Centennial Bank suffered a data breach in April 2023 – but they allege the lender only notified affected customers that their PII was stolen a full year later, reports consumer lawsuit-focused news site Top Class Actions.










According to Centennial Bank’s website, the data security incident happened between April 6th-7th of last year, and the lender completed its review on March 29th.
Although the bank has not released the exact number of customers affected, a mandatory data breach notification in Washington State shows 3,044 people were hit in that state alone.
The incident compromised customers’ sensitive information including full names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers, bank account numbers and health insurance details.
One lawsuit says that Centennial Bank failed to establish a robust security system to protect its customers.
“Defendant failed to adequately protect plaintiffs and class members PII – and failed to even encrypt or redact this highly sensitive information.
This unencrypted, unredacted PII was compromised due to Defendant’s intentional, reckless, negligent and/or careless acts and omissions and its utter failure to protect customers’ sensitive data.”
Local news site 104.9 The Fox reports that Centennial Bank suffered a massive system-wide shutdown amid the April 2023 incident. Customers were not able to access online banking services or use their cards to withdraw cash or pay for goods and services. At the same time, branches of the billion-dollar lender could not complete withdrawals or take in cash deposits, while auto-deducted bills were rejected. Direct deposit checks for payrolls also witnessed delays.
Centennial Bank has $22 billion in total assets with 222 physical locations across Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Texas and New York City.

                        Roaring Kitty, the pseudonym of the trader who gained fame for his role in the GameStop short squeeze of 2021, is back, and so is the rise in GME’s stock price.As if revisiting the start of 2021, markets have turned bullish with the return of this retail investor icon.Responding swiftly to the market excitement, Solana meme coin developers have capitalized on the momentum by launching and promoting various new coins, with KITTY emerging as the standout performer at the time of writing.This article will analyze KITTY’s current price trends and look to see whether an innovative new meme coin, Dogeverse, represents a more promising investment opportunity.Legendary Leader of the Wall Street Bets campaign for GameStop (GME), Roaring Kitty has returned to X (Twitter), and Solana meme markets are witnessing a major surge for name-linked tokens like GME, STONKS and, in this instance, KITTY.KITTY Price Analysis: Can Solana Meme Coin Rally Sustain After Roaring Kitty Return Hype?
As price action continues to hammer to the upside, the Roaring Kitty token is currently trading at a market price of $0.0.0366 (representing a 24-hour change of +21,247%).This comes after KITTY price roared out of capitulative price levels in a dramatic surge, triggered by Roaring Kitty’s first return to X post at around 1AM on May 13.The hours since have seen strong buy pressure (currently representing 54% of transactions) has fuelled major gains, with few signs of slowing down after a well-established support zone emerged between $0.01 and $0.02.Now in a second rally leg, KITTY is targeting a further upside move, as bulls hold strong at a shocking $27M market cap.These heights induce risk.However, a strong upside move from here could see KITTY surge to $100M superstar status – offering as much as a 4x return for investors here.Yet, with late-stage entries all that’s left, many are shifting their attention to presale tokens poised to explode in similar fashion over the weeks to come.Discover the Next Solana Meme Coin to Pump in May 2024: DOGEVERSE
While SOL offers a market leader opportunity, the biggest gains can be accrued through presale opportunities, which position investors as early birds able to capture the lion’s share of project growth—just imagine investing in KITTY before it hit the market and skyrocketed 22,000%.One such opportunity in the SOL ecosystem is the DOGEVERSE presale – which has unlocked viral success over the last two weeks to hit $15M raised in the ongoing presale.Aiming to be the first multi-chain incarnation of DOGE, DOGEVERSE is positioned to grow rapidly as market participants race to grab a piece of the pie.DOGEVERSE is still raising funds at the presale stage and will start preparing for exchange listings very soon.Buy DOGEVERSE Here

Rain exchange suffered $14.1M in suspicious outflows 2 weeks ago - ZachXBT

The Rain cryptocurrency exchange was “likely exploited” on April 29 when $14.1 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP was transferred to a new wallet under suspicious circumstances, according to a May 13 report from on-chain sleuth ZachXBT. The report comes two weeks after the reportedly suspicious transactions took place.Rain is a centralized crypto exchange headquartered in Bahrain. It specializes in serving customers from Southwest Asia and the Middle East. According to regional news site The National, Rain has recorded over $1 billion in trading volume since its inception.ZachXBT’s official Telegram channel reported that the transferred funds “were quickly transferred to instant exchanges and swapped for BTC and ETH” before being deposited to two destination addresses on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. The Ethereum address, which ends in 6c28, is currently holding approximately 1,881 ETH, worth $5.5 million at the current price. The Bitcoin address, which ends in prp2, is holding ‎137.9 BTC, worth $8.6 million at the current price.Report on suspected Rain exploit.

New Hampshire representative proposes Bitcoin ETF investment to address state financial liabilities

New Hampshire State Representative Keith Ammon discussed the potential benefits of the state diversifying its financial reserves into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a May 12 social media post.The SEC approved trading spot Bitcoin ETFs on US exchanges in January. Since then, the products have generated huge interest, with major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, trading firm Susquehanna International Group, and others revealing substantial holdings in these ETFs.6200% ROIAmmon highlighted a hypothetical scenario where if the state had invested 5% of its rainy day fund into Bitcoin in 2016, the initial $4.65 million investment could have grown to approximately $473 million, marking a remarkable 10,000% profit.Nevertheless, the state missed this significant ROI opportunity because it failed to invest in the top digital asset.However, Ammon noted that the state could right that wrong and gain a remarkable 6,200% return on investment by allocating just 5% of its $290 million rainy day fund to a Bitcoin ETF now and holding it until 2030.His projection stems from insights by influential figures in the crypto space, such as Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, who anticipates a significant upsurge in Bitcoin’s value. Wood proposes that if institutions dedicate 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, its price could skyrocket to $3.8 million by 2030.Moreover, Ammon references Manuel Nordeste, Fidelity’s Vice President of Digital Assets, who recently highlighted the increasing inclination of major pension funds and prominent banks toward incorporating Bitcoin ETFs into their portfolios.Ammon also points out that a substantial portion of pension managers—25% to be precise—revealed personal ownership of digital assets during a recent panel. He noted:“If just 1% of state pension AUM ($5.5T) flowed into BTC, it would dwarf mining revenue, leading to a supply shortage relative to demand and a price increase for Bitcoin.”Considering these insights, Ammon posits that Bitcoin exposure could alleviate New Hampshire’s financial burdens. He said:“The State of New Hampshire has outstanding liabilities to the state pension system of $1.25 billion and for bonds of around $200 million. How could we climb out of that hole? The answer may be staring us in the face, and it’s worthy of further investigation.”Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Bitcoin bottomed at $56K? BTC price chart hints at breakout within days

A popular Bitcoin chart formation suggests that Bitcoin's (BTC) price could break out from its current range. However, this week's macroeconomic news could also significantly impact the price. Can Bitcoin break out to the upside?Is a Bitcoin breakout imminent?On the four-hour chart, Bitcoin price printed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a formation used by technical analysts to predict the reversal of a previous downtrend.Based on the technical formation, Bitcoin could rally to the upside if a break above the trendline occurs, according to a May 13 X post from crypto investor Quinten Francois, who wrote: “Inverse head and shoulders pattern spotted on the $BTC chart. Not the most beautiful iH&S I've ever seen, but I'll take it. Different ways to draw the neckline too, but this way makes the most sense to me. Break the neckline for further price recovery!”Source: Quinten FrancoisBitcoin has nearly reset some key technical indicators, including the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), an indicator used to gauge changes in the strength and direction of an asset. This could mean more upward momentum according to pseudonymous crypto analyst Jelle, who wrote in a May 13 X post:“Bitcoin has nearly completed a full reset. Back to the 100-day EMA, a bullish MACD cross (below the zero line) -- and the first higher low in a long time. It's looking good.”Source: JelleOver on the daily chart, Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) stood at 49, up from 33 on May 1, suggesting that BTC price is currently at fair value. The RSI is a popular momentum indicator used to measure whether an asset is oversold or overbought based on the magnitude of recent price changes.BTC/USDT, 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewIn line with the previous prediction, pseudonymous crypto trader Mags also expects a price breakout, based on key technical indicators, according to a chart shared in a May 13 X post with his 74,200 followers:Source: MagsDespite the bullish chart formation, the sentiment around Bitcoin is still in a precarious situation. Particularly, this week's macroeconomic developments, especially the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on May 14, could significantly impact its short-term price trajectory, according to Matt Bell, the CEO of Turbofish. Bell told Cointelegraph:"While the 4-hour chart hints at a potential trend reversal with the Inverse Head and Shoulders formation, it’s crucial to note that Bitcoin’s price action is tightly bound within a narrow trading range... Factors like United States macro data and insights from Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, could introduce a new wave of volatility to the crypto market."Related: Did XRP price just bottom against Bitcoin?Bitcoin at $56K marked local bottom: analystBitcoin’s retrace to $56,000 has likely marked the local price bottom, according to popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital, who wrote in a May 13 X post:“If $56,000 was not the bottom then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days. History however suggests that this current pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days.”Source: Rekt CapitalWhat's more, Bitcoin’s distribution danger zone ended on May 6, as Bitcoin rose above the $65,000 mark.However, Bitcoin faces significant resistance around the $63,500 and $63,700.

Founder and chairman of MicroStrategy Michael Saylor has sent an important Bitcoin message to the crypto community, citing the legendary Terminator dilogy.Saylor was the one who initiated the current Bitcoin course taken by MicroStrategy when it started buying BTC on a regular basis in the August of 2020. A few years ago, he stepped down from his CEO position to focus on the Bitcoin strategy for the company.Several times a day, Saylor publishes Bitcoin-related posts on the X platform with a short message to the BTC community and an AI-generated image. This time, his message was related to the original Terminator movies directed by James Cameron and their Sarah Connor character in particular."Terminator" Bitcoin call to communitySaylor published a picture of a young woman who looks like Sarah Connor – generated by an AI app. She has a Bitcoin mascot on her tank top and the famous phrase “No fate” that Kyle Reese passed to her from John Connor from 2029 in the first Terminator movie. Saylor urges the Bitcoin community to create their own future with BTC. Recently, Saylor seems to have increased his pressure on the crypto community with his daily Bitcoin messages as he strives to send the “good tidings” of the world’s flagship cryptocurrency to as many people on the X platform as possible.In another recent tweet, Saylor mentioned the Mother’s Day, urging Bitcoiners to go and tell their mothers about BTC.Robert Kiyosaki issues important BTC tweetAnother renowned Bitcoin advocate, author of the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” book Robert Kiyosaki has recently endorsed BTC in his tweet. He believes that the US dollar is about to face a major crash since rumors continue to spread about high chances that BRICS will launch a gold-backed cryptocurrency in the near future.Should this happen, Kiyosaki said, massive amounts – billions! - of US dollars will start flowing back into the US, taking the dollar’s value even lower than it is now. The US dollar is bound to crash, the writer and investor believes. Therefore, he recommends his followers on X to buy Bitcoin, gold and silver to protect themselves from that USD crash.Kiyosaki is famous for his predictions, expecting the US economy and the dollar to collapse soon. Many on X have already stopped paying attention to them.

GameStop Tribute Meme Coin on Solana Surges 1,900% as GME Fever Returns - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIs the meme stock craze back? GameStop’s share price doubled from Friday’s close to Monday’s open, with trading of GME paused nine times already due to volatility. And a GameStop-themed meme coin on Solana is reaping the rewards, too.The “GameStop” token on Solana, which also uses the GME ticker, has seen a 1,900% price jump over the past 24 hours, per data from DexScreener, to a current price of approximately $0.01. That gives GME a current market cap of $68 million.GME on Solana, which is an unofficial meme coin created as a tribute to the company, was launched in January shortly after the gaming retailer announced that it would withdraw from the crypto world, shutting down its NFT marketplace that launched back in 2022.Like most meme coins, GME had a short and extremely volatile moment in the spotlight. Meme coins are often created based on internet memes and pop culture trends, but they’re also often created by anonymous developers—and may be “rug pulled,” or have the liquidity drained, leaving buyers with a near-worthless token.The GME token rose to a high price of $0.0135 in early February, and swung up and down for weeks before eventually losing steam and sinking lower and lower. GME had barely budged in price for weeks, and was trading for about $0.0005 just before the latest surge.The unofficial GameStop token still remains about 26% down from its all-time high price, but is closer to that mark than it’s been in three months. And the 24-hour jump of about 1,900% is vastly higher than that of the actual GameStop stock price.Stock trader Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty and DeepFuckingValue, helped drive an enormous surge in the price of GameStop’s shares in early 2021 via Reddit posts and livestreams, encouraging traders to purchase and hold the diminished shares of the retail giant. The trend then spread to other nostalgic, beleaguered brands, like movie theater chain AMC.The original craze eventually died down, but a revival appears to be in the offing following a Twitter (aka X) post from Gill on Sunday—the first in nearly three years. GME more than doubled from its close price on Friday, while AMC jumped 37%. Adjacent stocks like Reddit (up 9%) and Robinhood (up 6%) are also rising alongside them.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests a potential bullish surge for Shiba Inu (SHIB), the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, predicting a 20% upswing if it manages to breach the upper boundary of a descending parallel channel at $0.00002444. Martinez's analysis, depicted in a chart attached to the post, indicates SHIB's trajectory aiming at surpassing this crucial resistance level.Today's cryptocurrency market saw a notable uptick, particularly for meme-based digital assets. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the meme cryptocurrency sector experienced a significant 5.56% surge in capitalization, amounting to a staggering $52.94 billion. Trading volumes for the meme-inspired tokens surged by over 118%, underscoring the heightened interest and activity within this niche.Source: Ali MartinezLeading the charge alongside SHIB are other meme coins like Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE). This surge in meme coin activity coincides with the resurgence of interest in the crypto space, possibly fueled by the return of Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill to the limelight. "Roaring Kitty" is backGill, notable for his involvement in the GameStop (GME) stock short-squeeze saga in 2021, has once again become a prominent figure in financial discussions.  A former financial advisor and investor, Gill became widely known for his bullish stance toward GameStop. His enthusiastic and persuasive posts attracted a large following in the online trading community, influencing many retail investors to buy shares of GameStop, creating a sort of cult.While SHIB stands out among its meme coin counterparts, Martinez's forecast injects a renewed sense of optimism into its trajectory. The potential 20% upswing, contingent upon breaching the resistance level, could herald a significant bullish trend for the SHIB community.

However, these gains have yet to provide the strength needed for DOGE to soar above $0.15.Can Bulls Spurt DOGE Back to $0.20?This particular price barrier is crucial for DOGE to clear on the way up, as 11.35B DOGE coins are held in 261.78K cryptocurrency addresses at an average price of $0.142. If Dogecoin surges past this support cluster, the next barrier between $0.149 and $0.181 consists of 13.31B Dogecoins split between 340.45K crypto addresses.Judging from the volume held at the aforementioned price barriers, Dogecoin’s $0.20 price target could come into play if it continues to highly correlate with Bitcoin (BTC) and no extra sell pressure arrives. At the current Dogecoin price levels, the DOGE combined order book is favorable for crypto bulls, with $82 million in DOGE bids over the past 24 hours compared to $76 million in completed DOGE 24-hour sales.DOGE Banks on the Rapid Hike in DerivativesAlongside the high price correlation of 0.9 with BTC, another upside for Dogecoin is the 62% upswing in Derivatives trade volume. As depicted in the graph below, Dogecoin’s Derivatives market trading volume is nearing $2 billion, as both long and short DOGE traders partook in position placements that boosted the Open Interest (OI) rate by 4.86% over the past 24 hours.While the general long versus short DOGE position ratio is slightly on the short-selling side, it shall be noted that OKX customers are the most bullish on DOGE, on a 3.61 ratio between long and short positions. Secondly, long Dogecoin Derivatives traders on Binance outsource the short-sells more than twice, at a 2.0452 ratio based on DOGE positions.While Dogecoin couldn’t gain the same popularity on Spot markets this Monday, the overall DOGE trading volume on Spot still exceeded $1 billion. DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) dwells around 50, which means that DOGE is neither in an oversold nor an overbought condition. Finally, a positive Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) index above 0.10 shows a renewed interest in trading the token on Spot markets.On the Flipside
While Dogecoin is the clear leader by global market cap in the meme coin department, Pepe Coin (PEPE) challenges its popularity in derivatives.



According to the real-time on-chain data by CoinGlass, PEPE’s trading volume on Derivatives has breached $2B with a positive long versus short ratio at 1.0259.
Why This MattersDogecoin’s status as the second largest Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain aside from Bitcoin (BTC) puts the original memecoin at the top of the list of the most talked-about alternative currencies.

Will the Law to Determine the Fate of Cryptocurrencies in the US Pass? Is It Favorable for the Sector? - Bitcoin Sistemi

TD Cowen, one of the leading investment banks in the USA, recently shed light on the future of the Financial Innovation and Technology Act for the 21st Century (FIT21), a comprehensive crypto market structure bill. Although the bill has a slim chance of becoming law in the current Congress, it is seen as a critical cornerstone for future legislative efforts.
The Republican-led FIT21 bill will be voted on in the House of Representatives at the end of the month. The bill proposes a comprehensive approach to regulating the emerging crypto market and aims to impose greater regulatory responsibility on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC is described as a softer regulator for cryptocurrencies.


But TD Cowen's Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, warns against getting caught up in the details of this legislation. “There is no chance of it becoming law in this Congress,” they wrote in a memo. The group cites the Senate Banking's lack of preparatory work and Democrats' focus on investor protections as the main reasons for this.
Despite these obstacles, TD Cowen sees FIT21 as a critical cornerstone for Congress when a new effort to enact crypto market structure legislation is expected in 2025/2026. The bill brings together members of the House of Representatives and shifts the focus to the Senate, allowing it to introduce its own bill.





The FIT21 vote could also shed light on how Democrats and Republicans view critical issues like anti-money laundering and investor protections. TD Cowen expects FIT21 to pass the full House.
FIT21, which passed the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee last summer, faces a tougher challenge than a bill regulating stablecoins. Announcing the vote on FIT21, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry called the bill a bipartisan effort “to finally provide clarity.”



Former President Donald Trump recently expressed his support for crypto. However, it is unclear whether he will maintain this pro-crypto stance if he wins the presidential election later this year.
TD Cowen notes that Trump could be a “problem” in the future. They believe Trump risks further polarizing crypto oversight, which could make it harder to find bipartisan consensus. “We will monitor this closely,” the investment bank concluded.

Is Bitcoin A 90% Surge Incoming? Analyst Sees Bottom As Inflation Data In Focus


								Bitcoin prices are moving sideways when writing and are generally firm. Even though there are marks of strength, the world’s most valuable coin is still swimming against ferocious downstream currents and could risk plunging below $60,000 and May 2024 lows. 
Is The Bitcoin Bear Run Over? Prices Retest The 100-Day Moving Average
Though there are risks, one analyst on X is upbeat. In a post, the trader noted that prices have retested the 100-day moving average. Historically, whenever Bitcoin has dipped to or slightly below this level, it has marked a local bottom, followed by a significant upward rally. 
BTC retesting 100-day moving average | Source: Analyst on X
Looking at the daily chart, the analyst notes that the most recent instance occurred in January, where a price test of the 100-day moving average preceded a 90% surge. 
Now that prices have once more retested this level, if history guides, it is likely that Bitcoin has found a local bottom, and a bullish outcome, last seen in January 2024, could be on the offing.  

Though traders are hopeful, there is no guarantee that prices will surge as expected. As mentioned earlier, the coin remains under immense liquidation pressure, and sellers have been soaking in attempts for higher highs.

The daily chart shows local resistance and support are at $66,000 and $56,500, respectively. As prices move sideways, the trend direction established will largely depend on the breakout direction. 
A conclusive close above $66,000, buoyed by rising participation, might surge BTC prices. However, whether it will spike by 90% or higher like in the past remains to be seen.
Inflation Data: A Catalyst For Bitcoin Growth?
With traders upbeat, this week promises to be pivotal, with inflation data taking center stage. On May 14, the United States Producer Price Index (PPI) will be released. A day later, on May 15, the public will know where the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading stands. 

While economists anticipate a slight decrease in inflation compared to previous readings, volatility is expected. If inflation slows down in the United States, the greenback could weaken. Subsequently, Bitcoin may edge higher as investors seek alternatives to store value.
Inflation data versus Oil prices | Source: Analyst on X
In a post, one analyst believes falling oil prices and a robust labor market point towards an overall softening of inflation in the United States. If this trend guides, it aligns well with the expectation of lower PPI and CPI readings this week; a net bullish for BTC.

What's a BFG Token? | 100% Project’s Revenue for BFG Support



                    

Countless tokens appear in the crypto world nowadays. However, only some cryptocurrencies effectively combine earning opportunities and strategic vision for strengthening a token from the inside. Such projects build long-term prospects for token utilities and have a loyal community of holders. 



The BFG token can be classified as one of these tokens. It has taken on these qualities and shown clear tokenomics, aligning with the idea of sharing revenue with users in both the project and the token.




This article will reveal the primary BFG utilities, exclusive benefits for its holders, and token price prediction. We will also share how the BetFury project allocates 100% of its revenue to sustain the BFG token.



What is a BFG Token?



BFG is a native token of the BetFury ecosystem, launched on a BSC Chain (BEP-20) in June 2021. It has over 67,000 holders who use BFG for trading, gaming, sports betting, getting passive income from staking, etc. More about BFG: https://betfury.com/about-bfg. 



BFG has become integral to the BetFury project, constantly moving towards new achievements. It plays a vital role in the ecosystem and rises in market value due to the robust deflationary strategy. One of the fundamental points of this strategy is the direction of GGR (Gross Gaming Revenue) to the BFG Staking pool, the main crypto utility.Do you know other projects that spend 100% of the team’s revenue to support the native token? Moreover, BetFury seasons it with permanent BFG buybacks that positively affect the BFG price. Therefore, having stable revenue, the platform spends it on token development and its long-term perspective.




History Behind BFG Growth



The BFG token was launched to distribute the platform revenue and passive income to its owners. Gradually, as the project scaled, the number of collaborations increased, providing additional utilities for the BFG token, including exchange options and additional income opportunities for users.Tokens were mined by playing in a one-to-one ratio for the user and team. After the end of BFG mining in June 2023, the total supply amounted to 5 billion tokens. Simultaneously with the mining process, the primary utility of the BFG token was launched – revenue share. Users who became BFG holders began to participate in this distribution mechanism. After listing on top exchanges like PancakeSwap, BFG increased its liquidity and market circulation, taking a well-deserved place among the most popular tokens in the crypto-iGaming niche.



Strategic BFG Deflationary Mechanism



After the end of BFG mining, BetFury took on the most critical mission – escalating the value of BFG. Stable and healthy tokenomics allowed the team to create a new deflationary strategy to accomplish this task. The new deflationary mechanism involves repurchasing tokens from the market using the BetFury team’s revenue. 



BFG Buyback & Burn Mechanism



The team uses funds from the platform’s revenue streams to buy back BFG tokens from the market and conduct a monthly BFG token burn, reducing the circulating supply. These revenue streams include:




crypto staking penalty fee;



crypto swap fee;



borrowing liquidation and fee;



Futures fee



staked BFG by the BetFury team;




BFG Buyback & Lock



Each month, BetFury’s team buys back tokens from the circulating supply using funds generated from the mentioned revenue streams and stores them in a dedicated wallet known as the Treasury. Periodically, these repurchased BFG tokens will be distributed as incentives to stBFG/BFG holders and active platform users. 




This transparent and innovative deflationary strategy demonstrates that the BetFury team will focus all its efforts on boosting the token and supporting BFG holders.



How to Earn with BFG?



BFG has many utilities that reveal the token’s full range of usefulness.



Staking BFG



It’s the primary tool for passive earning. BetFury offers BFG Staking with an opportunity to double rewards by converting BFG to stBFG (a special native token) with zero fees. It provides up to 70% APY and daily payouts in BTC, ETH, BNB, USDT, and TRX.According to the mechanism for replenishing the BFG Staking pool, the part of GGR is distributed among BFG and stBFG holders in the BFG Staking pool. This way, the BetFury team can consistently support the pool’s profitability for users by providing a high APY. Additionally, the BetFury team has locked 1 billion BFG tokens for three years, opting not to benefit from the x2 APY but to earn from a regular APY in the BFG Staking pool. Such a lock ensures the team’s serious commitment to token development and its deflationary model.



Trading BFG



Everyone can trade assets on BetFury using Crypto Swap. It’s an internal exchange that provides fast transactions and low fees. Besides, you can trade BFG on top exchanges like Pancake Swap, Biswap, etc.



Holding BFG tokens



By holding a BFG token, you also gain benefits: 




High passive income from BFG staking;



Access to exclusive features and bonuses on BetFury;



Potential to get the high-value token thanks to strategic deflation mechanism and smart tokenomics (link);



Additional huge rewards for all holders are available in different formats.




Playing BFG



BetFury has over 8,000 slots and 20 Original games. Therefore, players can easily place bets and multiply their BFG assets.



Betting BFG in Sports



The platform offers over 80 sports betting options in BFG. Users also can get beneficial bonuses by placing BFG bets.



BFG Bonuses & Events



BetFury has a profitable Welcome Pack with up to a $10,500 Deposit bonus and 225 Free Spins. Moreover, each user can receive pleasant bonuses for activity and participate in various large-scale events with huge rewards:




Rise your Rank on BetFury to receive up to 25% Cashback in BFG;



Loot fantastic Rakeback and Weekly & Monthly Bonuses from Rank 1;



Get the BFG tokens during Coindrop, Rain, etc;



Choose great Bonus Packs in your Bonus Cabinet;



Join regular battles, events, and tournaments to multiply BFG;



Gather Weekly and Monthly Bonuses in BFG based on your wager and lost deposit funds between accrual periods;



Be an active VIP user to earn BFG regularly;



Receive a boosted TG Monthly Bonus in BFG after connecting the BetFury Telegram Bot to your account.




The different uses of the BFG token help it stay strong in changing markets, and its strategy of reducing supply makes it more valuable over time.



Is the BFG token secure?



BFG got a CertiK certification on September 17, 2021. This report showed the token’s reliability and security. Moreover, BetFury also received a Curacao gaming license. As a result, the platform gained users’ trust and assured all BFG holders.



BFG Token Price Prediction



According to Coincodex forecasts, the BFG price may increase by 228% and reach $0.0567 by June 6, 2024. Based on historical cycles, the platform also determined the minimum and maximum value of the token for 2025: $0.017284 and $0.081670. The upgraded tokenomics and deflationary strategy can support these positive dynamics. Therefore, such predictions have a good chance of coming true. In any case, remember that the crypto market is very volatile. Experienced traders should keep their finger on the pulse and always conduct their own research.



Conclusion



Ecosystem upgrades are essential for any crypto platform competing for a leading position in the industry. That is why BetFury has updated its tokenomics and introduced a new transparent deflationary model to empower its BFG token. The platform has directed 100% of iGaming revenue to support BFG tokens in the BFG Staking pool, thus granting users favorable conditions and stable APY rewards. The other part of the non-iGaming income will be used for BFG buybacks to fill the Burning and Treasury funds. As an outcome, the BetFury team is committed to fostering a healthy token economy and facilitating the continuous growth of the ecosystem.

Big Brother surveillance dystopia is now reality at Binance


When Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), it agreed to allow two government agencies to appoint compliance monitors within the company.
As a result, Binance agreed to let the DoJ monitor its operations for three years and FinCEN for five.
After a lengthy bidding process, the DoJ picked Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) to operate its monitorship while, according to Bloomberg, law firm Sullivan & Cromwell will likely fulfill FinCEN’s.
Never before in the history of Binance has such an expansive surveillance apparatus existed. Indeed, as the world’s largest crypto exchange and hub for tens of millions of crypto traders around the world, these DoJ and FinCEN monitorships are arguably the most powerful and comprehensive government surveillance operations in the history of crypto.
US crypto surveillance backend for almost all crypto trades
For the first time in crypto’s 15-year history, the US government has workers installed within the world’s largest operating crypto exchange. It’s a leap in surveillance by orders of magnitude. The increased power above its prior data sources — such as one-off historical subpoenas, widely neglected suspicious activity reports, or Chainalysis blockchain analytics — cannot be overstated.
According to Binance’s sworn settlement, it must provide FRA, as DoJ’s authorized contractor, access to “all information, documents, records, facilities, and employees, as reasonably requested,” including “direct observation of selected systems and procedures of the company, including those related to know-your-customer, customer due diligence, US sanctions screening, real-time transaction monitoring, law enforcement notifications, internal accounting controls, record-keeping, and internal audit procedures.”
Monitorships probably explain CZ’s prison getaway
Given the immeasurable quantities of data to which the US government now has access — including tens of millions of people and untold criminal acts by Binance users for the next five years — it’s somewhat unsurprising that its CEO Changpeng Zhao was able to get off with such a short prison sentence.
Like Binance the company, Zhao, its founder and CEO, also pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws. However, he received only a relatively short, four-month prison sentence.
Many observers attribute the judge’s leniency in Zhao’s prison sentence to the expansive, dual monitorships to which he agreed. For the first time, the US government has guaranteed, court-enforced oversight of Binance’s global operations. According to Dennis Kelleher speaking to Law360 reporters, the monitorship plea agreement made it “preordained that he was not going to get a very serious sentence.”

All other crypto surveillance tools in distant second place
Binance is by far the world’s largest crypto exchange and for years, it has facilitated multiples of the transactions of any of its closest competitors. Therefore, from a crime-fighting perspective, these years of surveillance will prove invaluable for US law enforcement efforts against crypto-using criminals.
According to a commentator, “It means bad actors going forward need to be really careful with their operational security practices to make sure they don’t pull in funds from an address which was incidentally doxxed because of an interaction with Binance.”
Binance has not settled the SEC’s multi-billion dollar lawsuit — that litigation regarding unregistered securities continues — and the crypto giant also faces continued law enforcement abroad.

Former CEO Turned Author? Binance's CZ Teases What’s Next - DailyCoin


        

Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has hinted at an upcoming adventure.



The former Binance CEO was recently sentenced to a four-month prison term.



Changpeng Zhao vowed to focus on new projects in the future.




The legal tussle involving Binance and the United States Department of Justice has recently concluded, culminating with the long-awaited sentencing of founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. However, contrasting the broader expectation of a lengthy stay behind bars, CZ bagged a mere four-month jail time. 



With ample free time now at his disposal, the former Binance CEO may now be exploring new ventures.



Binance CZ Taps Into Author Era?



Joining in a books-themed thread initiated by Binance co-founder Yi He on May 12, Changpeng Zhao hinted at the possibility of authoring a book in the upcoming months. 




Zhao, who has been spending more time on social media since his sentencing, cheekily responded to X user Omobola Oduntan’s tweet, which expressed anticipation of the former Binance CEO’s book. “I got some “quiet time” coming up. Will use that to write something,” he stated.







The former Binance CEO’s words follow his post-sentencing vow to focus on more educative ventures following his legal challenges, including establishing a learning platform for young underprivileged students to access free basic education.



While CZ’s statements were lighthearted, Yi He co-signed his message, hinting at the details the potential book will cover.



Changpeng Zhao’s Memoir-y Lane?



Despite CZ’s recent history being marked by rocky regulatory challenges, he undoubtedly remains an influential figure in the crypto industry.




From humble beginnings in Jiangsu Province to founding Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Zhao’s journey to success is an inspiring tale that solidifies his status as one of the crypto industry’s heroes.



If he does write a book, Zhao could offer insights into his journey to becoming one of the most influential figures in crypto, valued at approximately $33 billion. Additionally, CZ’s book may provide valuable guidance to aspiring industry leaders on navigating regulatory challenges by drawing insights from real-life experiences.



Zhao is arguably the third most influential person in crypto after Satoshi and Vitalik, and a memoir or autobiography will likely receive a warm reception from most of the industry.



On the Flipside




While most of Zhao’s follower base has offered a warm reception, others are fixated on his regulatory woes.



CZ recently shared the launch of a non-crypto education-driven platform, Giggle Academy. 



Following the six-month tussle with the DoJ, Binance‘s global market share dropped to 55%.




Why This Matters



Changpeng Zhao’s little to no time behind bars allows him ample time to try out new ventures. If successful, writing could become his next passion, particularly in the absence of an executive role at Binance.



CZ’s exchange Binance is still embroiled in regulatory challenges in other regions.

U.S. Senators Question Justice Department's Pursuit of Crypto Mixers Such as Tornado Cash

The DOJ also argued in a court filing that FinCEN's guidance addressing crypto mixers didn't address the idea of "control," a stance that the senators' letter took issue with. In its filing from last month, the DOJ said anything that facilitates the transfer of funds would meet the legal definition of a "money transmitter," likening the wallet to a USB cable that transfers data or a frying pan that transfers heat.

Macro Events and Interest Rate Updates Impacting Crypto Market



This week’s significant macro events include notable Consumer Price Index (CPI) news. Bowman recently stated that there are no expectations for a rate cut this year, making this week’s remarks worth noting. 



Rate cuts appear to be distant, with some economies considering further interest rate hikes. The situation will continue to maintain the tight market funding status quo. 





Despite no significant crypto events impacting the market, the FTX claim and numerous hearings are worth tracking. The cryptocurrency market, especially Ethereum and other altcoins, has been weak recently.

The vision of Infinex to revolutionize DeFi

In an era where decentralized finance (DeFi) is transforming the traditional financial world, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick has launched a new platform called Infinex. 
The new project aims to further revolutionize the DeFi sector by eliminating some of its most significant barriers: wallet configuration, asset bridging, and gas fees. With this innovative initiative, Warwick intends to simplify access to and use of decentralized finance, making it more accessible to a wider audience.

Infinex’s vision to revolutionize DeFi
Infinex was born out of the need to make DeFi more inclusive and less intimidating for novice users. Currently, one of the biggest obstacles users face is the complexity of managing digital wallets and inter-chain transactions, often accompanied by high transaction fees, known as “gas fees”. 
These elements can discourage many potential users who find the existing system too complex or too expensive.
Warwick’s vision for Infinex is clear: to eliminate these complexities and create a DeFi ecosystem that is as simple as it is effective. “We want to break down the barriers that prevent many people from entering the world of decentralized finance,” Warwick stated. 
Infinex introduces various innovative features to reduce the complexity of DeFi. First and foremost, the platform promises a simplified wallet setup that can be completed with just a few clicks, eliminating the need for complicated security procedures or private key management, often seen as intimidating by new users.
Furthermore, Infinex aims to facilitate the bridging of assets between different blockchains. Traditionally, transferring assets from one network to another is a process that can be both costly and subject to delays, due to the different speeds and capacities of blockchain networks. Infinex uses proprietary technology that allows for fast and low-cost transfers, making interoperability between different blockchains a more seamless and accessible reality.
Another significant innovation of Infinex is the elimination of gas fees, which are often a major deterrent for frequent transactions or for users operating on limited budgets. Infinex has developed a mechanism that allows to manage these fees more efficiently, potentially subsidizing or completely eliminating the cost for end users.
Expected Impact on the DeFi Sector
The introduction of Infinex could have a significant impact on the DeFi sector, especially in terms of accessibility and mass adoption. By reducing the complexities and costs associated with DeFi operations, Infinex not only attracts a new segment of users but also promotes greater financial inclusion. This expanded accessibility could result in increased liquidity and transaction volume within the DeFi ecosystem, further enhancing its growth and stability.
Despite the optimism, the road to success for Infinex is not without challenges. Security remains a predominant concern, especially when simplifying processes that traditionally require rigorous security measures. Additionally, the platform will need to demonstrate its reliability and scalability in an environment that is constantly under siege from new and sophisticated cyber attacks.
In conclusion, with the launch of Infinex, Kain Warwick not only continues to consolidate his position as a leader in the field of DeFi but also paves the way for potential transformations in the way users interact with decentralized financial technologies. If Infinex manages to overcome its initial challenges, it could very well become a fundamental pillar in the increasingly inclusive and accessible architecture of decentralized finance.

More crypto AI alliances emerge following $7.5B token merger

On May 13, blockchain AI platform ChainGPT will hold the initial dex offering (IDO) of its launchpad project, Wisdomise AI, in conjunction with KuCoin and Gate.io. Wisedomise is an AI-powered crypto adviser and investment assistant that helps users learn, predict, and execute digital asset trades. Ilan Rakhmanov, CEO and Founder of ChainGPT, said that the tool allows users to use "advanced AI algorithms" for engaging in digital asset marketplaces. Wisedomise is currently targeting an IDO with a fully diluted valuation of $20 million. Meanwhile, ChainGPT uses language learning models (LLM) to build AI-powered chatbots and news aggregators and is currently valued at $236 million, based on its native token. Similarly, on May 3, web3 base layer KIP Protocol said it would partner with GPU cloud infrastructure provider Aethir to accelerate AI development on both networks. Through the collaboration, KIP would deploy its KnowledgeFi monetization system and decentralized retrieval augmented generation (dRAG) framework, used by AI models to dynamically gather information after user prompts, to Aethir. Likewise, Aethir will allow KIP Protocol to access its fleet of 40,000 GPUs and 3,000 NVIDIA H100s for generating AI prompts. Julian Peh, co-founder and CEO of KIP Protocol, stated that the two protocols are in alignment over the firm's use of Aethir's computing resources for powering its AI asset deployment and monetization tools. Last month, the three biggest players in the crypto AI industry, SingularityNet, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, approved a $7.5 billion token merger, creating the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) project. The ASI is currently examining three distinct product pipelines: deployment of AI agents in commercial settings, neural symbolic language learning models (LLMs), and AI data sharing and utilization. “In the near term, we anticipate generating revenue as we launch the agentic network for deployment,” Humayun Sheikh, chairman of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and CEO of Fetch.ai, told Cointelegraph in a statement. “In the short term, we’ll focus on deploying numerous commercial products that breathe life into AI applications.”Despite the hype, scammers have also begun taking advantage of unsuspecting users drawn by the crypto AI frenzy. On May 5, blockchain security firm CertiK reported that the Genius Crypto Token GNUS.ai was exploited for $1.27 million. After exploiting the developers' private wallet on Discord, an attacker allegedly created a fake GNU token on Fantom blockchain and copied the code from GNUS.ai's Ethereum Chain, thereby converting the fake GNU tokens to genuine GNUS.ai tokens on Fantom. Afterward, the attacker bridged 500,000 worth of illicitly minted GNUS.ai tokens from Fantom to Ethereum and sold them for $1.27 million. Related: OKX Ventures invests in Web3 ‘play ARPG to train AI’ game Blade of God X

                        President Joe Biden’s stringent crypto policies could jeopardize his re-election bid, according to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams. On May 13, Adams warned of the potential consequences that the administration could face at the November polls.Adams expressed concerns about President Biden and other Democrats’ perceived anti-crypto position, which could reduce the incumbent US president’s likelihood of re-election.Uniswap Founder Tags US SEC as Catalyst for Biden’s Potential Loss
He advised that anyone close to President Biden or within his leadership circle “should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto.”This is not the first time experts will predict how Biden’s stringent crypto policies could undermine his re-election chances.Shark Tank billionaire and crypto evangelist Mark Cuban joined the long list of critics that have blasted Biden’s crypto stance as a potential election killer. He pointed to SEC chair Gary Gensler’s aggressive crackdown and lawsuits against major crypto firms as a liability to the president’s bid.Cuban believes the 2024 US presidential election will take a new turn as crypto voters will influence the outcome, limiting Biden’s chances of a second term.Since becoming president, Biden has taken a hardline stance against the crypto sector. An Executive Order was signed in 2022, which referenced Terra’s $50-billion crash and “the wave of insolvencies” as reasons to “harness” crypto potential responsibly.Ever since, influential figures such as Senator Elizabeth Warren have advocated for stringent crypto industry regulations, as she claimed in March 2024 that crypto threatens US security and helps terrorists.Additionally, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has classified nearly all cryptocurrencies as securities, further complicating regulatory clarity regarding the crypto industry amid the recent probe of Uniswap.Meanwhile, the Republican candidate in the November 2024 election has been wooing crypto community members.In a recent speech, former US President and Republican Presidential candidate in the November 2024 election, Donald Trump, expressed support for crypto, criticizing Biden for his skeptical views and accusing him of being uninformed about crypto.Uniswap Founder Asserts that 40% of US Adults Own Crypto
Hayden Adams had previously highlighted the ongoing shift in the financial sector due to the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. He noted that 40% of adults in the US already own crypto, which could potentially threaten Biden’s election prospects given the growing influence of cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, the political tides seem to be shifting in favor of Trump. David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, revealed a month-long collaboration with Trump on a “comprehensive executive order.”Bailey also mentioned that other players in the crypto space are seeking to raise about $100 million to aid Trump’s campaign to ensure his return to the White House.

New Development in the Tether-XRP Conflict: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Steps Back - Bitcoin Sistemi


Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, the company behind XRP, claimed in his recent statement that the US government was going after Tether (USDT).
On the other hand, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino published a long response and said that an 'uninformed' CEO was spreading fear about USDT, referring to Garlinghouse. He also reminded that Ripple is under investigation by the SEC and intends to launch a USDT rival stablecoin.


However, Garlinghouse also said in the podcast program in which he made his controversial remarks that he saw Tether as very important for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. He added that he did not know how to predict what impact potential US regulatory action against Tether would have on the crypto ecosystem.
Garlinghouse published a response and took a step back after Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino lashed out at him.





Ripple CEO said that his intention was not to attack Tether. In addition, he also reminded that his next words in the podcast were that Tether was very important for the ecosystem.

Garlinghouse said that his statement was intended to remind that the US government demands more control over dollar-based stablecoin companies and that Tether, the largest company in this field, is also in its targets.

Bernstein Argues Bitcoin's 'Flattish' Price Action is Great for Public Miners - Benzinga

Analysts at research and brokerage firm Bernstein aren't worried about the "flattish" price action of Bitcoin BTC/USD, arguing that it can be great for miners — when economics are driven by competitive hash-rate wars. "Bitcoin price action has been flattish, but we don't fear any major drawdown here" Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "We expect Bitcoin to remain range bound (high 50Ks to low 60Ks) and break out on the upside to continue its upward adoption trajectory, as Bitcoin ETFs see allocation from RIAs, wealth platforms and other institutional funds." Bitcoin is currently trading for around $62,800, according to The Block's price page.Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Strong start, slowing demand: The first 4 months of US spot bitcoin ETFs - Blockworks


The financial world prefers quarterly reviews. But US spot bitcoin ETFs have been alive for one-third of a year, and now seems as good a time as any for a look back.  
The sample size captures bitcoin hitting a new all-time high and seeing some corrections since the Jan. 11 ETF launches.
Oh yeah, and adding a fourth month captures the demand (or lack thereof) for bitcoin ETFs after per-block rewards for mining the asset were cut in half last month.
One headline number: US spot bitcoin ETFs have notched net inflows of about $11.7 billion.
Another noteworthy stat: Those inflows occurred despite the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) enduring net outflows of $17.6 billion.
Profit-taking by ETF investors, as well as the Federal Reserve’s likely higher-rates-for-longer posturing, have resulted in a demand drop-off for BTC in recent weeks, according to analysts. Bitcoin’s price (BTC) — at roughly $63,000 Monday at 12 pm ET — is down about 6% from a month ago.
Industry watchers had said it would be hard to sustain the pace of some of the most successful ETF launches of all time.
Read more: Macro headwinds could spur a ‘boring’ bitcoin summer — or something worse
The category’s inflow total once stood above $12.5 billion before a month-plus of outflows brought the category back down to Earth.
Net money exiting the funds over the last five weeks (since April 8) stands at $931 million, according to Farside Investors data. Last week’s positive flows of $117 million broke a four-week bleeding streak. 
Crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) volumes — the majority of which come from US spot bitcoin ETFs — have continued to slide, CoinShares research head James Butterfill wrote in a Monday report.The offerings saw volumes of roughly $8 billion last week, compared to the $17 billion average in April.“These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges, relative to 31% last month,” Butterfill added.
Even BlackRock, Fidelity see demand slow 
Perhaps as expected, products by BlackRock and Fidelity were able to capitalize on their renowned brands and deep client networks out of the gate to attract the most investor assets.
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) so far have net inflows amounting to $15.5 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively.
Both offerings enjoyed unprecedented inflow gains for new ETFs.
FBTC saw net inflows during its first 63 days before the streak ended on April 12. The takeaway: It saw about $8 billion of net money enter the fund in those first 63 days, and just $94 million in the 21 trading days since. 
IBIT’s run lasted 71 days, before the fund notched a zero in that category on April 24.   
So, the fund’s net inflows were nearly $15.5 billion in the first 71 trading days. They are $24 million in the last 13 trading days.
BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF looked poised to pass GBTC in assets under management weeks ago. But the recent demand slowdown has kept Grayscale’s fund in the lead — at about $17.6 billion to $16.6 billion, as of market close on Friday.
IBIT’s trading volumes were roughly $3.6 billion last week, a Blockworks analysis of Yahoo Finance data shows. That gave it a daily average of $720 million, down from a nearly $1.1 billion daily volume average the week before.  
GBTC saw its lowest weekly outflow since January from May 6 to May 10, at $171 million. The fund saw its first daily net inflow, gaining $63 million on May 3. 
Read more: Bitcoin ETF snapshot: GBTC surprise helps end sector’s seven-day outflow run 
Still, like IBIT, the Grayscale fund’s daily volumes average dipped to $338 million last week, according to Yahoo Finance data — down from a daily mark of $446 million from April 29 to May 3.
Financial advisers are expected to contribute massively to future inflows, with some revealing in recent filings that they already hold millions of dollars worth of positions in various BTC funds.

Christopher Jensen, crypto research director at bitcoin ETF issuer Franklin Templeton, told Blockworks in an April interview that more institutional investors are considering including bitcoin within long-term investment portfolios.
“There are lots of platforms, there are lots of institutions that are interested and are doing work,” Jensen said at the time. “So we don’t think the flows for the ETPs are done even though they’ve cooled off in recent weeks.”

Why Bitcoin holders may need to wait a bit longer for $70K - AMBCrypto



Buying momentum on Coinbase decreased, suggesting a further decline for Bitcoin.
The negative Sharpe Ratio indicated that BTC might not produce good gains in the short term.

Bitcoin [BTC] might experience another downturn, according to signals from the Coinbase Premium Index.
This index shows the level of buying pressure among investors in the U.S.— especially as the nation has a high number of Bitcoin holders.
High premium values indicate an increase in buying pressure. On the other hand, a low reading of the Coinbase Premium Index suggests a surge in sell-offs.
The big players are letting go
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis using CryptoQuant, the index was -0.050 at press time. This was a sign that many U.S. Bitcoin holders were selling instead of accumulating.
Source: CryptoQuant
Signal Quant, a wallet profiler and author on CryptoQuant commented on the trend.
According to the handle, the state of this leading indicator means that Bitcoin’s price might experience another correction before a significant bounce.
“The current Coinbase Premium trend is currently positive, close to zero. So if the historical pattern repeats itself, we may have a better chance of success if we wait a bit longer and invest in the rebound after the trend turns negative.”
At press time, the price of BTC was $62,785 — a 2.94% increase in the last 24 hours. Coming from the analysis above, this price increase might not last long.
But if users in the U.S. start to buy in large numbers, this bearish outlook might be invalidated. However, AMBCrypto considered other metrics to confirm it a rise beyond Bitcoin’s current peak could take more time.
Risky season is here
To do this, we looked at the Sharpe Ratio. In simple terms, this metric tells you whether to take a risk with an investment or not.
If the Sharpe Ratio is positive, it means that the potential Return On Investment (ROI) might be great compared to the risk involved.
Furthermore, a negative Sharpe Ratio indicates that the possible reward might not be worth the risk. This was the case with Bitcoin, as blockchain analytics tool Messari showed that the reading was -2.22.
Source: Messari
However, returns for BTC might start to rise once the metric rises to the zero midpoint. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s total supply in profits was 87.03%.
For a significant bounce to occur, the percentage might need to decrease. And a reasonable point for it to drop to could be 78.20%. This was the same profit supply Bitcoin had before it rallied back in March.
If the supply declines to a similar level, BTC might begin a run that could take it above $75,000.

In addition, the one-day circulation was down to 17,600, indicating that the number of coins engaged in transactions has decreased.
Should the circulation increase, Bitcoin might begin another trip down the charts.

Hyperinflation Warning: US Bizman, Author Tells Businesses To Stack Bitcoin


								Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the bestselling personal finance book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” has fired another financial warning shot, this time targeting the US dollar and a potential challenger – a gold-backed stablecoin from the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).

Kiyosaki, a longtime advocate for “real money” like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, fears the BRICScoin could trigger hyperinflation in the US, causing the dollar to lose its global dominance and ultimately collapse.
Hyperinflation Or Hyperbole?
While Kiyosaki paints a stark picture of a dollar deluge flooding the US economy, experts remain divided on the BRICScoin’s true impact. The very existence of the stablecoin is still under discussion within the BRICS alliance.
If it does materialize, its primary purpose would likely be to facilitate internal trade between member countries, potentially reducing their dependence on the US dollar for international transactions.


This shift could undoubtedly chip away at the dollar’s global hegemony, but financial experts are more cautious than Kiyosaki when it comes to predicting hyperinflation. The US economy, despite its challenges, still holds significant weight. A complete dollar collapse seems unlikely in the immediate future.
On Hyperinflation And Stablecoins
So, what exactly is a BRICScoin, and why does Kiyosaki fear it so much? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a real-world asset, like gold, to prevent the wild price fluctuations often associated with traditional cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $62.584. Chart: TradingView
A gold-backed BRICScoin would theoretically offer stability and potentially challenge the dominance of the US dollar in international trade, particularly for commodities like oil currently priced in dollars.
Kiyosaki: A Prophet Or Provocateur?
Kiyosaki is no stranger to bold financial predictions. While his “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” series has sold millions of copies, some of his past forecasts haven’t materialized.
His dire warnings about the US dollar and hyperinflation should be taken with a grain of salt, especially considering his vested interest in promoting alternative assets like gold and Bitcoin.
Beyond The Hype: Building A Resilient Portfolio

The BRICS stablecoin, if it materializes, is unlikely to be an overnight revolution. But it could signal a shift in the global financial landscape. The US, facing a potential erosion of its dollar dominance, might have to focus on strengthening its own economic fundamentals.

Uniswap CEO warns US President to reverse course on crypto policies

Hayden Adams, the founder and CEO of decentralized exchange Uniswap, called on United States President Joe Biden to consider how voters think about crypto when they enter ballot boxes in November.In a May 12 X post, Adams claimed there was “not much time” for President Biden to change the perception many crypto-focused voters had of his administration’s policies on digital assets. According to the Uniswap CEO, the U.S. President was making a “miscalculation” of assuming crypto would be irrelevant in the 2024 elections and allowing Senator Elizabeth Warren and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to “wage total war” on the technology.“Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto,” said Adams. “Not much time for Biden to save it. Anyone close to him or [Democratic] leadership should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto (public support/plan and reigning in sec + warren).”Source: Hayden AdamsIn November, U.S. voters will choose whether to elect President Biden to a second term. Since taking office in 2021, he signed one of the first executive orders to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and nominated Gary Gensler as the SEC Chair. Under Gensler, the SEC has ramped up enforcement actions against crypto firms offering services or products to U.S. residents, resulting in many criticizing the commission for a seemingly inconsistent approach to digital assets. The regulator has civil cases pending against Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple and Binance. Related: Neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump are crypto championsOn May 8, a majority of members of the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of a resolution that would overturn an SEC rule placing restrictions on banks holding customers’ crypto. Before the vote, President Biden said he intended to veto the resolution, letting the SEC’s Special Accounting Bulletin 121 stay in place.With fewer than six months until U.S. Election Day, many in and out of the crypto space have called out the Biden administration for its policies on digital assets — some as a warning like Adams, others as a criticism. Members of Congress are also moving forward with legislation to clarify the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would play in regulating crypto.Magazine: Opinion: GOP crypto maxis almost as bad as Dems’ ‘anti-crypto army’

Bitcoin price shows strength as investors anticipate return of money printing

Bitcoin (BTC) rose by 2% in the last 24-hours, recovering after two days of difficulty in surpassing the $61,500 resistance. By sustaining price levels above $62,500, the current upside movement demonstrates that Bitcoin can still experience positive price fluctuations regardless of the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows, which saw $100 million in net outflows over four days.U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF daily flows, USD million. Source: Farside InvestorsSeveral factors have improved sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, beginning with China's announcement of issuing $138 million in long-term bonds to boost the economy. Although this was expected since the announcement in March, it reaffirmed that governments are acknowledging increased risks of recession. This was in response to data indicating that China's aggregate credit decreased in April for the first time in seven years.Zou Wang, an investment director at Shanghai Anfang Private Fund Management, told Reuters that the market now anticipates further liquidity injections from China's central bank, possibly including cuts to interest rates. Such actions would exacerbate issues stemming from recent expansive measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), which led to an increase in the U.S. monetary supply in March for the first time in two years.U.S. M1 monetary base, USD. Source: Fed Saint LouisAt first glance, injecting more money into the economy seems beneficial, but it can lead to higher inflation over time, especially as companies and individuals might delay spending and investment. As fixed-income investors begin to recognize that their returns are barely keeping pace with rising inflation, scarce assets like Bitcoin could become more attractive.Ultimately, investors are likely preparing for a continuous trend where governments will need to keep providing liquidity to forestall economic crises. While some might argue that the stock market would primarily benefit from this added liquidity, high interest rates adversely affect companies by raising their capital costs. Any debt issued in the past 16 years will encounter significantly higher rates upon refinancing.Last week, Fed officials hinted that interest rates might stay elevated for an extended period, according to Yahoo Finance. Minneapolis Fed Chair Neel Kashkari notably stated, "I think it’s much more likely we would just sit here for longer than we expect,” and Chicago Fed Chair Austan Goolsbee remarked, "I think now we wait." This strategy, while seemingly contradicting the push for increased liquidity, is carefully designed to delay inflationary pressures.In essence, the U.S. central bank's actions are intended to encourage more borrowing by companies and individuals to support employment and consumer markets. However, what the Fed cannot foresee is how much of this borrowed money will be spent on scarce assets to hedge against inflation, rather than stimulating the economy. It appears too early to fully evaluate such risks, but Bitcoin investors are skeptical about the Fed’s chances of achieving a soft landing.Related: Japanese listed firm adds Bitcoin as reserve asset with 117 BTCAdditionally, Bitcoin's value was influenced on May 13 by an unexpected factor: the return of social media influencer "Roaring Kitty," a former marketer who played a pivotal role in the GameStop (GME) stock rally in 2021. Having been inactive on the X social network for nearly three years, the Bitcoin community appears hopeful for some form of remarkable influence from this personality.Cryptocurrency investors anticipate a positive shift in sentiment toward digital assets, fueled by a growing distrust in banks and traditional finance, especially in light of recent government bailouts, including the rescue of Philadelphia-based Republic First Bank. These investors believe that these developments may drive more participants toward cryptocurrencies.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Crypto ETPs See First Institutional Inflows in Five Weeks, With $130,000,000 Hitting Markets: CoinShares - The Daily Hodl


								Digital assets manager CoinShares says institutions resumed investing in crypto products last week after a five-week break.
In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares finds that digital asset investment products brought in $130 million in inflows last week after four weeks of outflows.










“Digital asset investment products saw inflows for the first time in five weeks totaling $130 million. ETP (exchange-traded product) volumes continue to subside, though, with $8 billion for the week compared to $17 billion average in April. These volumes highlight ETP investors are participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present, representing 22% of total volumes on global trusted exchanges relative to 31% last month.”
Source: CoinShares
Regionally, the US led inflows with $135 million. While Switzerland and Hong Kong also saw crypto ETP inflows of $14 million and $19 million, Canada and Germany saw outflows of $20 million and $15 million.
“Hong Kong, after a prior week of record inflows, saw just US $19 million inflows, suggesting the majority of the first-week post-Bitcoin ETF launches were seed capital.”
Bitcoin (BTC) ETPs, per usual, led crypto products with $144 million in inflows. Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), XRP and Litecoin (LTC) also enjoyed inflows of $5.9 million, $1.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively, Ethereum (ETH) products suffered $14.4 million in outflows.
“Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF (exchange-traded fund) issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent, this has been reflected in outflows which totaled $14 million last week.”

Tether CEO Dismisses SEC Probe Rumors as Malicious FUD - DailyCoin


        
Brad Garlinghouse warned of impending enforcement action against Tether.



Tether’s CEO wrote off the claim as fear-mongering.



Ripple is planning to launch a competing stablecoin product.
Tether has carved out a dominant position as the world’s leading stablecoin provider, with USDT boasting the highest trading volume and largest market capitalization. However, the company has faced persistent doubts over the years, particularly on the matter of its reserves being sufficient to cover all of the tokens it has issued.Playing on these doubts, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently warned that Tether is currently under investigation by US authorities. However, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has since pushed back, dismissing Garlinghouse’s claim as intentional fear-mongering and malicious misinformation from a rival.Tether is Number 1 For a Reason: ArdoinoArdoino fired back at Garlinghouse by deriding his comments as baseless fear-mongering from an “uninformed CEO,” whose own company is currently engaged in a high-profile legal battle with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).
Doubling down, the Tether chief asserted that USDT has rightly earned its status as the leading stablecoin thanks to its proven track record, solid backing from top-tier custodians, and robust compliance measures, which included respecting OFAC sanctions lists, training investigators monitoring blockchain activity, and working hand-in-hand with law enforcement agencies globally to stamp out criminality.Ardoino also emphasized USDT’s vital role in underbanked emerging markets, where millions rely on the stablecoin for spending and saving. Turning the tables, the Tether boss alleged that Garlinghouse’s alarming statements were likely motivated by Ripple launching a competing stablecoin product, with the comments being an attempt to undermine Tether’s reputation. Industry-Wide RiskGarlinghouse’s alarming statements about Tether came from a recent interview in which he expressed concerns about the impact of a US authorities’ Tether probe. The Ripple boss stated that the crypto industry has demonstrated a high degree of resilience following the imprisonment of Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao.
However, Garlinghouse warned that another “black swan” type event is inevitable, with US investigations into Tether’s operations a foreseeable event that worries him the most."The US govt is going after Tether. That is clear to me," claimed Garlinghouse. Given that Tether is deeply rooted across the crypto ecosystem, Garlinghouse expressed apprehension about the potential industry-wide impact of any major regulatory actions against the stablecoin.On the Flipside
Garlinghouse did not provide a source for his claim that the US government is coming for Tether.

Why This MattersTether’s persistent challenges have highlighted the stablecoin industry’s struggles to establish credibility and build public trust amid increased scrutiny.

Tether CEO Claps Back At 'Uninformed' Ripple CEO's Criticism - Benzinga

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino on Monday targeted Ripple XRP/USD CEO Brad Garlinghouse, labeling him “an uninformed CEO” and criticizing his commentary on its stablecoin, USDT/USD, during ongoing SEC investigations and Ripple’s own stablecoin launch.What Happened: Ardoino’s tweet vehemently defended USDT’s credibility and emphasized its crucial role in global finance, especially in developing regions where traditional banking services often fail to reach the unbanked population.Ardoino used the platform to underline the stability and reliability of USDT, describing it as key for communities in unbanked regions.He pointed out that USDT serves as both a transactional and a savings medium, providing essential financial services where conventional banks have not.“USDT has consistently demonstrated strong price stability, ample liquid reserves, and adherence to high compliance standards with premier custodians,” Ardoino tweeted, countering the negative portrayal of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies often seen in mainstream media. He argued that such biased reports protect traditional financial interests while overshadowing the substantial benefits that cryptocurrencies like USDT offer to global finance.Further delving into Tether’s operational practices, Ardoino highlighted the company's rigorous compliance measures, including adherence to OFAC/SDN lists and a robust internal investigation framework that utilizes advanced tools for monitoring market activities.Also Read: Arthur Hayes: ‘Major Economies To Print Even More Money’ In The Next 24 MonthsTether's proactive approach is evidenced by its collaboration with 124 law enforcement agencies globally and the use of sophisticated software from partnerships with companies like Chainalysis, he said.Ardoino noted Tether’s aggressive stance against illegal activities, having blocked over $1.3 billion related to scams and hacks, and approximately $1.6 million linked to terrorist financing. “Tether has responded to 198 law enforcement requests in the past year alone, significantly collaborating with U.S. law enforcement to block harmful transactions totaling over $639 million,” Ardoino shared, emphasizing Tether's commitment to safety and regulatory compliance.The CEO also highlighted Tether’s international cooperation, citing strong relationships with entities like Israel's NBCTF and Ukraine law enforcement. Unlike other stablecoins that often require judicial orders to act, Tether's policy allows for immediate responsive measures to threats and illegal activities.What’s Next: As discussions about cryptocurrency’s role in global finance continue to evolve, these themes will likely be explored further at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.The event will delve into the impact of regulatory actions, the role of stablecoins, and the technological advancements shaping the financial landscape, providing a platform for critical dialogue on these pressing issues.Read Next: ‘Republicans Smell Blood In The Water:’ Uniswap CEO Warns Democrats Of ‘Swing States Level Miscalculation’ On CryptoImage: Shutterstock

OpenAI Shows Off Voice Chatbot, Touts New GPT-4o AI Model - Decrypt

ChatGPT developer OpenAI today announced its latest AI model, GPT-4o—the “O” stands for “omnimodel”—during a spring product update live stream, along with a slew of product updates, including a voice chatbot.OpenAI updated its mobile apps immediately following its announcements and also launched a desktop app for ChatGPT. The company emphasized improvements to its user experience, which it says allows people to better focus on the conversations they have with ChatGPT.“For the past couple of years, we’ve been very focused on improving the intelligence of these models, and they’ve gotten pretty good,” OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati said. “But this is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to ease of use.”The livestream emphasized a simplified and more holistic approach to generative AI. An “omnimodel”—or natively multimodal—system does everything within its core application instead of coordinating among GPT for text, GPT Vision for images, and so on.“We think it's very, very important that people have an intuitive feel for what the technology can do, so we really want to pair it with this broader understanding,” Murati said.She noted that GPT-4o will be available to both paid and free ChatGPT users, as well as users of ChatGPT’s API. Paid ChatGPT subscribers, Murati added, will continue to have access to up to five times the system capacity of free users. Everyone, she said, should be able to access OpenAI tools.”We're always finding ways to reduce that friction, and recently, we made ChatGPT available without the signup flow,” she noted. In April, OpenAI allowed users to access ChatGPT 3.5 without signing up for an account. OpenAI then showcased ChatGPT’s ability to hold a real-time casual conversation with users, demonstrating a variety of tones and emotions. The demo included ChatGPT singing, laughing, and joking with the OpenAI engineers. The company also claimed that ChatGPT can now determine a user’s emotional state using the mobile phone’s front-facing camera.A new blog post outlined the major developments announced today, leading with “much more natural human-computer interaction.”“It accepts as input any combination of text, audio, and image and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs,” the company wrote. “It can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in a conversation.”Even before today's announcements, AI and tech enthusiasts suggested a voice chatbot powered by a next-generation AI model would make the personal companions depicted in the sci-fi movie “Her” a reality—including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a cryptic, one-word Twitter post.Using the ChatGPT desktop application, the OpenAI engineers showed that software code could be copied into ChatGPT, allowing the engineer to chat with ChatGPT about it. In the demo, OpenAI also showcased ChatGPT’s ability to perform real-time language translations. ChatGPT was additionally shown explaining a math problem after a photo of the equation was submitted to the app.OpenAI and the broader generative AI industry have publicly committed to fight the use of their technology in the creation of AI-generated deepfakes. OpenAI acknowledged today that GPT-4o presents new safety challenges given its real-time audio and vision capabilities.“Our team has been hard at work figuring out how to build mitigations against misuse,” Murati said. “We continue to work with different stakeholders out there—from government, media, entertainment, red teamers, and civil society—to figure out how to best bring these technologies into the world.”Rumors had been circulating since the beginning of the month about OpenAI’s big announcement, ranging from the release of GPT-5, ChatGPT powering Apple’s new version of Siri, and AI-powered search ahead of Google’s anticipated announcement on May 14. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI and Apple closed a deal that would bring OpenAI’s technology to the iPhone.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to Twitter to calm the waters on Friday, tweeting, “Not GPT-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love! Feels like magic to me.”Launched in 2015 by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, OpenAI and its wildly popular ChatGPT released in November 2022 have dominated the conversation surrounding generative AI. With close ties and investments from Microsoft, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Dall-E 3 have been integrated into Microsoft's suite of Office 365 tools and the new Copilot AI assistant.In March, Musk sued OpenAI and Altman, claiming that the AI developer had prioritized Microsoft’s commercial interests over the public good.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Andrew Tate seems confused as he dumps bitcoin to buy GameStop


Andrew Tate claims he’s cashed in a portion of his bitcoin holdings and invested the funds into GameStop following a new wave of hype around the controversial stock. However, he can’t seem to decide on a figure. 
Tate initially said he made a $50,000 investment into GameStop before changing this to half a million. He then upped the ante even more, claiming that he’d actually allotted $6 million worth of his crypto to destroy hedge funds.
The hype around GameStop was fuelled by the return of investment-focused social media personality Roaring Kitty, who helped inspire the initial GameStop rally in 2021.

When Kitty posted on X (formerly Twitter) for the first time in three years today, GameStop’s price reportedly doubled. In response, Nasdaq has halted the trading of the stock 18 times today, likely due to the sudden price swings. 
However, these swings apparently haven’t deterred Tate, who claims he’ll hold onto the stock regardless as “PERMA DONATIONS TO THE CAUSE AGAINST THE SYSTEM.” 
The controversial influencer then described the investment as a ‘spiritual battle’ and claimed that it’s about “pissing off some dork somewhere on wall street with a fucking vaccine and a tiny Johnson.”

Tate still faces legal troubles in a number of court cases, including four women in the UK suing him over alleged rape and assault and the continuation of his human trafficking case in Romania.

                        Chinese workers are showing a lack of enthusiasm towards the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC). A report on May 13 revealed that some workers who received their salaries in digital yuan (e-CNY) converted the asset into fiat currency immediately after they were paid, indicating a clear preference for physical cash over the digital alternative.Despite the Chinese government’s efforts to promote the adoption of the digital yuan, a report from the local media outlet South China Morning Post indicates that many workers are hesitant to use it in their daily transactions.Chinese Workers CBDC Concerns Leans on Lack of UtilityThe report surveyed responses from local workers and detailed the reason behind China’s slow uptake of the digital yuan.Ye Dongyan, a researcher at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, highlighted the need to balance privacy and security, which has slowed the progress of promoting the digital yuan.“Paper currency is used anonymously, but the digital yuan is different,” he said. “The boundaries between information tracking and information security protection need more deliberation.”Workers in the Chinese civil service also expressed their thoughts on the use of the CBDC.Andrew Wang, a civil servant, said he wasn’t too worried by the idea of digital cash as it was only a small part of his salary being paid in digital yuan. His wife, who receives her full salary in digital yuan, however, withdraws the full amount as regular cash the moment she’s paid due to a lack of utility with the digital currency.He explained that she couldn’t deposit the funds or buy financial products with the e-CNY wallet, which limits the use cases and makes cash a better alternative.It could be recalled that China started trials of the digital yuan in selected cities in 2019, looking for a nationwide rollout amidst fierce global competition to establish a state-backed digital currency. While no specific timeline has been announced for the national launch, the country has actively promoted the currency since the trials began.China’s Digital Yuan Recorded $250B in Processed Transactions
Yi Gang, the former governor of the People’s Bank of China, told the South China Morning Post that over $250 billion in transactions were processed using the digital yuan as of mid-2023.He highlighted that privacy was still a major issue despite the substantial volumes, however.Unlike traditional cash, which allows for anonymous transactions, digital yuan is traceable, giving the government a high level of visibility into individuals’ financial activities. The lack of privacy raises concerns about surveillance and the potential abuse of personal financial data.While Gang’s concern borders on privacy, a top Chinese law firm analyzed the anti-money laundering (AML) challenges posed by the digital yuan. It highlighted the cross-border nature of digital currency transactions, which can complicate traditional AML monitoring methods.Regardless, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world’s largest bank by total assets, revealed in its annual report that over 15 million e-CNY wallets were newly created by individuals in 2023, with an additional creation of 1.3 million wallets by business entities, while over 2.7 million businesses joined the list of those accepting the digital currency.Crypto News reported in February that over 29.16 million digital yuan wallets have been opened in Suzhou, China, as individuals and firms transacted over $416,811,390,000 worth of CBDC in 2023.The digital yuan is now utilized in various public services, including tax and social security payments, which are in addition to personal expenditures.

Bitfarms Sees Stock Dip Following CEO Termination


Bitfarms announced the termination of Geoffrey Morphy as its interim President and CEO. 
This decision came shortly after Morphy filed a lawsuit against the company, seeking $27 million in damages for claims including breach of contract and wrongful dismissal. 
Bitfarms Shares Fall Over 6%
The company has dismissed Morphy’s claims as baseless and has vowed to defend itself vigorously in the Superior Court of Ontario.
Morphy’s termination marks a tumultuous period for Bitfarms, which is currently navigating various challenges in the crypto-mining sector. The industry suffers from rising energy costs and intense competition, compounded by the recent Bitcoin halving that has significantly cut revenue from mining operations. 

As Bitfarms continues its search for a CEO, Nicolas Bonta, co-founder and chairman, has stepped in as the interim leader. The company expressed confidence that the executive search is nearing completion, with an appointment expected in the coming weeks.

“The CEO executive search is nearing completion and that the Company will be appointing a new CEO in the next several weeks,” the company wrote.

The market reacted negatively to Morphy’s firing, with Bitfarms’ shares falling over 6% on the announcement day. Such price action reflects concerns over the company’s stability and future direction, according to Javier Bastardo, Bitcoin Ambassador at Bitfinex.

“Companies in this sector must have a solid structure and know how to navigate different market conditions. However, disputes like this reduce their competitiveness, so beyond the negligible influence I believe this news will have on the industry, it raises questions about the company’s business and leadership,” Bastardo told BeInCrypto. 

Last year, Bitfarms CEO Emiliano Grodzki resigned and was replaced by Geoffrey Morphy, who was fired this year. This comes amid a disastrous year for Bitcoin miners, which caused some large companies to declare bankruptcy.

Stand With Crypto PAC launches as industry interest in campaign funding ramps up - Blockworks


There’s a new crypto Political Action Committee (PAC) on the scene. 
Coinbase-initiated nonprofit Stand With Crypto announced it is launching a new PAC Friday. 
The associated PAC, which means only individual Stand With Crypto members can contribute up to $5,000 each, plans to back “candidates who support the crypto community,” the nonprofit said on X Friday. 
Stand With Crypto, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, launched last summer as an effort to give crypto fans more access to information about policy makers and candidates, leaders said. 
“This is a grassroots, organic bottom-up effort,” Kara Calvert, Coinbase’s head of US policy, said in August 2023 when announcing the new initiative. 
“It can provide a lot of tools to people, they can learn about the members of Congress, they can access a scorecard, they can access a legislative action portal…it will really give them the tools that they need to engage with their members of Congress,” Calvert added. 
Read more from our opinion section: Only a fool would vote on crypto alone
While federal law makes contributions to the PAC tricky, companies and individuals are free to make donations to the nonprofit itself. Crypto payments operation Moonpay on Monday announced a $1 million pledge, an effort the company said was inspired by upcoming elections. 
“Today, two things are abundantly clear: This year’s election will define the future of our industry in the United States, and it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that want to positively advance crypto innovation for everyone,” Ivan Soto-Wright, Moonpay CEO, said in a statement Monday. 
Stand With Crypto’s PAC comes on the scene as crypto-focused Super PAC trio Defend American Jobs, Fairshake and Protect Progress continue to dish out cash. The three groups have collectively deployed $31,752,033.81 so far this calendar year, according to Federal Election Commission filings.

The PACs made a big financial push during the March Congressional primary cycle, doling out more than $10.1 million to fund advertisements against Rep. Katie Porter, the incumbent Democrat from California who ultimately lost her bid for the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat. 
The trio is also backing Alabama Democrat Shomari Figures, who is vying for a US House seat in November. Protect Progress donated close to $2 million during his primary campaign in March and April, filings show. 
Stand With Crypto has not yet filed contribution and disbursement forms with the FEC, but has revealed its first five endorsements: Figures; Jim Banks, a Republican running for Senate in Indiana; Jim Justice, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia; Eddy Morales, a Democrat running to represent Oregon’s Third District; and Troy Downing, a Republican running to represent Montana’s Second District.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Pumped And Retraced After The Last Inflation Data Release - What To Expect This Month? - Benzinga

With key inflation data scheduled for release this week, Benzinga takes a look at what cryptocurrency traders predict its impact to be.What Happened: CrypNuevo predicts an aggressive market move in response to impending inflation data. He states, "I have the feeling that we’ll just push towards one direction in an aggressive way," acknowledging the possibility of being wrong in his assessment.Considering Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD recent price action, he notes the fact that range lows are acting as support after a deviation, which he considers a good sign.Another, crypto trader Kevin shares his thoughts on the current market sentiment, the impact of macroeconomic factors and potential scenarios for Bitcoin and altcoins. He sees the current Bitcoin price action as "okay" but "not great and not bad." Kevin attributes this ambiguity to the influence of macroeconomic policy and data, which could potentially sway the market in either direction. "It’s a toss-up on which way it breaks due to Macro policy and data," he notes.While the altcoins chart looks "hideous" on the daily timeframe, the weekly and higher timeframes for Total 2-3-Others still lean more bullish than bearish.He cautions, "If CPI comes in bad this week, I think Altcoins are in for a very bad time and I believe BTC will break down and we could see 50K. If it comes in better than expected I see the opposite occurring."Also Read: Bitcoin Up 3%: What Will Inflation Data And Powell Speech Bring This Week?Why It Matters: The crypto traders’ comments highlight the significant influence that macroeconomic factors, such as PPI, and CPI data, can have on the cryptocurrency market.As investors eagerly await the CPI and PPI data, the market remains in a state of uncertainty, with the potential for a sharp move in either direction. While the last three consecutive releases of inflation rates surpassed expectations, traders are awaiting the CPI report on May 15, which is forecasted (3.4%) to come in below the prior month (3.5%). The CPI index is predicted to decelerate from 0.4% to a 0.3% monthly pace.Goldman Sachs economists Manuel Abecasis and Spencer Hill predict a 1.6% rise in car insurance prices, while health insurance costs are expected to stabilize. Rent inflation has slowed to 0.37% while owner's Equivalent Rent (OER) inflation is expected to remain strong at 0.45%  Following the last inflation data (CPI) in mid-April, which saw a marginal increase in CPI data while PPI data saw a significant increase, Bitcoin traded 2.4% higher one day after the meeting, while Ethereum ETH/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD gained 0.71% and 0.91%, respectively. However, after the PPI data on the next day, there was a drop across the crypto board.At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $62,800, up 1.9% on the day. Ethereum and Dogecoin are up 0.1% and 6%, respectively.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class are topics expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Pumped After The Last FOMC Meeting—Will History Repeat On Wednesday?Image: Shutterstock

Ripple, XRPL Labs Eye Mass Adoption With DeRec Partnership - DailyCoin


        

Ripple and XRPL Labs have joined the DeRec Alliance.



Ripple has tipped the move to help bolster XRP and broader crypto adoption.



Ripple and XRPL Labs are joining over ten projects to standardize the crypto asset recovery system.




The crypto industry is always harping on mass adoption; however, the technology remains niche amid its complexity.



As part of efforts to make the technology more user-friendly, on January 11, 2024, the Algorand Foundation and Swirlds Labs introduced Decentralized Recovery (DeRec), a solution to simplify crypto asset recovery and interoperability backed by the DeRec Alliance, which includes several leading crypto firms working to standardize the solution across the industry. 




This Alliance has now received a significant boost from Ripple and XRPL Labs as they tip the effort to drive mass adoption for XRP and crypto.



Ripple XRPL Labs Join DeRec Alliance as Founding Members 



On May 9, Ripple and XRPL Labs announced they were joining Swirlds Labs and the Algorand Foundation as founding members of the DeRec Alliance, touting it as a step toward greater adoption of the XRP Ledger and crypto.



"The DeRec Alliance addresses one of the biggest challenges facing mainstream crypto adoption—secure and user-friendly management of private keys. Together, we can revolutionize how users manage their private keys, representing a major step forward for user security and adoption – not just for XRP Ledger users, but for everyone in crypto," RippleX Senior Vice President Markus Infanger noted.



For the uninitiated, DeRec is a system for storing and recovering sensitive information like crypto wallet private keys by breaking it into multiple pieces that are shared with a group of trusted “helpers,” such as friends or organizations. Users gather half of the shared pieces from helpers to recover the information. The DeRec Alliance, formed by multiple crypto projects, helps to standardize the process across various blockchains.



Alliance members nominate and vote for members of a Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), participate in quarterly meetings, and provide input on policy to be voted on by the elected TOC.




Per a press statement shared with DailyCoin, Ripple and XRPL Labs will serve two years on the TOC as founding members of the DeRec Alliance. On the TOC, they will provide input on the organization’s governance structure and core policies.



DeRec Another Step Closer to Industry-Wide Impact



Commenting on the importance of the Ripple and XRPL Labs membership, Algorand CTO John Woods enthused that DeRec inched closer to having an industry-wide impact with each notable partnership.



"I'm thrilled with the addition of these new members to the DeRec Alliance. As more and more influential projects join the Alliance, we reach the critical mass required for DeRec to yield its hugely positive impact on the industry," Woods noted.



The DeRec Alliance already boasts over ten members working across sectors like health and finance. These members include The HBAR Foundation, Casper Association, Acoer, BankSocial, and The Building Blocks.



On the Flipside 




The Ethereum network achieves some of the benefits DeRec does with EIP-4337.




Why This Matters



Crypto technology’s complexity continues to pose a hurdle to its mass adoption.

Crypto Price Predictions For 2024: Dogecoin To $2 And XRP To $3 | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Kyle Chasse has given his price predictions for different crypto tokens. His price targets for Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP were eye-catching, considering the heights he expects these coins to reach. 
Dogecoin To $2 And XRP To $3
Chasse mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin will climb to $2 and XRP to $3. His prediction for Dogecoin stands out given that other crypto analysts like Altcoin Sherpa have predicted that $1 is the highest level the crypto token can attain in this bull run. As such, Chasse’s prediction undoubtedly increases expectations for the meme coin in this cycle. 

Interestingly, Chasse’s prediction for Dogecoin still feels conservative, considering that crypto analyst Kevin (formerly Yomi OG) predicted that the meme coin could rally above $3 in this bull run based on its price action in previous bull markets. Unlike Chasse and Kevin, some are still skeptical of Dogecoin even rising to just $1. 
One of them is Pav Hundal, lead analyst for Australian exchange Swyftx, who explained why Dogecoin might not reach $1, stating that some bought the meme coin at the peak of the last bull and would want to take profits as soon as Dogecoin hits a new all-time high (ATH). He believes this category of investors can add significant selling pressure, affecting Dogecoin’s journey to $1. 
Meanwhile, Chasse’s prediction of XRP rising to $2 looks more conservative than ambitious, given other price predictions for the crypto token made so far. For instance, crypto analyst Ash Crypto predicts that XRP will reach as high as $5 in the next 12 to 16 months, while crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto claims that XRP can rise as high as $20. 
Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto is the most bullish of these analysts. He predicts that XRP can climb to $27 in this bull run. Egrag noted that the price target is feasible given XRP’s parabolic run in 2017, when it saw a 61,000% gain in 280 days. 
Price Predictions For Other Crypto Tokens
Chasse also outlined his price targets for other major crypto tokens, including Bitcoin. He expects the flagship crypto to reach $150,000 at the peak of this bull run. Chasse shares a sentiment similar to that of Tom Lee, co-founder of research firm Fundstrat, who predicts that Bitcoin will surge to $150,000 by year-end. 

Meanwhile, Chasse predicts that Ethereum will climb to $9500, another conservative prediction since crypto analysts like Mikybull Crypto predict that the second-largest crypto will climb to $20,000 in this bull run. Cardano also made Chasse’s list, with the crypto analyst predicting it would rise to $7. Chasse joins a growing list of crypto analysts who have made bullish predictions for Cardano despite its unimpressive price action.

Trader Who Called May 2021 Collapse Updates Bitcoin Outlook, Says Bottom Likely In for BTC - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								A trader who accurately called the beginning of the 2021 bear market meltdown says that the low for Bitcoin (BTC) is likely already in, based on historical patterns.
Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 190,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s monthly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator has slightly contracted, which traditionally signals that a bullish trend has at least temporarily lost steam.










The MACD is a momentum indicator that traders use to spot potential points of trend reversals.
But Dave the Wave says he doesn’t think the signal suggests that BTC’s price is headed much lower, as the MACD has not ascended anywhere near the same levels as previous bull runs.
“Yes, there is a contraction on the BTC monthly histogram, with momentum slowing, but I don’t count this definitive for price going significantly lower given:
1] the MACD had not reached the height of the line
2] a maturing market
It wouldn’t at all surprise me to see something different develop, pattern-wise, over the longer time frame.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that the monthly MACD of BTC has yet to come close to the diagonal resistance, indicating that the bull market is likely far from over.
On the weekly timeframe, the trader says that Bitcoin’s current MACD structure is reminiscent of July 2016, which was also right after the halving and just before a massive bull run.
“If I had to make a comparison of the current BTC weekly MACD to previous, I’d put it here.
Note that on the MACD cross highlighted, the price low was already in.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,448.

Bitcoin Has Officially Left the ‘Danger Zone’ As BTC Starts Week in the Green, According to Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst believes Bitcoin (BTC) is entering into a bullish reversal phase after a post-halving correction.
The pseudonymous analyst known as Rekt Capital tells his 466,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin seems to be following a 2016 cycle pattern when Bitcoin dipped after the halving event – during the so-called ‘danger zone’ – and then soared to new all-time highs (ATHs).










He says Bitcoin now appears to have exited the historic correction period on the weekly chart after April’s halving event when miners’ rewards were cut in half.
“The post-halving Bitcoin ‘danger zone’ (purple) is officially over. And Bitcoin is celebrating with a good bounce from the re-accumulation range low support.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
The analyst believes that Bitcoin has likely already reached its cycle post-halving bottom when it touched the $56,000 mark.
 “If $56,000 was not the bottom then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days. History, however, suggests that this current pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
According to the analyst, key support for Bitcoin is holding around $60,000 as momentum builds to the upside, which could send BTC to $68,000 again.
“Bitcoin is showing early-stage signs of slowing down in its sell-side momentum, slowly developing a curl against the ~$60000 support. ~$60000 needs to continue to hold as it has been holding thus far for this curl to progress and eventually lift up.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
Bitcoin is trading for $62,971 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

CertiK discovered $5M security flaw in Wormhole bridge on Aptos

A security flaw in the Wormhole bridge on Aptos network could have resulted in $5 million worth of losses had it not been discovered, according to a social media post from blockchain security platform CertiK. The platform claimed to have discovered the bug and reported it to the Wormhole team before it could be expl. The flaw has been patched, and the bridge is no longer vulnerable.Source: CertiK.Aptos is a blockchain network that uses the MOVE programming language, which was originally developed by Facebook for the Libra project. Supporters of MOVE claim that it is a safer language to write smart contracts when compared to Ethereum’s Solidity or other alternatives.The CertiK report was posted in the form of a video. It claimed the flaw “arose from an incorrect implementation of the ‘public(friend)’ and ‘entry’ modifiers in the MOVE programming language.” The ‘public(friend)’ modifier allows a function to be called by other functions within the same module or by external accounts specified on a “friends list,” but not by other callers. On the other hand, the ‘entry’ modifier specifies that a function can be called by any external account.The bridge contained a function called ‘publish_event,” which was used to announce events such as token transfers. It was only supposed to be callable by other functions within the same module or by certain “specified external entities.” However, in the version of the bridge that CertiK studied, the function was modified by both ‘public(friend)’ and ‘entry.’ This made it possible for anyone to call ‘publish_event,” even if they were not an approved caller.Because of this flaw, an attacker could have created fake transactions that appeared to move tokens from one account to another, even though no actual tokens were being moved. These “events” could have caused the Ethereum version of the bridge to mint or unlock tokens without having any real deposits backing them on the Aptos side. As a result, the attacker could have drained up to $5 million worth of funds from the bridge, CertiK stated.CertiK informed members of the Wormhole team about the flaw on Dec 5, 2023. After investigating the report, the team developed and tested a patch to close the security loophole and informed the protocol’s Guardians of the issue. Via a multisignature vote, the Guardians approved the patch to be implemented, and the protocol’s Aptos contract was upgraded to implement the new code. Once the flaw was reported, the process of fixing it took approximately three hours, and the new version of the bridge is no longer vulnerable to this exploit.Wormhole Aptos exploit timeline. Source: CertiK.In addition to removing the ‘entry’ keyword from the publish_event function, the new patch also restricted the value of the “governor rate limits” on Aptos from $5 million to $1 million, effectively preventing withdrawals from Aptos of greater than $1 million per day. This was done to limit losses in case of a future exploit. Current usage is below $1 million per day, CertiK claimed, implying that the rate limit shouldn’t affect most users.Wormhole also performed a “retrospective analysis” to determine whether any user funds had been affected by the issue. They concluded that no funds had been illicitly transferred and that users’ balances were safe.Wormhole hasn’t always managed to catch security flaws before they are exploited. In 2022, it lost more than $321 million when a bug in the Solana part of the bridge allowed an attacker to mint unbacked tokens. However, the team later patched the bug and compensated users. In January, Wormhole reclaimed $1 billion in total value locked for the first time since the incident, showing that some users feel its security practices have improved.Related: Bugs in Gains Network fork let traders profit 900% on every trade: Report

Another New Memecoin Trend Emerged Today - A Whale Got FOMO - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Onchain data, a trader made significant purchases and sales on the Solana network in the company's memecoin imitation, which is on the agenda today.
This token is a memecoin that has the same name as GameStop shares traded in the United States, but has no connection to the company.


Today, GameStop shares in the USA showed an incredible rise. The reason for the rise was that Keith Gill, nicknamed Roaring Kitty, one of the architects of the short squeeze on GameStop shares in 2021, returned to Twitter.
As GameStop shares rose, the memecoin called GME also recorded significant increases. GME price has climbed 1365% in the last 24 hours.





During this rise, a trader bought GME with SOL coin for $ 65 thousand after Roaring Kitty's Twitter account became active. Then, 14 hours later, he sold them for 336 thousand dollars. So this trader earned $271 thousand in just 14 hours.

On the other hand, a second whale wallet was caught by the FOMO effect of the increase in the GME token 3 months ago and bought a large amount of GME tokens by paying 408 thousand dollars. Even though the price of GME has fallen more than 90% since then, this whale never sold his assets. Today, thanks to the re-emergence of Roaring Kitty, it has compensated for its losses and has an unrealized profit of 282 thousand dollars at the time of writing this article.


However, many new memecoins emerged after their rise in GameStop. Another altcoin named GME has appeared on the Ethereum network this time. Cryptocurrency analysis platform Lookonchain, in its statement about this altcoin, found that someone who was previously aware of the project bought 34% of the total supply of the token with 17.7 thousand dollars. Analysts have warned that this whale has current assets of $1.96 million and could make a dump.

Bitcoin's bullish trend reinforced as 'danger zone' signals fade | Cryptopolitan

Bitcoin is seeing a strong upward push, shaking off earlier fears of a downturn. This comes as technical signals strengthen and key indicators reset, suggesting a bright road ahead for Bitcoin’s price.Bitcoin Market Indicators and Breakout SignalsBitcoin’s price chart is showing an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a strong indicator that often predicts a reversal of a previous downward trend. Crypto investor Quinten Francois pointed out this pattern, saying, “Inverse head and shoulders pattern spotted on the $BTC chart. Not the most beautiful I’ve ever seen, but I’ll take it.” He suggests that breaking the neckline of this pattern could pave the way for further price recovery.The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), a tool used to spot changes in the strength and direction of Bitcoin’s price, is also showing positive signs. According to crypto analyst Jelle, “Bitcoin has nearly completed a full reset. Back to the 100-day EMA, a bullish MACD cross below the zero line—and the first higher low in a long time. It’s looking good.”Current Trends and Potential MovementsAs of the latest updates, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures whether it is overbought or oversold, stands at 49—up from 33 on May 1. This suggests that Bitcoin is currently valued fairly according to market conditions.Crypto trader Mags, following the bullish sentiment, expects a breakout based on these technical indicators. However, the broader market sentiment remains cautious. The upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and comments from Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, might bring additional volatility, impacting Bitcoin’s short-term movements.Source: MagsRising Through ResistanceBitcoin’s trajectory faced resistance around the $63,500 and $63,700 marks. If Bitcoin pushes above $63,700, it could potentially liquidate over $516 million in cumulative leveraged short positions, providing a substantial boost to its market position.Source: TradingViewAt the same time, Bitcoin’s price has rebounded from a recent low of $56,000, which many analysts believe was the local bottom for this cycle. Rekt Capital, a well-known analyst, suggests, “If $56,000 was not the bottom then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days. However, history suggests that this pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days.”Moreover, with a morning star pattern forming at the $60,000 support zone, there is a high potential for a short-term rally. The technical setup, coupled with increasing buyer interest, points to a possible bull run challenging the overhead trend line.With Bitcoin currently trading at $63,010 and seeing an intraday rise of 2.52%, the momentum is building. There’s a growing consensus among analysts that a mix of technical strength and renewed investor interest could push Bitcoin toward a new resistance level at $68,283. Conversely, should the momentum falter, we could see a drop to around $58,451, marking the lower bound of the current trading range.

Solana Overtakes Ethereum DEX Volume: Is Ethereum Slipping? - DailyCoin


        
Solana’s DEX trading volume hits $1.3 billion, briefly outpacing Ethereum.



Ethereum quickly reclaims its lead in DEX volume.



Memecoin trades spur Solana’s temporary volume boost.
Thanks to its early start and network effects, Ethereum has long been the frontrunner in decentralized finance (DeFi). However, recently, Solana has experienced its own growth in that area, fuelled by its low fees and developer-friendly environment.
Last week, Solana once again exceeded Ethereum’s volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX), leading investors to ask questions about Ethereum’s long-term outlook. Solana’s DEX Lead Over EthereumOn Friday, May 10, Solana briefly surpassed Ethereum in DEX trading volume, recording $1.3 billion compared to Ethereum’s $1.29 billion. The flipping was primarily due to increased trading activity on Solana, thanks to a renewed interest in memecoins.
https://twitter.com/degeneratenews/status/1788746606197498093
In recent months, Solana has attracted a significant community of memecoin enthusiasts. Tokens like Bonk and DogWifHat have seen increases of upwards of 1000% since their launch. As noted in a recent analysis by Franklin Templeton, memecoin airdrops have received huge attention among the community. They also generated significant wealth effects, further contributing to interest. However, despite Solana’s temporary lead in DEX volume, Ethereum quickly regained its top position by the end of the day, closing the day at $1.39 billion in volume. Conversely, Solana’s trading volume dropped to $943 million. Solana’s DEX Volume Is Not What It SeemsThis was not the first time Solana flipped Ethereum in DEX volume. The last time this happened was on April 21, when Solana’s DEX volume was $1.4 billion, compared to Ethereum’s $1.16 billion. Before that, on March 16, Solana’s DEX volume was even higher, at $3.4 billion, against Ethereum’s $2.4 billion. 
It is important to note that high network volume does not mean the same thing for Ethereum and Solana. Due to its low fees, Solana attracts a significant number of high-frequency trades, which boost its overall volume. On the other hand, Ethereum’s higher gas fees mean that its users will only trade when it is advantageous. While their DEX volume is comparable, Ethereum still holds significant dominance regarding the network’s total value locked (TVL). Currently, Ethereum has a TVL of $52 billion, dwarfing Tron’s $8 billion and BSC’s $6 billion. Solana is only in fourth place in this metric, at a TVL of $4 billion. Even if Solana were to take the first spot in either DEX or network volume for good, it would still need to come a long way before it can grow to the size of the On the Flipside
Solana has faced significant network issues in the past. Most recently, the chain has experienced network congestion, leading to a high transaction failure rate. 



The reliance on memecoins and speculative trading may not be sustainable in the long term.
Why This Matters Even if Solana is still far behind, its rise challenges Ethereum to continue improving, particularly around scalability and transaction costs, two critical areas for user experience. Read more about Solana’s prospects to take third place among blockchain networks:Here’s How Solana Can Outpace BNB and USDT: Franklin TempletonRead more about SBF’s life in prison and his legal defense: Sam Bankman-Fried Still Claims He’s Innocent From Prison

Tokenized funds could chip away at stablecoin market, Polygon exec says - Blockworks


The growth of tokenized financial products likely represents the tip of the iceberg, as the world’s biggest financial players continue to investigate the potential of blockchain technology.
This interest could lead to the proliferation of on-chain funds that might challenge the dominance of stablecoins, according to Colin Butler, Polygon Labs’ head of institutional capital.
Franklin Templeton launched its OnChain US Government Money Fund in 2021. It uses the Polygon and Stellar blockchains to process transactions and record share ownership.
BlackRock debuted its own tokenized offering — the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund — on the Ethereum Network in March. The world’s largest asset manager then led a funding round by Securitize, a firm focused on bringing physical and traditional financial assets onto the blockchain.
The BlackRock and Franklin Templeton funds had amassed $375 million and $368 million in assets under management, respectively, as of April 30.
Their future asset growth will depend on how investors use them, Butler noted.
Franklin Templeton got regulatory approval to allow institutional investors to transfer shares of its on-chain fund to other shareholders.
“What you could do is have a venture capital firm on one side sending yield-bearing digital assets to one of their crypto-native portfolio companies that don’t have banking relationships,” he said. “That’s one idea; I don’t know what sort of adoption that receives.”
Read more: A stablecoin with yield? Tokenized fund perhaps just the start for fund giant
The stablecoin market is currently sized at about $160 billion. But unlike the Franklin Templeton fund, for example, stablecoins don’t offer users a yield. 
“To the extent you can make them more permissionless and fit certain use cases, I can see these products chipping away at that existing [total addressable market], let alone the future TAM,” Butler said.
Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Butler. 

Blockworks: What sorts of conversations are financial institutions having with blockchains as they mull their presence in the tokenization space? 
Butler: Trust and credibility are the most important factors for any Wall Street transaction. The entity looking to collaborate really needs to understand that the chain doesn’t go down. 
Virtually 100% reliability is what they’re looking for, because you can’t have a transaction just kind of disappear and fall through the cracks.
When you’re a big player thinking of coming on-chain, you also have to think about future-proofing your solution. Because if you spin something up that’s kind of a sandbox or walled garden, and there’s no future connectivity, then you have a product that’s limited in scope and you’re going to have to re-engineer everything at some point.
Read more from our opinion section: The future of tokenization? Permissioned blockchains
Blockworks: How might BlackRock’s entrance into the tokenized fund space affect how others move ahead here?
Butler: They are a thought leader, a technology leader and an innovation leader, and so when they make an action there tends to be a lot of replication.
You should just assume that almost everybody in the top 20 globally [in assets under management] has a plan for blockchain adoption. I can’t tell you when those plans will be realized, but there’s only — from my personal knowledge — one or two of the top 20 that aren’t really materially invested…without a team or a roadmap.
When BlackRock comes, it accelerates the plans for all of these other players because now they know they have air cover to do it.
And each one has a different angle on it. It’s not just BlackRock did this and now everybody replicates. Everybody’s looking to do something slightly different or build on what’s been done before, because nobody wants to be the third fund to do the exact same thing.
But broadly speaking, fund tokenization on blockchain is a huge conversation at most of the large players.
Blockworks: Private markets investment firm Hamilton Lane and hedge fund manager Brevan Howard have tokenized funds on Polygon. Do you expect more where that came from?
Butler: Longer term the vision is for everybody from banks to large RIAs, and everyone in between, to distribute these tokenized assets. 
Why it’s interesting is that these assets are not available in any other format. So they’re going to go with both hands after that, because it enables a growth trajectory that they currently don’t have. 
There’s deep financial incentives for the providers of financial products and the distributors, such as banks, to participate in this new ecosystem. That’s why people are so motivated to participate and come on-chain.
Blockworks: What do you make of the latest effort by Visa, Mastercard, JPMorgan, Citigroup and others aimed at using a shared ledger technology to settle tokenized assets? 
Butler: Many of the players listed in that announcement have been working on this for so long. I would say mentally they’ve been very serious about it for the last two years, and to me, it takes about two years to get to the point of approval for production use cases at major financial institutions.
That’s why I think that while you may have seen announcements similar to this maybe two years ago, qualitatively it’s very different because of the stage that a lot of the global financial institutions are at internally.

Sens. Lummis, Wyden oppose Justice Dept. stance on Tornado Cash charges

United States Senators Cynthia Lummis and Ron Wyden have sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland voicing their concern over the Justice Department’s (DOJ’) interpretation of money transmission licensing. As the bipartisan authors indicate in a footnote, this interpretation is being applied in the case against Roman Storm, co-founder of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, who has been charged with operating an unlicensed money transmission operation and other serious crimes.Sens. Lummis and Wyden's letter to the attorney general. Source: Senator Cynthia Lummis on XThe Bank Secrecy Act and the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) clearly define money transmission as the acceptance and transmission of currency and other forms of value. Non-custodial crypto service providers do not meet the established definition of money transmitters, and the DOJ is thus acting contrary to the Treasury, muddying policy enforcement, the senators said. In their words:“Bitcoins have a clear unilateral owner at all times. At no point in the [transfer] transaction process is there uncertainty over where ownership resides. […] Custody and control are, therefore, the logical touchstone of where ‘acceptance and transmission’ occurs on Bitcoin and other crypto networks.” FinCen is the “primary interpretive authority” of money transmission registration requirements. The standard suggested by the DOJ could be applied to a broad range of services, from internet service providers that process bank transfers to the post office, the senators wrote. Crypto advocacy groups filed a joint amicus brief in April with the Southern New York District Court making a similar argument. Source: Senator Cynthia LummisLawyers for Storm filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him in March, saying Tornado Cash did not meet the definition of a money transmission business and Storm was unable to prevent sanctioned groups from using the service because it was “immutable.”Related: DOJ’s Tornado Cash arguments show ‘obvious disdain for privacy’ — LawyerProsecutors countered that Storm was accountable for operating the service and claimed he designed software to aid criminality. They said Tornado Cash was “involved the transportation and transmission of funds known to the defendant to have been derived from a criminal offense.” Storm was arrested in August on charges of sanctions violations and facilitating money laundering in addition to unlicensed money transmission. He could be punished by up to 45 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is free on $2 million bail with travel restrictions.Magazine: Tornado Cash 2.0: The race to build safe and legal coin mixers

With the return of Roaring Kitty—the internet figure who spearheaded the movement—it seems meme stock mania is in full swing.“I’m cashing half a million dollars of Bitcoin right now and I’m going all-in, maximum leverage, all-in on all these stocks,” Tate claimed. “We’re losing all the money, we are taking down Wall Street, we’re going to take them down ourselves.“I’m taking Wall Street down, watch me,” he continued. ”Fuck ‘em. Fuck ‘em all.”Tate says he doesn’t care if he loses it all—his motivation is the downfall of the unnamed hedge fund manager.The flurry of activity surrounding GME stock has more than doubled its value in the last 24 hours—prompting exchanges to halt trading at least six times on Monday—meanwhile triggering $1.4 billion in liqudiations for investors who had bet against its rise, according to Bloomberg. GME is trading for $32.50 as of writing, compared to $10 a month ago.An unofficial Solana meme coin named in honor of Game Stop has posted even more astronomical gains.Tate has since gone further, shouting out the Occupy Wall Street movement, which initially sparked the first wave of interest in meme stocks. Some investors blame hedge funds and other financial institutions for the 2008 financial crisis. Investing in stocks that will trigger hedge fund losses is one way of exacting revenge. Tate has gone on a Twitter tirade, touting GameStop stock and invoking the WallStreetBets vow that he’ll never sell his stocks, no matter the price.“This is about pissing off some dork somewhere in Wall Street with a vaccine and a tiny johnson,” Tate exclaimed in another video.This all comes amid the influencer’s trial for alleged human trafficking and rape. A couple of weeks ago, a court in Romania said that his trial can officially go ahead 10 months after Tate and his brother were charged. A few days ago, the same court extended restrictions that prevent Tate from leaving Romania for another 60 days. A trial date is yet to be set.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Unexpected Development in Cryptocurrency Regulation in Turkey: Leveraged Trading is Expected to be Banned - Bitcoin Sistemi


The bill prepared on the legal regulations and definitions of crypto assets is ready to be presented to the Parliament with its final touches. The proposal, which is expected to be presented to the Parliament this week, will ban short selling and leveraged transactions regarding crypto assets.
Crypto assets will be defined as “intangible assets” for the first time, and thus transactions can be carried out in a more transparent and reliable manner. The bill to be presented to the Parliament will harmonize the broad definition of crypto assets with the definitions of international organizations.


The authority to determine the issuance principles will be given to the Capital Markets Board (CMB). The licensing and auditing processes of trading platforms will also be managed by the CMB. Minimum operating requirements similar to financial institutions will be introduced for service providers.

All transfer transactions made on the platforms will be recorded and compliance with the regulations determined by the Financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAK) will be ensured. Since sudden and large fluctuations may occur in the prices of crypto assets, margin transactions, short sales and leveraged transactions that increase risk will be prohibited.





It is stated that similar prohibitions and restrictions have been introduced in practices abroad. Secondary regulations will be made on investment consultancy and portfolio management and the CMB will be authorized in this regard.
Due to the risky nature of crypto asset investments, no insurance mechanism will be created for trading transactions. These transactions will be exempt from investor compensation. In the draft law, the crime of “unauthorized crypto asset service provider” is defined and penalties are foreseen for those who operate without permission from the CMB.

Bitcoin ETF Weekly Investments Grow For First Time In Over a Month - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFresh cash has started hitting Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) again after five weeks of outflows. A Monday report from European asset manager CoinShares shows $130 million entering the funds last week. CoinShares tracks all crypto funds from the U.S. to Europe and Australia. Most of last week's movements entered American funds, particularly the new spot ETFs that give traditional stock investors exposure to Bitcoin.The report added that European investors pulled $14 million out of Ethereum-related funds due to bearish sentiment surrounding the approval of an Ethereum ETF.A number of high-profile investment firms are hoping to get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Ethereum ETF, but experts think the regulator will drag its heels in giving such products the green light—if they're approved at all.“Low interaction by the U.S. regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent,” CoinShares wrote. “This has been reflected in outflows which totalled $14 million last week.”Perhaps the best news for investors who are long on Bitcoin is that the amount of money leaving Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) last week was the lowest it has been since its conversion to an ETF in January. Since shifting from a closed-end fund model to an ETF, investors have aggressively redeemed shares to cash out of the product—either to look for a cheaper ETF or take home gains. As the fund sells its Bitcoin to pay customers cash, these massive outflows have put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.But at the start of this month, for the first time, more investors started buying GBTC shares than redeeming them.GBTC inflows could lead to the price of the asset going up if more investors want exposure to the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, CoinShares said.Bitcoin is now trading for $62,810 per coin, CoinGecko says. It touched a new all-time high in March of nearly $74,000 but has since struggled due to dying ETF hype. Just a fortnight ago, the Bitcoin ETFs had their worst day on record, with investors pulling out more than half a billion dollars.Could investors be hungry for Bitcoin again?Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

House overturns SEC’s anti-crypto guidance, Biden to veto: Law Decoded

The United States House of Representatives has voted to pass a bill overturning controversial Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance preventing banks from owning crypto. The House voted to pass a bipartisan bill titled H.J. Res 109, overturning the SEC’s Special Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) requiring banks to hold their customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets, which is not the case for traditional assets such as securities.Republican Party Representative Mike Flood — who introduced the resolution — said SAB 121 was unfair for banks looking to custody crypto, as custodial assets are “always considered off-balance sheet.”However, before the vote, U.S. President Joe Biden’s office issued a statement informing lawmakers and the public that his administration plans to veto a joint resolution affecting crypto policy at the SEC if it comes to his desk.The White House said it “strongly opposes” members of the House of Representatives seeking to pass a joint resolution it claims would disrupt the SEC’s efforts “to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.” Australian Tax Office seeks data from 1.2 million crypto usersThe Australian Taxation Office (ATO) seeks personal data and transaction details from up to 1.2 million cryptocurrency exchange users for a potential crackdown on crypto tax obligations. The tax officials believe the data will help identify traders who may have failed to pay their taxes on their crypto trades. The ATO will seek personal data, including users’ date of birth, social media accounts, phone numbers, transaction-related details like wallet addresses, type of coin trades and bank account details.For Australian regulators, cryptocurrencies are taxable assets, unlike other foreign currencies. This requires traders to pay a capital gains tax on the profit from selling crypto assets.Continue readingSouth Korea’s ruling party will press for Bitcoin ETF tradingThe Democratic Party of Korea will request that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) reconsider its interpretation of the legal status of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). An unnamed official of the Democratic Party policy committee told the local paper that the party would make the request after the opening of the National Assembly in June. The opposition party was swept into power in the April elections in South Korea and holds 175 of 300 seats in the legislative body.Previously, after the approval of spot BTC ETFs in the U.S., the FSC issued a statement saying Korean securities firms could violate the Capital Markets Act by listing foreign spot ETFs.

Bitcoin ETFs Break 4-Week Outflow Sorrow with $117M Inflows - DailyCoin


        

Bitcoin ETFs have overturned their weeks-long trend of outflows.



The crypto market recorded a similar wave of inflows in signs of recovery.



The ongoing rebound suggests reignited interest in crypto funds.




The crypto market has witnessed mixed sentiment over the past weeks, marked by rollercoaster performances across assets and fluctuating interest among market participants. Negatively impacted, Bitcoin ETFs took a downward spiral of outflows, shedding over half a billion on May 2, 2024.



Now, in a reversal of fortunes, the market is displaying signs of recovery.



Bitcoin ETFs Signal Recovery



According to Farside Investors data on May 11, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. recorded a total of $116.8 million in the recently concluded week.




Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge with a dominant $111.3 million, surpassing Ark Invest’s ARKB, which saw a total of $82.8 million in inflows. FBTC and ARKB surpassed the once best-performing BlackRock’s IBIT, which continued its trend of underperformance with only $48.1 million in inflows.







In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC reverted to its infamous lackluster performance. Despite commencing the week with a promising $67 million inflow, Grayscale ended the week on a sour note with a total of $175 million outflows.



Bitcoin ETFs such as VanEck’s HODL and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, among others, recorded minimal inflows, contributing to a total record for the week of $11.7 million. The recovery witnessed across the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market mirrors the uptick observed across global crypto investment products.



Crypto Funds Reverse Negative Trend



According to CoinShares data on Monday, May 13, the crypto market recorded $130 million in inflows in the past week. This marked the funds’ first set of recovery inflows, following an unimpressive performance that saw the market consecutively bleed for nearly five weeks




Being the primary focus, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled $144 million, followed distantly by Solana (SOL), which saw a total of $5.9 million in inpour. Litecoin, XRP, Polkadot, and other assets also closed the week with an uptick, registering a cumulative $3.2 million.



Source: CoinShares



However, the optimism didn’t extend to others, which bucked the trend with outflows. One notable loser was Ethereum (ETH), which led the negative train of approximately $23.3 million.



This brought the inflows to $130 million, marking an approximate 430% increase from the previous week’s $435 million outflow record.

Uniswap CEO: Biden's Crypto Stance Echoes Hillary's Past Errors - DailyCoin


        

Uniswap Labs CEO Hayden Adams has asserted President Joe Biden is making a deadly mistake with his handling of crypto as elections near.



According to the Uniswap founder, Republicans are already taking advantage.



Adams’ sentiments add to a chorus of opposition to the Biden administration within crypto circles.




Despite being widely seen as the home of technological innovation, the U.S. has proven rugged terrain for the crypto industry.



Amid uncertain regulations and a flurry of enforcement actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), several industry leaders have espoused the view that the President Joe Biden-led administration is out to stifle crypto. With the November 2024 elections approaching, the president’s recent vow to veto any legislative attempt to overturn a perceived anti-crypto accounting rule from the SEC has only strengthened these views.




According to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, Biden’s continued alienation of the crypto industry could cause his campaign to face the same fate as Hillary Clinton’s in 2016.



“Republicans Smell Blood in the Water”



On Monday, May 13, Adams asserted that the Biden administration was underestimating the influence of crypto “both in terms of voters and money” in the coming elections. He likened it to Hillary Clinton’s failure to campaign in swing states when she ran for office in 2016.



"Hillary campaigning in red states states [sic] instead of swing states level miscalculation from Biden camp thinking crypto will be irrelevant in 2024 election and letting SEC + Warren wage total war - both in terms of voters and money," he wrote.



According to the Uniswap Labs chief, whose protocol faces the threat of enforcement from the SEC, while the Biden administration and Democratic party fumbled the ball on crypto, the Republicans were catching on.



"Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto."



This sentiment comes as former President Donald Trump has increasingly pandered to the crypto community in recent weeks, noting that his campaign is now open to receiving crypto donations.




Adams noted that the Biden administration had to act fast to stand any chance of changing the tide.



"Not much time for Biden to save it. Any one [sic] close to him or dem leadership should be expressing how serious this is and pushing for immediate reversal on his approach to crypto (public support/plan and reigning in sec + warren)."



While Adams’ sentiments suggest that there may be room for redemption, several other leaders appear to have lost all hope.



Crypto Industry Leaders Rally Against Biden



In an X post on May 8, Messari Crypto founder Ryan Selkis argued that several aspects of the crypto industry will suffer if Biden is re-elected. Recently, Selkis has become an active part of the Trump campaign. On May 9, he shared the stage with the leading Republican candidate during a 60-minute Q&A at Mar-a-Lago.







Echoing Selkis’ sentiments, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson asserted that “a vote for Biden is a vote against cryptocurrencies” in a message to followers on May 8. Unlike Selkis, however, the Cardano founder has pitched his tent in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s camp.



Meanwhile, on May 10, the Coinbase-led Stand With Crypto advocacy group formed a Political Action Committee (PAC) to raise funds for crypto-friendly candidates.



On the Flipside 




Uniswap faces the threat of an enforcement action from the U.S. SEC.



An April 2023 Pew Research survey found that only 17% of Americans say they have ever invested in crypto.



Crypto industry participants should also consider the policy stances of candidates beyond crypto.




Why This Matters 



Uniswap’s Hayden Adams statements highlight crypto’s hot-button topic status in the U.S. presidential election.

Going for Gold on Blast Jackpot | Bankless


Blast has done a pretty stellar job of courting attention as a place for degens to earn big. The main way the network has accomplished this is through its native yield, as ETH and stablecoin holders can annually earn 4% and 5% respectively on Blast. The L2 also aims to make good on its reputation thanks to its ongoing Blast Points and Blast Gold program. Half of Blast’s upcoming airdrop is going to Points holders, and half to Gold holders. Note that initially, only ETH and USDB holders earned Points, and only Blast app users earned Gold. Yet with the early makings of memecoin and NFT scenes starting to rise on Blast, the L2’s team decided to offer passive token and NFT holders a way to rack up Gold rewards, too.Here, cue in Blast Jackpot. The Blast Jackpot is a recently launched game that periodically rewards token and NFT holders on Blast. Every block mined on the network has a basic chance to trigger a jackpot, and when this happens, a random token or NFT is selected as the winner. Everyone who entered the winning asset will receive a cut of the latest Gold prize pool. The odds of selection favor tokens over NFTs, but all assets on the platform, except for WETH and USDB, are eligible.The initiative gets Blast users to diversify their holding on the network for a chance at the jackpot.If you’re interested in trying it out, entering is straightforward, but you will need to onboard to the Blast Airdrop dashboard first if you haven’t already. If you need an invite code, dozens of users have dropped theirs as comments in the Blast “Referral Link” quest in our Airdrop Hunter hub!Once you’re set up on Blast, transfer some ETH in through the native bridge or a fast 3rd-party bridge like Relay, and then you’ll be ready to start acquiring assets so you can enter into Blast Jackpot. For example, I recently joined by acquiring some of the $PAC memecoin on Thruster, a decentralized exchange, and some Skellies NFTs on the NFT orderbook platform Mintify. Once you have whichever assets you want ready in your wallet, just head to the Blast Jackpot page, scroll down and select the “Add Token or NFT to your Deck” option, and then select your desired asset. You can enter as many as eight different assets in the available deck slots like this!At this point, it’s just a waiting game—you can check back on this Jackpot page to manage your entries over time and track if any of your assets are winners going forward. If you’re lucky, you’ll win at least one nice chunk of Blast Gold before the official Blast airdrop, and if you’re really lucky you may win multiple—they’re are only so many assets on the young L2 right now, after all.

Nibiru COO highlights grants as a magnet for TradFi talent in crypto - Crypto Briefing




The presence of crypto among institutional investors is on the rise, especially after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Companies such as JPMorgan, UBS, and Wells Fargo declared Bitcoin ETF holdings in their recent 13F filings.This rise in institutional interest can also be seen in the professional area. Executives with backgrounds in traditional finance (TradFi) are rotating to crypto as the market matures. Former Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Jonathan Chang, is one of these executives, now in the role of COO at layer-1 blockchain Nibiru.He shared insights with Crypto Briefing on valuable TradFi skills that can be used in crypto, how grants are a powerful tool to attract more of the traditional market, and how those professionals can help solve crypto issues.Crypto Briefing – What was your biggest challenge when pivoting from traditional finance to crypto? What set of skills learned from TradFi were most valuable when joining this new market?Jonathan Chang – Crypto is known for its unique complexities. Traditional Finance (TradFi) offers a more relatable framework for understanding decentralized finance due to its familiar concepts. However, there is still a learning curve, particularly with the specialized terminology used in crypto.For instance, while the principles of lending, including borrowers, underwriting, credit assessment, and lenders are well-established in TradFi, the application of these concepts in crypto—built on smart contract platforms and enhanced with tokenomics—introduces a new layer of complexity.In fintech, the ledger is fundamental for recording bank transactions. This concept closely parallels the blockchain ledger used in crypto, which also records transactions but does so in a decentralized way.I’ve noticed that fintech and crypto startups often share similar goals, particularly in speeding up payments and financial services. The main difference lies in the technology stacks each uses to achieve these goals.Now that I’m more involved in crypto, my background in traditional finance is proving beneficial. My experience in equity research enhanced my analytical and writing skills, and deepened my understanding of how markets moved.In investment banking, I refined my abilities in structuring transactions, managing teams, and general soft skills. Venture capital and growth equity offered opportunities to meet diverse founders, understand market mapping, and appreciate business differentiation. These skills were invaluable, aiding in process management, quality control, and leveraging a broad network in new environments.Often, creative problem-solving is essential, and having a variety of experiences from high-pressure situations has become increasingly valuable. These reference points from my past work are helpful tools in navigating and innovating within crypto.Crypto Briefing – Are grants a valuable way to attract talent to crypto? Do you think of grants as just a money incentive, or do you think of a proper introduction to the market and its technologies?Jonathan Chang – Grants play a crucial role in drawing talent to the crypto and DeFi sectors, providing much more than just financial incentives. In a time when funding is limited and developers and entrepreneurs urgently need resources to bring their ideas to life, grants offer vital early support.Equally important, however, is the comprehensive ecosystem support that a well-designed grant program provides. This includes access to mentorship, technical resources, and a network of like-minded innovators, fostering an environment ripe for learning, experimentation, and growth.At Nibiru, our grant program is crafted to achieve these goals. We offer financial assistance and leverage our extensive network and expertise to enhance our grantees’ success. This support includes connecting them with VC partners, offering mentorship opportunities, and providing access to our advanced developer suite. Our objective is to give a complete introduction to the market and the tools needed to succeed.The Nibiru ecosystem is dedicated to empowering developers, helping them become catalysts for positive Web3 transformation. Our grants initiative not only supports through partnerships and mentorship but also boosts the visibility of projects within our ecosystem with targeted marketing support.Our grants are structured with Total Value Locked (TVL) milestones in mind, aiming to find partners committed to long-term growth within the chain. During our diligence process, the chemistry between the founder and our team is a key factor in ensuring aligned goals and collaborative potential.Crypto Briefing – Despite being better, crypto UX is still a threshold to capture more users and talent. Do you believe that non-native crypto talent’s point of view is an important piece to solve this problem?Jonathan Chang – Absolutely. A major challenge in the crypto industry today is the complexity of the user experience. Despite significant innovation, many blockchain applications remain too complex for the average user.This is where non-native crypto talent becomes crucial. These individuals may not possess deep technical knowledge of blockchain but offer fresh perspectives and a strong focus on user-centric design.They are key to bridging the gap between sophisticated technology and the seamless, user-friendly experiences that people expect. At Nibiru, we see this in action. Our team, drawn from a mix of backgrounds, including traditional finance, technology, and consumer industries, brings diverse viewpoints that are critical in developing relatable products.They challenge us to simplify and humanize our offerings, urging us to prioritize the user journey over technical details. As a result, they help us create not just functional but genuinely enjoyable experiences. So, to directly answer your question—yes, I firmly believe that non-native crypto talent is essential in addressing the UX challenges in crypto.

Bracebridge Capital Becomes Largest Bitcoin ETF Holder, Investing $380 Million In All-In Bet | Bitcoinist.com


								Last week, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced a notable shift in investor sentiment. Positive inflows were reported, breaking a streak of outflows that had persisted for almost a month. The week concluded with a significant $116 million positive inflows, indicative of growing interest in the newly approved index funds.
Notably, a new player entered the market and made substantial investments, quickly becoming one of the largest holders of Bitcoin ETFs.
Bracebridge Capital Nets Major ETF Holdings
Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund, reported owning $262 million worth of Ark Invest’s ARKB ETF. Additionally, they emerged as the largest owner of Blackrock’s IBIT with an investment of $81 million. 

Bracebridge Capital also holds $20 million of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which experienced negative outflows of $103 million during the same period. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas described Bracebridge Capital’s investment as a “wild” move, noting the firm’s significant acquisitions.

It is also worth mentioning the growing number of holders for each ETF, with IBIT boasting 250 holders in the first quarter alone, which is notable for a recently launched product.
Bitcoin ETF Outflows In Hong Kong Persist
In contrast, the Bitcoin ETF market in Hong Kong has been experiencing slower but consistent outflows. On Friday, May 10, 2024, there was an outflow of $6.3 million, followed by an $18.5 million outflow on Monday, May 13, 2024. However, it should be noted that Bosera and Harvest are yet to report for Monday, according to Farside data. 
These outflows come amidst rumors that Bitcoin ETFs listed in Hong Kong could soon become accessible to investors from mainland China.
As previously reported, Richard Byworth, Managing Partner at SyzCapital, sparked speculation about integrating Hong Kong-listed Bitcoin ETFs into the Stock Connect system, potentially allowing mainland Chinese investors to access these funds. 
Byworth’s remarks on social media highlighted ongoing discussions surrounding this potential integration, which could lead to a significant influx of capital from mainland China into the Bitcoin ETF market. 
The initial performance of the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF, which gathered $121 million on its first trading day, has fueled optimism about the future of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. 

Samson Mow, a prominent figure in the industry, expressed bullish sentiments. At the same time, Brian HoonJong Paik, Co-founder & COO at SmashFi, emphasized the potential socio-economic benefits of mainland Chinese interest in Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs. 
Paik highlighted the vast amount of Chinese wealth in real estate, suggesting that alternative investment opportunities could help stabilize the socio-economic landscape and mitigate social unrest.
As discussions continue, market participants are closely monitoring its potential impact on capital flows and the overall adoption of digital asset funds in the region.

Bitcoin ETFs have been traded in the country since 2021, managing about 2.5 billion reals (~ $500 million) as of March.“BTC and ETH accounted for a combined 43% of BRL trade volumes. For context, they make up more than 70% of USD-denominated volumes.”Binance currently holds the largest market share in Brazil at 79% of transactions, though its dominance has been shrinking. In contrast, the largest Brazilian exchange, Mercado Bitcoin, along with Mexico-based Bitso, have seen their combined market share climb to 21% by early May, reaching its highest point in over three years, Kaiko reported.

Shiba Inu Adoption: People Can Now Book Airbnb or Buy Nike Clothes via SHIB


																TL;DR

CoinGate, a blockchain payment processor, has added Shiba Inu as a payment method, integrating it with Polygon and Binance Smart Chain.
SHIB’s price experienced an uptick lately, while its market capitalization neared $14 billion.


Enabling SHIB Payments
CoinGate – a blockchain payment processor headquartered in Lithuania – became the latest entity to embrace the popular meme coin – Shiba Inu – as a payment method. To do so, it integrated SHIB with Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. 

The payment gateway enables businesses to buy, sell, manage, and accept cryptocurrencies. It acts as a bridge between crypto and traditional finance, facilitating transactions for goods and services. 
Popular companies that collaborate with the payment processor in some way include Airbnb, Nike, Spotify, Walmart, IKEA, Uber, and many more.
Besides the thumbs up from CoinGate, SHIB made the headlines today (May 13) thanks to its substantial price increase. As CryptoPotato reported, it spiked by 7% on an hourly scale while its market capitalization neared the $14 billion mark.




Previous Support for SHIB
The self-proclaimed Dogecoin-killer saw the light of day in the summer of 2020, capturing the attention of numerous industry participants and exchanges in the following years.
Not long ago, the crypto lending platform Nexo enabled users to buy Shiba Inu, explaining that card transactions can be accepted “in seconds.” It also allowed swaps with rewards, borrowing against the token, and sending assets to a friend via a phone number or email.
Other leading crypto firms that have already embraced the meme coin include Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Gemini, OKX, KuCoin, GroveX, and many more.

Memestock Mania Returns | Bankless


Memestock Pop-Off. GameStop Corporation (GME) shares soared as much as 126% off their Friday close, the stock’s largest single-day spike since the height of the memestock frenzy in January 2021! Why has GME surged in such dramatic fashion, and could this development be a harbinger of good tidings for your crypto bags?While wild swings in GME triggered circuit breakers to halt trading numerous times this morning, highlighting the immense amount of realized volatility from this move, GME had been displaying unexpectedly high volatility throughout May after a short squeeze at the start of this month already sent the stock rallying by 40%.Monthly options on US-listed stocks are set to expire this Friday and market participants were heavily long in-the-money GME call positions for this expiration, forcing the dealers who sold these calls to repurchase stock as the price rose to hedge their exposure, a textbook example of a short squeeze.
This explosion in GME has also been marked by the return of Roaring Kitty (aka Keith Gill) to Twitter, an investor who championed short squeezes throughout 2021 only to vanish from the internet shortly after GME’s third pump in July of that year.His account tweeted out a picture of an individual leaning forward in a chair as if to indicate that it's time to pay attention on Sunday, following up the initial post with a series of inspirational clips from popular movies.Popular American movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, another primary beneficiary of the 2021 memestonk craze, has not experienced triple-digit daily returns like GME, but still managed to pop over 50% on the day.The last memestock short squeeze catalyzed by a historic GME run-up was followed by a near 12-month uninterrupted streak of gains for broader equity markets before the Federal Reserve’s interest rate raises sucked liquidity out of the market.Although market participants are uncertain about the timing of future rate cuts, their eventual occurrence has been accepted with near certainty given the steadily deteriorating global economic condition, eliminating rate increases as a future risk factor for bulls.With year-over-year growth in the monetary supply as measured by M2 turning positive for the first time since 2022 and animal spirits seemingly taking control of TradFi, it is certainly feels possible that prices of crypto assets prices could continue to run, drawing an increased amount of investors and their capital into the space as they seek return.

Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times

I understand that, ideally, voters should care more about things like abortion, environmental and immigration policy than crypto. (Most probably do.) I understand Zuckerman and Albus’ distaste for Trump, his sexual assault charges, alleged fraud and election denialism. I understand why, optically, crypto casting itself as conservative is a dubious proposition, an expedient way to get 40+% of the population to turn their minds against it, as Laura Shin astutely pointed out.

Annoying News from Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs: Seen for the First Time Since Launch - Bitcoin Sistemi

There were significant outflows in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed in Hong Kong today, after Bitcoin fell below $61,000 on Friday.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs from issuers ChinaAMC, Harvest Global, Bosera and Hashkey saw an outflow of $32.7 million on Monday, according to data from Farside Investors. This figure is significantly more than previous debuts, which generally hovered around $6 million.


Today was a first in the history of these funds. All six cryptocurrency ETFs, including both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), reported negative flows for the first time since their launches on May 2. Notably, Harvest Global has never seen an outflow for its spot Bitcoin fund.
Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw significant outflows, with $6.6 million outflows from the funds. This figure is also significantly higher than past figures.





After eight days of trading, investors had withdrawn nearly $13 million from six ETFs. This result was disappointing for Asia-based ETFs, especially when compared to the exciting initial period for their US-listed counterparts.

Many industry enthusiasts point out that the Hong Kong-based ETF market is relatively small, with around $50 billion in assets. In stark contrast, the ETF market in the US is estimated to have approximately $9 trillion in assets under management.


Rumors had spread that mainland Chinese investors were gaining access to funds through Stock Connect, which would open the doors to a much larger investor base. However, the Hong Kong stock exchange denied these rumors early on Monday, stating that they were false.

                        Iconic retail stock trader/investor “Roaring Kitty,” who rose to fame during the 2021 meme stock surge, just posted on X for the first time since 2021, igniting a surge in the excitement that a new meme stock/meme coin trading season could be inbound, and with traders feverishly hunting for meme coins that could be the next GME stock.GameStop icon Roading Kitty—Keith Gill in real life—posted a meme about “locking in.” The implication could be that Roaring Kitty is about to refocus on his trading.GameStop was last up 70% on Monday, with GME reaching around $30 as per Yahoo Finance. Roaring Kitty was a major champion of beaten-down stock GameStop prior to its stunning 2021 pump.Roaring Kitty’s GameStop position is thought to have surged to as much as $50 million in 2021 at its peak.Other popular stocks during the 2021 meme stock craze also picked up. AMC Holdings (AMC) was up 45% on Monday.The return of Roaring Kitty hasn’t just sparked excitement in meme stock markets. Indeed, there has been a surge in risk-taking activity in across the crypto meme coin space.Scores of meme coins related to Roaring Kitty, Gamestop, and the 2021 meme stock craze are pumping.Roaring Kitty (KITTY) was up 21,000% in 24 hours, as per DEXTools. Wall Street Bets (WSB) was up 4,500%. And GamgeStop (GME) was up 2,200%.None of these meme coins have any official connection to the original persons/communities/companies. They are purely just borrowing the name.Additionally, none of these meme coins, beyond their 2021 meme stock craze links names, have any real utility or prospect of long-term growth.Traders looking for the next GME stock should check out these meme coins instead.Are These 5 Meme Coins the Next GME Stock?Dogecoin (DOGE)Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 9% on Monday as traders grew excited that it could be the next GME stock.Dogecoin is the largest and oldest meme coin by market capitalization and was last near $0.1550.The meme coin’s market cap is a whopping $22.2 billion.But many think DOGE will one day reach $1, which would see its market cap swell to over $140 billion.Investors willing to ride the DOGE rollercoaster could be looking at 6.5x gains if $1 is reached.That might not be as impressive as GME’s 2021 gains. But Dogecoin remains one of the best meme coin bets.Shiba Inu (SHIB)The second largest meme coin in crypto, Shiba Inu (SHIB), is another good bet for the next GME stock.SHIB was last up 7.5%, eyeing an upside break from a pennant structure.That could reignite a quick surge back to March highs above $0.000045.Shiba Inu could be the next GME stock if it can break this pattern.

Slothana could soon take the crown as the biggest Sloth meme coin.As meme coin risk appetite returns, it could become a multi-billion-dollar coin. Slothana is a good bet for the next GME stock.Dogeverse (DV)Another exciting meme coin with novel cross-chain capabilities called Dogeverse (DV) is available in presale.Dogeverse is a multi-chain spin on Dogecoin, launching on the six most used blockchains, excluding Bitcoin, with multi-chain bridge capabilities.There are a host of chains out there vying to be the go-to destination for meme coin launches – Dogeverse plans to fit the bill by being present on all chains that matter.The multi-chain meme coin has raised more than $15 million so far.Potential investors don’t have long to buy before launch.

Uniswap founder says Biden's indifference toward crypto could cost him elections

Uniswap founder Hayden Adams criticized President Joe Biden’s approach to crypto regulation and said his administration’s perceived indifference to crypto could be a significant miscalculation in the 2024 election.Adams warned in a May 13 post on social media that the administration is ignoring a key issue for many Americans and compared the decision to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign strategy. He said:“Hillary campaigning in red states instead of swing states level miscalculation from Biden camp thinking crypto will be irrelevant in 2024 election and letting SEC + Warren wage total war — both in terms of voters and money.”The Uniswap founder’s comments reflect growing frustration within the crypto community over what they see as aggressive regulatory actions led by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and vocal critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).Adams suggested the Biden administration’s current stance could alienate a crucial voter base and financial backers. He pointed out that Republicans are increasingly embracing crypto, seeing an opportunity to attract disillusioned voters and donors from the crypto sector. He wrote:“Republicans smell blood in the water and are turning hard towards crypto.”This shift, he argued, could have significant implications for the 2024 election, potentially swaying votes and financial support away from Democrats.Adams urged those close to Biden and the Democratic leadership to recognize the seriousness of the situation and advocate for a more favorable stance toward digital assets.Key voter issueAmerican voters’ views toward crypto are evolving rapidly, with a recent Harris Poll revealing that nearly 60% of Americans have some familiarity with digital assets, and about 20% have invested in crypto.Younger voters, particularly those in the 18-34 age bracket, show a higher propensity for crypto investment and support for pro-crypto policies. The demographic’s growing influence could be pivotal in upcoming elections.Moreover, the poll highlighted a partisan divide in attitudes toward crypto. Republicans are generally more supportive of crypto adoption and innovation, viewing it as a symbol of free market principles and technological advancement.In contrast, many Democrats advocate for more robust regulatory oversight to prevent fraud and protect consumers, reflecting broader concerns about financial stability and systemic risk.The Biden administration’s approach to crypto has been a contentious issue, with proponents arguing that tighter regulations are necessary to protect consumers and the financial system. At the same time, critics contend that excessive regulation stifles innovation and economic growth.As the 2024 election approaches, the debate over crypto regulation will likely intensify, with both parties vying for the support of a rapidly growing and increasingly influential industry.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Bitcoin Deja Vu: Metric Mirrors Pattern That Led To 2021 Top


								On-chain data suggests a Bitcoin indicator is currently mirroring the same trend that led to the top of the bull run in 2021.
Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Distribution Appears To Be Ending
As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the BTC long-term holders are currently showcasing a trend that’s reminiscent of 2021.
The “long-term holders” (LTHs) are Bitcoin investors who have been keeping their coins dormant (that is, not transferring or selling them from their wallet) for more than 155 days.

Generally, the longer a holder keeps their coins still, the less likely they are to move them at any point. As such, the LTHs, with their long holding times, are considered the market’s resolute hands.
These investors usually don’t react to events in the wider market, like a rally or crash, but this year’s price surge towards the new all-time high (ATH) has forced even these HODLers into selling.
The chart below shows the trend in the total Bitcoin supply held by the addresses belonging to the LTH cohort over the last few years:

Looks like the value of the metric has observed a drawdown in recent months | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As the graph shows, Bitcoin LTHs were accumulating between the May 2021 crash and this year’s rally. With this rise towards the new ATH, though, the supply of these HOLDers has started observing a downtrend instead.
Something to keep in mind is that the indicator has a 155-day delay when it comes to buying, as only mature supplies can count under it.
Thus, when the metric goes up, it doesn’t mean that there is accumulation in the present but rather that some buying occurred 155 days ago, and these coins have just now aged enough to count under the LTHs.
For selling, though, no such delay is attached, as coins exit the group as soon as they are transferred on the network. As such, the latest decline would correspond to a selloff that has been happening in the present.
Recently, as the Bitcoin price has fallen prey to stagnation, the LTHs have slowed down their selling, with the supply more or less moving sideways. As Maartunn has highlighted in the chart, this trend is similar to what was observed in 2021.
The LTHs ending their distribution then meant a top for the cryptocurrency. A similar pattern was also witnessed during the 2017 bull run. Therefore, going by these historical precedents, the latest flat movement in the LTH supply could also suggest a potential peak for the latest bull run.

This is only if, of course, the LTH distribution has truly ended. The chart shows that in each of the last two bull markets, the initial sharp selling from the LTHs was followed up by a phase of slower-paced distribution.
This slowed-down decline continued for months before the metric reached the consolidation phase and the asset’s top occurred. It now remains to be seen if the latest trend shift in the Bitcoin LTH supply corresponds to the former or the latter phase.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $62,700 level, down almost 2% over the past week.

Mark Cuban Urges CFTC Regulation of Crypto and Suggests Impact on 2024 Election



                    

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban recently voiced strong opinions about the need for clearer regulatory frameworks within the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, urging the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to oversee all crypto-related activities. 



In a post directed to his 8.8 million followers on X on May 10, Cuban emphasized the urgency of legislative action prior to the 2024 presidential election, suggesting that it could influence the re-election of President Joe Biden.




Cuban stated, “You could solve this problem for Biden by passing legislation that defines registration that is specific to the crypto industry just as other industries have registration that is defined for them.” 



His comments reflect a broader concern within the crypto community about the need for tailored regulatory measures that can foster both innovation and consumer protection.



Highlighting the potential political repercussions of regulatory decisions, Cuban pointedly mentioned Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), known for his stringent stance on cryptocurrencies. 




Cuban argued that Gensler’s approach could alienate crypto voters, implying that this could be a decisive factor in the upcoming election. 



“If Joe Biden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank Gary Gensler and the New York SEC,” Cuban said, suggesting that a more crypto-friendly regulatory approach could be more advantageous.



He proposed a more effective alternative, advocating for the CFTC to take charge of all crypto regulations.



This idea aligns with the growing consensus among younger and independent voters who perceive crypto as a significant part of their financial interaction and are critical of the SEC’s handling under Gensler’s leadership.

Cuban harshly criticized Gensler’s record, saying, “Crypto is a mainstay with younger and independent voters. Gensler HAS NOT PROTECTED A SINGLE INVESTOR AGAINST FRAUD.”



Data from litigation consulting firm Cornerstone Research indicates that the SEC undertook 46 enforcement actions against crypto firms in 2023 alone, underscoring the aggressive regulatory landscape. 



Meanwhile, Rostin Behnam, Chair of the CFTC, anticipates another wave of enforcement within the next six to 18 months, hinting at ongoing challenges for the sector.



The discourse around cryptocurrency regulation is poised to be a significant issue in the 2024 U.S. election. 



A recent poll reported by Cointelegraph on May 7, conducted among 1,201 registered voters, found that over two-thirds resonate with the sentiment that “crypto is for people like them, and more equitable than the financial system.”



This unfolding narrative captures the complex interplay between politics, regulatory actions, and the vibrant dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, reflecting a critical juncture in the regulatory oversight of digital assets in the U.S.

Solana Price Prediction as SOL Trading Volume Soars to $2.5 Billion – Are Whales Buying the Dip? / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Solana (SOL) price has jumped back up to test $150 from earlier session lows under $140 amid a surge in trading volumes, as traders await a barrage of upcoming US economic data releases later in the week.As per Yahoo Finance, trading volumes on major exchanges surpassed $2.5 billion on Monday. That was the highest since last Tuesday.The impressive price rise still leaves the Solana price lodged well within its $120-$160 range over the past month.Wednesday’s US CPI and Retail Sales could shake things up, as traders assess the interest rate outlook.But ahead of then, the focus is on meme coins (and meme stocks) following Roaring Kitty’s sudden return.His return comes with gas fees very low across major blockchains like Ethereum.Solana has marked itself out in 2024 as the number one meme coin blockchain.If Roaring Kitty’s return coupled with low gas fees can start a new meme coin season, Solana could be a key beneficiary.Solana Price Prediction – Are Whales Buying the Dip?
Bitcoin (BTC), last at $63,000, also remains stuck within multi-month ranges and isn’t likely to see a major breakout soon.The macro backdrop remains uncertain, with traders unsure how soon and fast Fed rate cuts are coming.Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have crawled to a halt. The April halving proved to be a sell-the-news event, with post-halving rallies typically not coming in for 4-6 months.And we are heading into summer, typically a subdued/bearish time for Bitcoin.So Bitcoin could easily remain stuck within recent ranges for the foreseeable future. And that suggests that Solana might also be stuck within recent ranges.But say meme coin season returns and Solana meme coins take center stage.A break above $160 would open the door to a swift move back to $200.If it can break above $160 resistance, the Solana price is in with a shot of quickly rallying back to $200. Source: TradingViewHowever, should meme season fail, and the market’s broader malaise turn into a sell-off, Solana could break lower.$120 is key long-term support. Should this level break a quick test of $100 or lower would be on the cards.Alternatively, the Solana price would likely dip under $100 if it breaks below $120 support. Source: TradingViewSuch a sell-off would likely see short-term holders with a low tolerance for riding a drawdown, often referred to as “crypto tourists”, panic sell into the hands of higher conviction dip-buyers and whales.Such capitulation isn’t yet obvious. But you can bet that under $100 the Solana whales will come piling in to scoop up more.And this would be a great sign of a near-term bottom.Solana Alternative to Consider – Slothana (SLOTH)
An exciting new Solana meme coin called Slothana (SLOTH) has seen an amazing start to life since its recent launch.The Sloth-themed meme coin is up 550% since its May 1 launch, with a market cap now near $100 million.Slothana aims to supplant its Sloth-themed meme coin predecessor Slerf (SLERF), which at one point had a market cap of close to $500 million.But Slerf has since dropped back to $145 million. Slothana could soon take the crown as the biggest Sloth meme coin.As meme coin risk appetite returns, it could become a multi-billion-dollar coin. Slothana is a good bet to the next GME stock.

GameStop Meme Coins Are Taking Over Solana as Pump.fun Sets Record - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe return of Keith Gill, a man closely linked to GameStop’s stock rally in 2021, has unleashed a massive flood of Solana-based meme coins through the pump.fun protocol. GME Stonks, GameOver, and KiethGillWifHat are just a few examples of tokens launched through pump.fun in the last 24 hours after Gill—a financial analyst and investor also known as Roaring Kitty—posted a meme on Twitter, resurfacing for the first time in years.Allowing anyone to launch a meme coin for only 0.02 SOL ($3), pump.fun notched its busiest day of deployments on Sunday after Gill posted an image of a man hunched forward in a chair with a video game controller in hand. In all, 14,500 different meme coins were launched via pump.fun that day, setting a new record, according to a Dune dashboard.Appearing to match Sunday’s pace of new Solana tokens, over 7,400 were also created through pump.fun on Monday, as of this writing. On Twitter, the pump.fun account appeared to reference Gill’s cat-themed moniker and an influx of associated tokens when it said, “Today is a good day for cats, that's for sure.”Pump.fun also acknowledged the not-so-good side of meme coins as well, such as how the value of the volatile assets can plummet due to “rug pulls.” The pump.fun team asked Gill on Twitter if he was “interested in grifting [on his] followers with a coin launch,” effectively inviting him to join in.Whether anonymous developers simply added an image of a hat to Gill or employed a popular misspelling of words, Monday’s Gill- and GameStop-themed coins added to the growing list of 512,000 tokens deployed using the Solana protocol. Since pump.fun’s January release, those launches have resulted in around 127,000 SOL or $19 million in revenue for the protocol in the form of gas fees.Some Solana-based tokens drew inspiration from videos Gill posted Monday after his initial reappearance. For example, playing off of the inclusion of the Marvel superhero Wolverine in one, a token named Roaring Wolverine was launched—and appears to have already crashed. Once known for making frequent, top-rated posts on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets, Gill is credited with corralling thousands of traders in 2020 to bet against Wall Street through one of its most shorted stocks. Following a historic short squeeze that sent GameStop share price skyrocketing to $483, however, the figure of modern financial folklore largely faded from the public’s view.As GameStop’s stock surged on Wall Street Monday following Gill’s reemergence, trading was halted several times. Meanwhile, a Solana-based token that borrowed GameStop’s ticker name increased nearly 1,700% along with others inspired by the meme stock craze.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Hard to Believe Statement from Fund Manager: "Solana Price Could Rise to $400, Here's Why" - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to Ryan McMillin, Chief Investment Officer of cryptocurrency fund manager Merkle Tree Capital, Solana is predicted to rise to $400 during the US elections in November, riding on the wave of election-themed memecoins.
Two Solana-based altcoins, Jeo Boden and Donald Tremp, named after mashed-up versions of the last two US presidents, were instrumental in this prediction. These memecoins helped Solana surpass Ethereum in trading volume this Thursday.


“Memecoins will move deeper into the bull market,” said McMillin, suggesting that these two altcoins will be actively traded in the coming months. The rise of these memecoins coincided with former US President Donald Trump's strongest-ever support for crypto and current President Joe Biden's threat last week to veto a pro-crypto bill, thus making cryptocurrencies an election issue.
According to the analyst, the volatility experienced in Solana due to this news is expected to restore investors' confidence in the blockchain, which has been marred by outages over the years. “While Memecoins are a ridiculous and short-term speculative tool, they pave the way for other, more sustainable use cases, such as the tokenization of real-world assets,” McMillin added.






Currently, Solana is trading around $136, which is still far from the all-time high of $260 set in November 2021. But according to McMillin, the increased transaction volume served as a real stress test for the Solana network.
Additionally, the analyst suggested that Solana's price will be supported by more liquidity entering the market as the US Treasury takes steps to strengthen the economy.

                        As cryptocurrency markets rebound ahead of a week packed with important US economic data releases, various meme coins are leading the pack and might be the best crypto to buy now.Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading in the upper $62,000s, up 2% on the day but still stuck within recent ranges.US CPI and Retail Sales data out on Wednesday could shock the market out of its recent ranges.As traders await macro catalysts, an unexpected theme has jumped into focus on Monday.Legendary GameStop (GME) meme stock investor Roaring Kitty resurfaced on X for the first time since 2021.The icon of the 2021 meme stock surge’s return has resulted in a surge in meme coin risk-taking activity.Meme coins are dominating the top performer charts today. Here are some that might be the best crypto to buy now.
Best Crypto to Buy NowDogecoin (DOGE)Dogecoin’s Potential for GrowthMonday saw a 5% surge in Dogecoin (DOGE) price as traders speculated on the potential arrival of a new meme coin season. As the largest and oldest meme coin by market capitalization, Dogecoin currently sits just under $0.15, boasting a substantial market cap of $22.2 billion.Despite its current price, many enthusiasts believe DOGE could reach the coveted $1 mark, propelling its market cap to over $140 billion.This potential for exponential growth, representing a 6.5x increase from its current value, positions Dogecoin as one of the best cryptos to buy today for investors willing to embrace the volatility inherent in the meme coin market.Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Shiba Inu (SHIB), currently the second-largest meme coin by market cap, also presents itself as a compelling investment opportunity.The recent 4% price increase, coupled with a potential upside break from its pennant structure, suggests a possible surge toward its March highs above $0.000045.Shiba Inu could be the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewSuch a rally would represent a near 100% increase from its current price, hovering around $0.000024.With a market cap exceeding $14 billion, Shiba Inu mirrors Dogecoin’s strength in its dedicated and vast community of over 3.8 million followers. This strong community support suggests that Shiba Inu is well-positioned to be the best crypto to buy today.Pepe Coin (PEPE)
Pepe Coin (PEPE) pumped to new record highs on Monday above $0.000011 per token.While it has since retraced lower to $0.000010, PEPE is still up 13% in 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.If it retraces to $0.000009, this could be a great support zone to buy at.Pepe could be the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewA still modest market cap of $4.2 billion suggests Pepe has some more room to run.PEPE could easily become a $20 billion meme coin in the years ahead. Potential 5x gains make it among the best cryptos to buy now.
Exciting Meme Coin Presale to Consider – Dogeverse (DV)
The above-noted meme coins could all post solid 3-5x gains.But if meme coin investors want to lock in 50-100x gains, they need to target newer/lesser-known coins.Analysts at Cryptonews are excited about a new meme coin, Dogeverse (DV), which is available in presale and has novel cross-chain capabilities.Dogeverse distinguishes itself from other meme coins through its multi-chain approach, launching on six of the most widely used blockchains (excluding Bitcoin) and incorporating multi-chain bridge capabilities. The strategic decision could position Dogeverse as a frontrunner in the competitive meme coin market, capitalizing on the diverse blockchain ecosystem.The project has already attracted considerable attention, raising over $15 million in presale funding. Its multi-chain accessibility and ambitious vision suggest Dogeverse possesses the ingredients for viral success, attracting investors eager to participate in its presale phase.Visit Dogeverse Here

According to the CME’s FedWatch tool, market analysts forecast a 72% chance of rates remaining the same at July’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with the possibility of rate cuts pushed later in the year, at 48.6% at September’s meeting.

CFTC announces $1.8M settlement against brokerage firm FalconX

The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that it had both filed and settled charges against cryptocurrency brokerage firm Falcon Labs for roughly $1.8 million in disgorgement and penalties.In a May 13 notice, the CFTC said Falcon Labs, owned by FalconX, had failed to register as a futures commission merchant, “inappropriately facilitat[ing] access to digital asset exchanges.” The settlement required FalconX to cease offering services to U.S. residents and pay roughly $1.2 million in disgorgement and $600,000 in civil monetary penalties.“The CFTC’s enforcement program has made clear it will not tolerate digital asset exchanges that fail to register with the CFTC or comply with the agency’s rules that maintain integrity in the derivatives markets,” said Enforcement Director Ian McGinley. “And now the CFTC is taking the fight one step further by, for the first time, charging an intermediary that inappropriately facilitated access to those exchanges.”The settlement alleged that FalconX facilitated orders for digital asset derivatives for U.S. users from October 2021 to March 2023 through its ‘Edge’ product. According to the CFTC, the brokerage firm voluntarily improved its practices after its lawsuit with Binance and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. In that case, the CFTC and other U.S. authorities settled for $4.3 billion in November 203.Related: Mark Cuban advocates for CFTC to regulate ‘all crypto’ ahead of US election dayThe regulator said that FalconX had provided “substantial cooperation and remediation,” resulting in the firm receiving a lower penalty. The CFTC order included that the firm was not “admitting or denying” any of the regulator’s findings or conclusions. Cointelegraph reached out to FalconX but did not receive a response at the time of publication.On May 6, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said crypto firms operating in the U.S. could expect “another cycle of enforcement actions” within two years.

OpenAI introduces GPT-4o model, promising real-time conversation

OpenAI announced a new model, GPT-4o, which will soon allow real-time conversation with an AI assistant.In a May 13 demo, OpenAI members showed that the model can provide breathing feedback, tell a story, and help solve a math problem, among other applications.Head of Frontiers Research Mark Chen noted that, although users could previously access Voice Mode, the new model allows interruptions, no longer has a multi-second delay, and can recognize and communicate in various emotional styles.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the update in a separate blog post, calling it the “best computer interface I’ve ever used,” adding that it “feels like AI from the movies.”He said:“Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”In addition to improved text, video, and visual capabilities, GPT-4o is faster and offers the same level of intelligence as GPT-4.Full availability pendingInitially, GPT-4o will have limited features, but the model can already understand and discuss images “much better than any existing model.” In one example, OpenAI suggested that the model can examine a menu and provide translations, context, and recommendations.Each of the company’s subscription models includes different access limits. Starting today, ChatGPT Free users can access the feature with usage limits. GPT-4o to ChatGPT Plus and Team users can also access GPT-4o with five times greater usage limits.The company also plans to extend the feature to Enterprise users later with “even higher limits.”OpenAI will introduce the updated “Voice Mode” in the near future. It plans to release an alpha in the coming weeks, with early access for Plus users.Competitive AI sectorOpenAI’s updates follow other upgrades from competing companies.In March, Anthropic released an upgrade to Claude that it called superior to OpenAI’s GPT-4. Meta, meanwhile, announced Llama 3 with an improved parameter count in April.Other industry developments are yet to occur. Google is set to host its I/O conference on May 14, featuring AI within several keynotes. Apple is expected to announce iOS 18 in June, which is expected to include various new AI features.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Led by Bitcoin, why is the crypto market up today? - AMBCrypto



Crypto markets are in the green once again, thanks to factors like CME, U.S. economy and long-term holders.
Bitcoin bulls are facing the stress of pulling prices back to the immediate support level of $68,000.

The global cryptocurrency market cap has seen an increase of 1.8% in the past twenty-four hours, coming up on what can be seen as a modest recovery from the start of the weekend. 
By this time yesterday, Bitcoin [BTC] was barely hanging onto $60,000. At press time, it was worth $63,111, up by 4% on the daily chart. But is there any special reason for this minute surge? And will it hold firm?
Why Bitcoin is up
Examining data from Coinglass, Bitcoin is the most liquidated asset over the past day. It has seen over $36 million gone, mostly from Binance [BNB]. 
Overall, the data suggests that traders are actively responding to price changes with corresponding changes in their market positions, indicating a market highly sensitive to both external influences and internal sentiment changes.
Source: Coinglass
Still. Bitcoin is in the green and going up. Looking at reasons for the abrupt resilience, Coinglass data also tells us that Bitcoin’s CME open interest has increased by over 3% in twenty-four hours.
 Moreover, spot netflow has seen nearly $140 million over the same timeframe.
Source: Coinglass
 
Another reason why Bitcoin is holding firm is the U.S. economic data getting released on the 14th of May. 
Going by the negative pattern Jerome Powell has established this year, interest rate decisions have proven to be bullish for Bitcoin, seeing as rate cuts aren’t coming anytime soon.
Meanwhile, experienced Bitcoin holders are echoing the 2021 bull market vibe, as suggested by some on-chain data. 
Currently, long-term holders (LTHs) are increasing their BTC holdings after having sold off early this year.
The data suggests that, similar to mid-2021, these long-term holders are trying to acquire a larger share of the BTC supply. 
They view the low Bitcoin prices as a chance to buy more coins at a bargain, to then sell them when market excitement picks up. 
A pattern can be traced from 2018 and 2021, showing a recurring cycle where long-term holders purchase during market lows and sell during highs. 
Despite these cycles, there’s a noticeable, persistent trend where an increasingly majority portion of Bitcoin is being held by long-term holders.
Bitcoin’s current stand
AMBCrypto’s dissection of TradingView data for the BTC/USDt pair reveals a strong resistance level around the $68,000 mark, which BTC has tested multiple times over the past month without a sustained breakthrough. 
Conversely, a clear support level is evident near the $60,000 level, below which, if Bitcoin falls, further corrections to $55k and beyond could be witnessed.
The frequent and relatively large price swings within short periods (as seen from the candlestick sizes) highlight the ongoing volatility in the Bitcoin market. 
This pattern suggests a trader’s market, where short-term gains can be captured based on swift movements.

As of the latest data point, the price is experiencing another pullback towards the upward support level. 
This could be indicative of another potential buying opportunity if the pattern holds as previous instances suggest. All in all, the bears are very much in control.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 3,000% Surge For Shiba Inu - Here’s The Timeline | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Davie Satoshi has dropped a bullish prediction for Shiba Inu as part of what might be the future outlook for major meme coins. According to the analyst, SHIB is one of the meme coins with the potential to go on a 1,000% to 3,000% price surge amidst a flurry of cryptocurrencies in the meme coin niche. SHIB, on the other hand, is currently struggling with bearish price action as the bulls find themselves outnumbered by the bears.  
Surge Potential For Shiba Inu
The crypto market is full of different meme coins, each with its own community. Particularly, meme coin demand has shot up this year, with many new meme coins shooting up in value. However, investing in meme coins has its own demerits. This is because the value of these cryptocurrencies is driven by hype and sentiment, as most of them do not have a real-world utility to back up their value. As a result, some of them can tank quickly and go back to zero as easily as they shot up.

Despite this risk, some of these meme cryptocurrencies have established themselves as major industry players over the years. According to Davie Satoshi, SHIB is one of the few cryptocurrencies that fall in this safe category and can “never go to zero.” 
From his viewpoint, SHIB can go on a 10x to 30x journey in the current market cycle. This translates to a 1,000% to 3,000% surge to a price range of $0.0002250 to $0.0006750. Interestingly, this prediction is way above the current SHIB all-time high, which is at $0.00008616.
How Feasible Is This Price Target For SHIB?
SHIB is no stranger to price rises of epic proportions. After the last halving, SHIB went on an 800,000% price surge and turned many of its early holders into crypto millionaires overnight. However, the crypto landscape has evolved since then and SHIB would need to gain a better mainstream adoption and develop utility before a similar price surge can occur. 
SHIB has grown over the years from its early days as a meme cryptocurrency and now stands behind only DOGE in terms of meme coin market cap. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is now home to its own community projects including a layer-2 scaling solution (Shibarium), other tokens like BONK and LEASH, and many others. 

Shiba Inu’s team members are actively working to transform the cryptocurrency into a utility-based cryptocurrency. According to a similar prediction from crypto analyst Xanrox, Shiba Inu will definitely go higher later this year. Per his analysis, the best price to get in and catch the bounce to the upside is $0.00002249. 
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002181 and is down by 3.45% in the past 24 hours. Davie Satoshi also mentioned DOGE, PEPE, WIF, and COQ as meme cryptocurrencies with the potential to grow by 10x to 30x.

50,000% Return? Bitcoin Whale Starts Moving Decade-Old BTC Investment | Cryptoglobe


                                
A long-dormant Bitcoin whale has seemingly resurfaced after nearly 11 years and has now moved 1,000 BTC worth nearly $61 million to new cryptocurrency wallets, at a time in which the price of the cryptocurrency started recovering.



According on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the whale made two transactions after being inactive for 10.7 years, moving funds from two wallets that received 500 BTC each back in September 2013, when Bitcoin was trading at just $124 per coin.



In total, the whale received $124,000 worth of the flagship cryptocurrency and remained dormant since then, allowing the price of BTC to appreciate around 50,000% to now trade at $63,000 per coin, which the whale moved to two new addresses.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The whale’s movements come at a time in which the price of the flagship cryptocurrency has been seemingly stuck in a range between the $59,000 and the $67,000 marks over the past month, after dropping from an all-time high of over $73,000 earlier this year over the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US.



As CryptoGlobe reported, Wall Street behemoth Susquehanna International Group, known for its vast trading volume across global financial products, has significantly increased its exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin, amassing a $1.2 billion position on it in Q1 2024.



According to a recent 13-HR filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Susquehanna International now holds a massive17,271,326 shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), valued at roughly $1.09 billion as of March 31, as well as 1,349,414 shares of Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), valued at approximately $83.74 million.

                        Rain cryptocurrency exchange experienced a potential exploit on April 29, which transferred approximately $14.1 million worth of various cryptocurrencies to a new wallet under suspicious circumstances, according to a May 13 report from on-chain analyst ZachXBT.ZachXBT shared the information via their Telegram channel, noting that the exploit occurred on April 29. It entailed suspicious outflows from Rain’s Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP wallets. Funds from these wallets were swiftly transferred to instant exchanges, exchanged for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and then transferred to two addresses on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin address ending in “prp2” holds 137.9 BTC, valued at $8.6 million.Arkham Intelligence data reveals that the Ethereum destination address received its funds from an address ending in “d609,” which, in turn, received the funds from various Bitgo multi-signature wallets. Arkham has not explicitly attributed these wallets to Rain, however.BitGo MultiSig wallets are allegedly related to suspicious outflows in Rain. Source: Arkham Intelligence.Although these wallets have not been explicitly identified as belonging to Rain, they were involved in sending over 590 ETH ($1.7 million), approximately 20 billion Shiba Inu ($481,000), 12,500 Chainlink ($169,000), $240,000 Tether (USDT), and $500,000 USD Coin (USDC). These tokens were promptly swapped for ETH on Uniswap. Additionally, the Uniswap account received funds from a Binance hot wallet.Rain, a centralized crypto exchange based in Bahrain, primarily serves customers in Southwest Asia and the Middle East. Since its establishment, Rain has facilitated trading volumes exceeding $1 billion, according to regional news outlet The National.The exchange’s “pro” version has been intermittently down since May 5, according to Rain’s website, however.In 2023, Rain obtained approval from Abu Dhabi‘s financial regulator to operate as a virtual asset brokerage and custody service provider.
ZachXBT Alleges Lazarus Group’s Crypto Laundering
In recent posts, ZachXBT has made other substantial claims, including allegations that North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundered $200 million worth of cryptocurrency into fiat currency over a four-year period.According to ZachXBT’s analysis, at least $44 million worth of stolen crypto has been laundered through Paxful and Noones, utilizing two usernames, “EasyGoatfish351” and “FairJunco470,” which exhibited deposits and trading volumes corresponding to the stolen funds.The stolen funds were reportedly converted into Tether (USDT) stablecoin before being exchanged for cash and withdrawn. The Lazarus Group has historically relied on China-based over-the-counter traders for crypto-to-fiat conversions.Additionally, ZachXBT reported that a holder of Bored Ape Yacht Club tokens fell victim to a phishing attack, losing three rare NFTs – BAYC #7531, BAYC #6736, and BAYC #2100.Crypto investors lost $2 billion to hacks and exploits in the crypto industry last year, and an additional $333 million was stolen in the first quarter of this year.

Aptos Posts Triple-Digit Gains In Key Metrics, Yet APT Price Struggles At $8.40


																According to a report by Messari, Layer 1 (L1) blockchain Aptos experienced substantial gains in key metrics during the first quarter (Q1) of the year. The growth was driven by the surge in Bitcoin prices to new record highs and increased capital inflow in the market. 
However, Aptos’ native token, APT, has struggled with price performance, recording modest gains compared to other top cryptocurrencies.
Aptos Network Activity Surges
The report highlighted that Aptos’ circulating market cap increased 127% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to $6.6 billion.
This growth outpaced other projects with similar market caps, improving market cap rank from 33 to 22. Despite this growth, APT’s price experienced a more modest increase of 76% QoQ. 
Aptos’ market cap increase was recorded during Q1. Source: Messari
Aptos revenue, which encompasses all fees collected by the protocol, grew by 37% to $475,000. However, when denominated in APT, the revenue decreased by 10%. All revenue generated by Aptos is burned, but these burned tokens have not significantly reduced inflation.

APT inflation started at a 7% annualized rate and is set to decrease by 1.5% each year until it reaches 3.5%. By mid-October, the inflation rate had reduced to just under 6.9%. Additionally, there was inflationary pressure from the genesis supply unlocks, with almost 31% of the genesis supply distributed by the end of Q1.
Looking at network activity, Aptos witnessed a significant increase in transactions and active addresses in Q1. Average daily transactions and addresses saw 66% and 97% QoQ growth rates, respectively. 
Despite the increased transaction activity, the average transaction fee decreased by 45% QoQ to 0.0006 APT ($0.007). Furthermore, average daily new addresses grew by 91% QoQ to 44,000, and the weighted average one-month retention rate increased by 82% QoQ to 14%.
APT Staked Tokens Decrease 5%
Regarding staking, APT staked decreased by 5% to 861 million tokens. However, when denominated in USD, the staked market cap grew by 68% QoQ, surpassing $14 billion. 
Aptos’ DeFi TVL growth during Q1. Source: Messari
As seen in the chart above, Aptos also experienced growth in its decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), which increased by 376% QoQ to $573 million. 
According to Messari, this increase was not solely due to APT price appreciation; TVL also grew by 170% QoQ in APT terms. Additionally, Aptos’s stablecoin market cap nearly doubled QoQ, reaching $97 million.
APT Struggles To Break $8.80 Resistance
Despite these positive developments, APT’s price performance has faced challenges. The native token has declined over 16% in the past month, resulting in a modest 2.7% surge year-to-date. This contrasts with the double or triple-digit gains seen by other top cryptocurrencies.

Currently trading at $8.46, APT has struggled to surpass its nearest resistance wall at $8.80, leading to a consolidation phase between $8.20 and $8.70 over the past month.

Keith Gill, Known as Roaring Kitty, Sparks Meme Stocks Rally


GameStop’s shares have seen a rally of more than 70%, reminiscent of a few years ago. This time, it was due to the return of trader and investor Keith Gill, better known as “Roaring Kitty.”
The stock market was set ablaze on Monday as Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” suddenly returned to social media, reigniting the meme stock frenzy that captivated the world in 2021. 
Speculation Mounts Around Meme Stocks
Gill’s post on X, depicting a video gamer intently leaning forward — a stance known to signal serious gameplay — was enough to send GameStop and AMC Entertainment’s stocks through the roof, with increases of 77.5% and 77.9%, respectively.
This dramatic market reaction marks the first time Gill has been publicly active since his last appearance roughly three years ago. The mysterious post quickly attracted over 12 million views, with Gill adding a cryptic video clip hours later, further fueling speculation and excitement among traders.


GameStop saw its shares momentarily peak at a staggering 110% increase before stabilizing. The trading frenzy was so intense that it triggered multiple daily trading halts. Similarly, AMC shares also saw a significant uptick, with prices doubling at one point during the trading session.
The resurgence of these stocks can be traced back to Gill’s influence in the early days of the pandemic. His advocacy for GameStop, a struggling video game retailer at the time, drew in a horde of retail investors who opposed hedge funds shorting the stock. 

This collective action forced massive buy-ins from short sellers, skyrocketing the stock’s price and causing significant disruptions in the market.

Gill’s recent activity has spurred buying in GameStop and AMC and spilled over to other meme stocks like BlackBerry and Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., which experienced their own respective rallies. Still, some industry analysts remain skeptical. 

“I don’t think they have the numbers to keep this up, nor do I think the shorts have the resolve shown by Gabe Plotkin three years ago, so likely this fizzles as the fundamentals continue to deteriorate,” Wedbush’s Michael Pachter said.

Edward Snowden warns that Bitcoin developers must prioritize privacy at the protocol level to protect users as the U.S. government intensifies its scrutiny of crypto mixers.
                        Two crypto-supportive senators have urged the Justice Department (DOJ) to reconsider its recent enforcement action against a popular Bitcoin privacy service.Protecting Bitcoin Privacy Tools
On Monday, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) publicly shared a letter arguing that the DOJ’s “unprecedented interpretation” of what constitutes an unlicensed “money services business” (MSB) contradicts both Treasury Department guidance and the intent of Congress.“This interpretation threatens to criminalize Americans offering non-custodial crypto asset software services,” read the letter, co-authored by Lummis and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR).Late last month, the DOJ arrested the founders of Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet for allegedly operating an unregistered MSB, allowing criminals to use their service for money laundering.Specifically, Samourai used CoinJoin transactions to enhance user privacy, which involves multiple parties combining the inputs and outputs of their transactions into one transaction, making the flow of funds difficult to trace on the blockchain.While Samourai’s wallet did require a centralized server to coordinate CoinJoin transactions, the service never involved taking control of users’ actual funds.That makes Samourai’s case a tricky legal topic, since the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) defines “money transmission” as “the acceptance of currency…and the transmission of currency…to another location or person by any means.”What Counts As Money Transmission?
The senators argued in their letter that such definitions were clear, and required so that other groups like internet service providers and postal code carriers weren’t caught up in the definition of an MSB. By the same logic, the definition would fail to capture that of crypto wallets where users maintain control of their private keys.“Subjecting developers of non-custodial crypto asset software to potential criminal liability… will only serve to stifle innovation and shake confidence in the DOJ’s respect for the rule of law,” the letter concluded.By contrast, the DOJ’s interpretation of the money-transmitting business statute posits that a money transmitter need not have actual control of the funds that it transfers. It likened money transmission to a USB cable transferring data between devices, or a frying pan transmitting heat from a stove the the pan’s contents.The DOJ has since issued a warning to crypto users that they could lose funds in wallets provided by non-regulated entities, which could face future prosecution by the department.

As 'Roaring Kitty' Returns, Here Are 3 ETFs To Leverage The 2024 Meme Stock Wave - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AMC Enter Hldgs (NYSE:AMC) - Benzinga

Meme stocks have once again captured the spotlight in the financial market following the return of Keith Gill — known widely as “Roaring Kitty”— to social media after a three-year hiatus. For those unfamiliar, Gill is a pivotal figure in the meme stock phenomenon that took the financial world by storm in early 2021. As an individual investor and financial analyst, he became famous for his role in the explosive rise of GameStop Inc. GME’s stock price.The struggling video game retailer saw its shares soar from under $20 to nearly $500 at their peak in January 2021, largely driven by a short squeeze on investors who had bet against the stock amid weak fundamentals. Unlike traditional stocks, which are influenced by fundamental analysis and corporate performance, meme stocks are often subject to rapid price changes driven by hype and mass trading actions.Gill chronicled his investment journey across various platforms, including YouTube and Reddit, notably under the username u/DeepF******Value on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets. His philosophy is emblematic of a broader narrative about meme stocks and the democratization of investing, illustrating how individual investors can unite to disrupt the financial status quo of seasoned and large investors.Gill’s resurgence on  X (formerly known as Twitter) on May 13, sparked a viral reaction. A posted image of a man intensely focused on a video game, adopting a serious gaming stance, served as a metaphor for Gill’s impactful return to the public eye.The post has attracted considerable attention, amassing over 10K retweets, 24K quote tweets, 94K likes, and over 19 million views, highlighting its widespread appeal and significance.As a result, GameStop’s share price soared by 74% on Monday, representing the fourth-largest one-day gain since the company’s IPO in 2002. This surge trails only behind the spikes of 104% on Feb. 21, 2021, 135% on Jan. 27, 2021, and 93% on Jan. 26, 2021.Similarly, other meme-related stocks experienced significant increases. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC saw its shares climb nearly 80%, marking its most substantial single-day rise since June 2021, the third strongest in its history.

Price analysis 5/13: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, TON, DOGE, ADA

Traders prefer a trending market rather than a range-bound one. Sometimes, when there is uncertainty about the next directional move, traders step to the sidelines, and that seems to be the case with Bitcoin (BTC). According to research firm Santiment, “fear and indecision” could be the factors that have led to a drop in Bitcoin’s on-chain activity toward historic lows. The firm clarified that it does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin will fall more.Bitcoin’s consolidation is giving opportunities to investors to load up on Bitcoin. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet said it had made a “strategic shift” in its treasury management strategy to follow a Bitcoin-only approach in response to a sustained decline in the Japanese yen. Metaplanet announced a purchase of 117.7 Bitcoin at an average price of $65,000.Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

If the price turns down from this level, the index may stay range-bound between 5,265 and 4,950 for a while.U.S. Dollar Index price analysisThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) broke below the 20-day EMA (105) on May 9, indicating aggressive selling by the bears on every minor rally.DXY daily chart.

If that happens, the index could rally to 106.50.Alternatively, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bears are in charge.

Big Week: US CPI, Ethereum ETF, SEC vs Ripple, and More News


This week is key for the crypto market, as several pieces of news will show the industry players’ direction. 
From inflation data to legislation would affect the crypto industry, and even updates on spot Ethereum ETFs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple.
Wednesday’s US Consumer Price Index
This week, the market will witness the release of the US Consumer Price Index data, which could be busy defining the direction of the crypto market. Analysts expect the underlying CPI to rise 0.3%, up from 0.4% in March. 

“Investors need to have some level of reassurance that inflation is not going to go back up, and potentially down, to give the Fed cover for at least one or maybe two cuts before the end of the year,” Thomas Hayes, president of Great Hill Capital LLC, said.

The SEC’s Position on Spot Ethereum ETFs
Forecasts that rule out the SEC’s upcoming approval of spot Ethereum ETFs are growing. The regulator recently delayed the review of Galaxy Invesco’s proposed Ethereum ETF for 60 days until July 5. Meanwhile, ARK Invest and 21Shares removed staking from their SEC filing due to a regulatory crackdown on crypto staking. 
Analysts already predict Ethereum will fall to $2,500 if the ETF is denied. However, if approved, ETH could surpass $4,000.

In the coming weeks, the SEC will file a decision on several Ethereum ETF proposals. These include BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark Invest and 21Shares, Fidelity, VanEck, Hashdex, Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy Digital, and Bitwise. 
Crypto Regulations in the US Congress
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry said the US Congress could vote on the “Financial Innovation and Technology Act of the 21st Century” (FIT21) before the end of May. FIT21 would impose jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies in investment contracts. 
Representatives believe the legislation would cement US leadership in the international financial system for decades. 


“With the floor vote announced today, Congress will take a historic step toward providing a clear regulatory framework for digital asset markets,” McHenry said.

SEC vs. Ripple Update Expected
Finally, one of the most emblematic legal cases in the crypto market, SEC v Ripple, is expected to make news headlines. The latest development around this is that both parties involved filed omnibus letter motions to seal proceedings.

These pieces of evidence represent one of the last steps before judges rule on the case. The goal is to conclude whether Ripple must pay a hefty fine for its XRP sales.

OpenAI’s latest upgrade essentially lets users livestream with ChatGPT

ChatGPT creator OpenAI has announced its latest AI model, GPT-4o, a chattier, more humanlike AI chatbot, which can interpret a user’s audio and video and respond in real time.A series of demos released by the firm shows GPT-4 Omni helping potential users with things like interview preparation — by making sure they look presentable for the interview — as well as calling a customer service agent to get a replacement iPhone.Other demos show it can share dad jokes, translate a bilingual conversation in real time, be the judge of a rock-paper-scissors match between two users, and respond with sarcasm when asked. One demo even shows how ChatGPT reacts to being introduced to the user’s puppy for the first time.  "Well hello, Bowser! Aren't you just the most adorable little thing?" the chatbot exclaimed.


“It feels like AI from the movies; and it’s still a bit surprising to me that it’s real,” said the firm’s CEO, Sam Altman, in a May 13 blog post.“Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”A text and image-only input version was launched on May 13, with the full version set to roll out in the coming weeks, OpenAI said in a recent X post. GPT-4o will be available to both paid and free ChatGPT users and will be accessible from ChatGPT’s API.OpenAI said the “o” in GPT-4o stands for “omni” — which seeks to mark a step toward more natural human-computer interactions. 


GPT-4o’s ability to process any input of text, audio and image at the same time is a considerable advancement compared with OpenAI’s earlier AI tools, such as ChatGPT-4, which often “loses a lot of information” when forced to multi-task.Related: Apple finalizing deal with OpenAI for ChatGPT iPhone integration: ReportOpenAI said “GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models,” which even includes picking up on a user’s emotions and breathing patterns.It is also “much faster” and “50% cheaper” than GPT-4 Turbo in OpenAI’s API.The new AI tool can respond to audio inputs in as little as 2.3 seconds, with an average time of 3.2 seconds, OpenAI claims, which it says is similar to human response times in an ordinary conversation.Magazine: ​​How to stop the artificial intelligence apocalypse: David Brin, Uplift author

Buy Or Sell Bitcoin? Quant Reveals What Leading Metric Says


																A quant has explained what a potential leading Bitcoin indicator could say about what’s next for the cryptocurrency’s price.
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium May Hold The Answer To Where BTC Goes Next
In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the trend currently taking place in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium. “We can use the trend of Coinbase Premium as a leading indicator of the future direction of BTC price,” notes the quant.
The “Coinbase Premium” is a metric that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).

	Related Reading



When the value of this indicator is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is higher than on Binance right now. Such a trend suggests the buying pressure is higher (or the selling pressure is lower) on the former platform than on the latter.
On the other hand, the negative premium implies Coinbase might be observing a higher amount of selling than Binance, as the asset is currently trading at a lower price there.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium over the last couple of years:

The 30-day MA value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant
As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has been positive recently, suggesting that Coinbase users have supported the asset through the rally.
Coinbase is popularly known as the preferred platform of the US-based institutional entities, while Binance has a more global user base. As such, the premium’s value can provide hints about how the behavior of the American whales differs from that of the rest of the world.
From the chart, it’s visible that the buying pressure from these institutional traders peaked alongside the price top but has since been declining. The metric continues to be positive overall, although it’s now quite close to the neutral zero mark.
In the graph, the quant has highlighted an interesting pattern that the cryptocurrency has followed regarding the Coinbase Premium during the last two years. It would appear that whenever the indicator has hit bottom in negative territory and reversed back to an uptrend, the coin’s price has observed a rebound.

	Related Reading



An example of this trend also played out just earlier in the year, when a reversal in the indicator led to Bitcoin observing a rally in which the asset would eventually break its all-time high.
The Coinbase Premium is currently riding a downtrend, but it’s yet to dip into negative territory. The analyst explains that BTC is in a “wait and see” phase, where a rebound might be a bit longer out. The metric has to first decline more and reach a reversal point, at least if the historical pattern has to repeat.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had slipped under $61,000 earlier, but the asset has found a slight rebound in the past day, returning above $62,700.

Crypto Fear and Greed Index signals greed: Bitcoin, altcoins to rally? - AMBCrypto



The crypto Fear and Greed Index indicated that the market could get greedy, going forward.
Ethereum and Solana could gain from the rise in greed as well.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] price hasn’t budged significantly over the past few days, suggesting a neutral market sentiment.
However, despite the inactivity of BTC’s price, the crypto Fear and Greed Index told a different story.
Holders get greedy
The Fear and Greed Index gave a reading of 57 at the time of writing, which suggested that most of the market was willing to buy BTC and was mostly bullish.
This could mean that BTC’s price may surge significantly going forward and may even reach the $65,000 level.
The long positions taken in favor of BTC had also grown materially from 48% to 51.23% over the past few days as well, according to Coinglass’ data.
Source: coinglass
At press time, BTC was trading at $62,581.09 and its price had grown by 2.21% in the last 24 hours.
Despite the recent uptick in price, the MVRV ratio for BTC had declined significantly, implying that most holders were still unprofitable and there wasn’t much selling pressure on the king coin.
Source: Santiment
However, it won’t just be BTC that will be affected by the rising greed in the markets. As BTC is highly correlated with other altcoins in the industry, they are expected to see growth as well.
Across the board
For instance, Ethereum witnessed an uptick of 1.27% as well in the last 24 hours.
AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s data revealed that the velocity of ETH had also grown significantly, implying that the frequency of transactions occurring on the Ethereum network had surged materially.
This could mean a positive turn of events could unfold for ETH holders in the future.
Even though the price of ETH was growing, it was observed that the network growth for ETH had declined. This indicated that new addresses were losing interest in ETH as a token.
The falling network growth of ETH can hinder the ability of ETH’s price to climb in the future.

Other altcoins such as SOL could also benefit from a greedy market. At press time, SOL was trading at $145.66 and its price had grown by 0.44% in the last 24 hours.
Coupled with that, the social volume for SOL had also surged, indicating a rise in popularity for the SOL token.

Trader Says Two Ethereum Rivals Could Outperform Crypto Market, Predicts Rally for Low-Cap Altcoin - The Daily Hodl


								A popular crypto strategist is naming two Ethereum (ETH) challengers that he thinks will rise faster than the rest of the market once conditions improve.
Pseudonymous analyst The Crypto Dog tells his 776,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s long-term bullish on Near (NEAR).










According to the trader, NEAR has been one of the faster horses this cycle and he believes it will burst right out of the gate once the crypto market catches a bid.
“Still believe taking a multi-month NEAR position today is a good move. Lock it in and don’t trade it.
NEAR keeps showing relative strength along with coins [latching] AI (artificial intelligence) trend. When the market turns, it will outperform.”
At time of writing, NEAR is worth $6.95.
Next up, the analyst is also keeping a close watch on fellow layer-1 altcoin AIOZ (AIOZ). The Crypto Dog says he’s also willing to hold AIOZ over a multi-month period.
“Been ranging for the last couple of months, should pick up again and outperform when the market swings back. I’m trading lees, taking bigger, longer-time positions.”
At time of writing, AIOZ is trading at $0.778, down nearly 4% in the past day.
The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the gaming-focused crypto project Xai (XAI). According to the analyst, XAI could skyrocket by nearly 60% from current levels in the coming weeks.
“I’d think XAI can send back to $1 by June, seems like a good price at the moment. (I am a heavy bagholder).”

At time of writing, XAI is worth $0.635.

China Takes Down $295M Crypto Underground Bank: Beginning Of A Bigger Crackdown?


								Chinese law enforcement has disrupted a covert banking network that leveraged cryptocurrencies to execute unauthorized foreign exchange transactions totaling around 2.14 billion yuan ($295.8 million).
This illicit operation mainly converted the Chinese yuan into the South Korean won, evading the established legal frameworks for currency exchange.

Uncovering The Shadow Crypto Banking Network 
In Jilin province, police apprehended six people connected to this operation, underscoring the growing role of digital currencies in bypassing standard financial regulations.
According to official statements, this clandestine banking entity utilized cryptocurrencies’ inherent “anonymity and decentralization” to carry out these unlawful transactions.
It was reported that the accused managed domestic bank accounts to receive and channel funds and conduct over-the-counter cryptocurrency trades.
These activities primarily served several business types, including South Korean purchasing agents, cross-border e-commerce entities, and firms engaged in import-export trade. This setup enabled the illegal exchange of currencies between the yuan and the won, violating regulatory norms.
Notably, the busting of this underground bank is part of a broader crackdown by Chinese authorities on crypto-related activities. Despite banning cryptocurrencies and related operations like Bitcoin mining, China remains active in policing the sector.
This action follows the recent investigation of Yao Qian, a former pro-blockchain official, under suspicions of “serious violations of discipline and law.” However, details of the allegations against Qian remain unclear, with authorities only citing vague violations. The report noted:
Yao Qian, Director of the Science and Technology Supervision Department and Director of the Information Center of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently under investigation by the Central Committee.
Challenges Facing China’s Digital Currency Initiatives
While China combats illegal crypto operations, it faces challenges in promoting its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY, or digital yuan.
Despite government efforts to pilot the e-CNY in various cities and reports of billions in transactions, public reception remains tepid.
For instance, state employees in some regions are paid partly in digital yuan. Due to the lack of incentives and limited merchant adoption, they frequently convert their holdings back to cash.
The digital yuan struggles to compete with well-established digital payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay, which dominate online and offline transactions.

Sammy Lin, an account manager at a Chinese state bank, noted the absence of benefits in holding the digital yuan, stating, “There’s no interest if I leave it there, and there aren’t many places where I can use it.”
This sentiment reflects broader concerns about the e-CNY’s practicality and the need for more compelling use cases to ensure widespread adoption.

King Mark Cuban (KINGCUBA) to Surge 16,000% Ahead of ByBit Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and King Mark Cuban (KINGCUBA) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



King Mark Cuban (KINGCUBA), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 16,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KINGCUBA will be listed on ByBit, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy King Mark Cuban.



Currently, King Mark Cuban can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KINGCUBA on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for King Mark Cuban by entering its contract address – B8V4DqTWPUjY3TkPtUp14MUvcdNToT65JDpMtUDGL8Vz – in the receiving field.




KINGCUBA currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Here Are The Bitcoin Layer 2s To Watch Out For, According To Grayscale


																Crypto asset management giant Grayscale says there’s a “renaissance” in Bitcoin development, with several new Layer 2s (L2s) worthy of keeping an eye on.
In a new investor report, Grayscale analyst Michael Zhao argued how these technologies may both bring new use cases to Bitcoin and foster more market demand for BTC.
Rollups On Bitcoin
Zhao first named Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BitVM) among Bitcoin’s “most anticipated” next generation of applications.
Published by Robin Linus in October, BitVM is a new computing model for verifying computations on Bitcoin, opening the network to smart contract functionality more familiar to Ethereum.
One of the leading applications of BitVM in development is optimistic Bitcoin rollups, letting users batch fast, cheap transactions together in off-chain environments before settling them back to Bitcoin in one piece.




“While still in its early stages, projects like Build on Bitcoin aim to incorporate BitVM for future settlement,” the report stated. Late last month, developers at BitcoinOS published a whitepaper explaining a practical Bitcoin rollup system that would let users bridge BTC back and forth between rollups in a decentralized manner.
Another technology highlighted by Grayscale was Spiderchains, developed by Botanix Labs. Spiderchains are layer 2 chains secured by staked Bitcoin (BTC) within decentralized multi-signature wallets.
Users’ pegged Bitcoin assets are secured by a rotating subset of 100 ”orchestrators” that manage the layer 2 chain, which can feature any functionality seen on other blockchains, like Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Staking With Babylon
Babylon is also expanding the Bitcoin “staking” world through its BTC re-staking technology. This would allow BTC holders to stake their coins and earn yield on them by using them to secure other blockchain networks, like Solana or Ethereum, if the latter networks were upgraded to allow for it.
Finally, projects like Taproot Assets seek to bring tokenization – specifically stablecoins – to one of Bitcoin’s most popular current L2s: the lightning network.
“With numerous projects vying for attention and liquidity simultaneously, the Pareto principle suggests that only a select few will emerge as successful projects in the coming years, similar to patterns observed on other smart contract platforms,” Grayscale wrote.
Given Bitcoin’s underdeveloped smart contract ecosystem, Grayscale believes it could be a massive untapped market. For example, while roughly 17% of Ethereum’s total market cap ($360 billion) is currently used in applications, the value locked in Bitcoin dapps is still just 0.2% of its total market cap ($1.2 trillion).
“If the latest wave of development results in more adoption for these use cases, it would imply a larger addressable market and potentially a higher market value over time,” Grayscale concluded.

Pepe hits all-time high, memecoins soar after famous GameStop stock trader ‘returns’

Pepe (PEPE) price topped the $0.000010 level for the first time since March 15.

On the night of May 12, the account posted an image of a man holding a controller and moving to sit forward in his chair as if to focus. Users on X and Reddit interpreted it as Gill saying it was a period of “locking in,” a colloquial term for a period of intense focus or concentration.Source: TheRoaringKittyGill was at the center of the 2021 meme stock frenzy when shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment, among others, surged more than 1,000% by the end of the year.

The latest rally has seen PEPE rise above a critical resistance level, which has underpinned the price since March.

Who Is Roaring Kitty, and What Does His Return Mean for Crypto? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFinancial analyst turned stock and meme influencer Roaring Kitty has roared back onto social media. His return to Twitter on Sunday didn’t even directly mention GameStop—the stock whose rollercoaster ride sparked global headlines and a documentary film—but nonetheless prompted the price of GME to double briefly and preceded a 1,900% surge in a Solana-based tribute coin also named GME.What’s the connection between Roaring Kitty—whose real name is Keith Gill—the failed video game retailer, and meme coins?Gill is no fringe character. He was the subject of the 2023 film “Dumb Money,” which told the story of the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, after his stock analysis and campaign to promote GameStop stock largely started the fire that engulfed Wall Street in 2021—and led him to testify on Capitol Hill.He announced his return with a single tweet on Sunday with an image of a man sitting up in his seat, holding a video game controller with a look of keen interest on his face.It was his first tweet in over 150 weeks. And it was enough to fuel another maelstrom in both crypto and traditional investing circles.Who is Roaring Kitty?Before he took the financial sector by storm as Roaring Kitty (or DeepFuckingValue on Reddit), Gill dreamed of being a track and field star and even appeared in an edition of Sports Illustrated, according to the Wall Street Journal. Gill’s first foray into creating content on YouTube was posting a 4:33 mile run, where he lost a bet to beat 4:30.While his dreams of racing stardom failed to pan out after an injury, Gill shifted his focus to the stock market. In 2019, Gill became a director of financial wellness at life insurance company MassMutual. That same year, he joined Reddit and began posting on the WallStreetsBets subreddit.Gill gained widespread fame for his role in the GameStop short squeeze that occurred on January 27, 2021. Under his "DeepFuckingValue" account on Reddit, he earned a following for his investment in GameStop’s stock, his advocacy for the asset on social media, and his Roaring Kitty YouTube channel.“FYI these positions are up in March,” Gill wrote in a Reddit post in 2020. “GME has been crushing the market on a relative basis.”The stage was set.GameStopAt the time, the gaming retailer had been struggling financially, and many institutional investors and hedge funds believed its GME stock was overvalued, taking short positions on the GameStop stock. Short positions are an investment move where investors borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference.At the time, a share of GME stock was worth about $5.16. Before the GameStop surge started, its share price was way down from its prior all-time high.Users on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, including Gill, noticed the rising number of short positions being placed on GME, sensing an opportunity to trigger a short squeeze. A “short squeeze” is when the price of an asset rises sharply, prompting traders who had bet on its price falling or “shorting” to liquidate or sell their positions.While not single-handedly behind the GameStop short squeeze, Gill was a prominent figure in the conversation, having previously gone against the grain and deeming GameStop undervalued.“People talk up the demise of GameStop, yet here they are about to generate over $2 billion in [revenue] in a single quarter at the tail end of a console cycle,” Gill, writing as DeepFuckingValue, wrote on Reddit. “The ‘shift to digital’ thesis is way overblown. This business model has legs, and the new consoles will be a major tailwind.”As the price of GME rose, several firms that had bet against GameStop were forced to close their positions, including Melvin Capital, which lost nearly $3 billion for its GameStop shorting. SkyBridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci compared the GameStop short squeeze to the French Revolution.On January 28, the day after the GameStop short squeeze took place, Robinhood—the platform of choice for the legion of retail investors—was hit with two lawsuits after the trading platform blocked customers from purchasing more GameStop stock during its historic one-day run.At the time Robinhood blocked the purchase of GameStop, the stock had already reached $492—but soon fell to $193.The AftermathOn February 18, 2021, Gill was called to testify before the U.S. Congress House Committee on Financial Services. Joining him at the hearing were the CEOs of Robinhood and multinational hedge fund Citadel.“It is true that my investment in that company multiplied in value many times. For that, I feel enormously fortunate.” Gill said during the virtual hearing. “I also believe the current price of the shares demonstrates that I've been right about the company.”Dispelling any notion that he was a cat, Gill also told the members of Congress that he is also not an institutional investor or a hedge fund.“I do not have clients, and I do not provide personalized investment advice for fees or commissions,” he said. “I'm just an individual whose investment in GameStop, and posts on social media are based upon my own research and analysis.”Gill called the idea that he could use social media to promote GameStop stock and influence the market preposterous.“My post did not cause the movement of billions of dollars into Gamestop shares,” Gill said. “It is tragic that some people lost money and my heart goes out to them. But what happened in January just demonstrates again that investing in public securities is extremely risky.”Gill’s last Reddit post is dated April 16, 2021. He quietly left social media on June 18, 2021, after posting a video of sleeping cats on Twitter.It would be another 151 weeks before Roaring Kitty returned.After the frenzy around the GameStop short squeeze fizzled out, the stock's price returned to earth. Currently, it is trading at $36.90.GameStop did try to capitalize on the renewed interest in its business, even going so far as to make a push into cryptocurrency and NFTs. But the company’s crypto aspirations were short-lived as the firm shut down its NFT wallet in August 2023 citing regulatory uncertainty, and its NFT marketplace in January of this year.The GameStop short squeeze and Roaring Kitty’s part in the chaos were the focus of both a documentary and a feature film. In September 2022, Netflix launched the streaming mini-series “Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga,” which was followed in 2023 by the feature-length film “Dumb Money” starring Paul Dano as Roaring Kitty and Pete Davidson as Gill’s brother Kevin.The ReturnNews of Roaring Kitty’s return inspired social media influencers like Andrew Tate dumping Bitcoin to invest their money in GameStop stock and meme coins. For his part, Tate said he would sell $500,000 in Bitcoin to invest in the latest GameStop short squeeze.“I’m taking Wall Street down, watch me,” Tate said. "Fuck ‘em. Fuck ‘em all.”“Hey bro, what we buying?” Crypto Influencer Ansem asked in response to a Roaring Kitty tweet.Even Barstool Sports founder David Portnoy was also ready to jump in.“You wanna get nuts [Roaring Kitty] let's get nuts!” Portnoy wrote on Twitter. “Every time I think I'm out they pull me back in!” he said, quoting a line from the Godfather Part III.It's unclear why Gill chose Sunday to return to Twitter—his Reddit and YouTube account are still fallow as of this writing—and whether he will resume tweeting after posting a dozen times until 8 p.m. ET on Monday. He did not respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.But his reemergence has stirred the meme coin market, which rose 5.4% for the day, with several meme coins, including Dogecoin, Shibu Inu, and Pepe, up 5.7%, 5.0%, and 15.4%, respectively.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Binance Receives Approval to Operate in India, Joins KuCoin as Second Offshore Crypto Exchange Cleared by FIU



                    

Binance, the global cryptocurrency exchange, has recently received approval from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in India, allowing it to offer services in the country. 



This development positions Binance as the second offshore crypto exchange to receive such regulatory approval, following KuCoin.




In a CoinDesk report, FIU head Vivek Agarwal stated, “Binance is now a registered entity.” 



The approval comes after Binance, along with KuCoin and other major exchanges like Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex, were issued non-compliance notices by Indian authorities in December 2023. 



The Indian Finance Ministry had subsequently directed its IT department to block access to these platforms in mid-January 2024.




These regulatory challenges prompted several exchanges to seek compliance with FIU requirements to continue operating in India.



While KuCoin and Binance successfully navigated the regulatory landscape to reinstate their services, others such as OKX and BitStamp opted to cease operations within the country.

In response to India’s stringent tax laws on cryptocurrency—comprising a 30% tax on gains and a 1% tax deduction at source on each transaction—many Indian investors turned to foreign exchanges like Binance. At its height, Binance handled 90% of crypto trading volume from India. 




The Indian market’s heavy tax burden led to a significant migration of crypto traders and businesses to more favorable regulatory environments abroad. 



Consequently, the remaining crypto exchanges in India faced difficulties in building trust with investors, further hampered by the absence of robust banking solutions.



Despite these challenges, India remains a key market for major cryptocurrency exchanges. 



However, the regulatory uncertainty and stringent tax measures have cooled its appeal on the global crypto stage. 



As of the latest updates, Cointelegraph has reached out to both Binance and FIU for comments but has not received any response yet.

Tether CEO Responds To Brad Garlinghouse’s Comments


								In a recent podcast interview, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that Tether, the largest Stablecoin issuer by market share, is next on the US government’s target list. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, refuted Garlinghouse’s comments and accused him of spreading fear.

Is Tether Next In Line?
Ripple’s CEO joined Quantum’s founder, Chris Vasquez, for his World Class podcast on May 10. During the interview, he discussed his outlook for the future of crypto and his thoughts on the US government’s crackdown on the industry.


Regarding unforeseen circumstances, Garlinghouse believes the crypto market has shown remarkable resilience despite the adversities. The CEO used the downfall of FTX and the immense regulatory scrutiny that Binance has faced over the last couple of years to back his point.
Two years ago, FTX and Binance were two of the most influential companies in the industry. Similarly, their founders and CEOs, Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, were some of the most important players in crypto, as Garlinghouse highlighted.
Since then, SBF has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, while CZ has stepped down as Binance’s CEO and was recently sentenced to a four-month incarceration. To Ripple’s CEO, these events would have been impossible to predict, adding that black swans are “hard to know” as unpredictability is part of the event’s nature.
Despite this, he considers what the community and industry have endured over the years shows a positive side, as the “freaking resilience of this industry and market (…) should give us immense optimism about what’s coming.”
Garlinghouse believes there will be another Black Swan.  He also stated that it would be “an interesting one to watch,” despite not being sure what it could be.
To him, it’s clear that the “US government is going after Tether.” Ultimately, he added that a crackdown on the company could have a big impact due to its “important part of the crypto ecosystem.”
Tether’s CEO Responds
On Monday, Paolo Ardoino took X to respond to the comments. The CEO called Garlinghouse “an uninformed CEO,” and suggested that he was spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) about USDT.
Ardoino seemingly took the comments as an attack from someone “leading a company being investigated by the SEC, launching a competitive stablecoin.”  As a result, he decided to update the community on the safety of Tether’s ecosystem.


The CEO highlighted USDT’s status as “the most used stablecoin in the world, with hundreds of millions of users across primarily emerging markets and developing countries.”  Moreover, he added that most mainstream media reporters refuse to report data regarding Tether’s global compliance work.
Ardoino’s post listed various factors that affect Tether’s compliance. These included Tether’s collaboration with 124 law enforcement agencies across 40+ countries, its respect for the OFAC / SDN lists, and its blockage of over $1.3 billion related to scams, hacks, money laundering, and terrorist financing.
To the CEO, the refusal to share Tether’s statistics sets a “sensationalistic” narrative against the usage of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies worldwide, likely to protect the old guard of the financial establishment.
Garlinghouse responded to the post, clarifying his intentions behind the comments. He explained that he wasn’t attacking the stablecoin issuer. Instead, he pointed out that the US government had “clearly indicated they want more control over USD-backed stablecoin issuers.”
Thus, Tether’s status as the largest player in the sector made it “first in line” for a regulatory crackdown.

Dogecoin Investors Shift to New GambleFi ICO, Chasing Potential 895% Returns / Source: Cryptonews
                        The Dogecoin bulls were in charge on Monday amid a surge in meme coin risk-taking in wake of Roaring Kitty’s return to social media, but investors are nonetheless shifting funds to a new GambleFi ICO called Mega Dice as they hunt for 10x or 895% gains.Dogecoin gained 5% on Monday and was last trading just under $0.15, 10% up from earlier session lows.Legendary GameStop investor Roaring Kitty, who was a key leader of the meme stock movement of 2021, triggered a spike in meme coin and meme stock sentiment when he made his first post on X since 2021.His return triggered a chorus of calls that a new meme coin season might now be here.But the Dogecoin chart gives little reason for that kind of optimism right now.The Dogecoin price remains stuck near its 21DMA and substantially down versus its 50DMA.And the price is arguably also in the process of forming a bearish descending triangle from its late-March highs.A break below $0.12 support would open the door to a quick drop back towards $0.10.With Dogecoin potentially headed back under $0.10 soon, investors are turning to new GambleFi ICO Mega Dice as they hunt upside. Source: TradingViewCan Dogecoin Reach $1?
However, given it remains the undisputed king of meme coins, Dogecoin is a strong bet this bull market.Dogecoin could feasibly 6.5x from current levels to hit $1, fulfilling a long-term prophecy of many of its community members.At $1, Dogecoin’s market cap would be over $140 billion.That’s a lot for a token that doesn’t have much utility beyond as a collector’s item and independent blockchain.Few would expect Dogecoin to 10x or more. Investors looking to turn bigger profits, of 20-50x for example, should check out an often overlooked investment strategy – presale investing.Web3 projects frequently sell their tokens at a big discount to early investors as they raise funds for development.If presale investors can find a good projects that end up gaining decent traction in the market, they can book huge profits.One presale project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is new GambleFi ICO Mega Dice Casino.
Dogecoin Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
Mega Dice is an already well-established crypto casino that recently launched a presale of its utility token, DICE.With over 10,000 active monthly players and over $50 million wagered monthly, Mega Dice’s big user base ensures demand for DICE will be strong.That’s evident in the huge success of the project’s presale, which is closing in on raising $1 million.Investors need to move quickly, as when the $1 million mark is hit, the DICE price will rise from $0.069.At $0.069 per token, DICE is valued at a very modest $29 million market cap. That’s very low considering the amount of real-world adoption Mega Dice’s platform is already garnering.With Mega Dice already a market leader in GambleFi, its coin could one day be worth over billions of dollars. This could easily be a 50-100x coin.In terms of what DICE holders can expect to get – big cashback benefits on their wagers and an impressive passive income via staking.The new GambleFi ICO is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investors. Mega Dice is also running a referral scheme.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presalehttps://twitter.com/megadice/status/1787530056979341365

Historical cycle data suggests Bitcoin has left the ‘danger zone’ - Analyst

Bitcoin (BTC) may have escaped the post-halving “danger zone” — and is now headed for reaccumulation, according to a crypto analyst citing historical data. On May 13, crypto market analyst “Rekt Capital” posted an update to his Bitcoin market cycle chart on X declaring that the “danger zone” when the asset corrects after the halving event is now over. Bitcoin is celebrating with a “good bounce from the re-accumulation range low support,” he added. The periods of pre and post-halving “danger zones” have occurred in previous market cycles when the asset retreats on either side of a halving event.In this cycle, BTC fell 23% from its peak price in mid-March to $56,800 on May 1 marking the potential bottom of the post-halving danger zone period. The analyst added that if $56,000 was not the bottom, “then this current pullback will have officially equaled the longest retrace in this cycle at 63 days.” However, history suggests that this current pullback ended at $56,000 and 47 days, he opined. Source: Rekt CapitalBTC has now recovered to trade back above $63,000 at the time of writing, supporting the return to the re-accumulation zone analysis. However, historical cycle movements aren’t always indicative of future ones, and further pullbacks during the period of sideways chop that often follows the halving could still be on the cards. The analyst, however, was confident that current support levels would hold. “Bitcoin is showing early-stage signs of slowing down in its sell-side momentum, slowly developing a curl against the ~$60,000 support,” This level needs to hold as it has been doing so far for it to eventually lift up again which could result in a move back to $68,000, he added. Related: Bitcoin ‘as strong as ever’ with record high 200-day moving averageMeanwhile, in a May 13 post to X, Global Macro Investor founder Raoul Pal said “Macro Summer and Fall are driven by the global liquidity cycle,” with crypto performing particularly well in what he termed a “banana zone” in the latter half of the year when prices of these high risk assets surge. Source: Raoul PalEarlier this month, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes concurred that a period of sideways trading and accumulation is likely to occur before markets start moving again later this year.He also cited an injection of liquidity from Federal Reserve monetary policy which could make its way into riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Is The Crypto Winter Thawing? US Bitcoin ETFs Record First Inflows In Weeks - Coinshares


																After experiencing outflows for four consecutive weeks, US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have marked a notable shift in momentum, witnessing net inflows once again.
According to recent data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products have seen inflows totaling $130 million for the first time in five weeks.
This change suggests renewed investor interest in crypto-focused investment products, particularly in the United States, where most of these inflows, totaling over $130 million, occurred.

A Mixed Bag Of Global Investment Flows
Grayscale, a major player in the digital asset space, reported a significant decrease in weekly outflows, recording its lowest since January at $171 million. This trend indicates a potential stabilization in the market after a period of volatility and declining interest.
Meanwhile, interaction between US regulators and spot ETF issuers has remained minimal, particularly for spot Ethereum ETF applications.
This lack of engagement has fuelled speculation that approval for these ETFs might not be approaching, as reflected by the amount of outflows from Ethereum-based products. James Butterfill, Head of Research at Coinshares, particularly noted:
Low interaction by the US regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent, this has been reflected in outflows which totalled US$14m last week.
On a global scale, the investment landscape showed mixed signals. After a week of record inflows likely driven by “seed capital” post-Bitcoin ETF launches, as highlighted by Butterfill, Hong Kong saw a significant drop to $19 million in inflows.
Conversely, Switzerland experienced inflows amounting to $14 million. Canada and Germany continued to see outflows, with their year-to-date figures reaching a combined $660 million, indicating sustained bearish sentiment in these markets.
Bitcoin has rebounded with $144 million in inflows, counteracting a generally “weak month.” In contrast, short-Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded outflows totaling $5.1 million, up to $18 million over the last eight weeks.
These figures highlight the volatile dynamics within the crypto market, with Bitcoin currently showing stronger performance than Ethereum.
Bitcoin And Ethereum Market Performance
Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin surged nearly 3%, while Ethereum increased by only 1.2%. Despite these gains, both assets are down by 2.3% and 6% over the past week.

Amidst these market movements, crypto analyst Ali provided insights into Bitcoin’s potential paths. According to Ali, Bitcoin could climb to $76,000 if it reclaims $64,290 as a support level.

                        South Koreans who received airdrop tokens and prizes from the Bithumb crypto exchange from 2018 to 2021 could face unexpected tax bills.Per Hanguk Kyunjae, Bithumb said on May 10 that it would foot the bill for customers who have been ordered to pay taxes on the giveaways.However, the exchange wants to challenge the National Tax Service (NTS)’s decision to retrospectively tax its customers.Bithumb Airdrop Events Hit Hitch?
Bithumb customers have been told to pay a combined total of around $30 million in taxes as a result of winning airdrop prizes and taking part in cashback-type promotions.The NTS thinks that Bithumb gave away almost $61 million worth of assets to South Korean residents in the period 2018-2021.The tax bills have come as a shock to many, particularly as South Korea does not currently tax crypto-related profits.However, the NTS does require the winners of “lotteries and similar events” to declare and pay taxes on their winnings.The NTS classifies these as a form of “other income.” For prizes exceeding around $37, residents must pay 22% of their winnings.Bithumb says that 10,700 of its users were told to pay a total of $15 million in taxes last year alone. This is the first time the NTS has taxed South Korean airdrop recipients.Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko)Free Gifts or Prizes? Exchange to Dispute NTS Decision
Bithumb said that it would “immediately” compensate its customers for anything they had to pay the NTS as a result of receiving its airdrops.However, the exchange announced that it was “filing a tax appeal” against the national tax body.Bithumb argued that “virtual assets and commission cashback distributed via events are a type of free gift or sales benefit.” As such, the exchange said, these are “exempt from taxation.”The media outlet quoted South Korean tax experts as stating that the appeal’s success would hinge on “the nature of the event giveaways.”While the NTS appears to view the tokens as “a prize,” Bithumb insists these are “free gifts.”Legal Process ‘Could Take Years to Resolve’
The exchange may argue, experts noted, that it is following the example of securities providers, who often give out stocks to new account holders.In more conventional cases, shopping outlets that give high-spending customers gift certificates also avoid legal issues. In neither case do recipients pay taxes, experts added.Again, this is because the NTS does not see such handouts as competition “prizes,” but as “free gifts.”The media outlet warned that appeals to the NTS are often time-consuming, concluding that “it may take up to several years for a ruling to emerge.”Bithumb is currently aiming to become the first South Korean crypto exchange to float on the nation’s stock exchange.

Stablecoin Exchange Inflows See Major Drop: Bad For Bitcoin?


								On-chain data shows that stablecoin exchange inflows have seen a sharp drop recently. This could be bearish for the Bitcoin price.
Ethereum-Based Stablecoins Have Seen Low Exchange Deposits Recently
As CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr. pointed out in a post on X, the exchange inflows of Ethereum-based stablecoins have recently dropped below the 90-day average.
The “exchange inflow” here refers to an on-chain indicator that tracks the total amount of any given cryptocurrency being transferred to the wallets associated with centralized exchanges.

When the value of this metric is high, investors are now depositing large amounts of the asset into these platforms. Generally, holders send their coins to the exchanges for trading purposes, so this trend can show high demand for exchanging away the cryptocurrency.
Exchange inflows’ implications for the wider market, though, depend on the type of asset in question. For volatile assets like Bitcoin, inflows may have a direct bearish effect on their prices, as they imply selling is happening.
BTC, in particular, is a major doorway for capital to move in and out of the digital asset sector, so selling it can have cascading effects on the prices of the altcoins.
Selling stablecoins doesn’t affect their prices as they are, by nature, “stable” in value at the $1 mark. Exchange inflows of them are still consequential for the market, however, as they suggest the stable holders are looking to make a swap.
If investors are making the inflows to withdraw into fiat, then the market as a whole would see a bearish effect as it implies a net amount of capital is exiting the sector.
In the scenario that the deposits are being made to purchase Bitcoin and other volatile coins with them, the prices of these assets would register a bullish effect.
The latter may be more likely anytime large stablecoin exchange inflows take place as, generally, investors interested in the sector store their capital in the safety of these fiat-tied tokens, waiting for the right opportunity to buy into the volatile side.
Now, here is a chart that shows what the trend in the exchange inflow has looked like for the Ethereum-based stablecoins as a whole:

The value of the metric appears to have been sharply going down in recent days | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X
As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day moving average (MA) of the stablecoins exchange inflow has recently sharply declined and fallen below the 90-day MA.

This suggests that stablecoin users have significantly less demand for buying into Bitcoin and others now than during the rally that led to BTC’s new all-time high. “The drop in volume below the quarterly figure is a negative signal,” notes the analyst.
BTC Price
Bitcoin has been attempting another recovery push during the past day, and its price has now returned above the $63,000 mark.

Ethereum: What does ETH's future hold as investors continue to leave? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s price fell by nearly 10% in a week.
Technical analysis suggested a possible short-term recovery, with key metrics indicating reduced investor interest.

Ethereum’s [ETH] price has seen a significant downturn, with a nearly 10% drop in the past week and 1% decline in the past day, bringing it to a 24-hour low of $2,868. 
This decline is more pronounced compared to Bitcoin [BTC], which has managed to breach notable price marks despite the current market conditions. 
The downturn in Ethereum’s market performance is attributed to several factors, including massive whale activities that have introduced substantial volatility and selling pressure into the market.
Indicators of declining investor interest in Ethereum
Further compounding Ethereum’s market woes are the declining metrics of network activity. 
According to AMBCrypto’s look at Glassnode’s data, Ethereum’s active addresses have decreased from a peak of 564,868 in late April to 468,548 as of press time. 
Source: Glassnode
This decline in active addresses is paralleled by a drop in the number of new addresses—from 196,629 earlier in the month to below 85,000 on the 11th of May. 
These metrics highlight a waning investor interest in Ethereum during this period.
Source: Glassnode
From a technical analysis perspective, Ethereum has broken significant support structures on the daily chart, indicating bearish pressure. 
The 4-hour chart revealed that, at press time, there was liquidity near the $3,200 region that needed to be taken before any major downward continuation. 
This suggested that Ethereum could experience a short-term rise above the $3,000 mark before potentially dropping to around the $2,800 level, setting the stage for a potential rally thereafter.

Notably, the deposit of Ethereum into the exchange coincides with the reactivation of two Bitcoin wallets that had been dormant for nearly 11 years. 
Each of these wallets, holding 500 BTC, liquidated their entire holdings, which was yet another spot of bad news for investors.

Black Donald Trump Surges 600% Before Consolidating, As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP), a Solana memecoin that was launched yesterday, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Black Donald Trump presents a similar opportunity.



BLATRUMP rallied over 600% in the first few hours after its launch, before consolidating as some early buyers cashed out their profits.



However, most investors are still holding their tokens, as they are waiting for BLATRUMP to be listed on ByBit later this week, as this listing will cause the coin’s price to skyrocket.




Its current price presents a great opportunity for new investors to buy the dip before the next rally. 



BLATRUMP has a market cap below $30,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of around $500,000-$1,000,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-3,000% in a matter of days or hours. 



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally another 12,000% in the coming two days, and Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, BLATRUMP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




To buy Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for BLATRUMP by entering its contract address – 29BiHVTBEo7RnbtwqwTmV3Hy6nDTadcCgopM6HUyjGRK –  in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BLATRUMP.

Polygon (MATIC) Labs Head of DeFi Jumps Ship, Joins Berachain - DailyCoin


        

Last week, Polygon (MATIC) Labs Head of DeFi Jack Melnick disclosed that he was leaving the firm.



Melnick has now disclosed a new role at the Cosmos-based Berachain.



Despite the move, Melnick has asserted that he maintains a positive outlook on Polygon.




Another Polygon (MATIC), Labs executive has jumped ship. 



In recent months, the project has weathered an onslaught of key executive exits to competing projects, from its president in November 2023 to its head of business development in January 2024. Now, the firm’s former head of DeFi, Jack Melnick, has followed suit after announcing that he was leaving last week.



Melnick Announces New Role



In an X post on Monday, May 13, Melnick disclosed that he was starting his first day as head of DeFi at Berachain: a Cosmos-based EVM compatible project that tries to address liquidity concerns that can arise from the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model through a novel consensus model dubbed Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL). 




Explaining the rationale behind his decision, Melnick suggested that the move to Berachain was a long time coming.



“I’ve been in the trenches of the Berachain community for almost three years, and as [Berachain co-founder] @SmokeyTheBera used to say: ‘it’s when, not if’ I came on full time.



Grateful to have found the ulitmate [sic] culture & work fit – getting to do the job I love, with friends I’ve built alongside and respected for years,” he enthused.




Melnick first announced that he was stepping down from his role at Polygon (MATIC) Labs on Thursday, May 9, stating that he remained “excited about the things getting built on Polygon.”

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Struggles with Investor Outflows Despite May Influx



                    

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), experienced a brief resurgence in investment inflows in early May, following a substantial period of financial hemorrhaging since its inception. 



Despite this, the fund quickly reverted to outflows within just a few days, reflecting its ongoing struggles in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.




GBTC debuted on January 11 and suffered consistent outflows for 78 consecutive days, resulting in a total loss of over $17.5 billion. 



A temporary reversal occurred in early May, with inflows recorded on May 3 and May 6, totaling $63 million and $3.9 million respectively. 



This influx of investment briefly suggested a potential stabilization or renewed investor interest in the fund.




However, this trend did not sustain. By May 7 and May 9, GBTC reported outflows of $28.6 million and $43.4 million respectively, effectively negating the gains made in the previous days. 



This pattern of rapid reversal is indicative of the challenges faced by GBTC, marking it as the only spot Bitcoin ETF issuer to report outflows during that period while other funds under the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) saw positive or neutral investment flows.



In contrast, other Bitcoin ETFs have fared significantly better. 



For instance, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust attracted substantial investment, totaling nearly $15.5 billion.

Other notable funds include Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, and Cathie Wood’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, which reported net inflows of $8.1 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.2 billion respectively.



Despite these fluctuations, the average daily loss for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust since its launch stands at a stark $211 million. 



Nonetheless, the overall Bitcoin ETF market in the U.S. has maintained a positive net balance of $11.7 billion due to robust inflows into other funds.



Adding insight into the investor demographics, Jan VanEck, CEO of VanEck, commented during the Paris Blockchain Week in April that “You’ve had some Bitcoin whales and some other institutions move some assets in, but they were already exposed to BITCOIN.” 



He further noted the predominant retail investor contribution, which accounts for 90% of Bitcoin ETF inflows. 



Despite this, there is an anticipation for significant institutional investments from banks and traditional firms as projected around May.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Edge Higher On Spot ETF Holdings Disclosure And 'Roaring Kitty' Frenzy: Analyst Says $66,250 Next Hurdle For Bitcoin Before A New All-Time High - Benzinga

Top cryptocurrencies of the market lifted upward Monday, spurred by top banks' disclosure of investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs, and a social media post by retail trader "Roaring Kitty" that sent meme coins flying.CryptocurrencyGains +/-Price (Recorded 8:30 p.m. EDT)Bitcoin BTC/USD+2.19%$63,021.64Ethereum ETH/USD+0.48%$2,952.36Dogecoin DOGE/USD+4.72%$0.1488What Happened: Bitcoin, the most valuable digital asset on the planet, rose above $63,000 after a subdued weekend.

Investors Bet on Solana as SOL Investment Products Lead Altcoin Inflows, Data Shows | Cryptoglobe


                                
Cryptocurrency investment products saw inflows of $130 million over the past week, with Solana ($SOL) leading institutional investment among the altcoins it’s possible to get exposure to via these products.



According to CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund Flows weekly, investment products offering exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin saw inflows of $144 million, while products offering exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization Ethereum (ETH) saw outflows of $14.4 million as ETH keeps underperforming when compared to BTC itself.



Meanwhile products offering exposure to multiple digital assets saw $3.4 million of outflows, and were followed by those offering exposure to Binance’s BNB, which saw $400,000 of outflows. Products shorting BTC also saw $5.1 million of outflows.



Altcoins saw significant inflows with Solana-focused investment products seeing $5.9 million of inflows, bringing their total year-to-date flows to $17 million. Polkadot (DOT), XRP and Litecoin (LTC) investment products followed suit, with $1.2 million, $600,000 and $100,000 inflows respectively.



CoinShares noted in its report that exchange-traded product trading volumes were of just $8 billion, compared to the $17 billion average seen during April. Per the firm, these volumes show ETP investors are “participating less in the crypto ecosystem at present.”







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The firm added that Ethereum-based investment products likely saw outflows as low interaction by Us regulators with spot ETF issuer applications for Ethereum funds has “increased speculation” that the approval of these ETFs isn’t imminent.



Investors are seemingly more optimistic about Solana, based on a survey of 64 investors with a total of $600 billion in assets under management. It’s worth noting that Solana’s price is up over 470% over the past year as it saw a major surge, but it has lost around 33% of its value over the last 30 days.



As CryptoGlobe reported, a popular cryptocurrency analyst known in the space for accurately predicting the cryptocurrency market bottom during the 2018 bear market, has recently said the price of Solana is “gearing up for a violent breakout.”



Notably, earlier this month Solana whales started buying up memecoins amid a recent cryptocurrency market downturn that has seen the prices of these assets plunge.

Bitcoin dominance tops 50% amidst market volatility: What's next? - AMBCrypto



BTC remained the most dominant asset despite recent declines.
BTC rose above the $61,000 price range.

Bitcoin [BTC] prices have been fluctuating, moving in and out of the red zone, highlighting the lackluster trend it has been experiencing. 
Despite these fluctuations, Bitcoin dominance has managed to stay above 50%, albeit with marginal changes.
 This sustained dominance above the 50% mark has also influenced the overall trend of the cryptocurrency market capitalization.
Bitcoin dominance remains at over 50%
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Bitcoin’s dominance data from CoinMarketCap indicated that towards the end of the previous year, BTC dominance dropped below 50%, signaling a decrease in BTC’s market cap. 
However, at the onset of 2024, the market cap regained the 50% threshold and continued to rise. As of the last recorded data on 11th May, BTC dominance stood at over 53%.
Source: CoinMarketCap
It’s worth noting that CoinMarketCap calculates data weekly. As for the 24-hour data from Crypto Rank on 12th May 12th, BTC dominance had fallen to around 50%. 
However, within the last 24 hours, BTC dominance has increased by approximately 0.4%, bringing it back to over 51% at this time. 
This translates to around 51% of the total crypto market capitalization.
Bitcoin market cap maintains a $1 trillion threshold
Analysis of the crypto market capitalization trend on CoinMarketCap revealed that it stood at around $2.3 trillion at press time. 
Recent data indicated a reduction in market cap over the past few weeks, with a decrease of over 2% in the last 24 hours. Declines in the prices of various crypto assets primarily drive the decrease. 
Also, following a period in 2022 where the market capitalization fell below the $2 trillion mark, it re-entered this range around March and has since remained there, albeit with fluctuations. 
Further examination of the data highlights that out of the total $2.3 trillion market capitalization, Bitcoin accounts for over $1.2 trillion. 
Also, despite market fluctuations, the price of Bitcoin has managed to hover around $60,000. 
This ensured that its market capitalization remained above the $1 trillion mark for an extended period, allowing Bitcoin dominance to remain above 50%.
BTC makes push above $62,000
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin daily timeframe price trend indicated that it has surged above the $62,000 price zone. It was trading at around $62,500 at the time of writing, with an increase of over 1%.
 This marked the first return to this price range in the last three days.

Should this momentum persist, BTC may test its short-term resistance level at around $64,000. 
However, it’s worth noting that it remained in a bear trend according to its Relative Strength Index (RSI) at press time.

Crypto Firm Falcon Labs Settles ‘Unregistered Activities’ Case With CFTC For $1.7M | Bitcoinist.com


								The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has taken action against crypto brokerage firm Falcon Labs, a company based in the Seychelles, for failing to register as a futures commission merchant (FCM) in the US. 
Interestingly, this marks the CFTC’s first enforcement action against an unregistered futures commission merchant involved in providing “unauthorized access” to crypto exchanges.
Falcon Labs Faces CFTC Crypto Crackdown
Under the CFTC order, Falcon Labs is required to immediately cease acting as an unregistered FCM, specifically by facilitating US individuals’ access to digital asset derivatives trading platforms. 
In addition, Falcon Labs was ordered to pay a disgorgement of $1.7 million and a civil penalty of $589,000, the latter in recognition of the company’s cooperation with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, as described in the order.

Ian McGinley, the Director of Enforcement at the CFTC, emphasized the agency’s commitment to maintaining integrity in the derivatives markets and ensuring compliance with registration requirements. He stated: 
The CFTC’s enforcement program has made clear it will not tolerate digital asset exchanges that fail to register with the CFTC or comply with the agency’s rules that maintain integrity in the derivatives markets,” said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. And now the CFTC is taking the fight one step further by, for the first time, charging an intermediary that inappropriately facilitated access to those exchanges. Today’s action highlights that the CFTC will not hesitate to charge any entities—exchanges or intermediaries—who are providing customers access to digital asset products and services that require registration but have failed to appropriately register. 
‘Unregistered Activities’ In Crypto Derivatives Market
The CFTC’s order reveals that from around October 2021 through at least March 27, 2023, Falcon Labs solicited and accepted orders for digital asset derivatives from US-based customers. 
Acting as an intermediary, Falcon Labs facilitated customer trading on various digital asset exchanges, including institutional customers in the United States.
According to the CFTC, Falcon Labs provided direct exchange access by creating a main account in its name and associated sub-accounts. Notably, the sub-account holders’ customer-identifying information was generally not required by the exchanges, nor provided by Falcon Labs.
During the period in question, Falcon Labs collected net fees totaling approximately $1.1M from customers engaging in crypto-derivative transactions facilitated by the company. 

Following the CFTC’s complaint against Changpeng Zhao, Binance Holdings Limited, Binance Holdings (IE) Limited, Binance (Services) Holdings Limited, and Samuel Lim in 2023, Falcon Labs reportedly increased its controls for identifying customer locations.

New daily Runes etched on Bitcoin falls 99% from post-halving peak

The number of new Runes etched on Bitcoin daily has fallen below 250 for the last six days, with 157 Runes etched on Monday marking a 99% fall from its peak in late April. The fall comes after a highly successful streak that came a week after launch, which saw an average of 14,700 new Runes etched each day between April 26-30, including a record 23,061 etched on April 26, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard created by RUNES.IS.New daily Runes etched on Bitcoin since April 20. Source: Dune AnalyticsRunes is a new token standard that launched at the fourth Bitcoin halving block on April 20. The protocol allows memecoin and nonfungible token enthusiasts to inscribe and etch their favorite artwork, images, audio and videos onto the Bitcoin network.It initially provided a much-needed revenue boost for Bitcoin miners looking to mitigate the impact of the recent halving, which saw the block subsidy halve to 3.125 Bitcoin (BTC) — worth $196,800 at current prices.However, the 157 Runes etched on May 13 only contributed $3,835 in transaction fees to Bitcoin miners, far less than the hundreds of thousands of dollars that miners were receiving every day in late April. A total of $4.5 million in transaction fees have been paid to Bitcoin miners since Runes launched on April 20 — coming out at about $189,00 each day.A little over 91,200 Runes have been etched on Bitcoin so far.Runes still make up the bulk of transactionsDespite the fall in the number of Runes etched, Runes transactions continue to make up the majority of transactions in May, which were largely taking place on marketplaces such as Magic Eden, OKX, Ordinals Wallet, and UniSat.Key statistics from the Runes protocol from May 13.

GameStop sparked the 2021 memecoin bull run - will history repeat itself?

The sudden and unexpected return of Keith Gill — the man widely credited with kicking off the 2021 GameStop short squeeze — has speculators asking one question: Are we in for GameStop 2.0?Many are hopeful, but at least one analyst has his doubts.Gill was at the center of the GameStop saga during the pandemic, which saw Reddit traders flip the table on hedge funds that had been making money shorting what they believed to be a failing brick-and-mortar game store — which ended up sending the price of GME soaring over 1,000% in under a month. Some also believe the GameStop short squeeze laid the groundwork for a massive surge in the price of memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) after retail turned its attention elsewhere.Gill went dark on social media on June 19, 2021, but returned after a nearly three-year hiatus on May 13, posting a typically cryptic meme of a gamer sitting up in their chair to announce his comeback. In the 24 hours following Gil’s return to X, shares of GameStop rallied as much as 111%, while DOGE and SHIB gained 6.2% and 5.4% respectively in the same time frame.

Source: TradingViewNow, crypto enthusiasts are pinning their hopes that Gill’s return will spark a similar breed of retail mania.One analyst isn't so bullishHowever, eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert told Cointelegraph that it probably won’t be that easy this time around. “I think it will certainly ignite some short-term moves from these assets, but it's hard to see any longevity,” he said. Additionally, Gilbert noted that the outstanding shorts on assets like GameStop were much smaller compared to 2021 meaning that the “size of the move to the upside” would likely be smaller as well. “The environment is just not comparable to 2021, when interest rates were at rock bottom, governments were providing fiscal stimulus globally, and major economies had little to no inflation.”“We have 5.5% interest rates in the US and there is a global cost of living crisis going on. Simply, consumers are unlikely to be in the same position as they were in 2021 and that has a huge impact on financial decisions,” Gilbert added. Crypto enthusiasts offered a more simple thesis for their bullishness. Pointing to a recent integration between Robinhood and decentralized exchange UniSwap, pseudonymous trader Travis said it was reasonable to expect a new wave of GameStop degens to start buying memecoins and other cryptocurrencies by way of the app.“Just a reminder you can trade memes on Robinhood now. You think the Roaring Kitty army isn't going to buy these things?”However, Gilbert said among many other factors, most investors are now clued into how speculative rallies end up and are more likely to exercise a much higher degree of caution.Source: Trader Travis“I think we’re in a completely different position from where we were in 2021, which makes me think a similar rally would be unlikely,” he said. “That said, the 14.5 million users on WallStreetBets have shown in the last few years that anything is possible.”Several GameStop-related memecoins including a coin named GameStop (GME) — which bears no official affiliation with the company — spiked massively amid the unfolding drama. The GME memecoin soared more than 3,650% in a single day, per Birdeye data. A GameStop-themed meme oin spiked massively on the news.

                        The UK government’s Insolvency Service has shut down a London-based crypto advisory firm that claimed to offer investment advice in cryptocurrencies.In a London High Court ruling on April 30, Amey Finance Academy Ltd was ordered to close. The company’s sole owner and leader, Desmond Amey (42), who presented himself as a wealth creation specialist, had previously assured customers that their cryptocurrency investments were safe.Despite Amey’s assurances, customers allegedly lost money in their investments, according to a statement on Monday. This lack of positive returns raised red flags. And in July 2022, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stepped in.The financial watchdog identified Amey Finance Academy as an unauthorized provider of financial services or products in the UK, warning against dealing with it.The firm’s founder Amey didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.Crypto Advisory Firm Allegedly Made False Promises and Investor Losses
Established in Dec. 2018, Amey Finance Academy advertised itself on social media as “an established and successful independent consultancy providing a plethora of financial services.” The company also claimed to operate a leading education academy within the industry, the Insolvency Service said.However, Amey made false assurances, guaranteeing one customer who later lost all their invested funds that their investment would not fall below 90%.In WhatsApp messages investigators reviewed, Amey assured another customer that the investments were “100 certy” and urged them to “trust me bro.” Additionally, Amey Finance Academy promoted crypto schemes conducted by other firms such as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7b from investors globally.Chief Investigator Exposes Founder’s Deceptive Crypto Schemes
Further, Amey posted a video on YouTube in Oct. 2023, suggesting that the office still maintained a presence at 1 Canada Square in Canary Wharf, London. However, he had actually been evicted earlier that year in January due to rent non-payment.“Desmond Amey used Amey Finance Academy to recklessly persuade individuals to invest in cryptocurrency schemes and mislead them about the risks of doing so,” said Mark George, the Insolvency Service’s chief investigator.He also mentioned that the service couldn’t determine the company’s full activities, assets, liabilities. Nor could it ascertain the handling of £5m ($6.2m) from Oct. 2019 to March 2022 due to insufficient accounting records and lack of transparency.“The public deserve protection from companies trading in an opaque and objectionable manner which is why we applied to have Amey Finance Academy shut down,” George said.Earlier this year, the UK’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) took down 43 websites suspected of crypto phishing scams. The NFIB’s investigation uncovered a fake email address designed to trick Blockchain.com customers. This spoofed address aimed to exploit security weaknesses and steal cryptocurrency.

Falcon Labs Settles with CFTC in Case Over Unregistered Status

                        The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has reached a settlement with Falcon Labs, Ltd., a Seychelles-based entity, for operating as an unregistered futures commission merchant (FCM) and facilitating access to digital asset exchanges without proper registration.CFTC Settlement Terms and Fines Against FalconUnder the settlement terms, Falcon Labs must cease acting as an unregistered FCM, particularly in providing US individuals access to digital asset derivatives trading platforms. Additionally, Falcon Labs has been ordered to pay $1,179,008 in disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty of $589,504.The reduced penalty reflects Falcon Labs’ extensive cooperation with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement throughout the investigative process.Ian McGinley, the CFTC’s Director of Enforcement, emphasized the agency’s unwavering commitment to upholding integrity in derivatives markets, particularly in the digital asset space. He said,“The CFTC’s enforcement program has made clear it will not tolerate digital asset exchanges that fail to register with the CFTC or comply with the agency’s rules that maintain integrity in the derivatives markets.”McGinley highlighted the CFTC’s determination to hold accountable any entities, whether exchanges or intermediaries, that provide access to digital asset products and services without appropriate registration.As an intermediary, Falcon Labs facilitated customer trading on various digital asset exchanges, including institutional customers within the US. The company provided direct access to exchanges by creating main accounts in its name and establishing associated sub-accounts, often without requiring or providing customer-identifying information.Throughout this period, Falcon Labs amassed net fees totaling approximately $1,179,008 from customers engaging in digital asset derivative transactions intermediated by the company.Notably, Falcon Labs took voluntary steps to enhance its customer identification controls following the CFTC’s complaint against entities associated with Binance, which shed light on similar practices involving sub-accounts for U.S.-located customers trading digital asset derivatives.CFTC is Mostly Having Its Way
In last year’s precedent-setting decision, a US district judge ruled in favour of the US CFTC in its litigation against Ooki DAO, ordering the organization to pay a civil penalty of $643,542 and cease operations in the US. The court’s ruling establishes that DAOs can be held liable for violating the law, challenging the notion that their decentralized structure insulates them from legal consequences.The background of DAOs reveals them as organizations operating based on blockchain rules and smart contracts, enabling decentralized decision-making without a central authority. The case of Ooki DAO last year has echoed broader regulatory trends, as evidenced by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s subpoena of Sushi DAO, another decentralized organization behind a crypto exchange.With this recent landmark settlement, the CFTC seeks to encourage other digital asset intermediaries operating unlawfully to come forward and report their activities as required. Director Ian McGinley said,“In recognizing Falcon Labs’ substantial cooperation and remediation in this order in the form of a lower penalty, the CFTC hopes to encourage other digital asset intermediaries operating illegally to come forward and report their activities to the agency.”

Following this launch, the Open League has sparked improved user engagement with the TON blockchain. For context, the league has triggered a 264% increase in TON’s monthly active users (MSUs) to 1.5 million users. According to data from Coinmarketcap, TON trades at $7.05 during press time, representing a 4.15% intraday increase.

Mark Cuban Says SEC Didn't Learn A Thing After Mt. Gox, Applauds Japan's Response: 'They Are Still So Stupid' - Benzinga

Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor and television personality, criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its inaction following the Mt. Gox debacle. Cuban also lauded Japan’s regulatory response to the incident.What Happened: Cuban took to social media platform X, to express his views on the SEC’s handling of the Mt. Gox situation. He contrasted this with Japan’s approach, which he commended for protecting its stakeholders.“The SEC didn't learn sh*t. Not a damn thing when MT Gox happened. They are still so stupid they think the mere process of registration protects investors. The only actions they take are after the fact. See Madoff. See FTX. See Chinese Stocks,” Cuban wrote.See Also: If You Bought Your Mom $100 In Bitcoin, Dogecoin And Ethereum Last Mother’s Day, Here’s How Much She’d Have TodayHe also criticized the SEC’s approach to innovation, stating that it is “completely the opposite of our technology history in the USA.” He further questioned the SEC’s ability to protect investors from scams, suggesting that the regulatory body is “really really bad” at it.Cuban responded to a post by Mike Kelly, which questioned the potential of 65 tokens in Japan to be breakthrough applications. Cuban pointed out that even the “scammiest of the scammiest tokens” haven’t caused as much loss as other investments.Why It Matters: Cuban’s criticism of the SEC’s regulatory approach comes amid a broader debate on the regulation of cryptocurrencies. In a recent exchange with James Love, Director of an NGO Knowledge Ecology International, Cuban highlighted the various benefits of digital assets, including minimal transaction fees, easily accessible credit, and insulation against theft.Meanwhile, the Mt. Gox incident has been a long-standing issue in the cryptocurrency space. The exchange, once the world’s leading Bitcoin BTC/USD exchange, suffered a devastating hack in 2011 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2014. However, there is now a glimmer of hope for creditors, with some reportedly receiving updates on their claims.At the same time, the SEC’s regulatory approach has been a source of frustration for many in the crypto space. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev recently expressed his disappointment with the SEC’s response to the company’s efforts to engage with the regulatory body.Read Next: Bitcoin Clinging On To $60K, Ethereum, Dogecoin Bleed: ‘Bitcoin’s Final Move Will Be The Most Aggressive,’ Predicts TraderImage Via Shutterstock Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh BagalkoteThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

Joe Biden Blocks Chinese-Owned Crypto Mining Firm - MineOne


On May 13, The President of the United States, Joe Biden, issued a directive prohibiting MineOne from acquiring real estate near a strategic missile base. The US government found that MineOne, mainly owned by Chinese nationals, aimed to use the property for crypto mining.
This decision stems from national security concerns due to the site’s proximity to Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. The base hosts Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles.
National Security Concerns Prompt Presidential Action
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) saw risks in the foreign-owned, specialized equipment at the site.

“The proximity of the foreign-owned Real Estate to a strategic missile base and key element of America’s nuclear triad, and the presence of specialized and foreign-sourced equipment potentially capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities, presents a national security risk to the United States,” the President’s order reads.

As a result of these findings, the transaction has been prohibited. MineOne and its affiliates must sell or transfer all ownership interests in the property within 120 days. Additionally, they must remove all equipment and improvements from the site within 90 days and certify the completion of these actions.

MineOne and its affiliates are restricted from accessing the property throughout this period and must ensure compliance with the order. They must also provide weekly updates to CFIUS until all conditions are met.
The Department of Treasury issued an official statement following the President’s order. In the statement, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen emphasized that this order shows President Biden’s commitment to protecting national security.

“It also highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security, particularly as it relates to transactions that present risk to sensitive US military installations as well as those involving specialized equipment and technologies,” Secretary Yellen added.

Furthermore, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Investment Security Paul Rosen reiterated that CFIUS expects complete, accurate, and timely information from involved parties. He also stressed that failure to address national security risks would prompt decisive actions, including Presidential interventions.
This order follows the Department of the Treasury’s proposed 30% tax on electricity consumption by crypto mining firms as part of the Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue Proposals. This proposal aims to mitigate the environmental impact of the crypto mining industry’s rising energy demand.
Under this scheme, crypto mining firms must report the quantity and cost of electricity consumed, including off-grid power production. The tax will be introduced gradually, starting at 10% and reaching 30% by the third year, effective January 1, 2025.
Biden’s Crypto Policies Stir Controversy and Industry Reaction

The Biden administration’s tougher stance towards the crypto industry is further evidenced by its position on H.J. Res 109, a resolution to nullify the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. This bulletin requires financial institutions to include customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets, which the crypto community sees as burdensome.
The White House has clarified that rejecting this rule would weaken the SEC’s investor and financial system protections. President Biden is ready to veto the resolution.
In response to the current regulatory environment, industry players are rallying to support pro-crypto political candidates. Coinbase has created a new political action committee (PAC) named “Stand With Crypto” to support crypto-friendly candidates financially.
Coinbase’s PAC has garnered support from various parties, including Moonpay, a fintech platform that supports crypto transactions. Moonpay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright emphasized the importance of advancing crypto innovation.


“This year’s election will define the future of our industry in the United States, and it is our responsibility to step up and stand alongside those organizations that want to positively advance crypto innovation for everyone,” Soto-Wright stated.

Also, prominent crypto community figures, such as Mark Cuban and Hayden Adams, have warned that Biden’s current stance could impact the upcoming elections. The warning aligns with a recent report from the Blockchain Association. The report indicates that one in five US voters considers crypto a key issue, with many distrusting candidates who interfere with crypto.

Crypto exchange OKX launches local regulated entity in Australia

Crypto exchange OKX is moving its Australian-focused services under a locally regulated entity as part of its expansion efforts through the Asia-Pacific region.Oscar Piastri of McLaren Racing — one of OKX's main sponsors —officially announced the news at a media event in Sydney on May 14.“Australian crypto users deserve a platform that is secure, easy-to-use and response to their needs, which include seamless access to banking rails as well as AUD pairs for the most popular cryptocurrencies,” OKX Australia general manager Jamie Kennedy said in a statement shared with Cointelegraph.170 crypto trading pairs will be available to Australian users, OKX noted.Options trading would also be available in addition to spot trading, Kennedy noted.Source: OKXOKX president Hong Fang says Australia offers a “dynamic customer base” for the firm, including both sophisticated traders and others that are interested in crypto but haven't taken the first step yet.OKX told Cointelegraph it was opening an Australian office in March last year, explaining there was a “huge appetite” for crypto and it saw the country as “a key growth market.”The exchange’s Australian-focused services since March 20 moved from a Seychelles-based firm to the on-shore entities OKX Australia Pty Ltd which handles the crypto exchange and fiat services side, and OKX Australia Financial Pty Ltd which handles its derivatives and margin products.However, Australian laws dictate that local users must pass a suitability assessment and meet the definition of a wholesale client — a legal requirement under the Corporations Act 2001.Despite the regulatory hurdles, Fang praised Australian regulators for engaging with them in an open and transparent manner.Related: Australia’s top exchange may approve spot Bitcoin ETFs this year: ReportOKX has also had to stop offering its copy trading, yield-bearing products and trading of some tokens to comply with local laws. Unsupported tokens have been withdrawal-only since March 20.The exchange is the third-largest in the world by volume behind Bybit, seeing $2.8 billion in volume over the past day, according to CoinGecko.Magazine: Crypto City guide to Sydney — More than just a ‘token’ bridge
