								<p>The scalability debate within the Solana ecosystem has reached a fever pitch, fueled by pointed discussions on X (formerly Twitter) among leading figures in the blockchain space. At the heart of the debate is the question of whether Solana, a blockchain celebrated for its high throughput and low transaction costs, can maintain its performance and economic viability without resorting to Layer-2 (L2) solutions or <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tezos-activates-mumbai-introduces-smart-rollups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">rollups</a>.</p>
<h2>Does Solana Need L2?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/vibhu/status/1770223481910874148" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">conversation</a> was kick-started by Vibhu Norby, the founder of the Solana-based project DRiP, who raised concerns over the escalating costs and technical challenges faced by applications operating on the SOL blockchain. Norby’s initial statement set the stage:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Controversial take that honestly really shouldn’t be. But want to put on the table a topic that has been happening in many private conversations. Solana is going to have and needs to have L2s and/or rollups.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>He detailed the substantial on-chain fees DRiP encountered, amounting to “$10,000 in on-chain fees last week,” underscoring the misalignment of incentives as app success paradoxically increases infrastructure costs. He remarked, “The very apps that bring traffic and customers to the chain are rewarded with increased infra cost when the token appreciates in value,” suggesting a misalignment between the ecosystem’s growth and its economic incentives.</p>

<p>This, according to Norby, necessitates a discussion on the scalability and economic model, suggesting that “I think many app builders will be happy to make calculated decentralization tradeoffs to have favorable economics and TPS.”</p>
<p>The response from the developer community was swift. BASED CHARKER, Global Developer Growth at the Solana Foundation, countered Norby’s perspective by highlighting the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jump-crypto-solana-validator-client-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">potential of Firedancer</a>, a project aimed at significantly enhancing scalability.</p>
<p>Charker stated, “If Firedancer achieves what it set out to do and current issues are resolved (they will be) you’re not going to need a L2 in the next 2-3 years.” He acknowledged the frustrations of developers like Norby but remained optimistic about <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-solana-visa-reveals-reasons-for-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Solana’s roadmap</a> and its capacity to scale effectively without Layer-2 solutions.</p>

<p>Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs, chimed in with a technical standpoint focusing on the hardware aspect: “Hardware won’t get conservative, though. Solana code base will get conservative when the only thing that validators need to do is add more cores.” This perspective suggests an enduring solution to scalability lies in leveraging hardware advancements, reinforcing the belief in the foundational technology to meet future demands.</p>
<p>The discourse also touched on the nature of blockchain evolution and market forces. Jordan Prince, co-founder of Solana-based B+J Studios, posited a market-driven outcome: “The free market always wins one way or the other! Either the base layer becomes fast enough and cheap enough quickly enough to avoid some tacked on L2, or it doesn’t and someone builds one first to solve the problem.”</p>
<h3>Vision For A Scalable Future</h3>
<p>Beyond identifying challenges, Norby also articulated a forward-looking vision for Solana, envisioning it as the foundation for a new internet. “I think I am way more bullish on Solana than anyone in the world. I foresee millions of apps built on this new internet called Solana. I think we are going to recreate all of our core internet apps including social, email, commerce, financial, etc.,” he stated.</p>
<p>This ambitious vision underscores Norby’s belief in Solana’s potential to host a vast and vibrant digital economy, far surpassing current applications and possibly challenging traditional internet infrastructure. However, he acknowledges the future need for “a plethora of scaling solutions, call them L2s or something else entirely,” in order to create “a thriving economy 1 million times bigger than the NASDAQ.”</p>

<div><div class="post-content relative" data-v-25cc9d4a><p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) nosedived below the $61,000 level on March 19, signaling an urgency by select traders to exit their positions. According to data from investment firm Farside, the recent fall has led to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-price-dip-17-5-week-bitcoin-etf-net-outflows-near-500m">roughly $480 million in outflows</a> from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the past two days.</p><p>If the Bitcoin ETF investments fail to pick up, another round of selling cannot be ruled out, but a fall does not mean the bull market is over. Capriole Fund founder Charles Edwards said in a X post that it’s “normal” for volatility to pick up one month “either side of the Bitcoin Halving.” However, he added that the 12-month period following the halving <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-halving-price-narrative-strengthens-crypto-market-falls">historically offers the best risk-reward</a> tradeoff for Bitcoin.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/1f56233a-14a9-4c45-a23c-29a42215b2c0.png"><figcaption><em>Crypto market data daily view. Source:</em><em> </em><a href="https://coin360.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>Coin360</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>While retail traders speculate on the next move in Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, one of the largest public holders of Bitcoin, continues to buy more. MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said in a X post that the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-sells-604m-notes-buy-btc">firm bought 9,245 Bitcoin</a> “using proceeds from convertible notes &amp; excess cash.” The latest purchase boosted the firm’s stockpile to 214,246 Bitcoin, more than 1% of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist.</p><p>Will Bitcoin and altcoins continue their correction, or is it time for the recovery to begin? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>Bitcoin turned down from the support line of the ascending channel on March 18, indicating that the bears are trying to flip the level into resistance. That intensified selling and pulled the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($65,271) on March 19.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/07198746-c66a-4fde-b963-3220f3fc1aa3.png"><figcaption><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls are trying to arrest the decline at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $61,736. A bounce off the current level is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest strong selling on rallies. The BTC/USDT pair could slide to the 50-day SMA ($56,614), where the bulls are expected to buy aggressively.</p><p>The first sign of strength will be a rise above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, it will suggest that the corrective phase may be over. The pair may rise to $69,000. This is the final hurdle before the pair challenges the all-time high at $73,777.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>The failure to maintain Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH</a>) above the 20-day EMA ($3,550) on March 18 attracted aggressive selling by the traders. That pulled the price to the 50-day SMA ($3,113) on March 20.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/af3e415e-d2e8-4445-83de-6289c60f245f.png"><figcaption><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AETHUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The 20-day EMA has started to turn down, and the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting that bears have the upper hand. The recovery is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA. That could keep the ETH/USDT pair stuck between both moving averages for some time.</p><p>A break below the 50-day SMA will suggest that the bulls are dumping their positions in a hurry. That could sink the pair to $2,717. Alternatively, a break and close above the 20-day EMA will signal that the bulls are back in the game.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB’s (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index">BNB</a>) pullback reached the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $500 on March 19, just below the 20-day EMA ($511).</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/92caa0fc-3b66-4c4f-b401-7c7f6fe0dea3.png"><figcaption><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls are trying to stop the fall at the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. The BNB/USDT pair could rally to $590, where the bulls and the bears are likely to witness a tough battle.</p><p>If the price turns down from $590, it will suggest that the bears are active at higher levels. That increases the risk of a slide to the breakout level of $460. </p><p>On the contrary, if buyers kick the price above $590, it will suggest that the pullback may be over. The pair may then climb to $645.</p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>The bulls pushed Solana (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index">SOL</a>) above the $205 resistance on March 18 but could not sustain the breakout. That may have tempted short-term traders to book profits. </p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/a05bf7eb-9109-4a48-a341-67363a992c6c.png"><figcaption><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASOLUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The SOL/USDT pair dipped to the 20-day EMA ($158) on March 20, a crucial support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive. The bulls will again try to drive the price above the overhead resistance at $205.</p><p>On the other hand, a shallow bounce will suggest a lack of aggressive buying at the current levels. If the price slips below the 20-day EMA, the selling could accelerate, and the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($126).</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>) has been trading inside a large range between $0.46 and $0.74 for several months. Trading inside a range can be volatile and random.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/bc9c5954-fadb-452f-a052-ae5a446f6509.png"><figcaption><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AXRPUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The XRP/USDT pair is trying to take support at the uptrend line, but the relief rally is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the uptrend line, the pair could slump to the support of the range at $0.46.</p><p>On the contrary, if buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are trying to make a comeback. The bullish momentum could pick up if the pair rises above $0.67. The pair may subsequently climb to the formidable resistance at $0.74.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis</h2><p>Cardano (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index">ADA</a>) turned lower from the 20-day EMA ($0.68) on March 18 and plunged below the 50-day SMA ($0.62) on March 19.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/dc957621-333e-4860-a213-f559490c3901.png"><figcaption><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AADAUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The ADA/USDT pair is attempting to take support at $0.57, but the recovery attempt is likely to face selling at the moving averages. If the price turns down from the moving averages, it will increase the possibility of a break below $0.57. The pair may then skid to $0.53.</p><p>If buyers shove the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair may reach the 20-day EMA. This remains the critical overhead resistance to watch out for. A break above this level will suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. </p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>The bears sold Dogecoin’s (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index">DOGE</a>) recovery attempts on March 17 and pulled the price back below the 20-day EMA ($0.15) on March 18.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/aff32af5-72b9-417d-8b0c-b42d530a2e0d.png"><figcaption><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ADOGEUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The selling continued on March 19, and the DOGE/USDT pair plunged to the strong support at $0.12 on March 20. Buyers are expected to guard the 50-day SMA ($0.11), but they may find it difficult to propel the price above $0.16.</p><p>The 20-day EMA has started to turn down, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting that bears have a slight edge. The bulls will be back in command on a break above $0.16. That could clear the path for a rally to $0.19.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-low-can-the-bitcoin-price-go"><strong><em>How low can the Bitcoin price go?</em></strong></a></p><h2>Avalanche price analysis</h2><p>The long wick on Avalanche’s (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/avalanche-price-index">AVAX</a>) March 18 candlestick shows profit booking at higher levels. The selling picked up, and the price reached the breakout level of $50 on March 20.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/83060ce3-1802-4d24-85b8-625fd199af45.png"><figcaption><em>AVAX/USDT daily chart.

If they succeed, the AVAX/USDT pair could again rise toward $65. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair may consolidate between $50 and $65 for a while.</p><p>A break and close below $50 suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That may sink the pair to the next solid support at the 50-day SMA ($42). The bulls will have to catapult the price above $65 to signal the resumption of the uptrend.</p><h2>Shiba Inu price analysis</h2><p>Shiba Inu (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/shiba-inu-price-index">SHIB</a>) slipped below the $0.000029 support on March 16, and the bears successfully defended the retest on March 17. This suggests that the bears are trying to flip $0.000029 into resistance.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/8bf15650-0c50-45f9-9795-d69212051884.png"><figcaption><em>SHIB/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AshibUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The SHIB/USDT pair fell to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000023 on March 20, which is the last bastion of support. If this level cracks, the pair may nosedive to the 50-day SMA ($0.000017). The deeper the fall, the greater the time it will take for the new up-move to begin.</p><p>The bulls will have to drive and sustain the price above the resistance line to indicate that the correction may be over. The pair could then travel to the overhead resistance of $0.000035 and eventually $0.000039.</p><h2>Toncoin price analysis</h2><p>Toncoin (TON) pulled back to the 20-day EMA ($3.39), but the bulls aggressively purchased the dip, as seen from the strong bounce on March 17.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/53d2f1df-4779-408d-b06e-8e69fad9876e.png"><figcaption><em>TON/USDT daily chart. Source: </em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=OKX%3AtonUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>The bears sold the rallies and tried to sink the price below the 20-day EMA on March 18 and 19, but the bulls held their ground. Buyers are trying to sustain the price above $4.15. If they manage to do that, the TON/USDT pair could rise to $4.60. A break and close above this level will suggest the start of the next leg of the uptrend to $5.64.</p><p>The crucial support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA. The bears will have to sink the price below the 20-day EMA to indicate that a local top may be in place. </p><template data-name="subscription_form" data-type="markets_outlook"></template><p class="post-content__disclaimer">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

								<p><span>Amidst growing concerns of illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies, reports have emerged linking North Korean hackers associated with the notorious Lazarus Group to an exploit of Ethereum (ETH) through the virtual currency mixer <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Tornado Cash</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>It is alleged that the hackers are now involved in a transfer to BlackRock, the largest asset management firm, as claimed by a user of social media platform X (formerly Twitter).</span></p>
<h2><span>Alleged Transaction Links North Korean Hackers To BlackRock</span></h2>
<p><span>The user, operating under the pseudonym “Icebergy,” </span><a href="https://x.com/icebergy_/status/1770477188527071348?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span>shared </span></a><span>an image suggesting a transaction tied to North Korean hackers transferring 1 ETH, valued at $3,270, to BlackRock for undisclosed reasons. </span></p>
<p><span>If true, this development may pose challenges for the asset manager. Tornado Cash and the Lazarus Group have faced increased scrutiny from US regulators due to potential illicit activities facilitated by the mixer and alleged violations of anti-money laundering (AML) </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hackers-exploit-sanctioned-mixer-tornado-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><span>regulations </span></a><span>within the US jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p><span>As </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-legal-war-against-us-sanctions-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><span>reported </span></a><span>by Bitcoinist, in 2022, Tornado Cash faced legal action from the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The agency targeted the software due to its alleged role in allowing cybercriminal activity. </span></p>
<p><span>The US agency claims that bad actors used Tornado Cash to launder over $7 billion worth of crypto assets since its launch in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span>Consequently, OFAC sanctioned the mixer’s wallets and other smart contracts associated with its operations. The sanctions also contain allegations of “facilitating” </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-co-founde-to-us-sanctions-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><span>money laundering</span></a><span> for hackers supporting foreign terrorists, as a significant number of hacking incidents involving crypto asset theft have been linked to terrorist groups. </span></p>
<p><span>Notably, in February 2023, Chainalysis reported that North Korean hacking groups had stolen up to $2 billion in crypto assets in 2022, frequently utilizing Tornado Cash to obfuscate their </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-case-could-mean-for-code-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener "><span>transactions</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, it has been revealed that North Korean hackers, believed to be part of the Lazarus Group, exploited the coin-mixing service Tornado Cash to launder approximately $12 million worth of stolen Ethereum on March 14.</span></p>
<h2><span>Tornado Cash Returns To Focus</span></h2>
<p><span>As blockchain analytics firm Elliptic <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-laundering-north-korean-tornado-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">reported</a>, in response to the sanctions imposed on Tornado Cash, the Lazarus Group briefly shifted its focus to using cross-chain bridges and the Bitcoin-based mixer Sinbad.io as an alternative. </span></p>
<p><span>However, US authorities seized Sinbad.io in November 2023, eliminating another option for commingling funds. Consequently, the group appears to have returned to utilizing Tornado Cash.</span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately, the motive behind the alleged transfer of ETH tied to North Korean hackers remains undisclosed, and the relatively small amount involved raises questions about its specific objective. </span></p>

<p><span>At the time of writing, BlackRock has not responded to the matter, and no further information has been released. It is important to note that BlackRock has consistently operated within the US regulatory frameworks and complied with federal laws, which led the asset manager to receive approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its newly approved Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) under the ticker IBIT. </span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, the presence of BlackRock’s on-chain addresses in the public blockchain does not necessarily indicate a collaborative effort but rather a unilateral move by the alleged North Korean side, perhaps to generate controversy surrounding the asset manager’s reputation.</span></p>

								<p>A federal judge in Utah has sanctioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after the regulator copped to making an inaccurate statement in a crypto fraud case.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/1u6cDaFa3REg8wHUc6onZ8/e1257f64a80ca440d887f67821f872fe/Debt_Box_Order.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">order</a> filed on Monday, US District Court Judge Robert Shelby accused the SEC of “bad faith conduct in obtaining, maintaining, and defending” a temporary restraining order (TRO) against Digital Licensing Inc., a Utah-based company that was doing business under the name “DEBT Box.”</p>
<p></p><p class="code-block code-block-055f5289fd7e731bb72be7c5a19d18ed code-block-1">


<ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2032509223483502" data-ad-slot="8690903223" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>




</p>
<p>Last July, the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-146" rel="noopener" target="_blank">obtained</a> a temporary asset freeze, restraining order, and other emergency relief against DEBT Box after alleging the firm and its founders operated a fraudulent scheme that involved selling fake “node licenses” to investors that the company said would generate crypto assets via mining.</p>
<p>The company allegedly raised around $50 million and unspecified amounts of Bitcoin (<a href="https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/ethereum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ETH</a>).</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-055f5289fd7e731bb72be7c5a19d18ed code-block-1">
<p>The SEC obtained the TRO and asset freeze in part by arguing that DEBT Box and its founders were funneling investor funds into luxury purchases and accounts overseas.</p>
<p>The defendants, however, filed a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order granted by the court, claiming the SEC misrepresented facts in its allegations.</p>
<p>The restraining order was dissolved at a hearing in October, and in November, the case’s judge <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.141167/gov.uscourts.utd.141167.215.0.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">requested an explanation</a> from the SEC about the alleged misrepresentations.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.141167/gov.uscourts.utd.141167.233.0.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">response</a> filed in December, the SEC acknowledged that one of its lawyers “made a representation” that was inaccurate in the initial July restraining order hearing.</p>
<p>Michael Welsh, the SEC’s lead trial counsel, claimed during the hearing that the defendants had closed around 33 bank accounts in the 48 hours leading up to the court date.</p>
<p>The regulator admitted that Welsh’s number was derived from a miscommunication. In reality, the SEC explains, only 24 bank accounts were closed, and none were shuttered the month of the hearing.</p>
<p>The SEC did note, however, that the balances of several bank accounts owned by certain defendants were substantially decreased in July, but not closed. The regulator also acknowledged multiple instances where it erroneously presented interpretations and inferences as facts.</p>
<p>In his recent order, Judge Shelby called the SEC’s conduct a “gross abuse of power” that “substantially undermined the integrity of these proceedings and the judicial process.”</p>
<p><em>“In these circumstances, the court exercises its inherent authority to sanction the Commission’s bad faith conduct. Accordingly, the court imposes a sanction of attorneys’ fees and costs for all expenses arising from the TRO and appointment of the Receiver — to include payment of all the Receiver’s costs and fees.”</em></p>

<p>Financial services firm Bernstein raised its year-end price target for the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) to $90,000 from $80,000, citing a confluence of bullish factors.</p>



<p>According to a recent report by analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra. a new Bitcoin bull cycle is underway, fueled by strong inflows into the newly launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), aggressive expansion of mining capacity, and record-breaking miner revenue.</p>



<p>The analysts noted that Bitcoin miners remain “compelling buys for equity investors seeking exposure to the crypto cycle,” as CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/03/21/bitcoin-year-end-price-target-raised-to-90k-at-bernstein/">reports</a>, and revised their estimates for cryptocurrency mining stocks.</p>



<p>They noted that they foresee a 7% hashrate reduction after Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event, versus a 15% reduction they were previously eyeing. Hashrate refers to the computational power securing the Bitcoin network as miners compete to find new blocks.</p>



<p>The coinbase reward given to miners for each found block is set to drop in half next month, from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC in an event known as the halving. The halving is part of Bitcoin’s monetary supply and occurs every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years.</p>







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

<p>The hashrate typically dips after a halving as some miners become unprofitable over the reward reduction. Bernstein’s revised forecast, however,suggests the halving’s hashrate decline won’t be as dramatic as it has historically been.</p>



<p>As CryptoGlobe reported, over the long-term Bernstein has revealed its anticipating a <a href="https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/03/bernstein-eyes-on-monster-crypto-cycle-that-could-take-btc-to-150000-and-eth-to-150000-amid-unprecedented-institutional-adoption/">“monster” cryptocurrency market cycle</a>, forecasting the total market capitalization to skyrocket to $7.5 trillion by 2025, nearly triple its current value of $2.53 trillion. This surge, the report argues, would translate into significant growth for Robinhood’s cryptocurrency revenue, potentially increasing by a factor of nine.</p>



<p>Bernstein’s bullish outlook includes projections for individual cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin’s market cap being expected to reach $3 trillion by 2025, up from its current $1.31 trillion market capitalization, which could mean BTC’s price would double by next year to over $150,000.</p>



<p>Ethereum ($ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was forecasted to hit $1.8 trillion, up from its current level of $422.4 billion, which would see Ethereum’s price top the coveted $10,000 mark to trade around $15,000, up from its current $4,000 level.</p>



<p>The report also projects a combined market cap of $1.4 trillion for other leading blockchain tokens, with analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra writing they believe “the crypto market is experiencing unprecedented levels of institutional adoption.”</p>

On Jan. 1, the price of Bitcoin was $42,208. On March 14, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $73,737. That high is something BTC has not been able to sustain on the 30-day countdown clock.</p><figure data-ct-non-breakable="true"><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/6f55ac64-d142-4f54-b389-b53f329162c2.jpeg"><figcaption><em>One-week Bitcoin price chart. Source: Cointelegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">Samson Mow, who has been predicting serious upward price momentum for some time, is confident Bitcoin will soon go on to surpass its all-time high. The CEO of Jan3 — a technology company focused on expanding Bitcoin access worldwide — told Cointelegraph he predicts the price will still soar before the halving.</p><p>Bitcoin is “likely to reach $100,000 before the halving,” said Mow. “There’s just not enough coins to meet the voracious demand from the [exchange-traded funds] ETFs, which devour around 7,000 coins a day.”</p><h2 data-ct-non-breakable="true">Further Bitcoin price dip?</h2><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">Mow may predict a significant price rise over the next 30 days, but others say the dip may go deeper. One scenario does not preclude the other. However, it is possible that both a greater dip and a greater high could occur.</p><p>On X, Ran Neuner told his followers a 20–30% dip “would be completely normal and healthy” during a bull market.</p>


<p data-ct-non-breakable="true">Similarly, Danny Chong, co-founder of decentralized asset tracker Tranchess, told Cointelegraph the direction of travel could be downward.</p><p>“After the Bitcoin halving, instead of a continued upward trajectory, we may experience a temporary downturn. However, the overall market sentiment can be expected to remain bullish,” he said, “This optimism is linked to the broader dynamics with ETF-related development. The interest and growth in ETFs have become a significant factor in maintaining a positive market outlook.”</p><p data-ct-non-breakable="true"><strong><em>Recent: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cost-home-crypto-mining-bitcoin">How much does it cost to build a crypto mining rig at home?</a></em></strong></p><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">Chong further stated that a pre-halving price dip was simply a matter of historical precedent.</p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable="true">“In each of these cycles, the halving effect on the Bitcoin price was similar and displayed a pattern: a substantial rally leading up to the halving, followed by a brief correction and period of consolidation before the major bull run and blow-off top. The peak occurred approximately 18 months after the halving each time.”</blockquote><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">Chong said that this “highly simplified” analysis still held true.</p><h2 data-ct-non-breakable="true">Robust support for BTC price</h2><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">Even if a dip continues, the longer-term direction of travel for the original cryptocurrency is likely to be up, industry observers say.</p><p>Danny Lim, core contributor at decentralized exchange MarginX, told Cointelegraph, “This upcoming event is set apart by the involvement of institutional investors driving even higher demand against this constrained supply, likely to provide strong support for Bitcoin’s price during potential retracements.”</p><p>Zac Cheah, co-founder and CEO of Pundi X, a blockchain-based point-of-sale solution, also believes this halving is unique due to market conditions.</p><p>Just 30 days before the event, Cheah told Cointelegraph that the 2024 halving was different because “Bitcoin’s floor price enjoys robust support due to the heightened demand from institutional investors.”</p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable="true">“The competition between giants like MicroStrategy and BlackRock, vying for the title of top Bitcoin holders, not only fuels bullish sentiments but also amplifies transaction activity, leading to greater profits for Bitcoin miners.”</blockquote><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">With the United States Federal Reserve considering interest rate cuts, the positive case for Bitcoin only gets stronger.</p><p>“Historically, Bitcoin has thrived in lower interest rate environments. Considering these positive factors, there is substantial anticipation around Bitcoin’s performance in the upcoming halving cycle, with forecasts indicating a potential surge to as high as $100,000,” Cheah said.</p><p>Cheah’s $100,000 prediction matches similar comments from Mow. Whether it can achieve those lofty heights with the halving a mere month away, all eyes are on Bitcoin.</p><h2 data-ct-non-breakable="true">Could Bitcoin decouple from the broader crypto market?</h2><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">With the rest of the market seemingly dragged up or down by Bitcoin’s considerable gravity well, Cointelegraph asked Mow whether crypto would ride Bitcoin’s coattails all the way to the top or whether BTC would decouple from the rest of the market.</p><p><strong><em>Recent: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-court-craig-wright-bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto">UK court rules Craig Wright not Nakamoto, ending long-standing drama</a></em></strong></p><p>“Bitcoin will decouple from ‘crypto’ simply because we have massive tailwinds from the ETFs. We now have $500 million to $1 billion in inflows every trading day. ‘Crypto’ simply does not have that vast pool of capital flowing in. So while ‘crypto’ coins can track Bitcoin for a time because they’re small and have low liquidity, it’s inevitable they lose steam and are left behind,” said Mow.</p><p>“Or the founders/insiders simply decide to stop propping up the prices and buy Bitcoin — which is all too common, and retail buyers are left holding the bag,” he said.</p><p class="post-content__disclaimer" data-ct-non-breakable="true">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

<p><span>The crypto market has long been associated with illicit activity and lack of real utility. </span><span>Even the European Union has joined the naysayers. In February, the European Central Bank criticized </span><a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/bitcoin-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span>Bitcoin [BTC]</span></a><span>, terming it as “snake oil.”</span></p>
<p><span>However, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has dismissed these attacks, citing various crypto use cases. </span></p>
<p><span>In a recent </span><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/what-is-crypto-good-for-anyway" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span>blog</span></a><span>, Armstrong cited traditional payment challenges and how crypto has solved them. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“Merchants still lose about 2% on every credit card transaction, wire transfers cost $30, and many transactions in the U.S. still take days to clear.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Layer 2 solutions have scaled blockchain and solved high fees and delays in traditional global payment systems.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“As blockchains have scaled using “Layer 2” solutions, you can now send USDC in one second, anywhere in the world, for about one cent.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Additionally, Coinbase Chief also cited dollar-backed stablecoins that have now exceeded $100 billion as a sign of another remarkable real-world use case. He even referred to crypto as the “future of money.”</span></p>
<h4><strong>Coinbase future plans</strong></h4>
<p><span>Breakdowns and outages always mark bull run markets during traffic surges. Coinbase has suffered a handful of these outages in the past few days. </span></p>
<p><span>Armstrong told Bloomberg that the Bitcoin rally and traffic uptick exceeded their model set at 10X growth, so they must invest more in infrastructure upgrades. </span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, Coinbase’s chief highlighted that the platform will evolve to cater to three key category audiences; </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“We can be an infrastructure provider for traditional financial services and retail/institutions app for people who want to directly use crypto.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Adding extra value to these three categories could tip Coinbase’s shares and native BASE token to rally. BASE was already up 7% on the daily front, at press time, per CoinMarketCap data. </span></p>
<p><span>However, the sector still needs regulatory clarity despite US spot BTC ETF approval. Coinbase has opted to support pro-crypto candidates in the upcoming US elections to tackle this.  </span></p>

<div><div class="elementor-widget-container"><p>The crypto market witnessed a spectacle last week, akin to watching a high-wire act where the star performer, <a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/exploring-the-factors-behind-bitcoin-plunge/" data-type="post" data-id="488857">Bitcoin</a>, take a literal fall from grace. After a recent trailblazing performance, where Bitcoin was at the stratosphere, reaching a new all-time high of $73,800, it plummeted to a jarring low of $60,760. This sudden descent was a significant drop of 16%, leaving market watchers and investors in a state of bewilderment. And now the spotlight turns to Grayscale, the giant behind the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, and its role in this high-stakes drama.<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10b65d40-2ae8-468c-ad0e-759e12298251" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> </a></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="A_Torrent_of_Outflows_and_the_Grayscale_Effect">A Torrent of Outflows and the Grayscale Effect</span></h2><p>As the curtain rose on this week, the crypto market saw reversal of fortunes for Bitcoin ETFs. Asset manager CoinShares threw light on a huge outflow of nearly $500 million from 11 freshly minted Bitcoin ETFs in just a span of two days. Grayscale saw an exodus of over $1 billion from its vaults.</p><p>Grayscale’s spot ETF not only set the stage but also played a huge role in the play. The company’s fee structure, pegged at 1.5%, contrasted sharply with its competitors who opted for more investor-friendly rates. While entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Investment wooed the audience with reduced or even waived fees, Grayscale stuck to its guns, a move that now seems to have backfired. This disparity in fee structures steered investors towards alternatives, igniting a flight from Grayscale’s offerings.</p><p>The broader narrative of Bitcoin’s allure in 2023, fueled by the U.S. regulators’ nod to spot Bitcoin ETFs, witnessed a surge in investment flows. BlackRock’s ETF, in particular, broke records, garnering $10 billion at breakneck speed. Yet, Grayscale’s situation showed consistent outflows, culminating in a $12 billion withdrawal since its ETF received the regulatory green light.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="Market_Jitters_and_a_Reality_Check">Market Jitters and a Reality Check</span></h2><p>This week’s chaos also reflected deeper market sentiments. Analysts from K33 Research flagged an “overheated” market structure, indicative of a bubble on the brink. The report highlights a “slow bleed” across the crypto market, with Bitcoin’s price movements serving as a cautionary tale. After peaking, Bitcoin, along with other major cryptocurrencies like <a data-autolink-id="119" target="_self" href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/ethereum-eth/">Ethereum</a> and BNB, witnessed massive losses, causing investors to doubt the market’s sustainability.</p><p>The sharp contrast in inflows into new ETFs, juxtaposed with Grayscale’s outflows, shows a market at a crossroads. Grayscale’s recent performance, marked by a $642 million outflow in a single day, starkly highlighted investor sentiment and market dynamics. While the allure of Bitcoin ETFs remains undiminished, with a net positive flow of 27,000 BTC into these products, the gloomy outlook caused by Grayscale’s recent outflows cannot be ignored.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-lo" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noreferrer">John Lo</a>, the founder of Recharge Capital, shared insights with Cointelegraph regarding the future of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., emphasizing a less certain path compared to the previously approved Bitcoin ETFs. </p>



<p>He anticipates that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will intensify its examination of all forthcoming crypto-based ETFs, particularly those related to Ether. </p>




<p>Lo highlighted, “Scrutiny towards cryptocurrency ETFs has only grown, as you could argue to a certain degree that the SEC was forced to approve the Bitcoin ETFs because of its case with Grayscale. </p>



<p>No doubt, the SEC internally views that as a huge loss for themselves.”</p>



<p>Several firms, including BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton, are in the race to launch an Ether ETF. </p>




<p>Critical dates loom for the SEC to make decisions on these applications, with deadlines spanning from May 23 for VanEck, to August 7 for BlackRock.</p>



<p>Despite potential regulatory hurdles, Lo is optimistic about Ethereum’s resilience, attributing its strength to the platform’s innovative capabilities and recent upgrades. </p>



<p>He stated, “Whether or not there’s an ETF, Ethereum will be fine. </p>

<p>“I think it’s coming out with lots of innovation, use cases, and we’ve already seen alternative financial systems being built on the [network], which is incredibly interesting.”</p>



<p>Lo also touched upon the challenges within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, particularly the obstacles related to user experience that deter both institutional and retail participation. </p>



<p>He believes that the complex nature of DeFi services and the high cost of user acquisition, estimated at $10 to $12 per user, are significant barriers limiting DeFi’s user base.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, Ethereum continues to thrive as a central hub for DeFi activities. </p>



<p>The total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s DeFi protocols surged 80.3% over the past year, reaching $51 billion as of March 18, with a 21.6% increase in unique wallet addresses, signaling sustained growth and interest in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>On March 19, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noreferrer">Bitcoin</a>‘s journey took a downturn, reaching new lows within the week, sparking speculation among traders and analysts about the potential paths the cryptocurrency’s price might take amidst a broader market slump. </p>



<p>Despite achieving unprecedented heights previously, Bitcoin’s stability is now being tested, with key support levels struggling to hold firm. </p>




<p>Amidst this uncertainty, market watchers are identifying crucial thresholds and entertaining the possibility of a recovery bounce.</p>



<p>A significant factor that could influence the crypto market’s direction is the upcoming Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on March 20. </p>



<p>Historical patterns suggest that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings have previously impacted risk assets, leading to speculation that the forthcoming announcement could ease the current pressure on cryptocurrencies.</p>




<p>Cointelegraph’s examination of short-term BTC/USD predictions reveals an anticipation of Bitcoin potentially approaching the $60,000 mark, a crucial juncture that has yet to be retested convincingly. </p>



<p>Traders, including a notable one named George, suggest that a dip below last week’s low could lead to prices falling under $60,000. </p>



<p>Another trader, Ali, points out key support levels using the realized price distribution method, highlighting significant figures below the $60,000 range, while also identifying major resistance levels.</p>



<p>Analyst Mark Cullen, utilizing Fibonacci retracement levels, indicates multiple support levels that Bitcoin might encounter. </p>

<p>Furthermore, a “bullish order block” suggests bids congregating around the current price point, below $64,000, indicating potential areas where the correction could stabilize, contingent also on the outcomes of the FOMC meeting.</p>



<p>As the FOMC meeting garners attention, not just within crypto circles but across the broader spectrum of risk assets, financial commentator Tedtalksmacro anticipates that the Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s address could set a pivotal moment for the market. </p>



<p>Predicting a hawkish stance from Powell in response to persistent inflation, Tedtalksmacro suggests that the speech could mark a turning point for risk assets, potentially signaling a bottom.</p>



<p>Amidst these predictions and analyses, Bitcoin exhibits volatility around the $64,000 mark, awaiting the next movements influenced by macroeconomic factors and market sentiment.</p>

								<p><span>American digital asset management company, </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-lose-500m-as-grayscales-outflow-wanes/"><span>Grayscale</span></a><span> has been experiencing a series of outflows in its </span><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-579-million/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)</span></a><span> in recent times. As a result, the company has attempted to potentially curb the </span><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-2-7-billion-exodus-jpmorgan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>massive exodus</span></a><span>, promising to lower ETF fees soon.  </span></p>
<h2>Grayscale To Reduce Bitcoin ETF Fees</h2>
<p><span>In a recent interview, Grayscale’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Michael Sonnenshein, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/03/19/grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-bitcoin-etf-fees-will-come-down-over-time.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>disclosed</span></a><span> to CNBC that the fees for the company’s Spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) will decrease over time. </span></p>

<p><span>Since the start of trading, after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) </span><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-sec-approves-all-11-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-price-holds-steady-at-46000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs</span></a><span>, Grayscale has failed to record a significant daily net inflow. However, the asset management firm has steadily </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-outflows-end-experts/"><span>experienced outflows worth billions of dollars.</span></a><span> </span></p>
<p><span>“Of course, we anticipated having outflows. Investors have been wanting to either take gains on their portfolio, or arbitragers coming out of the fund, or people unwinding positions that were part of bankruptcies through forced liquidation,” Sonnenshein stated. </span></p>
<p><span>The company’s decision to lower fees marks a shift from its earlier position, where it justified charging investors a </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-grayscale-spin-off-vaneck-slashes-fees/"><span>higher-than-average fee compared to other Spot Bitcoin ETFs</span></a><span> in the market. Presently, Grayscale’s GBTC maintains the highest ETF fee by a wide margin, charging investors approximately 1.5% in fees. </span></p>
<p><span>Grayscale’s ETF fee stands in stark contrast to the fees maintained by other leading asset management companies, such as </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-slashes-bitcoin-etf-fees-to-competition/"><span>BlackRock</span></a><span>, and Bitwise, which charge 0.25% and 0.21%, respectively. Impressively, these companies, particularly BlackRock, have been </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-hits-milestone-blackrock-influence-evident-in-1-billion-triumph/"><span>seeing a considerable amount of inflows in its ETF</span></a><span>, making headlines as they experience a surge in investor demand.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite previously advocating the firm’s </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-amendments-to-gbtc-trust-agreement/"><span>exorbitant ETF fees</span></a><span>, Sonnenshein appears to have acknowledged market sentiment, announcing a reduction in its Spot Bitcoin ETF fees as the market continues to grow and mature. </span></p>
<h2>GBTC Witnesses Massive Outflows</h2>
<p><span>Grayscale’s sudden change of heart on retaining its lofty ETF fee may be attributed to the recent surge in outflows from its </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-record-2-2-billion-inflow-in-past-week/"><span>Spot Bitcoin ETF</span></a><span>. The asset management company has been witnessing a steady sell-off, totalling $12 billion in outflows since it began trading on January 11. </span></p>

<p><span>On Monday, March 18, </span><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/record-breaking-gbtc-outflows-send-bitcoin-down-14-to-62000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Grayscale recorded its largest outflow</span></a><span> in a single day. The asset management company </span><a href="https://x.com/cazenove_uk/status/1770051786184761509?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>witnessed</span></a><span> a staggering $642 million in withdrawals. </span></p>
<p><span>These massive outflows have been largely driven by the firm’s high fees, pushing investors and traders to gravitate towards companies offering </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-undercut-lower-spot-bitcoin-etf-fees/"><span>Spot Bitcoin ETFs with less expensive fees. </span></a></p>
<p><span>With lower fees, Grayscale stands to attract a wider pool of investors, while also catering to the needs of its existing shareholders. The combination of the firm’s robust reputation, impressive track record and a reduced ETF fee holds the promise of mitigating current outflows and </span><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-urges-sec-options-trading-on-bitcoin-etfs/"><span>potentially sparking renewed inflows. </span></a></p>

<div><div class="elementor-widget-container"><p>Gold advocate <a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/peter-schiff-calls-for-balanced-coverage-between-gold-and-bitcoin/">Peter Schiff</a> has once again stirred controversy within the cryptocurrency community by highlighting what he perceives as a significant flaw in Bitcoin exchange-traded Funds (ETFs). Schiff pointed out that, unlike the 24/7 global operation of the Bitcoin market, the liquidity of Bitcoin ETFs is limited to U.S. market hours. This limitation becomes apparent during times of market volatility, such as the recent overnight price crash, where ETF buyers find themselves unable to exit their positions until the market reopens.</p><p>The ongoing price decline in Bitcoin has intensified concerns among investors, with the leading cryptocurrency nearing the $60,000 level earlier today. Over the past 24 hours, the market has witnessed over half a billion dollars in liquidations, reflecting a lack of resilience amidst relentless selling pressure.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="Bitcoin_ETFs_facing_major_outflows"><strong>Bitcoin ETFs facing major outflows</strong></span></h2><p><a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-etfs-experience-historic-outflows/">Bitcoin ETFs</a> have been experiencing significant outflows, contributing to the souring sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency. James Seyffart, a notable ETF analyst at Bloomberg, countered Schiff’s argument by highlighting that the liquidity issue described is not unique to Bitcoin ETFs. He emphasized that similar constraints exist for gold-based ETFs and international equity ETFs. Seyffart also noted that market-moving events can occur outside of trading hours, impacting ETFs when markets are closed.</p><p>Despite Seyffart’s perspective, Schiff remains steadfast in his critique of Bitcoin ETFs, asserting that gold does not experience overnight crashes like its digital counterpart. He contends that this fundamental difference provides gold investors with a sense of security that Bitcoin ETF investors lack.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="Federal_Reserve_rate_cut_decision_adds_bearish_pressure"><strong>Federal Reserve rate cut decision adds bearish pressure</strong></span></h2><p>Adding to the downward pressure on Bitcoin prices is the anticipation surrounding the Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate cut decision. Analysts suggest that this looming event is another bearish headwind for the cryptocurrency market. The uncertainty surrounding monetary policy decisions often leads to heightened volatility in financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.</p><p>As Bitcoin continues to grapple with multiple challenges, including liquidity concerns, outflows from ETFs, and macroeconomic uncertainties, investors remain cautious about the near-term outlook for the digital asset. The recent price decline of nearly 20% from its recent high underscores the prevailing pessimism among market participants.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1770227134985895971" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Peter Schiff’s critique</a> of Bitcoin ETFs has reignited the debate surrounding the suitability of these investment vehicles in volatile market conditions. While some argue that liquidity issues are not unique to Bitcoin ETFs, Schiff maintains that the inherent differences between gold and Bitcoin make the former a more reliable store of value. With ongoing market turbulence and looming macroeconomic uncertainties, the resilience of Bitcoin and its associated investment products remains a topic of intense scrutiny among investors.</p>

								<p>In a trial set to commence on March 26 in the Dutch city of Hertogenbosch, Alexey Pertsev, the prominent developer behind Tornado Cash, finds himself at the center of a legal storm as he faces money laundering charges. The allegations, revealed in a three-page indictment obtained by DL News, accuse Pertsev of<a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/people-culture/alexey-pertsev-accused-of-laundering-1bn-at-tornado-cash/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> laundering over $1.2 billion in illicit funds.</a></p>

<p>According to Dutch prosecutors, Pertsev, who was arrested in August 2022, is accused of habitually engaging in money laundering activities.</p>
<p>However, his defense lawyer, Keith Cheng, maintains that the indictment lacks specificity regarding the exact acts Pertsev is alleged to have committed in relation to the criminal offense.</p>
<h2><strong>Tornado Cash Unveiled: Indictment Links Pertsev To Crypto Laundering</strong></h2>
<p>The indictment provides a glimpse into the state’s case, asserting that Pertsev was a co-perpetrator in laundering assets through <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tornado Cash</a>, a cryptocurrency mixer designed to obfuscate transaction trails.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have identified 36 transactions from decentralized protocols to Tornado Cash, including significant amounts of Ethereum (ETH) originating from platforms such as Ronin Bridge, which suffered a $625 million hack in 2022, linked to North Korean cyber group Lazarus.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/hoMe8Fwb/"></p>
<pre>Crypto market cap. Chart: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></pre>
<p>Decentralized protocols like Harmony and Nomad Bridge, both of which were associated with heists, are also mentioned in the indictment. US officials had previously sanctioned Tornado Cash, alleging its involvement in laundering millions of dollars from these incidents.</p>
<p>Following Pertsev’s arrest in the Netherlands, he was detained for nearly nine months and is presently subject to GPS monitoring with travel restrictions.</p>
<h2><strong>Stakes High: Pertsev Trial Could Set Precedent For Crypto Developers</strong></h2>
<p>The outcome of Pertsev’s trial holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency community. A guilty verdict could potentially create a chilling effect, resulting in developers and the open-source community fearing repercussions from US authorities for their involvement in projects that might later be deemed suspicious. Many within the crypto sphere view the case against Pertsev as an assault on coding itself.</p>
<p>Supporters ranging from major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to Ethereum developer Preston Van Loon and the Blockchain Association in Washington have rallied to Pertsev’s defense.</p>
<p>They argue that the act of software development should not be equated with participation in money laundering or similar crimes. This perspective aligns with the defense’s contention that the indictment lacks clarity on Pertsev’s specific actions.</p>

<p>Dutch prosecutors have hinted at a potential key element of their case, acknowledging the argument that software development cannot be inherently linked to criminal activities.</p>
<p>As the trial unfolds, it is likely that both the defense and prosecution will delve deeper into the complex intersection of coding, money laundering, and legal responsibility in the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>The trial of Alexey Pertsev is poised to be a pivotal event that could shape the future of cryptocurrency development and the regulatory landscape surrounding it.</p>

                            <p>In the late hours of Tuesday, Trezor’s X account was compromised. The hacker used the hardware wallet company account to promote a fake crypto presale with a malicious link attached.</p>
<p>Members of the crypto community quickly realized the suspicious activity from the company and alerted other X users about the scam. Since then, Trezor’s team has regained control of the account.</p>

<h2>Crypto Community’s Solidarity, Hackers’ New Prey</h2>
<p>In the now-deleted tweets, the hacker announced that Trezor was “willing to support the $SLERF Community.” Taking advantage of the ongoing efforts from crypto projects and exchanges to raise funds for the affected participants of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-memecoin-presale-gone-wrong-creator-accidentally-burns-10m-whale-makes-huge-profit/" target="_blank">Slerf presale debacle</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The unauthorized post offered the presale of a fake $TRZR token, which required interested users to send SOL to the hacker’s address. Additionally, Trezor supporters would receive a “separate bonus airdrop” if they went to a website linked in the post.</p>
<p>As it’s customary for phishing scams, the link would redirect to a wallet drainer that takes control of the person’s wallet after they try to “claim the airdrop tokens.”</p>
<p>The crypto community shared their thoughts on the hack. A user <a href="https://x.com/i_am_wilf/status/1770411148271128913?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pointed out</a> that the security breach was a “bad look” for the company as it focuses on crypto security. Others thanked the users who warned about the hack since it potentially saved them and others from falling for it.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that many users have raised their concerns about the community’s reaction to the Slerf presale drama. They <a href="https://x.com/DeNomics_/status/1770061164829122893?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">consider</a> that raising funds for the participants affected sets a precedent of “bailing out” bad actors and will only “enable” similar behavior.</p>
<p>Moreover, scammers have been trying to prey on the community’s good faith to help potential victims and newcomers. As seen with the Trezor hack, the scammer seemingly tried to maximize its gains by utilizing the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-presale-frenzy-raises-over-122m-worth-of-sol-in-a-week/" target="_blank">presale meta trend</a> and the Slerf drama.</p>
<h2>“Dumb” Hacker Or Smarter Community?</h2>
<p>Usually, the recounting of crypto hacks ends with staggering figures being stolen, but for once, the tale is different. As <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1770237007366639681" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported</a> by ZachXBT, the hacker managed to steal $8,100 from the unauthorized post, which includes the 25% drainer fee. As part of the loot, the hacker also received a “whooping 0.96 Solana,” as another user <a href="https://twitter.com/Theft/status/1770237549547802922" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pointed</a> out.</p>
<p>Many wondered if the small amount stolen was due to the community intelligently recognizing the scam or the hacker’s inability to perform a big heist. Whatever the case, this is a remarkable feat as the cold wallet company amasses over 200,000 followers that momentarily became potential victims.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Despite this small victory for the community, “It’s $8.1K more than 0,” as one user said. This raises the question of whether the hack was possible due to a lack of proper security measures or an inside job taking place.</p>
<p>No official explanation has been given yet. Nonetheless, Trezor acknowledged the hack in an X post earlier today.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The company affirmed that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/algorand/algorand-ceos-x-account-hacked-is-justin-sun-involved/" target="_blank">hack happened</a> despite its “robust protections,” including two-factor authentication (2FA). At the time of writing, Trezor is continuing its investigation. The statement closed with a message for all users to “remain vigilant.”</p>

<p>Bitget Wallet, previously known as BitKeep, is set to introduce its own native token following a substantial $30 million investment from its namesake exchange, which valued the company at $300 million. </p>



<p>The introduction of the BWB token comes with a generous airdrop plan announced on March 18, aiming to distribute 1 billion BWB tokens. </p>




<p>A notable 5% of these tokens are allocated to users who either hold digital assets in Bitget Wallet or engage in swap transactions within the app. </p>



<p>This airdrop initiative includes a six-week points reward system, with points convertible to BWB tokens in the second quarter post its initial exchange offering. </p>



<p>Moreover, users who benefited from rewards in the BitKeep wallet prior to its rebranding can exchange these for BWB at a 6:10 ratio in Q2.</p>




<p>Alvin Kan, Bitget Wallet’s Chief Operating Officer, emphasized the value BWB brings to its holders, stating, “It’s important to us that BWB serves as a key to unlocking exclusive benefits for its holders, offering them a voice in community governance, access to ecosystem airdrops, and a dividend in the rewards.” </p>



<p>“Following the token announcement, the wallet experienced a temporary service disruption due to an overload, preventing some users from claiming their BWB tokens. </p>

<p>The company reassured users that the issue was being addressed promptly and would be resolved soon.</p>



<p>Bitget Wallet has achieved significant popularity in the Asia-Pacific region, boasting over 19 million users. It supports in-wallet swap functionality for approximately 40 blockchains, positioning itself as a leader in the space. </p>



<p>This strategic move mirrors Trust Wallet’s post-acquisition launch of its native token by Binance in 2018, which has seen remarkable growth, offering a significant return on investment.</p>



<p>In a strategic shift in August 2023, BitKeep underwent a rebranding to Bitget Wallet following a major acquisition deal. </p>



<p>The wallet expanded its services by partnering with several payment platforms, including Banxa, Simplex, Alchemy Pay, MoonPay, and FaTPay, enhancing user accessibility to cryptocurrency purchases via credit cards, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. </p>



<p>This development underscores Bitget Wallet’s commitment to providing comprehensive services and benefits to its users, reinforcing its position within the digital wallet landscape.</p>

																<p>Bitcoin ETFs collectively experienced the highest outflows yesterday since their January launch, marking the second consecutive day of withdrawals.</p>
<p>Consequently, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) faced downward pressure, pushing it below the $61,000 mark momentarily.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETFs See $326M Outflows</h2>
<p>According to Farside Investors, the total outflows from all nine Bitcoin ETFs <a href="https://farside.co.uk/?p=1321" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reached</a> $326 million on Tuesday, significantly surpassing the outflows recorded the previous day and marking a continuation of the trend.</p>
<p>Among these, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw net inflows of only $75 million, while Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) followed with $39.6 million, positioning it second. Other Bitcoin ETFs experienced minimal to no inflows, as reported by Farside, indicating that institutional investors are adopting a cautious stance in anticipation of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision today, March 20.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) faced significant <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-etf-inflows-fall-as-grayscale-sees-record-outflow/" data-wpel-link="internal">withdrawals</a>, with net outflows hitting $444 million on Tuesday alone. Grayscale also reported losing another 6,860 Bitcoin, representing about 1.9% of its total holdings.</p><p class="code-block code-block-8">


</p>

<p>This occurred despite Grayscale CEO Michael Sonneshien’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-will-lower-fees-on-its-spot-bitcoin-etf-ceo-confirms/" data-wpel-link="internal">announcement</a> of an impending fee reduction for GBTC, which has had a limited impact on retaining investors’ confidence.</p>
<p>In the past two trading days, financial commentator Tedtalksmacro highlighted that almost $500M has flowed out of spot Bitcoin ETFs. He attributed traders’ cautious or exit behaviors to anticipating the FOMC decision and the ongoing tax season in the U.S. He also suggested that while a return to normal trading patterns is expected, some market volatility may ensue.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Nosedives Amid Declining ETF Interest</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled below the $65,000 mark on Tuesday as interest in U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) waned. According to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">data</a>, the top crypto by market cap witnessed a sharp decline of over 10%, dropping to below $61,000 yesterday. Bitcoin is currently trading at $63,830, down 0.7% over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The plunge pressured the general crypto market downward, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-markets-lose-220-billion-in-2-days-as-bitcoin-slumps-toward-63k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">falling</a> 2.4% to hit $2.48 trillion in market capitalization.</p>
<p>In a discussion on X (formerly Twitter), market analyst Kruger <a href="https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1770240971223007251" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">outlined</a> several contributing factors to the market downturn. He highlighted the excessive leverage in the market, showing that funding levels are critical. Kruger also pointed to the market’s negative reaction to Ethereum’s decline, fueled by speculation that an ETF approval was unlikely, alongside negative inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. However, he cautioned that this data reflects a one-day lag.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kruger highlighted the excessive hype surrounding Solana, referring to it as ‘shitcoin mania,’ which he deemed to have gone too far.</p>

								<p>Binance CEO Richard Teng is predicting that Bitcoin (<a href="https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BTC</a>) could reach a new all-time high by the end of this year, according to a Bloomberg report.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/binance-ceo-teng-sees-bitcoin-topping-80-000-on-etf-inflows-1.2047933" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a> says that Teng sees Bitcoin exceeding $80,000 after earlier estimating that the flagship crypto asset would close 2024 at around that price.</p>
<p class="code-block code-block-055f5289fd7e731bb72be7c5a19d18ed code-block-1">

</p>

<p>According to the report, Teng’s bullish prediction for Bitcoin is premised on the fact that supply is falling while demand is “continuing to come through”.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is trading at $63,100, down by around 14% from the all-time high of $73,802 reached earlier this month. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin is up by around 50%.</p>
<p>Per the report, Teng is forecasting that a Bitcoin rally will not occur in a “straight line” and that corrections will be beneficial for the market.</p>
<p>Teng <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2023/11/21/changpeng-zhao-will-step-down-as-binance-ceo-admit-to-violating-anti-money-laundering-laws-report/">stepped</a> into the top Binance executive role after the crypto exchange’s founder Changpeng Zhao resigned as CEO following accusations of flouting anti-money laundering laws.</p>
<p>Days after taking over from Zhao, Teng <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2023/11/27/binance-ceo-details-prediction-says-crypto-exchange-about-to-reinvent-itself-with-new-corporate-structure-report/">disclosed</a> that he intended to position the giant crypto exchange for more growth while ensuring regulatory compliance. At the time, Teng said that the crypto exchange’s business fundamentals were “very strong”.</p>
<p><i>“Binance continues to operate the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, our capital structure is debt-free, expenses are modest, and, despite the low fees we charge our users, we have robust revenues and profits.”</i></p>

<li><strong>A meme coin trader bought 292.16 million SHROOM and made $8.9 million in gains.</strong></li>



<li><strong>The 4-hour price analysis showed that SOL might drop to the $149.20 local support.</strong></li>



<li><strong>The MFI indicated that SOL neared the oversold region, and a bounce could happen soon.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Within one hour, a trader made a mind-blowing $8.9 million trading SHROOM, one of <a href="https://coinedition.com/solana-sol-price-prediction/">Solana’s (SOL)</a> memecoins. According to Lookonchain, the traders spent 6,000 SOL to buy 292.16 million SHROOM.</p>



<p>An hour later, the trader sold the SHROOM for $9.93 million, making the profits above in the process.</p>







<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meme-coin-season-continues"><strong>Meme Coin Season Continues</strong></h2>



<p>SHROOM is one of the many meme coins that have recently emerged on the Solana blockchain. In recent articles, Coin Edition made mention of <a href="https://coinedition.com/book-of-memes-bome-price-prediction/">BOOK OF MEMES (BOME)</a>, which gave incredible gains to buyers after it hit a $1 billion market cap.</p>



<p>At press time, DEXScreeener <a href="https://dexscreener.com/solana/9qjpzcmngd6nqrkc2usxq3wie5grwxxaexwuhx6w8vym" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">showed</a> that SHROOM’s price increased by 579% in the last 24 hours. However, its market cap, despite hitting $60 million at one point, had retraced. As of this writing, the market cap was $34.2 million.</p>



<p>However, the increasing deployment of meme coins has not been able to save SOL from decreasing. Previously, the token had attempted to hit $200. But on March 18, bears rejected the attempt as the price decreased by 4.29% in the last 24 hours.</p>




<ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4555727647488844" data-ad-slot="6498029277"></ins>




<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sol-price-analysis"><strong>SOL Price Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>On the 4-hour chart, SOL painted a bearish picture that saw bulls lose control of the $177.97 support. On March 18, bulls attempted a breakout that could have led SOL toward $250.</p>



<p>But it was rejected. Furthermore, resistance at $195.65 ensured that the attempt was completely invalidated.  Currently, bears have ensured bulls have no say in the cryptocurrency’s direction.</p>



<p>As such, a reversal might not occur anytime soon. Should this condition linger, the price of SOL might decline to the local support level of $149.20.</p>



<p>Further examination of the chart showed that liquidity has continued to flow out of Solana. This inference was obtained from the Money Flow Index (MFI). At press time, the MFI reading was 27.48.</p>



<p>This reading confirmed the increase in selling pressure over buying. However, the MFI can also tell when a cryptocurrency is overbought or oversold. If it hits 80, then the asset is overbought. On the other hand, a reading of 20 implies an oversold condition. </p>



<p>In SOL’s case, increased selling pressure could drive the MFI downward. However, if the indicator hits 20.00, the price of the token might reverse upwards. </p>





<p>Meanwhile, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicated that a rebound was not likely until SOL further declined. With a negative reading, the AO showed that the momentum might not continue to decrease and the price could slide below $150. However, in the mid-term, the value of SOL could eventually drive through to $250.</p>

You’re going to live longer, and in the most cynical, even rational, you will pay more taxes because you will be economically active for longer.”</blockquote><template data-ct-widget="buzzsprout" data-buzzsprout-podcast-id="2096305" data-ct-non-breakable='"true"'></template><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">However, no one has put a concrete monetary value on what movement is worth. Fomenko compared physical activity to attention in this regard. “We now know how much your attention is worth, very, very precisely,” he said, pointing to Google, Facebook and Amazon. “Twenty years ago, we wouldn’t have an answer. Now we do.”</p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable="true">“Physical activity is, in the same fashion, very, very valuable to you because, as I said, it makes you more productive. It makes you live longer. It makes you fitter, healthier, mentally fit. There are third parties willing to pay for it.”</blockquote><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">Sweat Economy breaks down one “unit” of movement into one step, and it has begun issuing grants for researchers to determine the monetary value of 10,000 steps. Fomenko said the project is partnering with the University of Cadiz on this effort and will announce more universities soon.</p><h2 data-ct-non-breakable="true">The movement economy of the future</h2><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">Fomeko expects that once the monetary value of physical activity is recognized, tokenized movement will become a major economic force and grow exponentially. Sweatcoin currently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sweat-economy-locked-tokens-proposal">pays out SWEAT tokens</a><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sweat-economy-locked-tokens-proposal"></a> for the first 5,000 steps to users who opt-in to its crypto features, which is just the first step (pun intended) for Fomenko.</p><p>Using the attention analogy, he argued that “if humanity has managed to build an economy of $7 trillion around the value of our collective attention, why would the movement economy, or the economy that we will together build around the value of your physical activity, be any smaller than that?”</p><p>Fomenko hopes that in the future, everyone will be incentivized financially to move more: </p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable="true">“The trade-off that we have in our minds right now is, oh, I need to be healthier? Then it means I need to spend money. We need to flip it in a completely different direction. If I’m healthier, I am earning because it is not just a benefit to me; it is a benefit to absolutely everybody.”</blockquote><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">One day, movement and physical activity could even be traded on major markets, according to the co-founder. When asked about his ideal future for Sweat Economy, Fomenko responded:</p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable="true">“What I would love to see is a headline saying physical activity value pumped 20% on the release of the latest obesity report in the U.S. That would be an incredible achievement because that would mean that SWEAT will stop being a token. It will start being perceived as the value of physical activity.”</blockquote><p data-ct-non-breakable="true">To hear more from Fomenko’s conversation with <em>The Agenda </em>— including his thoughts on the health impacts of the metaverse, how the Sweatcoin app prevents fraud, the value of health data and more — listen to the full episode on <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/the-agenda">Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-agenda/id1659393166" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6azmkkIXj5LQbxTRAbAqXS" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Spotify</a>.

<div><div class="elementor-widget-container"><p>Renowned investor and author Robert Kiyosaki, famous for his best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has recently voiced his bullish stance on silver as an investment opportunity. In a recent statement,<a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/robert-kiyosaki-backs-bitcoin-tout-supremacy/"> Kiyosaki </a>highlighted silver’s multifaceted utility as both a precious metal and a critical component in various industrial applications, asserting that its demand is on the rise.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="Silvers_unique_position_amidst_growing_demand">Silver’s unique position amidst growing demand</span></h2><p>Kiyosaki emphasized silver’s significance beyond its traditional role as a store of value, noting its pivotal role in industries and technologies. He <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1770204116062720202" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">pointed</a> out the escalating global demand for silver, fueled in part by ongoing geopolitical tensions and the proliferation of warfare across different regions.</p><p>The investor also underscored a significant development in the silver market: Elon Musk’s electric vehicle (EV) company, Tesla, securing rights to several silver mines. This strategic move by Tesla highlights the increasing importance of silver in the production of EVs, further bolstering its demand outlook.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="Current_market_dynamics_and_price_trends">Current market dynamics and price trends</span></h2><p>At present, the price of<a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/recommends-gold-and-bitcoin-investments/"> silver</a> remains considerably below its all-time high, presenting an attractive opportunity for potential investors. As per recent data, the price of silver per kilogram stands at $798.62, nearly 50% lower than its peak of $1,589.85 recorded over four decades ago. </p><p>Similarly, the price per ounce of silver is $24.81, with modest fluctuations observed in recent trading sessions.</p><p>Despite the short-term fluctuations, silver has demonstrated a notable upward trend, with a 2.44% increase over the previous week and a 7.88% gain over the past month. These developments indicate a growing investor interest and renewed optimism regarding silver’s prospects.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="Investment_considerations_and_risk_management">Investment considerations and risk management</span></h2><p>While Kiyosaki’s endorsement of silver as a potential investment opportunity is compelling, investors are reminded of the inherent risks associated with any investment venture. It is essential to conduct thorough research and exercise caution before allocating a significant portion of one’s portfolio to any asset class, including precious metals like silver or alternative investments such as cryptocurrencies.</p><p>As with any investment decision, diversification and risk management strategies are paramount to mitigate potential losses and capitalize on opportunities. While silver’s promising outlook may attract investors seeking to capitalize on its potential price appreciation, prudent risk assessment, and portfolio allocation remain essential principles of sound investment practice.</p><p>Robert Kiyosaki’s advocacy for silver as a viable investment option reflects the evolving dynamics of the precious metals market. With increasing industrial demand, coupled with strategic initiatives from key industry players like Tesla, silver’s role as a valuable asset is poised for continued growth.</p><p>While silver presents an attractive opportunity for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on emerging trends, prudent risk management and diligent research are imperative. As the investment landscape evolves, informed decision-making and a long-term perspective will be instrumental in navigating market fluctuations and realizing investment objectives.</p><p>Robert Kiyosaki’s insights serve as a timely reminder of the potential opportunities inherent in silver investment, albeit amidst a backdrop of evolving market dynamics and risk considerations. As investors weigh their options, careful consideration of both the opportunities and risks associated with silver investment will be paramount in achieving long-term financial goals.</p>

Because LUNC appears to have stagnated terminally, most traders may prefer to turn to newer tokens with more potential.</p><p>While the wider market is going through a mini-correction right now, there are a number of promising presale tokens available right now, many of which could rally big once they list.</p><p>A great example of this is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/greenbitcoin" rel="sponsored nofollow">Green Bitcoin (GBTC)</a>, an ERC-20 token that launched its hotly tipped presale a few weeks and has now raised more than $6 million.</p><p></p><p class="lazyload" data-script="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></p><p>The reason for all the market interest is that Green Bitcoin promises an environmentally friendly version of Bitcoin (BTC), marrying a hard cap of 21 million tokens to the energy efficient of the PoS Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>On top of this, GBTC boasts an innovative predict-to-earn staking model, which delivers greater rewards to those stakers who correctly predict future Bitcoin prices.</p><p>It also provides greater rewards to stakers who keep their tokens locked for longer periods, a setup which encourages long-term holding.</p><p>And given that GBTC has such a limited supply, this system is likely to help drive up GBTC’s price over time.</p><p></p><p class="lazyload" data-script="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></p><p>The fact that Green Bitcoin has already raised just over $6.7 million suggests that many traders believe in its roadmap and future potential.</p><p>New investors can join the sale by heading over to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/greenbitcoin" rel="sponsored nofollow">the official Green Bitcoin website</a>, where they can buy GBTC in exchange for USDT, ETH or fiat currency.</p><p>1 GBTC token currently costs $1.1062, although this price is likely to surge once the token lists and users begin staking.</p><p><strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/greenbitcoin" rel="sponsored nofollow">Visit Green Bitcoin Now</a></strong></p>

<p>Controversial internet personality and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/19/andrew-tate-instagram-facebook-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-described</a> misogynist Andrew Tate <a href="https://twitter.com/Cobratate/status/1769856451676127602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims</a> he made $85 million on Binance-supported, so-called decentralized exchange PancakeSwap. </p>
<p>Tate, who currently <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/12/1238086900/andrew-tate-arrested-romania-to-extradite-uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faces</a> — and denies — charges of rape, sexual assault, and human trafficking in Romania and the UK, didn’t provide any dates, coin prices, or wallet addresses to allow researchers to investigate his claim. This has, understandably led many to doubt that he could have made so much money on such a relatively obscure exchange.</p>
<p>However, as usual, the truth of his claims barely mattered as he quickly parlayed that incredible PancakeSwap claim into a promotional advertisement for his $49/month Discord group. There, he <a href="https://twitter.com/Cobratate/status/1717475507686494616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boasted</a>, customers can learn about future pumps and dumps.</p>
<p>They can also apparently pay for more Discord access, including a <strong>multi-thousand-dollar upsell payable in chargeback-proof bitcoin</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, Tate has openly advertised early access to pumps and dumps. Throughout his colorful media career, he has promoted <a href="https://protos.com/andrew-tate-says-he-doesnt-endorse-shitcoins-but-he-definitely-did/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many sketchy crypto assets outright</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to claiming multi-million dollar profits to advertise his paid Discord server, Tate also claimed that the current bull run is not the current bull run.</p>
<p>Despite overwhelming evidence that meme coins are the current meta in crypto and outperforming every other category, Tate disagrees. Instead, he says that meme coins must surrender leadership to “genuinely technological useful or innovating blockchain coins.” </p>
<p>Like it or not, meme coins are definitely the current meta in crypto. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fg%2F11sfdkgmfn&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Per</a> Google Trends, search interest in <strong>meme coins has increased at least 600% in the last month and 50,000% in 12 months.</strong> The leading meme coin PEPE has rallied 4 million percent within 12 months. Solana’s blockchain went <a href="https://twitter.com/the_freightrain/status/1770206462473629941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offline</a> this week because so many users were launching meme coins and larger meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and FLOKI have more than doubled.</p>

<p>Tate, ignoring this evidence, claims that crypto’s next bull run will be different from the last one, which apparently had DeFi as its trendy meta. He asked his followers to guess at new blockchain innovations.</p>
<p>Even with criminal charges still pending, Tate is still claiming to be a trusted crypto expert.

Previously, the fees for crypto retailers stood at just 20 BRV, which is around 6.8 million som ($540).</p><p>According to the NAPP, the modifications aim to boost state revenue from the crypto sector. The agency anticipates the revenue generated from this sector to double once the new structure is in place. </p><p>The NAPP also guaranteed that the updated pricing structure would not harm the financial stability of industry service providers.

								<p>The lawyers of disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried say that the prosecution’s sentence recommendations for their client are “disturbing.”</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.413.0.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">letter</a> addressed to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, Bankman-Fried’s attorneys say that the sentence recommendation is draconian and brands the former chief executive as a “supervillain.”</p>
<p class="code-block code-block-055f5289fd7e731bb72be7c5a19d18ed code-block-1">


<ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2032509223483502" data-ad-slot="8690903223" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>




</p>

<p><em>“The government’s memorandum is disturbing. </em></p>
<p><em>With marked hostility, the memorandum distorts reality to support its precious “loss” narrative and casts Sam as a depraved super-villain; it attributes to him dark and megalomaniacal motives that fly in the face of the record; it makes apocalyptic prophecies of recidivism; and it adopts a medieval view of punishment to reach what amounts to a death-in-prison sentencing recommendation. That is not justice.”</em></p>
<p>Earlier this week, the prosecutors in the case <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2024/03/17/prosecutors-recommend-up-to-50-year-prison-sentence-and-11000000000-money-judgment-for-sam-bankman-fried/">recommended</a> a 40-50-year sentence for Bankman-Fried, who was found guilty in October of defrauding investors and mishandling customer funds related to the multibillion-dollar collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022.</p>
<p>The lawyers elaborate by saying that the government is choosing to ignore that FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings “will result in customers and lenders being made whole,” painting Bankman-Fried as a “monster,” and overblowing his affinity to re-offend.</p>
<p>The letter concludes by saying the prosecution’s intent to keep Bankman-Fried behind bars for that long simply because he could theoretically perpetrate fraud again is terrifying.</p>
<p><em>“At age 32, the government wants to break Sam Bankman-Fried. </em><em>They ignore completely his condition and vulnerabilities. Instead, they urge, menacingly, that the sentence imposed must ‘disable’ him even from ‘being in a position’ where he theoretically ‘could’ perpetrate a fraud. That is a horrifying interpretation of specific deterrence.”</em></p>

<div><div class="coincodex-content">
																<p>Kyle Davies, the co-founder of the defunct cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), says he is not sorry that his company collapsed in 2022 and lost billions of investors’ funds in the process.</p>
<p>Davies <a href="https://youtu.be/IEsjWV7GRgY?si=QnBtUx07cl2ZcgNW" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">expressed</a> his lack of remorse during an interview with Laura Shin on a March 19 episode of the Unchained Podcast, stating that he intends to avoid jail time in any way possible.</p>
<h2>Kyle Davies is Not Sorry</h2>
<p>Recall that Three Arrows collapsed in mid-2022 amid the crypto market downturn due to heavy losses incurred from its positions. After a British Virgin Islands court <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/three-arrows-capital-founders-face-1-billion-asset-freeze/" data-wpel-link="internal">ordered</a> the liquidation of the assets, 3AC’s liquidator, Teneo, revealed the firm owed its creditors about $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>Since then, Davies and his partner, Zhu Su, have been in hiding. They launched and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3ac-founders-opnx-exchange-to-shut-down-flex-and-ox-prices-tank/" data-wpel-link="internal">closed</a> the bankruptcy claims trading platform Open Exchange (OPNX) and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3ac-founders-launch-brand-new-vc-fund-tied-to-opnx/" data-wpel-link="internal">ventured</a> into other crypto businesses. Although Su was eventually <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3ac-co-founder-zhu-su-reportedly-apprehended-in-singapore/" data-wpel-link="internal">arrested</a> in Singapore in September 2023, Davies has remained at large. The duo based 3AC’s operations in Singapore but <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3ac-files-for-bankruptcy-as-voyager-digital-suspends-withdrawals/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> for bankruptcy in the British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Davies claimed he is currently in Europe and would not return to Singapore immediately to avoid serving a four-month prison sentence as Su did. He said he would avoid the Asian country until he settles with appropriate authorities on charges concerning the collapse of 3AC. While at it, he feels no remorse for the unfortunate incidents that befell the hedge fund.</p><p class="code-block code-block-8">


</p>

<blockquote><p>“Am I sorry for a company going bankrupt? No. Like, companies go bankrupt all the time. Every company goes bankrupt. It’s what you do about it and how you build,” Davies stated.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Teneo’s Claims Are Exaggerated: Davies</h2>
<p>Interestingly, Davies believes his reputation is still intact regardless of the backlash he has received on social media. He said most complaints were from individuals and entities, including FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Digital Currency Group, who were unaffected by 3AC’s collapse. He claimed the successful launch of OPNX is proof that he is still well-respected.</p>
<p>The 3AC co-founder also insisted that Teneo’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/su-zhu-and-kyle-davis-from-three-arrows-capital-do-not-cooperate-court-filing/" data-wpel-link="internal">allegations</a> that he and Su were uncooperative in the hedge fund’s bankruptcy proceedings were exaggerated as they frequently participated in meetings geared toward liquidating the firm’s assets.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s a liquidator’s job to say that the founders are not cooperative…They are trying to maximize value for the estate,” Davies explained.</p></blockquote>

								<p class="p2">In addition to the Bitcoin crash that has brought down the crypto market, Shibarium, an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">Shiba Inu team</a>, has taken a huge hit. This latest drawback comes in the form of a significant decline in the number of daily transactions being carried out on the network, leading to its lowest level in months.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shibarium Daily Transactions Fall Below 10,000</h2>
<p class="p2">From the end of 2023 and into the new year of 2024, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-breaks-the-internet-again-with-over-400-million-layer-2-transactions/">Shibarium network</a> had been seeing a lot of adoption. This was embodied by a significant rise in the number of daily transactions that were being carried out on the network. It rose rapidly and crossed more than 7 million daily transactions in December 2023. And even after usage began to wane in the new year, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-takes-a-hit-amidst-shibarium-user-exodus/">Ethereum Layer 2 network</a> was still able to maintain an average of around 1 million transactions per day.</p>

<p class="p2">However, the network has entered into what seems to be an incredibly trying period with a notable crash in the number of daily transactions. This <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">decline</a> began on March 10 when the daily transaction figures fell below 1 million to 800,000 for the first time this year.</p>
<p class="p2">In the following days, the transaction count would pick up and cross 1 million again. But this was only short-lived as a bigger crash was on the horizon. March 16 was the last the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-breaks-the-internet-again-with-over-400-million-layer-2-transactions/">Shibarium network</a> saw daily transactions come in above 1 million as the count would crash to less than 600,000 the next day.</p>
<p class="p2">This decline would continue for the next few days and by Wednesday, March 30, the total daily transaction count on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-project-dao-charter/">Shibarium network</a> was sitting at 9,330. The last time the daily transaction count on the network was this low was back in November 2023, which means that the transaction count has now fallen to its lowest level in four months.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Price Decline To Blame?</h2>
<p class="p2">The decline in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/">Shiba Inu price</a> over the last few days can be attributed to the Bitcoin crash, which saw the price go from $73,000 to below $61,000 in a matter of days. As a result, altcoins such as Shiba Inu have been suffering as well.</p>

<p class="p2">This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/">crash in price</a> has seen investors reeling, with many not willing to gamble with their coins as they wait for prices to recover. This could explain the drastic drop in daily transactions on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-record/">Shibarium network</a> as crypto users enter a period of waiting for what will happen next.</p>
<p class="p2">If this is the case, then a recovery in the price should trigger another wave of adoption for the layer 2 network. However, competition is also fierce as the likes of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/">Solana</a> is taking on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-reach-14000/">Ethereum</a> for the blockchain with the most active users.</p>

These platforms have not only matched but exceeded the capabilities of the initial explorer, offering deeper insights and a more engaging user experience to the community.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="Celebrating_achievements_and_Sui_ecosystem_expansion">Celebrating achievements and Sui ecosystem expansion</span></h2><p>The inception of Sui’s blockchain explorers was driven by the necessity to provide early builders with real-time dashboards for network activities. These tools were crucial in monitoring transaction volumes, active accounts, and a plethora of other vital metrics. Sui’s unique object-oriented data model introduced innovative features in explorer design, such as the object display standard and the visualization of <a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sui-price-prediction/">Sui</a> Move features, enhancing the overall utility and user experience of these platforms.</p><p>With the Mainnet launch on May 3, 2023, the Sui ecosystem witnessed a surge in activity, with projects migrating from Testnet and new initiatives taking off. Ecosystem explorers like Suiscan and SuiVision, which predated the Mainnet launch, have been instrumental in the phase, introducing features that provided the community with deeper network insights than what the Mysten-run explorer could offer. Their ability to track <a data-autolink-id="123" target="_self" href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/defi/">DeFi</a> apps and <a data-autolink-id="125" target="_self" href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/nft/">NFT</a> collections, coupled with offering a broader range of data visualization options, has significantly contributed to the ecosystem’s growth.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="The_evolution_of_user_interfaces_and_data_accessibility">The evolution of user interfaces and data accessibility</span></h2><p>One of the standout aspects of the Sui explorer ecosystem is the diversity in user interfaces and site architectures. The variety ensures that different user preferences and needs are catered to, allowing for a more personalized and efficient navigation experience. The distinct navigation schemes and architectural designs of SuiVision and Suiscan highlight the ecosystem’s commitment to accessibility and user-centric development.</p><p>The retirement of the Mysten-operated Sui Explorer is a testament to the robustness and maturity of the Sui ecosystem. The move is not an end but a transition, a passing of the baton to the ecosystem builders who have demonstrated exceptional dedication and innovation. Mysten Labs’ decision to focus on supporting these ecosystem explorers reflects confidence in the community’s ability to sustain and enhance the network’s visibility and accessibility.</p><p>As the Sui ecosystem continues to evolve, the upcoming Basecamp event in April 2024 promises to be a landmark occasion, showcasing new initiatives and celebrating the achievements of the community. The event, along with ongoing developments throughout the year, will undoubtedly pave the way for further innovations and the continued expansion of the Sui ecosystem.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2><p>The retirement of the Mysten-operated Sui Explorer marks a significant milestone in the Sui ecosystem’s journey towards decentralization and innovation. By embracing the contributions of ecosystem explorers like SuiVision and Suiscan, Sui is setting a precedent for community-driven development and collaboration. As the ecosystem looks forward to new chapters and achievements, the focus remains on building a network that enhances digital asset ownership and security, ultimately enriching our online lives.</p>

<div><div class="post-content relative" data-v-25cc9d4a><p>The United States Department of Justice has slapped tech giant Apple with an extensive antitrust lawsuit claiming its app market rules and “monopoly" illegally throttled competition and suffocated innovation.</p><p>The March 21 <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68362334/1/united-states-v-apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">complaint</a> in a New Jersey federal court — supported by 16 state attorney generals — alleged Apple has a monopoly in the smartphone market that it has used to “‘force’ developers to use its payment system to lock in both developers and users on its platform.”</p><p>Apple’s App Store guidelines and developer agreements impose “a series of shapeshifting rules and restrictions” that allow the company to take “higher fees, thwart innovation, offer a less secure or degraded user experience, and throttle competitive alternatives,” the DOJ alleged.</p><p>The issue could be the reason that many crypto-based apps today offer only limited functionality on iOS devices. </p><blockquote>“Apple’s anticompetitive conduct not only limits competition in the smartphone market, but also reverberates through the industries that are affected by these restrictions, including financial services.”</blockquote><p>Apple policies have ousted alternative payment systems “in ways that were anticompetitive and exclusionary,” the DOJ said.</p><p>It also highlighted the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-apple-rules-double-down-on-30-nft-tax-and-geo-limits-exchanges">30% Apple tax</a> — a fee the company charges for apps and in-app payments whose “content, product, or service it did not create.”</p><p>The fee and Apple payment systems are fiat-compatible only and have walled off the use of crypto in apps or made it <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/grotesquely-overpriced-apple-s-app-store-wants-30-cut-on-nft-sales">not economically viable</a> for a crypto-based app to offer in-app purchases.</p><p>Apple offers ”certain enterprise and public sector customers” the ability to offer their own apps through custom app stores, but iPhone users and developers are restricted from such alternative app stores as they would compete with the Big Tech player’s fees, the DOJ said.</p><blockquote>“Apple often enforces its App Store rules arbitrarily. And it frequently uses App Store rules and restrictions to penalize and restrict developers that take advantage of technologies that threaten to disrupt, disintermediate, compete with, or erode Apple’s monopoly power.”</blockquote><p>Some nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces, such as OpenSea, have disabled functionality on their iOS apps as NFT sales <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/absorb-for-adoption-how-infamous-30-apple-cut-affects-ios-nft-apps">are subject</a> to the 30% fee.</p><p>The Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>)-friendly social app Damus also had to kill a BTC tipping feature after <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/apple-to-delist-nostr-based-damus-app-for-bitcoin-tip-feature">Apple delisted its app</a> because it wasn’t routed through its in-app payments function, where it takes a cut.</p><p>Web apps — those based online, available through a web browser and outside the App Store — are still under Apple’s control as the firm requires all iOS web browsers to use its WebKit browser engine.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/apple-poised-metaverse-mainstream-dominate-vision-pro-augmented-reality-market"><strong><em>Apple is poised to bring metaverse mainstream and dominate the market</em></strong></a></p><p>The DOJ also alleged Apple had denied access to competing digital wallets that would provide a “wide variety of enhanced features” and barred developers from providing their own payment services to their customers.</p><p>An Apple spokesperson told Cointelegraph the DOJ’s complaint was “wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.”</p><p>Apple claimed the lawsuit “set a dangerous precedent” as it could give the government the power to “take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”</p><p>In the European Union, the Digital Markets Act <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/apple-to-allow-third-party-app-stores-in-windfall-for-nfts-and-crypto">has forced Apple</a> to offer alternative browser engines, payment functions and app stores, although the company still has an approval process in place as it <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claims</a> the new options threaten user privacy and security.</p><p>Apple (AAPL) shares fell 4% on the day to around $171 and have stayed flat in after-hours trading, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according</a> to Google Finance.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-03/7cb2172f-dfc1-4e86-a1a1-2ad4b68c6fbd.png"><figcaption><em>Apple shares on March 21 fell after the DOJ lodged its lawsuit.

<li><strong>Crypto hardware wallet firm Trezor recently fell victim to a cyber attack.</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Trezor hack resulted in the compromise of its official social media platform X account.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Trezor previously fell victim to a security breach earlier this year.</strong></li>
</ul><p>The fast-growing nature of the crypto industry has been accompanied by evolving cyber threats, which are marked by malicious actors who often seek to exploit weaknesses in projects and entities through various <a href="https://dailycoin.com/12-biggest-hacks-in-crypto-exchange-history/" data-wpel-link="internal">hacks</a> and <a href="https://dailycoin.com/tag/crypto-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">scam</a> methods.</p><p>Despite the bolstering of security measures across the industry, these threat actors continue to strike, and the latest to once again feel their burn is <a href="https://dailycoin.com/top-12-crypto-wallets-to-integrate-with-decentralized-apps/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto hardware wallet</a> firm Trezor.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unraveling-the-trezor-hack">Unraveling the Trezor Hack</h2><p>In the early hours of Wednesday, March 20, crypto sleuth Zach XBT <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1770225097552363795" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external">raised an alert</a> of a security breach on the official <a href="https://dailycoin.com/?s=trezor" data-wpel-link="internal">Trezor</a> X account.</p><p>The hack, resulting from unauthorized access by a third party, was first detected when several suspicious token promotion posts were made to the account.</p><p>Touting a phony “$TRZR” token presale, the hacker demanded users to send SOL to a compromised wallet address. The attacker also included links that direct users to malicious wallet drainers, disguised as “bonus airdrops” for Trezor’s supporters.</p><p>The Trezor hack resulted in the loss of $8,100, <a href="https://x.com/i_am_wilf/status/1770411148271128913?s=46&amp;t=D4b98cqP9MGQO1agJ8PMRw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external">raising eyebrows</a> across the industry about the questionable nature of Trezor’s security standards.

<li><strong>Prior to the recent Trezor hack, the wallet firm suffered a data breach in January, which resulted in the compromise of sensitive user data such as usernames and email addresses.</strong></li>

<p>AMBCrypto’s on-chain analysis revealed that <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/shiba-inu-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Shiba Inu [SHIB]</a> whales were selling some of their holdings while the retail cohort did the opposite.

<p>This conflicting position suggests that whales and the retail cohort shared a different sentiment about the price action. At press time, Shiba Inu’s price was $0.000025. This value was a 22.67% decrease in the last seven days.</p>
<p>Though the broader market experienced a correction, SHIB’s <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/shiba-inu-shib-price-prediction-17-march/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">decline</a> could also be connected to the way whales booked profits, especially as the value doubled in the last 30 days. But what is next for SHIB’s price?</p>
<h4><strong>The downturn is not forever</strong></h4>
<p>According to the 4-hour SHIB/USD chart, bears resisted the attempt at flipping $0.000030 on the 18th of March. However, bulls seem to be doing well in defending the $0.000024 local support.</p>
<p>Should bears fail to arrest this bullish resolve, then SHIB might rebound off the trough. Conversely, a close below $0.00024 could lead the price down to $0.000020.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) neared the oversold region. This suggests that Shiba Inu remained in a bearish control and the corrective phase might not be over.</p>
<p>Despite the possibility of a further downtrend, the Fibonacci extension showed the SHIB’s potential recovery could be better.  In a highly bullish scenario, the price of SHIB might rally as high as $0.000052. From the current lows, this would indicate a 51.9% rally.</p>

<p>AMBCrypto also looked at Shiba Inu’s on-chain volume. As of this writing, the volume was 1.75 billion— a significant decline from what it was on the 6th of March when the price skyrocketed.</p>
<p>However, the declining volume might not be a bad omen for SHIB. Historically, rising. volume on rising price <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/is-shiba-inu-offering-you-the-chance-to-buy-at-a-discount/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">fuel further jumps</a>. But at the same time, a falling volume while the price decreases could trigger an increase. This is because the downtrend might become weak in the process.</p>

<p>In terms of sentiment, on-chain data showed that participants were <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/BaWpNTsl__sCl" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">not yet convinced</a> that SHIB would exit its bearish phase. At press time, the Weighted Sentiment was -0.0221. But this could also signal that it was time to accumulate the token.</p>
<p>Most times, a highly positive sentiment indicates a local top. However, when the sentiment is negative, buying opportunities appear, and that could be the case with SHIB.</p>

<p><a href="https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/filecoin-price-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Filecoin [FIL]</a>, like the broader altcoin market, bled profusely over the past week.</p>
<p>The token, which represents the decentralized storage network, shed 26% of its value in the last seven days, becoming one of the biggest losers in the market, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">CoinMarketCap</a>. FIL was exchanging hands at $8.19 at press time.</p>
<p>The price slump resulted in increased pessimism about the coin, as per AMBCrypto’s examination of Santiment’s weighted sentiment indicator.</p>

<p>While not the ideal situation for FIL traders, it did provide an opportunity for accumulation.</p>
<h4><strong>Will you still buy Filecoin?</strong></h4>
<p>Prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez took to social platform X to highlight a buy signal flashed by FIL’s TD Sequential indicator. “<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">If </span><span class="r-18u37iz">FIL</span><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"> can close above the 50-day EMA, we could see a one to four daily candlesticks upswing,” Martinez predicted.</span></p>
<p>AMBCrypto glanced through some of FIL’s other key technical indicators to make a sense of the above argument.</p>
<p>On a daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continued to move below the neutral 50 level. Typically, the 40-50 level acts as a good support level during an uptrend, raising hopes of an upward breakout in the days ahead. A dip below 40 however, could nullify this narrative and strengthen the bears.</p>
<p>The On Balance Volume (OBV) largely mimicked the price trend. In the last few days, the trend of lower peaks and lower troughs was snapped, giving hopes of a breakout to the north.</p>

<h4><strong>Traders reduce long exposure</strong></h4>
<p>Meanwhile, FIL’s derivatives market presented an interesting picture. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Coinglass’ data, the funding rate was positive, implying a broader bullish statement.</p>
<p>However, the declining trend in the last few weeks suggested increasing dominance of short positions, and therefore expectation of bearish conditions in the days ahead.</p>
