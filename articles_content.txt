21Shares Core Ethereum ETF Now Operates Independently as Ark Invest Withdraws - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Ark Investment Management has withdrawn from launching a spot-Ether ETF in partnership with 21Shares, with the fund’s name changed to 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF.



Despite this, 21Shares submitted a revised application for its Ethereum spot ETF and continued collaboration with Ark on Bitcoin ETFs.




Ark Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, has decided to step back from the competition to launch a spot-Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) in collaboration with 21Shares.



21Shares Core Ethereum ETF Now Operates Independently as Ark Invest Withdraws 4



21Shares Rebrands ETF as 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF Amid Collaboration Shift



The amended prospectus document filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late Friday disclosed the removal of Ark‘s name from the application, with the fund now renamed as the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF.



Following this development, 21Shares has submitted a revised application for 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. Moreover, ARK Invest will no longer be a partner for this ETF. However, a spokesperson for 21Shares assured that the company will maintain its collaboration with ARK Invest on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF launched in January and other existing futures products.



The decision by Ark comes after the successful launch earlier this year of spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, with the $3.2 billion ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ticker ARKB) ranking fourth in assets. Despite this withdrawal from the Ethereum ETF race, Ark remains dedicated to its Bitcoin ETF endeavor.




SEC Approval Advances Ethereum ETFs, Trading Pending



The recent unexpected approval by the SEC of 19b-4 filings made by major exchanges to list spot-Ether ETFs has prompted issuers to file revised S-1 statements. This development signifies increased access to crypto for US investors, eliciting enthusiasm from 21Shares.



The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of 19b-4 forms for eight Ethereum ETFs marks a significant step forward. However, issuers are still awaiting the effectiveness of their S-1 statements before trading can commence.

LayerZero airdrop: the amusing story of the naive sybil “Ruslan”

As we get closer and closer to the highlight of the LayerZero airdrop, with rewards in the form of the ZRO crypto expected to arrive in June, we share this nice story featuring a Web3 user with the nickname “Ruslan”
Ruslan is a farmers who uses hundreds of wallet in his hunting activities to increase the potential allocation on projects that are about to release an airdrop, just like LayerZero.
Despite on paper seeming like a prepared and highly skilled user, he made a serious mistake that could really cost him dearly. What is it about?
Let’s find out together in this article.


LayerZero and the hunt for sybil before the airdrop: caught the user “Ruslan”
The story of “Ruslan” begins when the anonymous user, in order to farm the best LayerZero airdrop and obtain the largest possible allocation of ZRO tokens, decides to use hundreds of different addresses to execute various types of on-chain transactions. 
It starts in 2023 to farm the airdrop with each of these addresses using the bridge of Stargate and other dapps that are based on the omnichain technology of LayerZero.
Despite the high number of entities connected to each other (having exchanged funds with each other to finance the interactions), Ruslan still finds an idea to manage to evade the anti-sybil checks and make each address appear as standalone.
Maybe under some advice from another user X, decides to associate an ENS domain with every address he had interacted with to position himself for the LayerZero airdrop, convinced that the on-chain analysis systems would identify his wallets as authentic.
In fact, sybil addresses are usually characterized by a low quality in the history of tx, with few low-value transactions, often advanced by bots and managed by automated scripts: an ENS domain can therefore increase the quality of its portfolio by adding a cryptographic component usually excluded from the economic operations of bot farming.
To carry forward this hedging strategy, Ruslan also spends a considerable amount, exceeding 3000 dollars between registration costs at Ethereum Name Service and Ethereum blockchain commission costs, in addition to obviously all the fees paid for farming.
The problem is that Ruslan comes up with the brilliant idea of sequentially naming all the domains he bought, going in order as follows: ruslan002.eth, ruslan003.eth, ruslan004.eth, ruslan005.eth, ruslan006.eth, ruslan007.eth, ruslan008.eth, etc.
One forgets that by sequentially identifying its addresses, these could be considered as connected to each other, being in fact linked by a fairly obvious logical thread that sees a progressive on-chain identifying name.
After the LayerZero team and its CEO Bryan Pellegrino kicked off the “sybil bounty” phase, inviting the crypto community to report improper behavior by other users, it didn’t take long before Ruslan was identified and marked under the sybil list on Github.
Most likely Ruslan and his addresses will not receive any reward from the LayerZero airdrop, and indeed, a portion equal to 10% of the allocation that would have been due to him will go to the address 0xc37395f3aca821f1f85D897Ee541BCdB4C5B7c7E, owned by the user who reported him with a detailed report.

Observing more closely the behaviors of Ruslan, we realize how the user is not exactly a newcomer in the crypto world.
Recently, he managed to become eligible for various airdrops such as AltLayer, Eigenlayer, Omni and Renzo, bringing home decent earnings.
The poor Ruslan simply made a serious distraction error, or he was excessively superficial in thinking that the insiders at LayerZero would never consider the progressive ENS domains.

In the blink of an eye, the entire community turned Ruslan into a viral meme, which spread across all the X boards of the airdrop farmers.
There are even those who have come to his defense, pointing out to Bryan Pellegrino of LayerZero that the addresses in question could belong to a long list of family members of the reported user and that it is not fair to identify them as sybil a priori.

In the meantime, Ruslan has put his ENS domains up for sale at 5 ETH each, hoping that in the midst of this extravagant and at the same time dramatic story, some crazy degen will want to purchase a piece of cryptographic collection that will remain forever in the history of crypto airdrops.

The “Sybil Bounty” phase ends: check if your address has been reported
Before excessively making fun of the poor user Ruslan, who will be despairing for having wasted time and money farming an airdrop that will see him ineligible,  it would be wise to check if our addresses have also been flagged by the so-called  “Sybil Hunters” during the “Sybil Bounty” phase that has just concluded.
The LayerZero team has indeed announced the end of this controversial initiative that saw members of the crypto community pitted against each other, searching for on-chain data that could identify others’ addresses as the result of sybil activities, in exchange for a bounty equal to 10% of the reported address’s allocation.
We can immediately check if the wallets with which we farmed the LayerZero airdrop have been included in the list of some “snitch”: first, click on this link, and then paste our addresses one by one into the search bar to see if they appear under any report. 

If your address does not appear in any search, you are safe. For safety, you can also individually check the internal links of each report (if there is an external link).
If, on the other hand, you have been reported in some report, you might not be eligible like Ruslan. Considering the high presence of reports, sometimes carried out in “spam” mode, we should wait for the official confirmation from the LayerZero team that will have to examine the documents. 
Therefore, even if our address is present in a sybil list, there is the possibility of receiving ZRO tokens as a reward for the airdrop.

Some advice to avoid appearing sybil in the upcoming airdrops
With the new crypto projects releasing airdrops, distributions are becoming increasingly selective, and with the anti sybil checks becoming more stringent, being eligible with your own addresses is becoming really complex.
Let’s see some advice on how not to fall under the identification of sybil, and how to avoid trivial mistakes like the one made by Ruslan, which could jeopardize our earnings from airdrop farming.
First of all, if you are operating with more than 4-5 addresses, it is CRUCIAL not to mix your funds between one entity and another by making direct asset transfers: rather, if you need to move funds, use multiple CEX as bridges for the exchange (one CEX associated with each address).
For a farmer, it is therefore necessary to be registered on as many exchanges as possible or to have connections with different addresses of the same CEX (e.g. accounts of relatives and friends on Binance).
NEVER use a single CEX to distribute funds to multiple wallets.

It is extremely important to generate quality tx, such as executing at least 5 transactions and holding at least 0.005 ETH on the Ethereum Mainnet, and being active on-chain for at least 1 year (do not use newly created addresses).
Perform the verification at Gitcoin Passport, or associate a domain ENS to your domain but do not do like Ruslan: choose names that are not connected to each other and not sequential.
Pay attention to the timing of your operations as well: if you perform the same type of transaction at the same time or in similar time frames, you risk being caught as a sybil. Move individually, address by address, without making the same tx in a group, and preferably without automated scripts.

Other small tips to avoid appearing sybil are:
download a multisignature wallet on Safe and execute at least 5 tx;
bridge your funds across multiple chains and leave some fraction of ETH on each network;
avoid farming with less than 500-1000 dollars per address and avoid swaps with micro volumes;
act as a liquidity provider (LP) if the project we are farming allows it;
Behave like a real user!!! Avoid appearing in any way as a bot.

Spot Ether ETF Fee Disclosure, A Strategic Move By Frankl...


                                Spot Ether ETF Fee Announcement Triggers Rivalry In The Crypto Market                                The financial environment shifted when Franklin Templeton started a fee war by declaring the fees for its spot Ethereum ETF. This aggressive move was through an Amended S-1 application which is a huge step in the world of competing Cryptocurrency ETFs.Fee Annunciation by Franklin TempletonOn 31st May, American multinational investment firm Franklin Templeton submitted an S-1 amendment to its proposed spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This ETF will mimic the price movement of Ethereum, an emerging cryptocurrency that is currently priced at around $3,780. The firm disclosed that the annual sponsor fee for their ETF would be 0.19% of the fund's net asset value, arising daily. This announcement was first broken by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas who revealed Franklin Templeton’s intention to aim for market dominance in the rising field of cryptocurrency ETFs.Balchunas highlighted that this fee structure is similar to that of Franklin's spot Bitcoin ETF, revealing that this rate is likely to be a permanent fixture rather than a temporary introductory offer. The importance of this move can be seen in the fact that there are usually people who are interested in investing in ETFs that are cheap in terms of fees.Why There is a Fee War of Spot Ether ETF?It is not a new phenomenon to talk about fee war in the ETF market.  The strategic moves and changes are important to attract investors in the ETF market. Lower fees can significantly increase the appeal of an ETF since fees have a direct effect on the net returns. When Franklin Templeton announced its fees, it created pressure on other firms like VanEck, Invesco, and Galaxy which had also filed S-1 applications but had not yet disclosed their fee structures.In the past, fee wars were seen in the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs at the beginning of the year. Firms revised the S-1 filings numerous times to alter fees, and some even decided to forego fees for a particular period to get ahead of competitors. For example, Bitwise did not charge any fees on its spot Bitcoin ETF for the first half a year of trading and the first $1 billion of assets. This is a competitive pricing strategy that is used to attract early investors and also to gain a big market share.Impact of Fee Announcement on the Crypto MarketThe recent announcement of Franklin Templeton leaves a deep impact on the cryptocurrency market. It has created a template that other ETF providers will need to take into account, which may result in a series of fee cuts or pricing wars. Such fee disclosures can also improve investors’ confidence as they ensure transparency and clarity in the cost structures. Furthermore, this fee war could also enable the approval and listing of other spot Ether ETFs as firms strive to complete their products for investment. Balchunas even predicted that there could be a possibility that spot Ether ETF could be launched before the end of June this year. This could lead to more people investing in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies which would improve the values of these markets and the overall liquidity.ConclusionCoinGabbar concluded that Franklin Templeton’s spot Ethereum ETF fee disclosure for its ETF has triggered a fee war in the ETF market similar to the Bitcoin ETF fee changes.  The strategy of setting an annual fee of 0.19%, Franklin Templeton not only manages to place itself in a favorable position but also puts pressure on other providers that offer similar services. This may be expected to help investors in the long run by cutting costs and increasing the availability of information and in the short term, could lead to the creation of more spot Ether ETFs. Thus, Franklin Templeton’s action will be a big step forward in the development of this segment. Also Read: Spot Ether ETF Approval Brings A New Era In Crypto Industry

Trump Meow (TRUMPMEO) Coin Will Exploede 13,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu, and Bonk Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Trump Meow (TRUMPMEO) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Trump Meow (TRUMPMEO), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 13,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




TRUMPMEO will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Trump Meow.



Currently, Trump Meow can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy TRUMPMEO on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Meow by entering its contract address – 5qRmBHnwHKdmbqWz6mPajjSHMgg4Yy1enxhjRJSMtnyF – in the receiving field.




TRUMPMEO currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

The Fall of CZ: Binance Founder Begins Prison Sentence


							

Binance founder CZ has reported to a federal prison in California to begin a four-month sentence.



CZ’s sentencing is part of a plea deal with U.S. authorities regarding AML charges.



Founder of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence for fraud.




Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the billionaire founder of Binance, has begun a four-month prison sentence at a low-security federal facility in Lompoc, California. Latham & Watkins, Zhao’s defense team, confirmed the former crypto executive is now in custody.



In April, Zhao was sentenced after pleading guilty to charges related to enabling money laundering through his cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.



The sentence is less than the three years federal prosecutors initially sought. Zhao’s defense had requested five months of probation, while sentencing guidelines suggested 12 to 18 months in prison.



Before U.S. District Judge Richard Jones handed down the sentence, Zhao expressed remorse. “I’m sorry,” he stated, acknowledging his failure to implement adequate anti-money laundering measures at Binance. “I believe the first step of taking responsibility is fully recognizing the mistakes,” Zhao added.



In November 2023, Zhao reached a plea deal with the U.S. government, concluding a multiyear investigation into Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. As part of the settlement, Zhao resigned as CEO of the company.



 
 




Zhao’s crimes included the willful omission of an effective AML program, as required by the Bank Secrecy Act, and allowing Binance to facilitate transactions involving illicit funds, including transactions between U.S. residents and individuals in sanctioned jurisdictions.



As a result of Zhao’s actions, the U.S. has imposed $4.3 billion in fines and forfeiture against Binance, with Zhao agreeing to pay $50 million personally. Notably, Zhao’s imprisonment coincides with the crypto industry’s ongoing challenges from another prominent criminal case.



Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the bankrupt FTX exchange, is currently serving a 25-year sentence for his role in a fraud conspiracy that caused the collapse of FTX and its affiliated hedge fund, Alameda Research. Unlike Zhao, Bankman-Fried did not enter a plea deal, and his conviction followed the cooperation of other executives from his company with prosecutors.

Ethereum ETF Issuers Enter Race For Sponsor Fees With Franklin ETF Charges 0.19% - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Major Ethereum ETF issuers have filed updated S-1 forms with the SEC for Ethereum ETF applications.



Franklin Templeton leads the competition by announcing a competitive 0.19% sponsor fee for its Ethereum ETF.



Despite regulatory hurdles and amendments by Ethereum ETF issuers, industry experts predict a June-end launch for spot Ethereum ETFs.




Several major investment firms, including Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Bitwise, and Fidelity, have advanced their Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) aspirations, filing updated S-1 forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Ethereum ETF Issuers Enter Race For Sponsor Fees With Franklin ETF Charges 0.19% 4



Ethereum ETF Issuers Enter Race For Sponsor Fees



Franklin Templeton, in a strategic move to entice investors, has initiated a potential fee war by announcing a competitive 0.19% sponsor fee for its spot Ethereum ETF, marking the lowest among its competitors. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, highlighted the significance of this move, dubbing it “the opening shot in the ETH ETF fee war.”



While other Ethereum ETF issuers such as VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Bitwise, and Fidelity filed edited S-1 applications simultaneously, none have disclosed their sponsor fees. Additionally, 21Shares amended its S-1 form, removing Ark’s name and rebranding the fund to 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF.



Spot Ethereum ETF Launch Anticipated Despite Regulatory Hurdles



These developments follow the SEC’s approval of April 19 filings on May 23, bringing spot Ethereum ETFs closer to reality, with industry experts anticipating a launch by the end of June.




BlackRock and Grayscale have also made notable amendments to their filings. However, despite meeting the SEC’s end-of-month deadline, prospective Ethereum ETF issuers may need to address regulatory comments, potentially delaying the commencement of trading for these financial products.



The race to launch spot Ethereum ETFs mirrors the successful introduction of similar products for Bitcoin, with issuers striving to provide investors with accessible avenues to engage with Ethereum’s price movements. Bitwise, for instance, has opted to waive all fees on its spot Bitcoin ETF for the initial six months of trading and up to the first $1 billion in assets.

The 10 Altcoins Developers Focused on the Most in the Last Month - Here's the List - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment, in its latest data, announced the altcoins that developers focused on the most in the last 30 days.
The data in question was obtained based on changes made by developers in the open source codes of cryptocurrency projects on Github.


Here are the 10 altcoins that developers focus on the most and their developer scores:

Hedera (HBAR) – 552
Optimism (OP) – 543
Cardano (ADA) – 539
Chainlink (LINK) – 442
Starknet (STRK) – 384
Status (SNT) – 355
Internet Computer (ICP) – 336
Cosmos (ATOM) – 291
Polkadot (DOT) – 274
Kusama (KSM) – 274


It is particularly noteworthy that Ethereum is not included in the list. Despite this, layer-2 networks established to scale Ethereum are frequently included in the list. It is interesting that Starknet (STRK), which we are not accustomed to being included in previous developer lists, also entered the May developer list.





On the other hand, Github pages of cryptocurrency projects are also the subject of controversy, with some spammy code changes to ensure high developer activity. However, Santiment states that it has implemented a special method to filter out these spam developer activities.

Shiba Inu dumped: 4 trillion tokens flood exchanges - Will SHIB sink? - AMBCrypto



Shiba Inu’s price dropped by 2.5% in the last 24 hours.
Most metrics and indicators looked bearish on SHIB.

Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] price volatility remained high last week as its value witnessed both major northward and southward movements. This might have sparked fear among investors, which resulted in a rise in selling pressure. 
Does this mean SHIB is poised for a price correction soon? 
A look at Shiba Inu’s sell-off
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that SHIB’s price action remained bullish until the 29th of May as its price touched $0.000029. 
However, the memecoin couldn’t sustain the rally and started to drop again. SHIB was down by 2.5% in the last 24 hours and, at press time, was trading at $0.00002536 with a market capitalization of over $14.9 billion. 
In the meantime, investors made up their minds to sell the memecoin. 
Ali, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development. As per the tweet, over 4 trillion SHIB have been sent to crypto exchanges in the last two weeks, worth around $103 million. 
To double check whether selling pressure was high on Shiba Inu, AMBCrypto analyzed its on-chain metrics. As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, SHIB’s exchange outflow spiked substantially last week. 
There was also a major rise in its supply on exchanges and a drop in its supply outside of exchanges. 
These metrics clearly suggested that investors were actually swelling. In fact, whales also followed a similar trend and sold SHIB. This was evident from the slight drop in its supply held by top addresses over the last seven days.
Source: Santiment
Will SHIB’s price drop?
Since high selling pressure often results in price drops, AMBCrypto then analyzed SHIB’s state to see whether that would be the case this time around.
An analysis of Glassnode’s data revealed that after a drop, SHIB’s NVT ratio started to increase again. A rise in the metric means that an asset is overvalued, indicating that the chances of a price decline are high. 
Source: Glassnode
A few of the technical indicators also looked pretty bearish on the memecoin. For instance, its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a downtick. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also followed a similar trend. Both of these indicators hinted at a price drop. If that happens, then investors might witness SHIB drop to its support level of $0.000020 in the coming days.

It was interesting to note that while SHIB’s value dropped, its ecosystem’s token, Bone ShibaSwap [BONE] appeared stable.
According to CoinMarketCap, BONE’s price increased by more than 1% in the last 24 hours. At press time, it was trading at $0.6595.

Police Advisory Group Urges Hong Kong to Combat Web3 Misconceptions


							

An advisory group spots stigmatization as a challenge in promoting Web3 in Hong Kong.



The advisory group comprises 12 leaders from the technology sector.



The group recommends the timely creation of appropriate and effective regulatory systems.




Hong Kong’s “Technology Crime Police Advisory Group” identifies stigmatization as a key challenge in fostering Web3 growth in the region. The group asserts that inaccurate labeling of web3 concepts like blockchain and cryptocurrency creates mix-ups about their role in both legitimate and illicit activities.



Established by Hong Kong police in December 2022, the advisory group consists of 12 technology sector leaders. Their mission is to inform the police about the latest information technology developments, providing early insights into the rapidly changing tech landscape.



In March, the group convened its fifth meeting to discuss web3 development trends, focusing on the technology and its associated risks. The advisory group emphasized Hong Kong’s active involvement in promoting web3 and blockchain technology.



According to the group, Hong Kong’s web3 engagement extends beyond the virtual asset market, encompassing sectors like gaming, finance, art, culture, and historical preservation. However, the group expressed concern over the rise in virtual currency-related fraud.









Following the meeting, the advisory group recommended the development of appropriate and effective regulatory frameworks to proactively identify and mitigate risks in the evolving sector. The group noted that such measures would limit opportunities for criminals to exploit blockchain technology or use the virtual asset market for money laundering.



On the flip side, the advisory group believes that a well-regulated industry would allow legitimate businesses to thrive while maintaining compliance. It also anticipates that such an environment would restore public and corporate confidence in web3-related concepts, laying the groundwork for the sector’s growth in Hong Kong.

Robinhood Approaches Settlement with Investors Over 2021 Meme Stock Trading Halt



                    

Robinhood, the popular trading platform, is finalizing a settlement with investors who sued the company for halting the trading of certain meme stocks in 2021, including GameStop. 



According to a May 28 filing in a Miami federal court, Robinhood’s lawyers stated that the settlement with the group of investors is nearly complete and is expected to be finalized and dismissed within the next two weeks.




The filing did not provide details of the settlement, and neither Robinhood, its counsel, nor the investors’ counsel responded to requests for comment.



The investors, led by Plaintiff Blue Laine-Beveridge, accused Robinhood of “unlawfully manipulating market prices” and causing “tens of billions of dollars of investors’ equity” losses by selectively restricting the stocks its users could buy between January 28 and February 4, 2021. 



The affected stocks included GameStop, AMC, Bed Bath & Beyond, BlackBerry, Nokia, trivago, Koss, Express Inc., and Tootsie Roll.




This lawsuit focused on Robinhood’s alleged violations of securities law and is part of a broader legal action in multiple U.S. jurisdictions regarding the company’s handling of meme stocks.



The settlement follows United States District Judge Cecilia Altonaga’s denial of the investors’ request to file a new motion for class certification on April 19. 



A similar request had been denied in November of the previous year.

Meme stocks, such as GameStop and AMC, are so named because retail investors often trade them based on social media hype. 



GameStop’s stock surged dramatically in January 2021 due to a “short squeeze,” causing significant losses for hedge funds and short sellers while some retail traders made substantial gains.



The surge in GameStop’s stock price was largely credited to Keith Gill, known as “Roaring Kitty,” who recently returned to social media platform X in May after a nearly three-year hiatus. 



His return and cryptic posts excited traders, pushing GME’s stock to close at $48.75 on May 14, its highest since late 2021, according to Google Finance.



However, GameStop’s stock has since dropped significantly, closing down nearly 11% on May 29 at $21.24, with an additional 2% decline in after-hours trading to $20.78.

SAB 121: Biden Intervenes, Vetoes Congressional SEC Guidance Resolution


							

Joe Biden has vetoed the Congressional decision on SAB 121.



According to Biden, SAB 121 would constrain the SEC from addressing future issues.



SAB 121 passed both chambers of Congress with an easy majority.




U.S. President Joe Biden vetoed a joint resolution by Congress that would have repealed the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121). Announcing his veto on Friday, Biden said he would not support any “measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors.”



In his statement, Biden described SAB 121 as a Republican-led resolution that would undermine the SEC’s ability to set necessary guardrails and address future issues. He noted that reversing the SEC staff’s considered judgment risks weakening the SEC’s broader authority regarding accounting practices.



Biden previously expressed his intention to work with Congress on legislation addressing the digital asset market. He stated that “appropriate guardrails that protect consumers and investors are necessary.”



Meanwhile, some banking groups and certain Congress members sent letters to the President urging him to sign the resolution to overturn SAB 121 a few hours before he vetoed it. A section of the letter claimed that the guidance, as noted by the Government Accountability Office, blocks regulated banking groups from offering custody services.









Furthermore, in their letter, the lawmakers urged the administration to at least work with the SEC to rescind the guidance if the President decided to go ahead with his earlier promise of vetoing the resolution.



It is worth noting that SAB-121 passed both chambers of Congress with an easy majority. According to Senator Ron Wyden of Biden’s Democratic party, the guidance creates a different standard for crypto than other assets in the financial sector.

What is PEPE?PEPE, an Ethereum-based meme coin launched in April 2023, has quickly made a significant impact despite the anonymity of its creators. PEPE began trading on April 15, 2023, at a price near $0.00000000. Within just two weeks of its launch, PEPE entered the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, currently ranking at number 70.Source: IntoTheBlockSince its inception, PEPE's market capitalization surpassed $1 billion in just 20 days, reflecting a staggering 7,000% surge in value within 17 days. This extraordinary rise has made a notable mark in the crypto meme coin industry.The risk-based token has recently secured its top place as the most profitable meme coin. Whether the current rally is going to end in a major crush remains unknown. However, several indicators hint at a number of upcoming events for PEPE in June.PEPE price historyThe PEPE coin employs a deflationary mechanism, burning a small percentage of tokens with each transaction to create scarcity and potentially increase the remaining tokens' value over time.Source: IntoTheBlockIt uses a redistribution system where a portion of every transaction is shared among existing token holders, promoting user engagement and long-term investment.The price of PEPE has experienced significant fluctuations in a matter of 24 hours, including surges of over 40% and steep declines. The most notable downturn occurred in January 2024, when the coin lost nearly half of its value.Source: IntoTheBlockHowever, it embarked on a remarkable bull run in March, followed by a correction in March and April, and then gained momentum in May, defying the general crypto market trend.The rally began in late April, gaining traction after PEPE surpassed the daily MA 50 at $0.000073. On May 27, the price reached an all-time high of $0.00001725, marking an impressive 88% increase since the SEC approved the Ether ETF filings on May 20.The frog-themed coin has been good to its holders in the past month. Currently, 91.59% of PEPE addresses, representing 227,990 holders, are in profit. Additionally, 5.32% of addresses, or 13,250 holders, are at breakeven with the current price around $0.0000144 per token.As of late May 2024, the chart shows what seems to be a correction on a monthly scale. Whether the rally continues in June remains the biggest question.PEPE price predictionPepe is now ranked as the 28th cryptocurrency by market cap on CoinGecko and has secured the 20th spot on CoinMarketCap with a current market cap of $6.16 billion as of June 1.Source: IntoTheBlockOver the past month, PEPE has surged by 107%, outperforming the overall market and the average meme coin. This performance has pushed PEPE above its 50, 100 and 200-day EMAs, highlighting its strong bullish trend.If we look at PEPE market value to realized price ratio, we can guess the potential "true" value of PEPE.Source: IntoTheBlockDespite its impressive gains, meme coins, including PEPE, are notoriously volatile. Many analysts predict a likely further price correction. For instance, Ali Martinez has noted bearish signals, pointing out that PEPE's daily RSI has surpassed 70, an overbought level that often precedes price corrections or consolidations. Source: XWhen the average RSI value surpasses 70, this increases the risk of a sell-off. However, it is important to note that the market can remain overbought for extended periods, with prices continuing to rise.According to the RSI heat map, PEPE currently sits at the "strong" level, with a potential "sell" signal. IntoTheBlock data also indicates a bearish sentiment as June approaches.Source: IntoTheBlockAnother important indicator is the historic correlation with the BTC price. As shown in the chart below, PEPE has seen mostly negative correlation with both Bitcoin and Ethereum within a year since its launch.The likelihood of both Ethereum and Bitcoin rallies remain high in June, which poses the question of whether PEPE trajectory will change its course in the next few weeks.In any case, PEPE is regarded as one of the most volatile coins on the market. As a typical high-yield asset, its price is extremely speculative with no fundamentals to watch. With that in mind, the beginning of June is set to be an important time for PEPE's foreseeable future.

SEC Warns Investors About Widespread Crypto Scams


                                Beware - SEC Warns of Rising Crypto Scams Threatening Investors' Funds                                The cryptocurrency boom continues to surge and the excitement around cryptocurrency keeps growing, but so do the scammers trying to take advantage of it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has alerted investors to be extra careful due to the increasing risks from crypto fraud. These scams are becoming more common, and anyone involved in cryptocurrency must stay informed and protect themselves. Whether you're new to crypto or an experienced investor, staying alert against these threats is more important than ever. The SEC's warning highlights the need for care in this rapidly changing and growing landscape.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is warning people about the rising risk of cryptocurrency scams. On Wednesday, the SEC's Office of Investor Education released a notice pointing out five common tricks scammers use to steal money from investors.As digital currencies like Bitcoin have become more popular in recent years, scammers have started to take advantage of the excitement. They are using clever and advanced tricks to fool unaware investors and cheat them out of their money. These cheaters take benefit of the hype and enthusiasm surrounding crypto, making it necessary for investors to stay informed and aware. By being aware of these tactics, people can protect themselves from falling victim to these scams and enjoy the benefits of the growing digital currency market."Scammers use all kinds of tricks to convince investors to hand over their money," the SEC warned in the alert. "And once the money is sent through cryptocurrency, it is extremely difficult to get it back."Here are the five crypto scams that the SEC is warning investors to watch out for:-Social Media TrickeryOne of the most common tricks involves scammers building a connection with potential victims through social media platforms or even accidental text messages. They may pretend to be an old friend making conversation. But they quickly guide the chat towards an "amazing" new crypto investment opportunity that you simply can't pass up.The scammers often create fake websites showing soaring profits and even allowing small withdrawals at first to build trust. But once larger sums are invested, the money disappears into the scammers' digital wallets.AI Hype ScamsAnother strategy involves scammers taking advantage of the current excitement surrounding new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). They pump out buzzwords about AI and machine learning while promising mind-blowing investment returns in fake crypto schemes.Scammers may even use AI itself to create fake marketing materials, including deepfake videos of celebrities promoting the scam.Impersonation FraudCriminals are also finding ways to impersonate authority figures like government agencies and trusted organizations such as the SEC itself. Or they hijack social media accounts to send messages appearing to come from your friends and family members about an "amazing" crypto opportunity."Even if the message seems to come from someone you know, it could be a scam," the SEC advises. "Always verify it really came from them before engaging."Pump-And-Dump SchemesThe SEC also warned about pump-and-dump schemes involving crypto assets like so-called "memecoins" - digital tokens tied to internet memes and pop culture trends like Dogecoin.Scammers hype up a new memecoin through a non-stop marketing push on social media, sometimes even advertising a "pre-sale" of the tokens. The goal is to attract enough investors to boost the price.But it's all an illusion. "Then the promoters or others working with them 'dump,' or sell, before the hype ends, profiting from the pumped-up price," the SEC explained. "Typically, after the promoters sell and take their profit, the price decreases rapidly, and everyone else who bought the tokens loses most of their money."Advance Fee FraudIn this age-old scam, fraudsters demand additional payments from victims for supposedly processing delayed withdrawals or unlocking "frozen" accounts. They may even pretend to offer help recovering money previously lost to crypto scams - but only after paying more fees in advance.The SEC stressed that once money is sent via cryptocurrency, it is extremely difficult to recover due to the anonymous and irreversible nature of blockchain transactions.The agency advised investors to always verify investment claims themselves instead of following uninvited proposals or social media hype. Investing money you can't afford to lose in crypto assets is simply too risky."No crypto account is ever truly 'guaranteed' to be safe from the fraudsters' tricks," the alert stated. "Do your homework on the investment and those making the offer."With billions of dollars lost annually to crypto scams, the SEC aims to educate investors on recognizing the red flags of fraud in the digital asset market. As crypto goes increasingly mainstream, authorities warn that scammers' tactics are only getting more advanced.Also read - Spot Ether ETF In the Limelight As Fee Announced

PayPal Expands Stablecoin to Solana, Introduces Confidential Transfers



                    

PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin, recently launched on Solana, will offer “confidential transfers” as an added feature.



On May 29, PayPal announced the deployment of its dollar-pegged stablecoin on the Solana blockchain, previously available only on Ethereum.




A significant new feature for PYUSD is “confidential transfers.” 



According to a May 29 Solana blog post, this feature will enable merchants to maintain transaction amount confidentiality for their consumers while ensuring regulatory visibility.



Bitcoiner Udi Wertheimer commented, “This sounds a lot like ‘confidential transactions,’ a feature Bitcoin devs have been larping about for almost a decade but never built, and you’re telling me PayPal users will have it first? LOL,” in a post on X on May 29.




Helius Labs CEO Mert Mumtaz remarked, “PayPal didn’t expand to Solana purely for speed,” and added, “Solana also allows confidential transfers and token programmability natively on the L1 itself. Confidential transfers alone are a game-changer.”



Additional programmability on Solana includes “transfer hooks,” allowing specific programs to be called with each token transfer, giving wallets more control over the asset.



Solana’s token extension standard, compliant with the SPL token standard, provides several benefits for PayPal’s stablecoin.

These benefits include reduced development and testing, enterprise-ready “plug-and-play” capabilities, and flexibility.



“TEs [token extensions] are an open standard that allows PYUSD to be integrated and used not only in the PayPal ecosystem but also outside of PayPal with any compatible wallet, exchange, or library,” explained the Solana Foundation.



PYUSD was launched in August 2023 and is primarily backed by U.S. Treasury Reverse Repurchase Agreements, as per issuer Paxos.



Its circulating supply has increased by 50% since the beginning of this year, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $18 million, according to CoinGecko.



Previously, the Paxos Trust Company-issued stablecoin was only available on Ethereum. 



The total circulation is around $400 million, with the current supply on Solana at $5 million, according to Solana’s network explorer.

Solana Killer Sui Has Serious Long-Term Potential, Says Coin Bureau Host Guy Turner - But There’s a Catch - The Daily Hodl


								The host of the Coin Bureau channel, Guy Turner, is offering his price projections for Solana (SOL) competitor Sui (SUI).
Turner tells the 2.48 million subscribers of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel that Sui possesses “serious potential” over the long term.










On the reasons for his bullish thesis, the Coin Bureau host says,
“[Sui] meets the criteria of a crypto that retail could ape into. It has a low price tag, which gives the illusion of large gains. It has a lower market cap than most large-cap cryptos, which means that it takes less money to move its price. And it’s accessible as it’s listed on all major exchanges.”
Sui is trading at $1.03 at time of writing, down by around 53% from the all-time high price of $2.17 reached in late March.
According to Turner, various metrics on Sui such as the total value locked (TVL) and the number of on-chain transactions suggest a short-term bearish future for the Solana rival.
“What is clear is that many of these on-chain metrics suggest demand is not trending in the right direction and this spells trouble for Sui’s price. In Sui’s defense, the same trends can be seen with almost every other crypto. 
As I mentioned a few moments ago, altcoin interest isn’t very high at the moment. This means that in the short term, Sui’s price is likely to continue trending lower, along with its demand-side metrics, even if the supply-side pressures ease.”

US President Joe Biden Vetoes Overturn of SAB 121 - Details


								US President Joe Biden has vetoed congressional resolution H.J. Res.109, which seeks to repeal the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.121, a controversial guidance measure that is widely viewed as anti-crypto. Interestingly, Biden’s action comes amidst rumors that the incumbent government was posturing to gain the favor of crypto voters in the coming US general elections.


SAB 121 Repeal To Jeopardize Investors’ Interest, Biden Says
On March 31, 2022, the SEC introduced SAB 121 which directed all financial institutions that custody cryptocurrencies for clients to consolidate these assets on their balance sheet thus precluding these firms from safeguarding such digital assets. 
SAB 121 received much criticism for its perceived anti-crypto nature. It was also perceived as controversial guidance that allowed the SEC to bypass the normal steps in its rulemaking policy which often included comments from relevant stakeholders on any proposed regulation.
Earlier in May, the US Congress passed a repeal of SAB 121 with the House voting 228-182 and the Senate, 60-38, in favor of overturning the SEC’s staff accounting bulletin. However, Biden has now rejected this resolution citing several reasons.
Firstly, Biden stated that the repeal of the said guidance would “inappropriately” undermine the SEC’s ability in terms of setting the right regulatory systems and resolving future issues. In addition, the US President said the proposed resolution could expose US investors to certain harms and risks. 
Biden said: 
My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors. Appropriate guardrails that protect consumers and investors are necessary to harness the potential benefits and opportunities of crypto-asset innovation.
The President also commented on the lack of clear federal rules and regulations for the crypto space. He said: 
My Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system.

Biden Government Back To ‘Default’ Crypto Policy? 
Amidst the sudden approval of the Ethereum spot ETF among other events, there were speculations the current administration could be softening its stance on the use of digital assets. However, Biden’s recent action is likely to cast doubt on such beliefs.
It is widely expected that US crypto users (valued at 46 million) will be looking to make an impact at the polls in October in order to protect their interests amidst the current hostile regulatory regime.
Whether the Biden government intends to persuade these voters remains largely to be seen, however, former President Donald Trump, Biden’s direct opposition and an ex-Bitcoin critic has begun to advocate for cryptocurrency development in the US.

Dogecoin Sentiment Turns Bearish Again - Here’s What Happened The Last Time | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin was one of the best-performing assets in the crypto market in the past month, outshining blue-chip cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. According to data from CoinGecko, the meme coin’s price rose by more than 26%, while BTC increased in value by approximately 19% in May.
However, the latest on-chain data shows that investors have still not become bullish about DOGE despite its positive price performance. The question here is – how will the unwavering bearish sentiment impact the price of Dogecoin? 
How Will The Bearish Sentiment Benefit Dogecoin Price?
In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez revealed that market sentiment for Dogecoin is currently bearish. This on-chain revelation is based on the weighted sentiment metric, which tracks the overall positive and negative sentiment towards a cryptocurrency.

The weighted sentiment indicator is built on two sub-metrics; namely sentiment balance and social volume. Sentiment balance, as the name suggests, is an indicator that measures the difference between positive and negative sentiment amongst investors at each given time. 
Social volume, on the other hand, tracks the unique number of posts/messages or the total amount of discussion around a particular asset on social media platforms. Essentially, the weighted sentiment metric is a product of both the sentiment balance and social.

Source: Ali_charts/X
According to Martinez, the last time the market sentiment around Dogecoin was this bearish was in early February, preceding a 200% price surge. The value of the meme token climbed from below $0.1 to above $0.2 in a little over a month.
Historically, investors’ fear has been a precursor to major price spikes, as the market tends to move in the crowd’s opposite direction. Hence, if history were to repeat itself, investors could see the price of Dogecoin grow exponentially and possibly cross the $0.3 mark. 
Whales Acquire 700 Million DOGE In Three Days
Another on-chain revelation that paints a bullish picture for the Dogecoin price is the recent accumulation by whales. As shared by Martinez in another post on X, DOGE whales have purchased 700 million tokens (equivalent to around $112 million) in the past three days.

Naturally, substantial acquisitions by large holders can be a bullish signal for a token’s price. Moreover, the actions of the Dogecoin whales can be worth watching, especially considering the magnitude of their holdings and their influence on market dynamics.
It is worth noting, though, that the recent buying spree hasn’t had any significant effect on the value of DOGE. As of this writing, the Dogecoin price stands around $0.159, reflecting a 0.5% decline in the past day.

Crypto community divided as Biden vetoes repeal of SEC’s SAB 121 - AMBCrypto



Biden’s veto of SAB 121 repeal reflects caution amid bipartisan support.
Bitwise CEO sees Biden’s decision as aligned with sensible crypto development.

In a surprising move, despite bipartisan support, U.S. President Joe Biden has vetoed the repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 aka SAB 121.
SAB 121 is the SEC’s controversial accounting guidelines seen as unfavorable to cryptocurrency. Critics argue that it deters investment banks from providing large-scale cryptocurrency custody services.
The story so far
On 16th May, in a rare display of bipartisanship, both Democrats and Republicans united to vote in favor of repealing SAB 121, passing the resolution with a 60-38 vote. 
Earlier, the White House had warned that repealing this policy could undermine the SEC’s ability to protect cryptocurrency investors.
 The administration even went as far as to signal that President Joe Biden would veto the repeal if necessary, and on 1st June, he did just that. 
Biden’s veto met with disappointment
This decision disappointed many who view these guidelines as harmful, as it contradicts the majority opinion in both the House and Senate.  
Providing further insights on the SEC’s overreach and Congress’s progress toward regulation, the Blockchain Association noted,
Source: Blockchain Association/X
Biden’s reason behind his bold move 
In his defense, Biden responded to Congress’ vote to repeal the cryptocurrency accounting guidelines with an official letter on 31st May and said, 
“This reversal of the considered judgment of SEC staff in this way risks undercutting the SEC’s broader authorities regarding accounting practices.” 
He further added, 
“My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors.”
Taking his words with a pinch of salt, Cardano’s co-founder, Charles Hoskinion took to X and noted, 
“The War on Crypto Continues.” 
Sharing the same line of thought was the CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz who said,

Not everyone is on the same page!
However, not everyone was disappointed with Biden’s stance on this matter. For instance, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley had earlier noted,
“U.S lawmakers want to foster sensible development of crypto in the U.S. Not some lawmakers. The majority. 2024 is the beginning of the mainstream era.”
Therefore, while Congress shows increasing interest in crypto, the White House remains cautious about its implications. 
With President Biden going against Congress to veto the repeal of SAB121, it’ll be interesting to see how it affects his campaign in the upcoming presidential elections.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) May Break Major Record This Month, Here's Reason

Shiba Inu (SHIB) had a good showing in the month of May, despite the broader market uncertainty. The digital currency recorded 13.2% growth in May, according to data from Cryptorank. This performance is a major lift-off from the 15.4% slump it recorded in May 2023 as it effectively broke free from that bearish trend.This month holds an even bigger stake for Shiba Inu. Since its inception, the digital currency has never recorded a positive close for June. In June 2021, the token recorded a 4.75% slump, setting the historic record for a 12% slump in June 2022. Last year, Shiba Inu also ended the month down by 11.5%, creating an avenue for SHIB to make a difference this month.Shiba Inu Monthly Analytics via CryptorankThe market dynamics this year are quite different from any in the past three years. Now, there are spot Bitcoin ETF products trading on U.S. stock exchanges. While this does not impact Shiba Inu directly, it bolsters the general institutional liquidity that can drive BTC prices up. As a token with a high correlation with Bitcoin, Shiba Inu is also poised to benefit from this rally.As per the internal Shiba Inu updates, the digital currency has recorded a major evolution that can contribute to its bid to breach major records this month. Unlike last year, Shibarium is fully operational with a growing total value locked (TVL) and functional decentralized applications (dApps) that are helping to drive the demand surge for SHIB.Shiba Inu is also well positioned to make history this month considering its current momentum over the past few weeks. Though it has been in and out of the top 10 list of coins by market cap, displacing Cardano and Avalanche recently, SHIB has shown that it can ride a steady momentum to clear outstanding losses.While it remains too early to tell, Shiba Inu might pull a similar May growth stunt to breach the historic June losing streak.

Global Crypto Users Report, Surge In Digital Currency Wor...


                                Global Crypto Ownership Surges to 562 Million: 6.8% of People Use Digi                                A new report out today shows a sharp increase in the adoption rate of digital currencies across the globe. It is now interesting to note that 562 million people own and use digital currencies which is higher as compared to the previous year's data which is 420 million in 2023. This means that approximately 6.8 percent of the global population is involved in the use of digital currencies.Asia Leads the Charge, North America Trails Close BehindThe report is compiled by Triple A (a fintech company) and the report focuses on the trends of owning cryptocurrency in the world. Asia is leading this trend as pointed out by the CEO of Triple-A that is Eric Barbier. The number of crypto users in Asia has increased from 268.2 million to 326.8 million with a marking rise of 21.8%. By analyzing closely, North America has seen its crypto ownership climb from 52.1 million to 72.2 million with a notable surge of 38.6%.Continental Cryptocurrency Adoption SpikesThere's much further to the report than that. It provides insight into the global growth of cryptocurrency users. For example, South America had a remarkable growth from 25.5 million to 55.2 million cryptocurrency owners with an enormous 116.5% increment. Europe is likewise catching up quickly with an impressive 60.3% rise in population from 30.7 million to 49.2 million. Africa saw a mild increase of 8.5% from 40.1 million to 43.5 million. Interest rose by 114.3% or more than twice from 1.4 million to 3.0 million in Oceania.Reasons Behind the Surge in Crypto UsersWhy therefore the unexpected spike? Well, a couple of things are involved in this. Firstly, an increasing global understanding of and knowledge about cryptocurrencies has made them invest in the crypto market. Additionally, more people are investigating and investing in cryptocurrencies due to the expanding use of digital payment systems and the need for financial protection and anonymity. Furthermore, a large number of new users have entered the cryptocurrency market due to the growth of decentralized financing (DeFi) platforms and the possibility of high returns on investment.Cryptocurrency is a Global PhenomenonWith all factors taken into account by CoinGabbar, the use of cryptocurrencies is rapidly expanding throughout the world with notable increments on every continent. This increase highlights how important digital currencies are becoming to the world's financial system. However, as the Digital market and its popularity increase day by day, simultaneously there are many scams and frauds in the dynamic cryptocurrency industry which led the market into a very risky and unstable position. As cryptocurrencies continue to evolve and become more mainstream in shaping the way we think about money and finance in the digital age.Also Read: Spot Ether ETF In the Limelight As Fee Announced

Ripple CEO Calls Out Biden's Crypto Veto


							

Ripple’s CEO shared opinions about developments in the crypto industry.



Garlinghouse asked the Biden administration to sack Gary Gensler.



The CEO expressed disappointment over Biden’s SAB 121 veto.




Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, shared his opinions about recent developments in the crypto industry. In a recent interview, Garlinghouse told CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos, “It is a magical time to be alive.” He said this in response to Sigalos’ question about his feelings on current crypto events.



Garlinghouse discussed several issues, including the SEC’s recent spot Ethereum ETF approval, Gary Gensler’s continued role at the SEC, and President Biden’s veto of SAB 121.



Among the recent developments, Garlinghouse noted a renewed national focus on institutional involvement in crypto. He highlighted improvements in the industry’s participation in mainstream leadership roles, citing the election of pro-crypto, pro-innovation, and pro-consumer protection leaders to key positions.









Meanwhile, Garlinghouse said the SEC’s recent Ethereum ETF approval was inevitable. He noted the SEC has been losing in courts, including the court of public opinion and politics. Therefore, not supporting Ethereum ETFs could have resulted in another loss for the commission.



Acknowledging improvements in the crypto sector, Garlinghouse believes the most crucial decision for the Biden administration would be to remove Gary Gensler as the SEC Chair. He considers this the most important step to promote crypto development and appeal to the electorate.



However, the CEO expressed disappointment over President Biden’s veto of Congress’s decision on the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB 121). He described the move as “incredibly disappointing” from the White House, noting that Biden’s administration chose a pivotal time to make a wrong decision.



Garlinghouse believes the SAB 121 veto announcement highlighted the Biden administration’s stance on crypto and could influence crypto voters in the upcoming U.S. Presidential election.

Innocent Trump (INOTRUMP) to Explode 12,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Innocent Trump could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.



Innocent Trump (INOTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because INOTRUMP has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Innocent Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Innocent Trump could become the next viral memecoin.



Innocent Trump launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Innocent Trump on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Innocent Trump by entering its contract address – JDco3yhutHK3aqWaCsLPBzMVoAgcFALZka85r1YWmsAi – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like INOTRUMP.

Privacy as a human right in crypto: An uncompromising stand

The following is a guest post by Felix Mohr, Co-founder at MohrWolfe.  In an age where our digital footprints are scattered across the expanse of the internet like breadcrumbs, the concept of privacy has become as elusive as it is precious. As we navigate the aftermath of COVID-19—a time that has immeasurably digitized human interactions—our right to privacy remains steadfast amidst the winds of technological progress.Nowhere is the debate on privacy more critical than in the realm of crypto, where the very principles of decentralized finance are continually being weighed against the scales of regulatory scrutiny.The Dichotomy of Privacy and Public ChainsPublic blockchains, such as Ethereum and its myriad of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible chains, have made significant strides in security—fortifying against hacks, shielding smart contracts, and safeguarding against data leaks. Privacy, however, can often feel like the sacrificial lamb offered at the altar of transparency and efficiency.Decentralization and minimal personal data collection should, in theory, buttress our privacy. Yet, as these public ledgers hold tall its banner of transparency, every transaction becomes a public spectacle. We commend the strides made for security, but we must also question if securing our assets is where we should draw the line when it comes to protecting our personal, private spheres.Privacy: A Human Right Facing Financial MarginalizationThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 12 solemnly proclaims “the right to privacy without arbitrary interference”. Still, the irony persists: “those in the comfortable echelons of power grip tightly to their privacy while being cavalier with ours” . The financial realm exhibits perhaps the starkest dichotomy, where the privacy of the elite seems sacrosanct whereas the average citizen finds theirs increasingly eroded.Financial privacy is not a rogue’s charter but a bastion of dignity. Yet, as we linger in the embryonic stages of crypto regulation, privacy-focused coins stare down a narrowing precipice—caught between the staunch advocates of financial sovereignty and the steely-eyed regulators demanding transparency.Anonymity Coins: Will They Endure?Monero, Zcash, and other anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies have captivated those who hold privacy in their hearts. These coins have elevated the potential for true anonymity by offering what seems like a sanctuary in a surveilled world. Nonetheless, my skepticism about their longevity resides in a stark new reality: the demanding due diligence that exchanges must now comply with sets the stage for a future where pure privacy coins might struggle to find a home.The delisting of privacy coins from several exchanges screams of this harsh new dawn. A world where compliance and privacy are pitted against each other, where the pursuit of anonymous transactions becomes a game of cat and mouse with a regulatory framework that tolerates no shadow.Privacy Cannot Be a CasualtyAs we weave through the complex tapestry of crypto and privacy rights, let us reaffirm human dignity and individual sovereignty tenets. Privacy, in every aspect, forms the cornerstone of our freedom. To relent on this front—be it out of convenience or coercion—is to concede to a future where we own nothing, not even the sanctity of our anonymity.The crypto community stands at a crossroads, defined by its willingness to integrate privacy within its foundational fabric. While we acknowledge the necessity of a framework to mitigate illicit activities, we must resist the impulse to cast away our privacy rights as dated relics.Instead, let’s commit to a future where innovation serves empowerment and where the human right to privacy is not just protected but revered even in the crypto space.We must stand firm: privacy is not a feature of convenience but a fundamental human right that must endure, uncompromising and inviolate, regardless of technological advancement.Mentioned in this article

$2.5 Billion In Bitcoin Flows Out Of Centralized Exchanges - Time To Buy?


																Investor confidence appears to be on the rise in the crypto market lately, and Bitcoin has been a major beneficiary of this positive trend. Consequently, there has been a continuous accumulation of BTC amongst large-scale investors despite its somewhat frustrating price action.
The premier cryptocurrency’s price may have ended May beneath the psychological $70,000 mark, despite having touched the level a couple of times in the last two weeks of the month. The latest on-chain data suggests that the faith in Bitcoin has only continued to grow strong.
Is BTC Primed For A Price Rally?
Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared via a post on the X platform that substantial amounts of Bitcoin have been making their way out of centralized exchanges. This on-chain observation is based on the CryptoQuant Exchange Reserve metric, which tracks the amount of a particular cryptocurrency in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.

	Related Reading


An increase in the metric’s value indicates that investors are making more deposits than withdrawals of a crypto asset (Bitcoin, in this scenario) into centralized exchanges. Meanwhile, when the metric declines in value, it implies that more coins are moving out than into the trading platforms.
According to Martinez’s post, more than 37,000 BTC (worth roughly $2.53 billion) have been transferred out of crypto exchanges in the past three days. This significant exodus of funds indicates a change in sentiment and the long-term holding strategy of Bitcoin investors.

While it is difficult to tell the exact rationale behind the massive outflow from exchanges, the movement of funds from trading platforms suggests an increase in investor confidence. This indicates that many investors might be convinced by the future promise of Bitcoin, thereby opting to store their assets in self-custodial wallets in the long term.
What’s more, the downward spiral of Bitcoin’s supply on centralized exchanges could trigger a bullish rally for the premier cryptocurrency’s price. The sustained decline in BTC’s balance on exchanges could result in a supply crunch. 
For context, the supply crunch refers to a scenario or period during which the supply of a particular asset is lower than the demand for it, resulting in a surge in the asset’s value. 
Bitcoin Price At A Glance
As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands around $67,489, reflecting a 1.5% decline in the past 24 hours. This sluggish performance in the past day underscores the premier cryptocurrency’s struggles in the past week. According to CoinGecko’s data, the BTC price is down by nearly 2% in the last seven days.

Joe Biden steps back, vetoes crypto bill after Trump conviction


    After not using this same power last week, Joe Biden surprised the cryptocurrency market by vetoing a crypto-related bill. This step-back decision happened amid Donald Trump’s conviction in an unprecedented election where cryptocurrencies could play an important role.



On May 31, nearing the end of the day and week, Joe Biden vetoed congressional disapproval of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) accounting bulletin on crypto assets—the SAB 121.




“By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, this Republican-led resolution would inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues.”








Notably, Biden’s administration previously declared it would not use the veto on another crypto-related bill as Donald Trump gained popularity. His first decision was related to the FIT21 Act, approved on May 22 with 279 to 136 votes.



Donald Trump’s conviction and Joe Biden’s crypto step back



Donald Trump was charged and convicted of 34 counts of falsification of business records in the first degree. This criminal conviction has shaken the presidential election and opened space for Biden to step in favor of the SEC.



Interestingly, Trump started gaining popularity among cryptocurrency enthusiasts with a crypto-friendly approach in a currently hostile regulatory environment. On the other hand, Biden gained a few points by declaring he would not veto the FIT 21 Act.



However, the surprising turn of events has clarified Joe Biden’s position about cryptocurrencies, which may affect this year’s elections. Known investors have commented on the decision.







Wall Street lobbying groups urged Joe Biden not to veto



Not only the cryptocurrency community opposed this veto but even Wall Street representatives have previously urged Biden to reconsider his stance. Surprisingly, lobbying groups in the finance and stock markets sent a letter to the President asking him to “reverse course” a few hours before the official announcement.



This lobbying pressure happened as Joe Biden’s administration hinted they would not allow Congress to challenge the SEC authority. Therefore, this is what the letter stated:




“SAB 121 effectively precludes regulated banking organizations from offering digital asset custody at scale since it treats the assets as if they are owned rather than simply custodied by a banking organization. Institutions that are forced to record custodied digital assets on balance sheet are subjected to higher capital, liquidity, and other prudential requirements, unlike their non-bank competitors.”




Nevertheless, some cryptocurrency developers argued that this was a positive outcome for the original ethos of crypto. According to Mike in Space, creator of Bitcoin Stamps, this veto has long-term positive effects on the self-custody industry.







Now, the United States awaits further developments in the following weeks, which may define the direction of 2024’s presidential elections. Crypto investors speculate whether the country will become more or less friendly to innovation and place their bets accordingly.

No New Retail Investors Are Joining the Crypto Market, Says Top Trader - Here’s What He Thinks Could Change That - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed trader is claiming that no new retail investors are joining the crypto market, but he believes one event could attract the newbies.
Pseudonymous trader The Flow Horse tells his 217,800 followers on the social media platform X that it will likely take Bitcoin (BTC) hitting six figures before new retail investors start entering the crypto market.










“No new retail investors are entering the market, despite the memecoin frenzy, which represents only a fraction of total market volumes and is more of a buzz on crypto Twitter than a significant trend. For new retail investors to come, we need much higher prices in large-cap, easily accessible pairs. Simply pushing on-chain assets up 10,000% does not attract retail investors, just as random pink sheet stocks doing the same doesn’t get people punting on Robinhood, or make the news. We need big and easily accessible names moving significantly. For that reason, I think Bitcoin probably needs to break $100,000 for people to take notice again.” 
The trader suggests the current cycle is also having a harder time attracting new market entrants due to the scandal-plagued prior cycle, among other factors.
“I think absent people getting free money shoved in their pockets a la government [stimulus]:
1. Each cycle, unless generations apart, means less and less new people to grab, since at some point we reach a level of global penetration. 
2. If someone isn’t here already, part of that reasoning is they haven’t felt strongly compelled or provoked to do so. Usually that occurs by seeing your friend/neighbor/coworker get stupid rich or asset prices that are front and center moving much higher. 
Excitement needs to reach the mainstream, and it’s reasonable to assume we are still trying to distance ourselves from bad memories and stigma associated with the prior cycle. 
This cycle seems more about ideally capturing the larger passive less price sensitive types, for a more accretive type of growth (with exchange-traded funds).”

Bitcoin price explosion: Chart patterns identify explosive BTC levels to watch


    Bitcoin (BTC) continues to cling to the $67,000 mark, with bears and bulls failing to push the maiden cryptocurrency’s price in either direction significantly.



Amid the standoff, crypto trading expert TradingShot has pointed out that chart patterns indicate a possible explosive Bitcoin price breakout.



In a TradingView post on May 31, the expert noted that Bitcoin is on the verge of completing the right shoulder of the inverse head and shoulders (IH&S) pattern, a bullish indicator that emerged following the cryptocurrency’s all-time high on March 14.

The IH&S pattern, a well-known bullish reversal formation, suggests a shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. The formation comprises three parts: the left shoulder, the head, and the right shoulder. Therefore, completing the right shoulder signals the potential start of a significant upward move. 



Additionally, the current price movement is contained within an upward channel. This “Channel Up” pattern has shown a previous bullish leg peaking at 19.50%, followed by two bearish legs of approximately -8% each, reinforcing the structural symmetry in Bitcoin’s price movements.



Support zones resilience 



The analysis also highlighted distinct support and resistance zones within the IH&S pattern. Support zone one has demonstrated resilience, holding firm twice since May 23. This suggests a strong buying interest at this level, providing a foundation for the anticipated bullish move.



At the same time, the analyst noted that the 50-day moving average is another critical indicator. As long as Bitcoin’s price remains above this moving average, the bullish trend is expected to persist, likely culminating in a price near the $80,000 level.




“As a result, as long as it holds along with the 1D MA50, the trend remains bullish, and the IH&S technical dynamics target the 2.0 Fibonacci extension at $89,000. However, we keep at the moment a shorter term perspective, and before 89k, we will aim at $79,500, which would be a +19.50% rise, similar to the Channel’s previous Bullish Leg,” the expert said. 




Bitcoin’s failed attempt towards $70,000



It’s worth noting that Bitcoin returned to trading above the $67,000 level after a failed attempt to reclaim the $70,000 mark in the last 24 hours. Notably, Bitcoin rose to $69,000 on May 31 but failed to hold that position.



The surge receded after the latest United States gross domestic product data reached 1.3% for the first three months annually, missing the forecast of 1.6%. The data implied that American consumers spent less, casting uncertainty over the future of the U.S. economy.



Indeed, Bitcoin also corrected amid a hacking incident that affected the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin, which lost over $300 million worth of Bitcoin. 



Amid the current Bitcoin price movement, Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of MNTrading, noted that the market is in equilibrium and investors should watch the crucial level of $66,000.







Bitcoin price analysis



At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,620, having corrected by about 0.80% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is down over 2%.

Overall, amid expert projections, investors will hope Bitcoin’s next price action aligns with the bullish post-halving rally.

Hong Kong's Crypto Crackdown? 11 Exchanges Get Nod, But Big Names Skip Out


							

Hong Kong will license 11 crypto exchanges, including Crypto.com and Bullish.



The deadline for exchanges to be licensed or “deemed to be licensed” is June 1st.



Major players like Binance, OKX, and Coinbase did not apply for licenses.




Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has announced that 11 virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) are poised to receive official licenses, a year after the city introduced new regulations to foster a thriving crypto industry.



Prominent platforms such as Crypto.com and Bullish, identified as “deemed to be licensed” in the SFC’s recent update, are among the applicants close to receiving the licenses. These exchanges, known for their significant global trading volumes, are now a step closer to operating fully under Hong Kong’s regulatory framework.



However, not all major players have sought licensing in Hong Kong. Exchanges like OKX and Bybit have withdrawn their applications, while Binance, the world’s largest exchange, did not apply. Leading U.S.-based platforms Coinbase Global and Kraken have also opted out of seeking permits.



The SFC set June 1 as the deadline for exchanges to either secure a license or be deemed eligible. To continue operating and serving local investors, firms must at a minimum be classified as “deemed to be licensed.” Full licenses will be issued once the SFC confirms ongoing compliance with its regulations.



 
 




Hong Kong’s push to become a virtual asset hub began in late 2022 as part of a broader effort to re-establish its status as a global financial center. The city’s initiatives to attract the crypto industry include expanding the list of authorized exchanges, introducing Bitcoin spot and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and developing frameworks for stablecoin regulation and digital bond issuance on tokenization platforms.



Notably, Hong Kong faces competition from other jurisdictions like Dubai and Singapore for the title of top digital asset center. Approximately two dozen entities applied for crypto exchange licenses by the February 29 deadline. Currently, HashKey Exchange and OSL Group are the only two fully licensed VATPs in Hong Kong.

Changpeng Zhao Begins Sentence in California


Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, has begun a four-month prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Lompoc, California.
This development follows a series of legal challenges faced by Zhao, commonly known as CZ, and his cryptocurrency exchange.
Changpeng Zhao’s Legal Battle

Zhao’s legal troubles started when US authorities charged him with multiple violations related to Binance’s operations. These included allegations of unregistered securities offerings, market manipulation, and failures in anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. Despite Binance’s status as one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, regulators have been relentless in their scrutiny.
In April, Zhao received a four-month prison term after pleading guilty to charges of enabling money laundering at his crypto exchange. This sentence was significantly shorter than the three years federal prosecutors sought. The defense requested five months of probation, while guidelines recommended 12 to 18 months in prison.

“I’m sorry. I believe the first step in taking responsibility is to fully recognize the mistakes. Here I failed to implement an adequate anti-money laundering program. I realize now the seriousness of that mistake,” Zhao said in court.

In addition to the prison sentence, CZ has agreed to pay a $50 million fine, a modest amount compared to his reported net worth of approximately $33 billion. He also resigned as the Binance’s CEO. Despite stepping down, Zhao still holds a controlling stake.
Binance, under new leadership, has pledged to cooperate fully with regulatory bodies and ensure that it meets all compliance requirements. The platform has already started implementing more rigorous AML measures and is working on improving its overall transparency.

However, Binance’s problems didn’t end there. As BeInCrypto recently reported, the company is facing allegations for selling creditor claims at a 50% discount during its acquisition of Gopax, a South Korean crypto exchange. The Financial Services Commission is now investigating the transaction, raising regulatory concerns over Binance’s handling of the situation​.

While Zhao’s imprisonment marks a tumultuous period for Binance, it also signals a potential shift towards a more regulated and transparent cryptocurrency market. Industry experts believe these changes strengthen the market’s integrity and foster greater trust among investors.

Solana price prediction: Will SOL break out to hit $500 this cycle? - AMBCrypto



Indicators suggested that SOL looks almost certain to hit $334 for a start.
The token’s correlation with ETH was negative, but with BTC, it was strong.

For the last seven days, Solana’s [SOL] price struggled to produce an impressive run. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of SOL was $167.12 at press time.
This was around the same value it was on the 25th of May. On a Year-To-Date (YTD) basis, SOL has increased by 52.63%. But it was nothing compared to the performance of the token in 2023.
However, the recent underwhelming price action has not stopped Solana bulls from betting on an incredible rally. For most SOL holders, the price of the cryptocurrency would hit nothing less than $500 before the end of this cycle.
SOL needs Bitcoin, not ETH
But this same set also predicted that Solana would surpass its all-time high of $260 before the end of 2024’s first quarter. However, that did not happen as the closest SOL got to this target was $210 in March.
AMBCrypto analyzed Solana’s price prediction from an on-chain perspective. First off, we looked at the correlation with Bitcoin [BTC], and with Ethereum [ETH].
According to data from Dune Analytics, SOL’s correlation with BTC was 0.83, indicating that the prices move in the same direction most times.
Source: Dune Analytics
For ETH, the reading was 0.10, suggesting a divergence between both cryptocurrencies. As such, if SOL were to hit $500 in the near time, BTC would have to increase past its all-time high.
Another metric AMBCrypto looked at was social dominance. Social dominance shows the rate of discussion about a token when compared with other cryptocurrencies in the top 100.
Has a good entry surfaced?
According to data from Santiment, Solana’s social dominance was 4.938%. When compared to the highs in March, this reading was low.
However, history showed that low social dominance could be a good buying opportunity. This is because a decrease in conversations about the token means it has not hit a high level of demand.
As such buying SOL around $161 to $168 could be a good entry point before another rally begins. To further buttress this point was the Open Interest (OI).
OI decreases or increases based on net positioning. If the indicator increases, it means that money is flowing into contracts related to the token.
On the other hand, a decrease implies that liquidity is exiting the market. At press time, SOL’s Open Interest was down to $807.25 million.
Source: Santiment
Concerning the price, this plunge indicated that Solana could dump into the underlying support which was at $161. However, this does not suggest that an increase in open contracts would not occur again.
In the case when SOL’s OI rises past $2 billion like it did some months back, the price could make a 100% increase. From the press time price, this means that the token’s target could be around $334 in a few months.
Data says “enough buying power”
In addition to the metrics above, AMBCrypto also looked at Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL). TVL tracks if market participants are locking or staking assets in a protocol and removing their capital.
When the metric increases, it means that the network is healthy and participants trust the project to produce a good yield. On the other hand, a decrease implies an increase in the number of assets withdrawn.
Based on DeFiLlama’s data, Solana’s TVL was $4.80 billion. This was a 20.27% increase in the last 30 days. But the last seven days have not been rosy for the token as it seemed some staked SOL were withdrawn.
Source: DeFiLlama
Regardless of the recent drawdown, the TVL of the chain could hit $8 billion especially as activity on the network was much more than other projects.
If (when) this happens, demand for SOL could be incredible, possibly leading the price to hit or surpass the $500 mark. Beyond this, Dune data showed that the circulating supply of stablecoin on Solana has been increasing.

Realistic or not, here’s SOL’s market cap in ETH terms

Stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and the recently added PYUSD have been contributing to this hike.
The increase here, suggests that addresses on the chain were armed with enough buying power to send the value of SOL higher.

Crypto Scammers Target Canadians on Dating Apps, Leading to Huge Financial Losses



                    

This summer, crypto scammers are aggressively targeting Canadians on dating apps and websites.



Unfortunately, many people looking for love are suffering significant financial losses.




The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) has identified a surge in two specific types of crypto scams targeting Canadians: romance scams, also known as pig butchering, and investment scams.



In response, the CAFC and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) issued a joint warning about these sophisticated scams, “particularly those involving extended online communication.”



Scammers typically approach potential victims on dating platforms, convincing them to switch to private messaging services. 




Authorities caution Canadians to be suspicious of individuals who discuss crypto trading or investments.



“Fraudsters may try to befriend the victim, develop an online romance, or pose as legitimate investment advisers. 



“Over time, the scammer will suggest investing in an opportunity, often involving crypto assets,” the warning states.



Victims are often lured into crypto investment schemes promising unrealistic returns. 




They are directed to sign up on fraudulent investment platforms created by scammers. 



Initially, victims can withdraw small amounts to make the scheme appear legitimate, but eventually, their funds are locked out once their identity is compromised.

Canadians are encouraged to report such fraud incidents to the CIRO, CAFC, and local police.



In 2023, Canadians lost $309.4 million to known investment frauds, with $172 million stemming from social media-related scams alone.



Canada is preparing to implement the international Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) for taxation by 2026, as outlined in a supplement to the 2024 annual budget.



The CARF will introduce new reporting requirements for crypto asset service providers (CASPs), such as cryptocurrency exchanges, brokers, dealers, and automated teller machine operators, whether they are individuals or business entities.



The report lists “stablecoins, derivatives issued in the form of a crypto-asset, and certain nonfungible tokens” as examples of crypto assets.



“Crypto-asset service providers would be required to obtain and report information on each of their customers, including name, address, date of birth, jurisdiction(s) of residence, and taxpayer identification numbers for each jurisdiction of residence,” the report states.

Veteran trader predicts Bitcoin could soon match 100 ounces of Gold


    Veteran trader Peter Brandt forecasts a major surge in Bitcoin’s (BTC) value compared to gold (XAU), predicting BTC could reach 100 ounces of gold within the next 12 to 18 months. 



Currently, it takes 29 ounces of gold to buy one Bitcoin, suggesting Brandt’s prediction could result in a 230% increase in BTC’s value against gold.



Bitcoin has steadily gained ground against gold since its inception. In 2017, Bitcoin surpassed gold in terms of price, peaking at $19,649 on December 17, while gold traded at $1,264 per ounce, requiring 15.5 ounces of gold to buy one Bitcoin.







Despite bearish markets in 2018 and 2019, Bitcoin maintained a higher value than gold, measured in dollars. By December 2018, Bitcoin hit a low of $3,126 compared to gold’s $1,283 per ounce.



In August 2020, amid the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, gold reached a new high of $2,075 per ounce, while Bitcoin traded at $12,341. 



As of May 2024, gold achieved an all-time high of $2,449 per ounce, and Bitcoin reached $74,000 before settling at $67,619.90 at press time. Gold is currently trading at $2,327 per ounce.



Peter Brandt’s BTC prediction



Peter Brandt anticipates the BTC/GLD ratio will stabilize for 12 to 18 months before a strong upward movement. He predicts Bitcoin could reach 100 ounces of gold, valuing BTC at $234,400—a 243% increase from its current price. 



Bitcoin has already gained 42% against gold this year, despite some corrections, showcasing its ongoing outperformance of gold and potential for future growth.







Brandt believes Bitcoin still has room for growth, with the BTC/GLD ratio currently above key moving averages, indicating bullish momentum. 



ETF influence and market dynamics



The launch of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has significantly influenced both assets. These ETFs have accumulated over $50 billion in assets under management (AUM) in record time, a feat that took gold ETFs five years to accomplish.







BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), became the fastest ETF to reach $20 billion in AUM, surpassing the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and now targeting the iShares Gold ETF (IAU), which holds roughly $29 billion in AUM.



Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, believes IBIT could surpass IAU by the end of 2024. This rapid growth has bolstered Bitcoin’s status as a leading market indicator.



Despite the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone noted that Bitcoin’s recent surge did not exceed its 2021 peaks against gold and the S&P 500, highlighting the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies compared to traditional assets. 



Meanwhile, Kaiko data shows that Bitcoin’s 60-day correlation with gold has been increasing, nearing yearly highs but still below 2022 peaks.

This suggests that while both assets offer protection against economic uncertainties, investors view them differently, with Bitcoin potentially offering more upside.

Over the past year, Bitcoin exhibited high volatility, ranging from $25,036 to $73,390, achieving a 118% increase. Its relative strength index (RSI)  indicated both oversold and overbought conditions, currently standing at a neutral 52. Factors such as the halving event and increasing institutional interest contribute to its optimistic long-term prospects.



Gold, on the other hand, showed steady growth, with a 17.7% increase in price and an RSI of 46, reflecting market balance. It remains a preferred safe haven asset amid economic uncertainties, expected to maintain its stability due to ongoing inflation and geopolitical tensions.



Both assets offer distinctive investment opportunities: Bitcoin for potential high returns and volatility and Gold for stability and risk mitigation



For now, the next target on Bitcoin’s list is silver, which has a total market cap of $1.8 trillion, while Bitcoin sits at $1.33 trillion in value, according to data provided by CryptoRank.



Bitcoin still has a long way to go to catch up to gold, which is estimated to have a total value of $15.5 trillion.



As Bitcoin continues to gain ground and attract investor interest, its performance against gold will be a key metric to watch in the coming months.

Cardano Shows Unstoppable Momentum as Development Milestones Defy ADA Price Woes ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Despite recent turbulence in ADA’s price, the Cardano ecosystem has been experiencing a surge in development, marked by significant progress across various projects.



This week, the Cardano consensus team achieved noteworthy milestones, focusing on enhancing performance and compatibility. According to the latest weekly development report, scalability solutions like Hydra node version 0.17.0 have substantially improved, while the Mithril team’s transaction enhancements have bolstered efficiency. The report also disclosed a substantial increase in transactions, token policies, and Plutus scripts.







Moreover, the report disclosed notable strides taken towards the Chang hard fork, which is slated for Q3 this year, representing a pivotal moment for Cardano. Notably, this upgrade heralds a new era of decentralized governance and smart contract capabilities. Earlier in the week, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, unveiled plans for the upcoming election of the Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC), a crucial step towards decentralized governance preceding the Chang hard fork.



The election process, scheduled to commence in June, will involve a stake-based vote accessible to all ADA holders. This will ensure democratic representation of the community’s preferences as Cardano enters the so-called “Age of Voltaire.”



Additionally, the report revealed that community engagement and testing on the SanchoNet testnet are underway to refine governance mechanisms and foster a robust, inclusive system.

&nbsp



However, amidst these strides in development, the price of ADA has continued to face downward pressure after experiencing a decline of over 45% since its peak in March. Cardano conceded its market capitalization throne this week to Dogecoin (DOGE), falling to the ninth position. 



Analysts view the current price range as a significant accumulation zone, potentially indicating a forthcoming price reversal. In a YouTube video on Friday, renowned crypto analyst Dan Gambardello commented on the prevailing sentiment surrounding Cardano, referring to it as the “Peak Cardano is Dead season.” Despite this, Gambardello emphasized that such phases are not uncommon in Cardano’s history, citing past market fluctuations that preceded robust price rallies. 



Notably, he underscored the resilience of Cardano’s fundamentals, particularly highlighting the upcoming Chang hard, as reasons for long-term optimism.



“Ada price exploding will be driven not by hype but by the very fact that it is one of the most secure decentralized scalable blockchains in crypto and it’s a top blockchain.” Gambardello emphasized.



In an earlier tweet, the pundit teased at the idea of ADA surging over 10X writing “Last cycle at this time, Cardano was down 90% from all-time high. Many said it was a dead ghost chain. Out of nowhere it pumped 3,000% from $0.10 to $3.00. Right now, at the same part of this cycle it’s down 85%. This time more secure, decentralized, and scalable. Patience.”



Similarly, analyst “Astronomer” expressed optimism, noting the current support levels on ADA’s chart and projecting a potential surge of up to 280% in the next leg up, with a minimal target of around $1.70.







ADA was trading at $0.4481 at press time, reflecting a 0.22% drop over the past 24 hours.

Crypto trader turns $12,300 into $1.72 million in 4 days


    Another crypto trader has made waves in the cryptocurrency market with impressive results trading on the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The trader made over $1.4 million in unrealized profits with the meme coin PEW on Ethereum (ETH).



As developed, the address starting with ‘0x8EF73‘ bought 27.05 billion PEW with 3.2 ETH, worth $12,300. Lookonchain spotted and reported this crypto trader’s activity on May 31 in a post on X.



Notably, ‘0x8EF73’ already sold 8.05 billion PEW for 83.5 ETH, worth $315,000—over $300,000 in realized profit. As of this writing, the monitored account holds 1 billion PEW worth $61,000.

However, Lookonchain explained that this same trader holds 18 billion more PEW, evenly distributed in 15 other addresses. These holdings are traced back from the first purchase, which happened just three minutes after the meme coin started trading on Uniswap (UNI), Ethereum’s main decentralized exchange (DEX).



The crypto trader holds a $1.42 million stash of this new meme coin four days after the purchase.



The crypto trader may have liquidity issues in realizing the $1.4 million profit



Interestingly, the meme coin that goes by the name “pepe in a memes world” (PEW) has only $7.5 million in total value locked (TVL) on Uniswap. This metric translates into the available liquidity to swap PEW with other ERC-20 tokens on the platform.



“pepe in a memes world” (PEW) on Uniswap. Source: Finbold



Therefore, any attempt to realize larger amounts of this trader’s holdings could directly impact PEW’s price, making profit realization difficult.



Meme coins and the greater fool theory



The risks associated with trading these highly volatile and speculative cryptocurrencies cannot be overstated.



Meme coins, such as PEW, often lack fundamental value, while hype and social media buzz drive their price action. Traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.



This mentality aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a “greater fool.”



However, this theory also highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down and demand dwindles, traders can remain holding worthless assets, leading to substantial financial losses.

Hong Kong KOs Unlicensed Crypto Exchanges In Licensing Deadline Blitz


								Hong Kong, a financial hub with a burgeoning interest in cryptocurrency, is undergoing a regulatory shakeup. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has flexed its muscles, forcing unlicensed crypto businesses to exit the market and tightening the grip on those seeking licenses.

Unlicensed Exchanges Face The Exit Door
Until recently, Hong Kong operated with a relatively loose regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. This attracted a flood of crypto exchanges, some with questionable practices. To combat this Wild West atmosphere, the SFC implemented a licensing regime in February 2024.
The grace period for unlicensed exchanges to comply ended on May 31st, prompting a mass exodus. Big names like Bybit, GateHK, and Huobi Hong Kong were forced to shut down operations or leave the region entirely.
This crackdown aims to protect investors from scams and fraud. With licensed exchanges, the SFC ensures compliance with certain standards, including robust security measures and Know Your Client (KYC) protocols. These KYC checks help prevent money laundering and other illicit activities that can plague the crypto space.
Balancing Safety With Innovation
While increased consumer protection is a welcome change, the stricter regulations might come at a cost. Stringent licensing requirements could stifle the growth of new and innovative crypto businesses in Hong Kong.
Start-ups with groundbreaking ideas might find the compliance process too expensive or time-consuming, hindering the region’s potential to become a hub for cutting-edge blockchain technology.

Total crypto market cap at $2.4 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com
Furthermore, some licensed exchanges, burdened by the new regulations, might choose to exit the Hong Kong market altogether. This could limit the choices available to retail investors, potentially pushing them towards unregulated platforms in other jurisdictions, which could expose them to greater risk.
A Microscope On License Applicants
The SFC isn’t just weeding out bad actors; it’s also raising the bar for those seeking entry. The process now involves external assessments of an exchange’s systems, along with on-site inspections by SFC officials. This meticulous scrutiny ensures that licensed platforms prioritize client asset safety and adhere to anti-money laundering regulations.

This focus on responsible operation is a positive step. However, some worry that the SFC’s heightened focus on compliance might create delays in the licensing process. This could discourage legitimate businesses from entering the Hong Kong market, hindering the overall growth of the crypto ecosystem.
The Future Of Hong Kong Crypto
Hong Kong’s crypto market is at a crossroads. The SFC’s crackdown on unlicensed businesses signals a commitment to creating a safer and more regulated environment. While this might benefit investors in the long run, it could come at the expense of innovation and accessibility.
The success of these new regulations will depend on the SFC’s ability to strike a balance between protecting consumers and fostering a vibrant crypto ecosystem.

In a recent tweet, tech billionaire and serial entrepreneur Elon Musk spread the word about a major new milestone reached by one of his largest companies — SpaceX — in May.In particular, he sent congratulations to the SpaceX Falcon team for launching flights 14 times within a single month. Among those was a launch of 23 Starlink satellites from Florida in May — that was the 14th launch, according to a SpaceX tweet quoted by Musk in his X post. The official SpaceX account also sent kudos to the entire SpaceX team “on continuously raising the bar for rapid and reliable launch.”The crypto community reacted with a wave of positive and encouraging comments, congratulations to SpaceX. Recently, Musk shared another SpaceX milestone with the crypto community. Some of them tweeted that since SpaceX owns DOGE, the price of this meme crypto is likely to go to the moon soon.As reported by U.Today, earlier this week, Elon Musk reached a new milestone as the number of his followers on the X social media network owned by him surged to surpass the 185 million level. Thus, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO’s account became the social media account most interacted with on the entire internet.

Expert sets Dogecoin price for this market cycle, expects ‘massive breakout’


    Meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) has weathered recent bearish sentiment as it strives to breach key resistance levels.



Indeed, Dogecoin aims to claim the $0.20 mark, and crypto trading expert Michaël van de Poppe believes investors should brace themselves for significant upside potential in the current cycle.



In an X post on May 31, Poppe projected that the token is poised for a massive breakout in the future, potentially resulting in a price surge of approximately 525% to reach the coveted $1 mark.  Notably, the $1 threshold has long been a target price for the meme cryptocurrency.








“This is such an easy play. I think we’ll be seeing a massive breakout of this one, and it might even be possible to reach $1 again this cycle,” he said.

Dogecoin’s rising whale activity 



Poppe’s analysis comes amidst a flurry of activity in the Dogecoin market, with notable developments fueling growing investor interest.



In this regard, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted in an X post on May 31 that DOGE whales have acquired over 700 million DOGE in the past 72 hours, amounting to approximately $112 million. 



This surge in investment from large holders indicates strong confidence in Dogecoin’s potential for future growth.

Initially, Martinez observed that DOGE had turned bearish while pointing out key levels to monitor. According to the analyst, Dogecoin faces significant resistance between $0.166 and $0.171. Breaking through this barrier could propel the price towards the resistance level of around $0.322.







While attention is focused on the recent whale transactions involving Dogecoin, scrutiny is also directed toward the coin’s proponents, particularly Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. 



Notably, the spike in Dogecoin whale transactions coincided with reports suggesting Musk was advising presidential candidate Donald Trump on cryptocurrencies.



However, contrary to these reports, Musk stated that he and the former president have never discussed crypto policy.




“Pretty sure I’ve never discussed crypto with Trump, although I am generally in favor of things that shift power from government to the people, which crypto can do,” Musk remarked.




Dogecoin price analysis



By press time, Dogecoin was trading at $0.16, reflecting a correction of over 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the meme coin is down by 4%.

Despite this short-term price correction, Dogecoin’s technical indicators are predominantly bullish. One-day gauges from TradingView summarize a ‘buy’ sentiment at 11, consistent with the sentiment reflected in moving averages, which gauge at 9. On the other hand, oscillators for the coin are ‘neutral’ at 8.

As things stand, DOGE has a considerable journey ahead to reach the $1 mark. Given that the two assets have historically traded in tandem, achieving this milestone will likely require substantial support from Bitcoin.

Ripple's Garlinghouse Takes Aim at Dogecoin, Shiba Inu - Favors XRP Utility and Stablecoin Plans ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has sparked controversy by criticizing Dogecoin (DOGE) and suggesting that it lacks a clear purpose and utility.



Speaking at the Consensus 2024 conference on Friday, Garlinghouse openly criticized the top meme cryptocurrency, questioning its value and purpose within the cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing the importance of cryptocurrencies serving a genuine purpose beyond speculation.



“We have to be about more than speculation. I don’t think Dogecoin has been a good thing for the industry,” he asserted. “I don’t know what the use case is, unlike other projects being built to solve real utility.”



Notably, this is not the first time Garlinghouse has voiced such concerns. Speaking at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos In January, he similarly questioned the purpose of Dogecoin, stating, “Other than Elon Musk as the central actor, I don’t see the use case and purpose.”



Nevertheless, despite the CEO’s latest critique, the Dogecoin community has remained staunch in its defense of its beloved digital currency. Some even cautioned that DOGE might surpass XRP in market cap soon, following its recent overtaking of Cardano.

&nbsp



Notably, Elon Musk’s involvement with Dogecoin has been a significant factor, with reports suggesting collaboration between Musk and developers to enhance the coin’s utility. Musk’s Tesla has even enabled Dogecoin as a form of payment for merchandise, indicating a broader push for utility and mainstream adoption. Yet, it’s undeniable that Dogecoin has seen fewer developments and real-world applications compared to other projects like Ethereum and Solana. Its main competitor, Shiba Inu, has garnered substantial support and witnessed increased project development, particularly with the launch of Shibarium.



Meanwhile, Ripple’s XRP has made strides to solidify its utility status. In a separate fireside chat with CNBC during the Consensus 2024 conference, Garlinghouse revealed ongoing efforts to create a stablecoin and improve cross-border payment efficiency.



“We are 100% behind the growth and development of the XRP Ledger and the health of that ecosystem. We think having a stable coin built on the XRP Ledger actually adds liquidity to the XRP Ledger,” said Garlinghouse. “We already have been using stable coins in our pay flows so this is just kind of a natural extension”.



That said, Garlinghouse’s critique of Dogecoin highlights broader discussions within the cryptocurrency community concerning the significance of utility and purpose. Interestingly, Bitcoin has also faced similar scrutiny, with some within the crypto sphere questioning its utility beyond price speculation. This stance has often sparked backlash from Bitcoin maximalists who staunchly defend its status.

Chainlink (LINK), the dominant Ethereum-based oracle protocol, is standing its ground against market bears at a time when the broader digital currency ecosystem is seeing a negative reversal. At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap data shows LINK is up by 3.18% in 23 hours to $18.54, a figure that compares to the 0.62% drop in the combined market cap.While its daily growth rate is impressive compared to that of Bitcoin (BTC) and other top altcoins, Chainlink’s 14.74% surge in volume places it on the right path for more potential surges.

Binance Founder CZ's Post-Prison Plans and Crypto's Futur...


                                Binance Founder CZ Begins Prison Term Amidst Crypto Community Support                                Changpeng Zhao (CZ) is the Founder and CEO of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world has started his four-month imprisonment at Lompoc Federal Prison in California. In this regard, he stepped down as the CEO of the exchange and pleaded guilty to money laundering charges.What’s The NewsThe news of Zhao's entry into prison has garnered support from various quarters within the crypto community. Many view his acceptance of responsibility and compliance with the legal process as a positive step for Binance's stability. A Reddit user praised CZ's decision, highlighting its protective measure against potential risks to the exchange.Despite his confinement, Zhao has outlined plans for his future involvement in the cryptocurrency sphere. He intends to maintain his cryptocurrency holdings and pursue passive investing upon completing his prison term, signaling his enduring faith in the digital asset market. Moreover, he stressed the importance of compliance with regulations, heralding what he calls "a new stage for the crypto industry."Zhao's sentencing stemmed from an April hearing in a U.S. District Court, where he received a four-month prison term and a $50 million fine for money laundering charges at Binance. This was less severe than the three-year recommendation made by federal prosecutors, which means that there was some leniency exhibited by the court. Zhao apologized for his actions before the sentencing and admitted that Binance did not have a proper Anti-Money Laundering program. He accepted responsibility and admitted to having reflected deeply during his pre-sentencing period.This comes after Zhao signed a settlement with the U. S government in November which saw him step down from his position as Binance CEO and pay heavy fines. It was the end of a multilayered investigation into Binance’s business. As CZ starts his prison term, the crypto community waits anticipating the change that is about to come and how the industry will start adhering to regulations. This case clearly shows that there is a need to respect the law as cryptocurrencies continue to become more accepted in society.Changpeng Zhao sentenced to prisonOn 21st November 2023, the prosecution initially proposed the imprisonment of CZ for three years because of Binance’s lack of an effective AML program. Nevertheless, the Judge pointed out that there was no proof that CZ had any knowledge of any unlawful activities taking place at Binance. This caused the judge to deny the motion for a longer sentence, thus lowering the initial suggestion of an 18-month sentence to just four months.The prosecution claimed that a jail term would be appropriate to deter other persons from breaching the law on AML and to send a strong signal that such offenses would not be tolerated. CZ, before he was given the sentence, offered his apologies for the conduct and insisted that he would rectify the problems. He took responsibility for Binance's failure to implement a robust AML program. He also stated that he would report to jail on the appointed date. He also agreed to pay a $50 Million fine.This guilty verdict led to his resignation as the chief executive officer of Binance. As part of a settlement with US regulators, Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion to resolve the investigation. The cryptocurrency community is paying close attention to the potential consequences of CZ's sentencing on Binance's operations and the wider crypto market.Also Read: SEC Warns of Rising Crypto Scams – Protect Your Investments

Arbitrum's proposal to unlock 225M ARB for gaming boost sparks debate - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Arbitrum’s recent proposal to release 225 million ARB tokens, valued at approximately $250 million, for its Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) has stirred controversy among its community members. Critics argue that the proposed budget is excessive.Ryan Graham, an analyst at Messari, said he initially supported the proposal but reversed his position due to discrepancies in the requested funds and a lack of justification for the program’s cost almost tripling from the initial $10 million to $25 million.The proposal on the forum page asked for $10 million worth of ARB – @AvgJoesCryptoSome community members have also expressed concerns about excessive upfront funding. One member suggested that incremental funding would allow for better accountability and the effective use of funds.@litocoenAnother member said in a post on X that the money might be wasted on low-quality, “click-to-earn” projects, which they view as less valuable and impactful.@OxGeeGeeHowever, some crypto members voiced support for the GCP proposal. Jason Hitchcock, the founder and General Partner of Four Moons, claimed that creating games requires substantial financial investment.According to him, the proposed funds are reasonable to attract talented game developers, support game studios, as well as foster a robust gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum. His post was reposted by Dan Peng, Arbitrum’s core contributor and the proposal’s author.As noted in the proposal, Arbitrum has seen considerable success in decentralized finance but lags behind competitors like Immutable X, Ronin, or Solana in gaming. The GCP intends to establish a team to support game industry developers with technical and strategic resources.The proposed allocation includes 160 million ARB for developers, 40 million ARB for bounty and rewards, and 25 million ARB for operating costs.At the time of writing, over 81% of votes favor the proposal, which is likely to pass by June 8.

Black Doge (BLADOGE) Coin Will Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Black Doge (BLADOGE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Black Doge (BLADOGE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BLADOGE will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Black Doge.



Currently, Black Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BLADOGE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Black Doge by entering its contract address – 2PE8dLsJa64vymp3RU35wdFYataxZC6dA2rx162CF7pu – in the receiving field.




BLADOGE currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Altseason incoming? Ethereum reclaims key trend line against Bitcoin


    Ethereum (ETH) has shown significant strength against Bitcoin (BTC), reclaiming a key trend line and sparking discussions of a potential altseason.



The cryptocurrency has outperformed BTC since mid-May, driven by the anticipation of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.



Ethereum’s price saw a significant surge following the announcement of the approval for the Ethereum Spot ETF. The ETH to BTC ratio currently stands at 0.056, indicating a significant increase for Ethereum.

By contrast, Bitcoin has found support at $67,000 and faces potential drops to $65,000. Meanwhile, Ethereum holds steady at $3,700 amid heightened volatility.



Since May 15, ETH has surged approximately 30%, compared to BTC’s modest 9% gain. This performance is reflected in the ETH/BTC ratio, which reached a two-week high of 0.05854 on May 23, marking a 31% increase.



A detailed analysis by pseudonymous crypto analyst Moustache revealed that the ETH/BTC ratio is reversing from a multi-year support trend line. Historically, when prices bounce from this line, altcoin prices tend to trend higher.







Bullish sentiment amid ETF approval



The ETH/BTC ratio measures how Ethereum performs against Bitcoin. Technical analysts closely watch this ratio as it compares the two most valuable cryptocurrencies. 



Although Bitcoin has been strong over the past two years, the monthly chart for the ETH/BTC ratio shows a downward channel , suggesting an upward trend for Ethereum.



 This trend is attributed to higher lows over time, indicating that buyers have been absorbing selling pressure, keeping ETH prices higher.



Renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has observed that the ETH/BTC weekly chart showed a bullish divergence from the relative strength index (RSI), suggesting a trend reversal had started. This ratio is considered bullish as long as it remains above 0.051.







Data from Santiment shows increased network activity in Ethereum. The number of unique smart contracts on Ethereum also rose from 37,870 on May 20 to 38,066 on May 31, according to CryptoQuant.

The approval of spot Ether ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  on May 23 has further fueled bullish sentiment. This development is seen as a significant milestone for Ethereum, increasing its attractiveness to institutional investors and potentially driving further price appreciation.



Adding to the bullish outlook, on May 31, 920,000 Ether options worth $3.5 billion expired. 



Historically, the expiry of crypto options contracts is linked to price volatility in the market. The put/call ratio (PCR), a technical indicator that reflects trader market sentiment, is crucial here.



 A PCR below 0.7 is considered a strong bullish sentiment, while a PCR above 1 is considered bearish. This ratio compares the number of active puts (bearish) contracts to call (bullish) options, with a lower PCR typically indicating a bullish bias.

Ethereum’s price has experienced significant volatility over the past week, fluctuating between a high of $3,965 and a low of $3,757. Despite this, in the last three days, the price has struggled to stay above $3,800, with bearish momentum prevailing.



At press time, ETH is trading at $3,803.09, reflecting a 27% increase on a monthly basis.



A bullish momentum is anticipated due to the expectations of spot Ethereum ETFs, with the SEC asking firms for their amended S-1 forms.



The overall outlook for Ethereum remains positive as investors watch for further regulatory developments and market reactions

Markets Get Choppy | Bankless


Market Uncertainty. It was a mixed week for risk assets, led by steep losses across the stocks earlier in the week and an end-of-week redemption pump on Friday. What happened this week in markets?Although U.S. stock markets were closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day, crypto continued to trade; BTC took a run at establishing new all-time highs, wicking to nearly $70k before proceeding to trade lower throughout the week.Despite the drawdown, riskier alt coins held their weight, with Bitcoin Dominance finishing Friday unchanged from the prior weekly close, a level set after the metric experienced its second worst week in 2024 catalyzed by widespread acceptance that spot ETH ETFs will receive approval that nullified BTC’s regulatory capture narrative.Source: TradingViewMacro appeared to be in the driver’s seat for much of the week, with releases of key global economic data coinciding with major moves in the stock market.While Germany has been a bastion of growth for the European Union, the nation reported Wednesday that inflation had only increased by a meager 0.1% from April to May, indicating its economy is in decline and on the brink of slipping into deflation.Revised US GDP estimates for the first quarter of 2024 released Thursday had growth projections lowered, meanwhile estimated corporate profits were slashed from a 3.4% gain to a 1.7% quarter-over-quarter loss. Concerningly, the U.S. GDP Deflator, a measure for the changes in price levels of domestically produced goods and services, which was unchanged from initial estimates of 3.1%, indicating that inflation continued to run hot throughout the first quarter as the real economy contracted.On Friday morning, risk assets initially popped after U.S. consumer spending data largely met expectations, but fell shortly thereafter after more bad forecasts. Early indications of globally synchronized economic decline did little to deter bulls, however, who feverishly bid stocks into the Friday close.

Trader Says Two Memecoins Primed To Surge ‘Much Higher’ Over the Coming Months, Maps Path Forward for Render - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst believes two memecoins have massive upside potential in the coming months.
Pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,400 followers on the social media platform X that he is bullish on both Pepe (PEPE) and PepeCoin (PEPECOIN).










However, he warns the memecoins may first retest lower levels.
“Both of these probably pullback in the short term but I’m still of the belief that they will both be much higher in the coming months. I have both.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Looking at the trader’s daily chart, he suggests Pepe could retest the support level at $0.00001084. Pepe is trading for $0.00001506 at time of writing, up nearly 5% in the last 24 hours.
As for PepeCoin, Altcoin Sherpa shares a chart suggesting that the meme token is poised for a leg down after respecting resistance at $5.50.
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
PepeCoin is trading for $5.31 at time of writing, down nearly 3% on the day.
The trader also says that he is long-term bullish on the native asset of the decentralized graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering blockchain Render (RNDR).
“RNDR: not really a great active trade but more one you just buy it and dollar-cost average if it goes lower. Artificial intelligence coins haven’t done super well the last week but it makes sense for them to cool a bit. Still bullish on this one for the cycle though.”

Render is trading for $10.06 at time of writing, a fractional increase in the last 24 hours.

Donald Trump's Cryptocurrency Wallet Continues to Grow: 14 Million Dollars - Here Are His Biggest Assets - Bitcoin Sistemi


The cryptocurrency wallet of Donald Trump, one of the presidential candidates in the USA and also the previous US President, continues to grow.
Currently, Trump's cryptocurrency wallet has a total of approximately $14 million in assets. However, it should not be forgotten that these assets were not purchased by Trump, but rather cryptocurrency developers airdropped altcoins to Trump in order to promote their own projects.



When we examine the details of Trump's wallet, we see that a significant portion of the assets, approximately $10 million, consists of TRUMP, a memecoin created in his name. On the other hand, the remaining assets are listed as Ethereum with $1.77 million, Wrapped Ethereum with $1.42 million, MVP with $541 thousand, CONAN with $216 thousand, BABYTRUMP with $142 thousand, MAGA with $106 thousand.
Trump's cryptocurrency assets have increased by almost 50% in the last 5 days. The biggest rise was seen in politically themed cryptocurrencies, which experienced hype as political debates in the USA flared up. The TRUMP token, the largest asset in the wallet, has increased by 68% in the last 5 days.

Joe Screws Up | Bankless


1️⃣ Biden Vetoes Crypto BillFollowing the ETH ETF approval, many hoped that Biden was changing his tune and would abandon his promise to veto the bill overturning the SEC's SAB 121 which makes it more difficult for entities like banks to custody crypto.Well, that didn't happen. Yesterday, Biden made good on his promise to veto the bill, much to the chagrin of the entire industry – a move that will likely cost the former President some support inside the industry, which has seemingly found an ally in candidate Trump. The presumptive GOP nominee's efforts to court the crypto voters by both hosting an event for his NFT holders and promising to commute the sentence of Silk Road Ross Ulbricht have seemed to be working despite Trump's mixed record on crypto.But there's no question about Biden's record with crypto now. With this veto, Biden has explicitly aligned himself with Gary Gensler and indicated he will continue to have the SEC's back in their cavalier crusade against crypto.
2️⃣ Solana Celebrity Coins 😵‍💫This week, crypto memecoins had their latest evolution – Celebrity Coins. Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, SoundCloud rapper Trippie Redd, Nigerian rapper Davido joined the ranks with famed olympian/failed gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner who launched their own insider-allocated tokens on Solana. Besides generating discussion over how getting dumped on by insiders could possibly be seen as positive instances of “onboarding,” much controversy swirled around whether this was largely the work of a single crypto promoter who helped Jenner launch her own Solana meme coin earlier this week.Crypto Twitter's most famed memecoin influencer, Ansem, attracted some flack for pumping up the hysteria, which led to a choice Vitalik retweet and plenty of pushback elsewhere.3️⃣ Crypto Villain Court Cases ConcludeFormer FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame was sentenced to 90 months in federal prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $11M in fines for his role in the exchange’s collapse. In the sentence, he pled guilty to unlawful political contributions, defrauding the Federal Election Commission, and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Separately, Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon has "reached a settlement in principle" — a non-binding, handshake agreement — with the SEC over LUNA’s collapse. The trial started in late March without Kwon, who remains in Montenegro. Both parties must file papers for a proposed final judgment by June 12th.4️⃣ ETH Upgrade Set for Early Next YearEthereum core developers want to launch Ethereum's next hard fork upgrade by the end of Q1 2025. The 'Pectra' upgrade will feature the EVM Object Format (EOF), a new way to organize, update, and execute smart contracts on the EVM, and PeerDAS, a data availability sampling solution. Developers also agreed to replace the account abstraction EIP-3074 with EIP-7702, enabling EOAs to function as smart contract wallets, which adds significantly more functionality. The final scope of the upgrade, which consists of the Prague upgrade on the Execution Layer and the Electra upgrade on the Consensus Layer, is still under discussion.5️⃣ ETH ETF Are Coming QuickSeveral more S-1 forms, required before the Spot ETH ETFs go live, have trickled in from BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. The Bloomberg ETF analysts see this as a positive sign, indicating issuers and the SEC are working quickly toward spot Ethereum ETF launches. Other firms like ARK Invest, Fidelity, and VanEck are also in the process of filing amended S-1 forms. Given this movement, we may see the ETFs as soon as the end of June.

Spot ETH ETFs without staking miss the mark - Blockworks


While the recent approval of the spot bitcoin ETF in the US marks a positive step towards the institutionalization of the digital asset industry, the imminent approval of spot ether ETFs raises some concerns. 
These ETFs do not offer staking rewards to investors (unlike European ether crypto ETPs), reflecting a lack of understanding by regulators and certain traditional finance asset managers of the key features that distinguish ether from bitcoin. 
Despite both being leading cryptocurrencies, ETH and BTC differ significantly in their functionality and role within the blockchain ecosystem. It’s therefore essential for the industry and regulators to tailor financial products to their specific characteristics, benefiting both investors and the underlying networks.
Understanding staking and Ethereum 2.0
Before delving into the specifics of ether ETFs, it’s important to understand what staking entails and why it is integral to Ethereum’s project. 
The Ethereum blockchain transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model with the launch of Ethereum 2.0 in September 2020.
Staking involves locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet to support the network’s operations, such as block validation, network security and governance. In return, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency.
To illustrate the importance of staking, consider that over 32 million ETH is currently locked up for staking. This represents 27% of Ethereum’s total supply. At current prices, this equates to more than $121 billion. This significant portion of ETH being staked underscores the critical role staking plays in securing and maintaining the Ethereum network.
BTC vs ETH: Different natures, different functions, different benefits
To fully appreciate the significance of staking in Ethereum, it’s important to understand the fundamental differences between ETH and BTC. While both are leading cryptocurrencies, they serve different purposes and have different technological underpinnings.
Bitcoin is primarily designed as a digital store of value and a medium of exchange. Its blockchain operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which relies on miners to secure the network and validate transactions. 
Moreover, bitcoin’s supply is predetermined, and the issuance rate of new bitcoins is halved approximately every four years. This predictable supply schedule further enhances its appeal as a deflationary asset, in stark contrast to the unpredictable monetary policies governing traditional currencies. These characteristics make bitcoin a unique and attractive asset for investors seeking to hedge against inflation, benefit from its potential decorrelation with traditional financial assets and diversify their portfolios.
Given these attributes, it makes a lot of sense to offer a spot bitcoin ETF. As a digital commodity, bitcoin provides specific benefits for an investor portfolio, similar to those of gold but with the added advantages of digital assets. Our CoinShares Research demonstrates that including just 4% of bitcoin in a traditional 40/60 portfolio significantly enhances its performance. This improved the quality of diversification and potential for higher returns underscore the value of integrating bitcoin into mainstream investment vehicles like ETFs.
Ether, on the other hand, is much more than a digital currency. The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized, Turing-complete platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps). ETH serves multiple roles, from facilitating transactions to staking and securing the network.
In addition to these roles, ETH plays a critical role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3. 
Web3, the potential next evolution of the internet, aims to create a decentralized web where users have control over their data and digital identities. Ethereum is at the forefront of this movement, providing the infrastructure for dapps that give users ownership and governance over their digital interactions. NFTs, which represent unique digital assets, are another significant innovation enabled by Ethereum. They could revolutionize digital art, collectibles and virtual goods, creating new economic models and markets.
Given Ethereum’s versatile nature as a platform that facilitates network usage, dapps, DeFi and NFTs, it raises questions about the relevance of launching a spot ETH ETF without a staking feature. 
Without staking rewards, a spot ETH ETF fails to fully leverage the unique advantages that Ethereum offers, both as an investment and a foundational technology for the future of decentralized applications and digital finance.
The benefits of staking ETH ETFs for investors
One of the most compelling reasons for including staking in an Ethereum ETF is the potential for additional returns through staking rewards. 
When investors stake their ETH, they earn a percentage of newly created ETH as a reward, significantly enhancing the overall return on investment (ROI) compared to simply holding ETH in a non-staking ETF. The annual percentage yield (APY) for staking ether typically ranges between 1% and 4%, which is attractive to investors seeking both capital appreciation and income generation.
Read more from our opinion section: Ether ETFs are the wrong solution to the right problem
By staking ether, investors are directly contributing to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. This alignment of interests ensures that stakeholders are incentivized to act in the network’s best interests, promoting a healthier and more secure ecosystem. This, in turn, can enhance the value of their holdings, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and security.
Additionally, staking-enabled ETH ETFs can foster a more informed and educated investor base. Engaging in staking helps investors better understand the different types of blockchain and stay updated with the evolution of the Ethereum blockchain.
The inclusion of staking rewards in an ether ETF can lead to significantly higher total returns compared to a non-staking ETF. Staking can also help mitigate some of the inherent volatility associated with cryptocurrencies by providing a steady stream of income. 
However, it is important to note that the daily volatility of ether can exceed the annualized staking reward, meaning the notion that staking provides a cushion against price swings might be perceived as somewhat far-fetched. Nevertheless, this regular income can still offer a more predictable return profile, which is particularly important for institutional investors who may be more risk-averse and seek steady income streams in addition to capital appreciation.
Staking-enabled ETFs encourage greater investor engagement with the Ethereum network. By participating in staking, investors are not just passive holders but active contributors to the network’s security and governance. This deeper level of involvement can foster a stronger, more informed investor community, ultimately benefiting the ecosystem as a whole.
Regulatory considerations and challenges
The primary concern for regulators with staking ETH is the security and custody of staked assets. 
Ensuring that staked ETH is safely and transparently managed is crucial for gaining regulatory approval and investor trust. Fortunately, the staking and custody ecosystem for Ethereum is now well-developed, with robust solutions in place to address these concerns. This maturity in infrastructure and technology ensures that investors can participate in staking with confidence, knowing their assets are secure and well-managed.
Additionally, there are fund structure considerations that present significant hurdles. For example, the US SEC has shown itself unwilling to allow staking in the traditional spot ETF structures. This is further complicated by the fact that the spot ETF structure (a 1933 Act grantor trust) generally does not hold securities. Because regulators in the US could consider staking a securities activity, this complicates the inclusion of staking rewards in the currently contemplated US spot ETF structure. Navigating these regulatory and structural challenges is essential to bring a staking-enabled ether ETF to market successfully.
Moreover, the tax implications of staking rewards need to be clearly defined. 
In many jurisdictions, staking rewards are considered taxable income, which could complicate the tax reporting process for ETF investors. Clear guidance from regulatory bodies will be essential to address these concerns and facilitate the adoption of staking-enabled ETFs. Additionally, depending on how staking is integrated into the product, it could generate additional revenue for the IRS, which is a positive aspect for the government to consider.
But the overall case for staking-enabled ether ETFs is compelling. 
By integrating staking into the ETF structure, investors can enjoy additional income through staking rewards, benefit from compounding growth and contribute to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. This alignment of interests between investors and the network fosters a healthier, more secure, informed, and sustainable ecosystem.
Without the inclusion of staking, a spot ETH ETF may struggle to attract investors, who might instead opt for crypto-native solutions which already offer staking and network participation.

Ethereum ETF Fee Wars Heat Up as Issuers Slash Rates


The race to lower fees for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has begun as applicants aggressively reduce costs to attract investors.
Experts note that fee wars are common in the ETF industry, as issuers tend to reduce their expense ratios to attract inflows. The crypto industry experienced this firsthand during the January approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC.
ETH ETF Fee Wars on The Horizon

Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the industry has seen its “opening shot in the ETH ETF fee war.” This happened after Franklin Templeton submitted its revised application to the SEC on May 31, introducing a 0.19% fee for its proposed spot Ethereum ETF. Additionally, the company said it would waive fees on the first $10 billion in assets for the first six months.

“The Sponsor’s Fee is accrued daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.19% of the net asset value of the Fund and is payable at least quarterly in arrears in US dollars or in-kind or any combination thereof. The Sponsor may, at its sole discretion and from time to time, waive all or a portion of the Sponsor’s Fee for stated periods of time,” the filing stated.

Consequently, this action has prompted speculations that the Ethereum ETF market will experience its own “fee wars” among applicants. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, said Grayscale’s ETH mini-trust fee would be the “most interesting fee to watch.” Geraci’s view is unsurprising, considering the investment firm’s Bitcoin fund experienced significant outflows due to its high fees compared to competitors.

“Are they going for jugular or no? Either way, it’s clear spot ETH ETFs will price in same neighborhood as spot BTC ETFs,” Geraci added.

While community attention appears fixated on the impending fee wars, other ETH ETF applicants have updated their filings with the SEC. The most notable change occurred with the 21Shares application, which removed all mention of Ark Invest. The ETF has been renamed from the “Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF” to the “21Shares Core Ethereum ETF.”

In response to this change, Ark Invest reportedly stated that it believes in Ethereum’s potential and is seeking efficient ways to provide its investors with access to the asset.

“ARK believes in its transformative potential and the long-term value of the Ethereum blockchain but, at this time, ARK will not be moving forward with an Ethereum ETF. We will continue evaluating efficient ways to provide our investors with exposure to this innovative technology in a way that unlocks its full benefits,” ARK declared.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $100 billion market cap in the second half of the year


    Bitcoin (BTC) has shown remarkable resilience recently, revisiting the $70,000 price zone, buoyed by macroeconomic indicators and a surge in market optimism.



As we move into the second half of the year, a long-term bullish sentiment permeates the industry, with multiple digital assets showing potential for sustained buying pressure that could impact their market capitalization. 



Notably, some assets are nearing the $100 billion market cap threshold and are poised for potential rallies. Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies likely to surpass that mark in the latter half of the year.







BNB Chain (BNB)



BNB, the native token of Binance, is on track to reach a $100 billion market cap, driven by strategic expansions and innovations within the Binance ecosystem. 



Initially an ERC-20 token, BNB transitioned to Binance Chain to enhance its utility, facilitating fee payments and enabling participation in new blockchain projects via Binance Launchpad.

Trading at $597.44 with a market cap of $88.17 billion, BNB is 39.40% above its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $427.54. This strong performance reflects growing investor confidence. 



The integration of 35 new decentralized applications (dApps) into BNB’s Web3 Wallet has broadened its utility across gaming, finance, and trading sectors, enhancing user experience and increasing platform engagement.



The upcoming closure of Beacon Chain will consolidate Binance’s networks, transferring all capabilities to Binance Smart Chain and potentially boosting BNB’s prominence. 



With continuous market growth and further platform expansions, BNB is on track to surpass the $100 billion mark by the end of the year.



Solana (SOL)



Currently, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $77 billion, Solana (SOL) is also poised to reach the $100 billion mark due to robust investor interest and confidence.



 SOL has experienced a 63% increase year-to-date, and its strong correlation with Bitcoin suggests further potential for growth.

The Solana ecosystem has seen significant activity, particularly with SOL-based meme coins such as Myro F and BONK, which have recently surged in trading volumes and prices. 



These developments indicate growing investor interest and contribute positively to Solana’s market value.



Despite occasional network outages, Solana maintains a strong market presence, trading above essential support levels. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at $4.80 billion, reflecting the ecosystem’s health and investor trust.



The integration of stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and PYUSD has enhanced liquidity, providing ample buying power for future rallies.



With solid fundamentals and increasing adoption, Solana is well-positioned to achieve a $100 billion market cap in the second half of the year.



It’s important to highlight that while backed by various fundamentals, the potential for the mentioned cryptocurrencies to reach the $100 billion threshold hinges significantly on the continuation of a bullish market momentum.

AI ‘Opens Up the Field’ for Filmmakers: AIFA Awards Founders - Decrypt

AI filmmakers gathered at NFC Lisbon for the AI Film Academy’s inaugural AIFA Awards this week, recognizing the “extraordinary diversity of stories and the radically new visual language of AI.”The AImagine Award for Best Film went to “Denny the Shark,” created by collaborative duo Ethereal Moon, which is made up of Melody Bossan (aka LeMoon) and Dina Lockamy (aka Ethereal Gwirl).Bossan said that using AI has revitalized her “faded dream of becoming a filmmaker,” adding that she and Lockamy were “both stay-at-home mothers when we discovered AI art and were immediately hooked.”Bossan and Lockamy are “a classic example of a huge sector of the world who are excluded from this fast paced, cutthroat industry,” AI Film Academy co-founder Leo Crane told Decrypt. He added that, “We're trying to prove this idea that the emerging technology opens up the field on a global scale.”The event also saw the launch of the AI Film Academy, a body aimed at “democratizing the film industry” through AI and blockchain technologies.“It's a global institution for the future of film,” said AI Film Academy co-founder Clare Maguire. “We essentially wanted to deliver a message to show how much potential there is in this new technology, so that we can help to stop the fear, and support and encourage positive adoption.”AIFA Awards hosts Clare Maguire and Leo Crane with Dyland Balquiee from Muse Frames. Image: AI Film Academy/Paige PowellAI and the film industryAI has proved to be a divisive topic in the film industry, with battle lines being drawn up between those who embrace the technology and those who argue it threatens artists’ livelihoods and relies on plagiarism.Negotiations to resolve last year’s actors’ and writers’ strikes hinged on provisions to regulate the use of AI in the film industry, while actors have reported losing jobs to AI-generated performances. There’s been pushback from audiences, too, with the directors of horror film “Late Night With the Devil” forced to defend their use of AI-generated art after the film's page on review site Letterboxd was flooded with negative comments.Earlier this month, actor Scarlett Johansson lawyered up, accusing AI firm OpenAI of using a soundalike voice for its GPT-4o model after she’d turned down its requests to use her voice.Johannson professed to be “shocked, angered and in disbelief” that the firm used a voice “so eerily similar to mine.” The firm withdrew the offending voice, denying that any similarities were intentional.Others have argued that artists’ fears are overblown. In a recent interview, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos argued that AI is simply another “tool,” likening it to technological advances such as CG animation or home video.“AI is not going to take your job,” Sarandos said. “The person who uses AI well might take your job.”Crane acknowledged concerns about AI “taking jobs” and “people being exploited,” but argued that the technology empowers creators outside the traditional system.“It's the studios, the big power structures that are controlling AI and exploiting the little person,” Crane said. “But when you look at the finalists, and you look at the filmmakers who were represented here, these are the so-called little people, these are the people operating outside of that system.”AI technology, he said, is giving them the chance to “really compete with multimillion dollar films in a way that's just not been possible before.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Bitcoin Shark, Whale Investors Go To The Market - Here's How Much BTC They Bought


								Bitcoin sharks and whales are relentless in accumulating the flagship crypto despite its unimpressive price action. These categories of investors are seen to have increased their Bitcoin positions in the last five months. This is undoubtedly bullish for the Bitcoin ecosystem and could soon have an effect on Bitcoin’s price. 

Bitcoin Investors Have Bought 154,560 BTC In The Last Five Months 
On-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin wallets holding at least 10 BTC have added 154,560 more BTC in the last five months. The platform noted that this purchase is significant as it is one of “crypto’s top leading indicators” when it comes to bullish signals for the flagship crypto. 

Santiment further mentioned that cryptocurrencies rise whenever these Bitcoin wallets accumulate and that an extended bear market occurs whenever they offload their holdings. This means that Bitcoin and other crypto tokens could rise soon enough, with these Bitcoin investors currently adding to their positions. 
These whales are usually known to have a significant impact on the market as their purchases could trigger a significant price surge in Bitcoin’s price. Meanwhile, a continuation of this accumulation trend is crucial, as the on-chain analytics platform Glassnode suggested that Bitcoin has failed to hold above $70,000 due to a lack of demand for the flagship crypto. 
As such, these Bitcoin investors could help drive up the demand for Bitcoin if they manage to sustain this accumulation trend. Bitcoin is expected to finally achieve a successful breakout above $70,000 as this happens.

The on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant has also recently provided a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. A market analysis on the platform noted a notable increase in the number of new participating Bitcoin accumulation addresses even though the flagship crypto hasn’t recorded any significant surge in its price over the past month. 

Bitcoin Still Far From Its Peak
In another blog post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto analyst Tarekonchain mentioned that Bitcoin is still far from its peak. He made this assertion based on the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) indicator, which the analyst claimed gives a “highly accurate alert for Bitcoin price tops and bottoms.”

According to Tarekonchain, the MVRV value being below 2 indicates a continued accumulation zone, meaning that Bitcoin is still undervalued. He added that Bitcoin only begins its path to a new peak when the MVRV value exceeds 2. He revealed that the MVRV value is currently at 2.3, indicating there is still room for Bitcoin’s price to rise significantly before it reaches its fair value. 

Bitcoin’s price is said to have peaked in previous cycles when the MVRV indicator reached a value of 3.5 or above, proving that the flagship crypto is still far from its peak in this bull run. Tarekonchain predicted that Bitcoin could still achieve a new high in this cycle and possibly rise above $100,000.

Shiba Inu: Over 800,000 SHIB holders are at a loss - Are you one? - AMBCrypto



More than 50% of SHIB investors hold at a loss.
The number of SHIB’s large investors has fallen in the last month.

Leading memecoin Shiba Inu [SHIB] has many holders at a loss. According to IntoTheBlock’s data, 829,340 wallet addresses, which comprise 62% of all its holders, are “out of the money.”
According to the on-chain data provider, a wallet address is deemed “out of the money” when it holds an asset at a price lower than its cost basis. 
On the other hand, 442,120 addresses, which represent 33% of all SHIB holders, are “in the money,” meaning they currently sit on unrealized profits. 
Source: IntoTheBlock
SHIB printed green in the past few weeks 
The past few weeks have seen a resurgence in the meme coin market activity. Impacted by this growth, SHIB’s price has risen by double digits in the last month. 
Exchanging hands at $0.00002526 at press time, the coin’s value has increased by 17% in the past 30 days.
Due to the surge in SHIB’s value, a significant portion of transactions involving the meme coin have returned profit during the period under review. 
According to Santiment’s data, SHIB’s daily ratio of its transaction volume in profit to loss (assessed using a 30-day moving average) was 1.2 at the time of press. 
Source: Santiment
This suggested that for every SHIB transaction that has returned a loss in the last month, 1.2 transactions ended in a profit. This means that SHIB traders have completed more profitable transactions than they have the ones that ended in a loss. 
This may have triggered SHIB whales to offload their holdings to book profit, as on-chain data revealed a decline in the count of SHIB whale addresses in the last month. 
The number of SHIB whales holding more than 1,000,000 coins has fallen by 2% in the past 30 days. This cohort of SHIB investors comprised 947,000 wallet addresses and held 99% of the meme coin’s total circulating supply as of this writing.

In its futures market, SHIB’s open interest has surged. As of 29 May, the coin’s futures open interest closed the day at $45 million, its highest since 13 May.

As of this writing, SHIB’s futures open interest totaled $41 million, according to Santiment.

XRP is fighting for balance amid the sudden shift in the broader crypto ecosystem that has seen the combined market cap slump by 0.53% to $2.53 trillion. Per CoinMarketCap’s data, XRP is changing hands for $0.5208, down marginally by 0.6% in 24 hours.XRP volume crunchAs one of the most-ranked digital currencies in the market, XRP has suffered a major dip in retail interest as showcased by the trading volume. This metric has plummeted by 28.94% in 24 hours with a total of $829,420,699 shuffled across the board. This XRP trade amounted to over 1.5 billion coins traded.The volume is quite low compared to the regular XRP record where almost double of this supply changes hands in a 24-hour period. This dampened sentiment presents two contrasting scenarios for the future price of the digital currency. First, the low volume might be a cautionary switch for both retail and XRP whale investors amid a general bearish market.In this instance, a revival in accumulation or trading activities and ultimately a price surge is imminent when conditions are optimal. Also, this slump in volume might be a cool-off period from the ecstatic price trends recorded in May.Per data from Cryptorank, the coin surged by 3.17% to sustain the streak from 2023 when it ended the month with 9.84% growth.Hurdle aheadXRP is in uncharted territory and it has been trading at a very close range over the past month. It recorded a low of $0.4879 to a high of $0.5689. This is not a very strong wall to break free from, however, XRP has historically traded negative in June.While the conditions are more favorable this time around, hurdles surrounding its legal constraints might be required before a convincing breakthrough is recorded.

Web3 Watch: Ronaldo re-ups Binance NFTs despite lawsuit - Blockworks


Soccer megastar Cristiano Ronaldo released another set of NFTs on Binance this week, marking his fourth collection since partnering with Binance in mid-2022. 
The NFTs give holders the chance to meet Ronaldo, as well as access to exclusive content, per Binance’s website. The drop also comes a few weeks after a Florida judge denied Ronaldo’s legal team’s motion to have a $1 billion class action lawsuit dismissed stemming from his promotion of the crypto exchange, Newsweek reported.
The lawsuit says Ronaldo was not forthcoming about aspects of the promotion, and he essentially aided Binance in the sale of unregistered currencies. 
Ronaldo’s continued involvement with Binance and crypto is interesting in light of other sports stars’ chastening following crypto-related lawsuits (you don’t see Tom Brady posting about bitcoin much these days). Not even the $4.3 billion settlement Binance had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission for breaking US laws could scare off Ronaldo. 
Read more: Binance, Zhao ‘deliberately’ violated US law, SEC argues
I spoke with Binance’s head of partnerships, Sarah Dale, this week to get a sense of how the exchange thinks about and pulls off sports partnerships like its continuing one with Ronaldo. 
Dale said the Ronaldo partnership helps Binance reach customers who aren’t necessarily “crypto natives.” He’s also a star with popularity in the countries where Binance has a license to operate, a consideration the company has to make when choosing partnerships.
“The Olympics isn’t going to work for us, because we aren’t even in all of those countries,” Dale said as an example. 
Read more: Web3 Watch: Binance seems likely to retain its sports partnerships despite DOJ actions
Overall, Dale told me sports is a main focus for Binance’s cultural marketing. This perhaps makes intuitive sense, as customers interested in Ronaldo and customers potentially interested in crypto may have a reasonable amount of overlap. 
As Blockworks Research analyst Ryan Connor wrote in 0x Research this week: “The college football, DraftKings, Barstool Sports combo is quite similar to crypto, DEX Screener, crypto twitter, no?”
Celebrities flock to launch memecoins
Caitlyn Jenner, Iggy Azalea, Soulja Boy and Trippie Redd are all names that I somehow just wrote in the same sentence. 
That’s because each of these (sorta-not-A-list) celebs had some involvement with Solana memecoins this week. 
Read more: Pump.fun revenues hit record as Caitlyn Jenner launches second memecoin
These celebrities are, presumably, profiting off the price appreciation in these assets while firing up their fanbases to invest alongside them. But memecoins with less connection to their titular celebrities had noteworthy weeks too.
The presidential candidates-themed BODEN and TREMP somehow both spiked yesterday in the hours after the news of Donald Trump’s felony conviction broke, according to CoinGecko.
One interesting stat:

The Pepe memecoin has a larger market capitalization than a range of top NFT projects combined, according to a dashboard posted by the pseudonymous @punk9059.

Also of note:

Web3 gaming device company BitBoy is soliciting pre-orders for a handheld gaming device.
Metaverse fashion company RTFKT announced a Nike collaboration coming in June.
The move and earn app STEPN is releasing a new app, STEPN GO.

Another Important Development Regarding Crypto Assets in Hong Kong, Seen as a Cryptocurrency Gateway to China - Bitcoin Sistemi

Hong Kong's securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), announced that 11 cryptocurrency exchanges are on the verge of obtaining a license.
This development comes a year after the introduction of a digital asset management guideline aimed at establishing Hong Kong as a hub for the crypto industry.


According to SFC's website, Crypto.com and Bullish “are considered licensed” among the applicants. These platforms are among those with significant global trading volumes. However, leading digital asset organizations such as OKX and Bybit, known for their significant activities, withdrew their permit applications. Remarkably, Binance, the world's largest exchange, nor Coinbase, one of the largest US platforms, nor Kraken have applied.
The SFC has given until June 1 for crypto exchanges to be licensed or recognized as such. To operate in the city and provide services to local investors, companies must fall into at least the second category. Once the SFC is satisfied with their consistent compliance, they will receive the actual permits.





In late 2022, authorities shifted their focus to creating a virtual asset center. The move was part of an effort to restore Hong Kong's reputation as a financial center following a crackdown on dissent that negatively affected global companies and foreign staff.

Crypto initiatives include expanding the list of permitted exchanges, launching spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, planning a framework for stablecoins, and issuing digital bonds on tokenization platforms.


In traditional markets, Hong Kong acts as a gateway to access wealth from mainland China. But Beijing's ban on digital asset trading means mainland investors have limited access to Hong Kong's crypto exchanges and ETFs.
Despite the ban, Chinese citizens are suspected of seeking alternative investments or exceeding overseas transfer limits amid falling housing prices. Bitcoin's quadrupling since the beginning of 2023 has fueled demand.





Traditional Chinese crypto startup Bixin, Matrixport, founded by Bitmain Co-Founder Jihan Wu, and Bullish, founded by EOS development company Blockone and acquired by CoinDesk, are also among the approved group.

ARK Invest opts out of Ethereum spot ETF, explores alternative paths: Report - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen several developments this week following listing approval on May 23. The most remarkable is that Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest suspended its spot Ethereum ETF plans. An ARK spokesperson stated in an email that it would seek better investor opportunities.“At this time, ARK will not be moving forward with an Ethereum ETF,” the spokesperson stated. “We will continue evaluating efficient ways to provide our investors with exposure to this innovative technology in a way that unlocks its full benefits.”The comments follow 21Shares’s updated S-1 form for its Ethereum product, which no longer names ARK Invest as the ETF’s partner. The proposed ETF has also been changed from Ark “21Shares Ethereum ETF” to “21Shares Core Ethereum ETF.”ARK Invest cooperated with 21Shares in pursuing a regulatory nod to launch a spot Bitcoin fund. The two asset management firms expanded their partnership, applying to offer spot Ethereum ETF in September last year. At the time, the SEC’s decision on spot Bitcoin ETFs was still on hold.After getting the SEC’s approval in January, their spot Bitcoin ETF, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), debuted trading on the CBOE on January 11. As of May 31, ARKB holds around $3.2 billion in Bitcoin (BTC).While Ark shelves its Ethereum ETF plans for now, the company affirms its continued commitment to its Bitcoin ETF.“21Shares and ARK remain committed partners on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, which launched in January, as well as on our existing lineup of futures products,” 21Shares confirmed in a statement.Spot Ethereum ETF filings: Weekly roundupThis week’s highlight is the updated S-1 forms from ETF issuers. At press time, all eight issuers had submitted their required filings to the SEC.The S-1 amendment from VanEck was filed on the day of approval. BlackRock followed suit with an updated filing earlier this week. Other issuers also sent their amended filings by Friday, the due date set by the SEC.Hashdex’s proposed Ethereum ETF was withdrawn on May 24, one day after the SEC greenlit the other eight funds, except for Hashdex’s. Hashdex was also the only issuer without an amended 19b-4 filing ahead of the Ethereum ETF decision.Fidelity is the only issuer that discloses its management fee in its updated filing. Its planned fee is 0.19%.The next step involves the SEC reviewing and providing feedback on the filings. According to a source with knowledge of the situation, this process could entail at least two additional rounds of revisions to the S-1 documents.

ChatGPT-4o predicts Bitcoin’s price if NYSE approves BTC trading


    The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is considering implementing cryptocurrency trading, although the current regulatory framework prevents moving forward. As the world’s largest exchange in volume, such development could positively impact the demand for cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin (BTC) included.



Looking for insights on the possible effects of an NYSE Bitcoin listing, Finbold asked OpenAI‘s most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model, ChatGPT-4o, what the BTC price could be following this approval.



ChatGPT-4o Bitcoin price prediction in hypothetical NYSE listing



Notably, ChatGPT-4o has provided three price predictions for the short, mid, and long terms after receiving the proper context.







At first, the AI model believes the current short-term speculation regarding a possible NYSE listing is enough for a surge. In particular, ChatGPT-4o believes in a 20% to 30% price increase following the recent announcement as an immediate reaction. This would put Bitcoin at $82,000, which aligns with a reported analysis on Finbold from a veteran cryptocurrency trader.



Second, OpenAI’s flagship product is expected to be priced between $100,000 and $120,000 in the mid-term. This is considering the combined effect of new investor inflows, increased legitimacy, and broader acceptance within six to 12 months.



Finally, the long-term BTC price prediction puts the leading cryptocurrency in a price range between $150,000 to $200,000.




“If crypto trading on NYSE leads to further institutional adoption, enhancements in market infrastructure, and overall market growth, Bitcoin could potentially aim for the $150,000 – $200,000 range as the market matures and the asset continues to solidify its place as a digital store of value.”

NYSE open to crypto trading with clear regulations; CME plans spot trading



In the Consensus 2024 event, NYSE President Lynn Martin said the exchange would consider offering cryptocurrency trading if U.S. regulations were clearer. The success of U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, amassing $58 billion, indicates demand for regulated crypto products. CME, NYSE’s rival, plans to launch spot crypto trading for clients, as also reported by CoinDesk.



Bullish CEO Tom Farley highlighted the rapid change in U.S. politics towards crypto, predicting regulatory progress in 2024-2025. Martin remains optimistic about using blockchain to improve financial processes, especially for less liquid assets.



However, Farley believes regulators’ distrust of public blockchains may push TradFi firms towards developing private blockchains for settlement. Clear regulatory guidance is crucial for the crypto industry’s growth and innovation in the U.S.



BTC price analysis



As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $67,724, maintaining a price range between $60,000 and $72,000. Nevertheless, currently trading above the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA) suggests a bullish potential to challenge the range’s resistance and fight for the $82,000 as forecasted by ChatGPT-4o.



Additionally, Bitcoin’s daily relative strength index (RSI) also suggests a growing momentum that can propel this potential bull rally. BTC is up 60% year-to-date from the $42,284 exchange rate on January 1.

In closing, the above ChatGPT-4o’s price prediction for Bitcoin will depend on a number of factors and is not guaranteed. Further regulatory developments, investors’ interest, and traditional finance offerings could significantly impact the cryptocurrency in the following years.

Hackers Targeting 1,500 Banks and Their Customers in Push To Drain Accounts Across 60 Countries: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Black hat hackers have reportedly unleashed malicious software targeting over 1,500 banks and their customers worldwide.
Security researchers at IBM say a revamped version of the Grandoreiro banking trojan has just rolled out, enabling attackers to perform banking fraud in 60 countries.










The malware allows attackers to send email notices that appear to be urgent government requests for payments.
Users are told they can click a link to view an invoice or a fee and when they do, a malicious file is downloaded and executed in the background.
Once installed, the malware searches for and interacts with banking apps to facilitate fraudulent transactions.
Infected users also have their keystrokes logged and screen captured in a push to capture banking credentials, usernames, and other sensitive data needed to crack and drain accounts.
“[The malware is] enabling attackers to perform banking fraud in over 60 countries including regions of Central and South America, Africa, Europe, and the Indo-Pacific. 
Although campaigns have traditionally been limited to Latin America, Spain and Portugal, X-Force observed recent campaigns impersonating Mexico’s Tax Administration Service (SAT), Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), Mexico’s Secretary of Administration and Finance, the Revenue Service of Argentina, and notably the South African Revenue Service (SARS)…
The updates made to the malware, in addition to the significant increase in banking applications across several nations, indicate that the Grandoreiro distributors are seeking to conduct campaigns and deliver malware on a global scale.”
Early this year, the Federal Police of Brazil, in collaboration with Interpol, the National Police in Spain, and Caixa Bank, announced five arrests and thirteen search and seizure actions in relation to the Grandoreiro phishing scam.
The criminal network is suspected of moving at least 3.6 million euros in fraudulent transactions since 2019.

New Solana Memecoin Devil Biden (DEVBIDEN) Will Explode 14,000% in 48 Hours - Should You Buy It?



                    

Devil Biden (DEVBIDEN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.



Currently, Devil Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Devil Biden could become the next viral memecoin.



In fact, many early Shiba Inu and Dogecoin investors have been pouring funds into this new Solana memecoin.



Devil Biden launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Devil Biden on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Devil Biden by entering its contract address – Hu1cFazfpaEFyJ3ETdotpTSBModCC4pJoCvVyLNiTKm7 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DEVBIDEN.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.It's been another boring week for Bitcoin but non-stop craziness for the rest of the industry.The price of Bitcoin broke above $70,000 on Monday but is now trading for $67,635, down about 2% over seven days.Its dip is in part due to news that defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox moved more than $9 billion worth of BTC to an unknown wallet yesterday, which caused the market to think that creditors were about to be repaid.Since then, the collapsed exchange's former CEO Mark Karpelès has reassured people that "there is no imminent sale of Bitcoins happening."In the Ethereum world, the second-biggest coin by market cap has not budged at all over the week—even following the historic approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last week.Ethereum's price currently stands at $3,798, according to CoinGecko. Analysts did say that the coin was due a bull run soon, though.But in the world of memes and alts, the action was non-stop.Firstly, Sahil Arora, a promoter who works with celebrities to launch crypto projects, launched a meme token with Caitlyn Jenner. The Solana-based project sent crypto Twitter into meltdown on its launch.Olympic gold medalist and member of the Kardashians then told Decrypt that she'd fallen out with Sahil, and that he owed her "lots of money."The token, JENNER, has since plunged and is trading at a big loss since its launch.But the circus surrounding the celebrity and her move into the crypto space helped push up other more established tokens in the meme space: Dogwifhat and FLOKI are both big winners this week, having surged by 15% and 14%, respectively.Dogwifhat is currently trading for $3.41; Ethereum-based FLOKI is priced at $0.0002588.In other news, former FTX executive Ryan Salame received 90 months in prison. And crypto exchange Gemini said Wednesday that it will pay out over $2 billion worth of digital assets to customers of its Earn lending program.In terms of big gains, Telegram-based "social clicker" game Notcoin's NOT token is the biggest winner of the week, having surged by 148% to $0.01354 in seven days.Hype around the project and its token took off since it launched "earnings missions" that enable players to passively earn crypto rewards by using the messaging app.It's now priced at $0.01285.Finally, the guilty verdict for former president Donald Trump dominated the end of the week. While the impact of the news on the broader market is being hotly debated, it was good news for meme coins dedicated to Trump—albeit after a notable plunge.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Crypto Analyst Predicts Huge Surge In Dogecoin's Value: 'Market Sentiment ... Is As Bearish As It Was In Early February' - Benzinga

Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez has forecasted a significant price increase for Dogecoin DOGE/USD.What Happened: According to a post on X on Friday, Martinez noted that Dogecoin's market sentiment is as bearish as it was before its previous surge in February."Market sentiment for #Dogecoin is as bearish as it was in early February, just before #DOGE skyrocketed by 200%!" he said.In early March, DOGE reached $0.18, following Bitcoin's BTC/USD rise after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs.Whales have also started moving large amounts of Dogecoin, with many transactions marked as purchases.Martinez tweeted that Dogecoin whales accumulated over 700 million DOGE in the last three days, valued at approximately $112 million.Also Read: Dogecoin Soars As Elon Musk's X Payments Gains Ground, Enthusiasts Rally With $800M BoostWhale Alert reported that around 1.5 billion DOGE were transferred anonymously over the past two days. Transactions included 420,696,969, 970,000,000 and 499,420,696 DOGE.Additionally, 90,000,000 DOGE were withdrawn from Robinhood and transferred to an unknown address, totaling 1.579 billion DOGE valued at $251,410,009.At press time, DOGE is trading at $0.1598, having risen by 2.89% after a 4.25% overnight drop.Why It Matters: Martinez's prediction comes amid significant movements in the Dogecoin market. Last month, a transfer of 120 million DOGE to Robinhood coincided with a 4.45% price surge for the cryptocurrency. Whale Alert's blockchain data highlighted this transfer, which was valued at approximately $18.5 million.Earlier in March, another significant prediction was made by a crypto analyst who suggested Dogecoin could surge over 200% and that it was "going to do something insane this cycle."Now Read: Forget Dogecoin And Shiba Inu — This Meme Coin Has Surged Nearly 70% In Just 24 HoursThis content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock

Global crypto investors population surpasses half-a-billion mark, study shows


    The cryptocurrency market and industry have seen exponential growth in the past decade, reaching new milestones every year. In 2024, the global crypto investors population unprecedently surpassed the half-a-billion mark, led by Asia and North America.



According to a recent study by Triple-A, there are 562 million crypto investors, up from 420 million in 2023. 



Moreover, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Singapore, and Turkey lead the global population of investors in cryptocurrencies. In particular, one-third of these investors are between 24 and 35 years old, and 326.8 million are in Asia.







Second place goes to North America, with 72.2 million people declaring ownership of these digital assets. Overall, the global crypto investor population represents 6.8% of the total global population.

Crypto investors population is higher than the United States population



Notably, the number of cryptocurrency investors has surpassed the United States population by a large margin. Furthermore, the 339.99 million U.S. citizens is just slightly larger than what the study revealed for Asia’s investors. United States population data is from Worldometers in 2023.



World’s top 5 larger populations (2023). Source: Worldometer



This evidences the relevancy of cryptocurrencies among the world’s population and how they can influence modern society from different perspectives. For example, crypto investors could, apparently, be already influencing this year’s United States presidential election.



Additionally, summing up the fourth and fifth countries with the largest population in 2023 still results in a smaller population than the reported global crypto investors’ crowd. Indonesia had 277.53 million people in 2023, while Pakistan had 240.58 million, totaling 518 million—a smaller “half-a-billion.”



However, this number only reflects the cryptocurrency investors identified by Known Your Customer (KYC) services. It is known that a relevant amount of crypto users are likely not identifiable by focusing on financial privacy, which is a fundamental human right highly recognized by respected global entities like the United Nations (UN).



Therefore, we can conclude that cryptocurrency enthusiasts are probably larger than the reported half a billion owners. A number is likely to grow within the expected bull market and increase crypto adoption as a means of payment.

Ethereum's bullish surge cools off - How much longer for $4k? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum shows signs of consolidation amid ETF hype, indicating no strong market direction.
Overall sentiment and technical indicators suggest that the consolidation phase has already begun.

Coming off the high of spot ETF hype, Ethereum’s [ETH] rally seems to be slowing down by the minute. What was an increase of 17% last week has turned to less than 1% this week. Is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency at risk of consolidating?
Let’s take a look.
The Ethereum derivatives data presents a mixed sentiment, potentially indicating a slowdown in Ethereum’s rally. The increased trading volume by 10.32% and open interest by 1.19% shows that traders are still quite active with ETH.
Source: Coinglass
Looking at the long/short ratios, we see a predominance of long positions over shorts, indicating that despite the slowdown, many traders are still betting on Ethereum’s bull run as ETFs get ready to start trading next week.
Source: Coinglass
Ether’s current liquidation pattern could signal that despite the predominant bullish sentiment, ETH is facing increased market caution. This typically precedes a short-term consolidation, as was seen from Bitcoin after breaking all-time highs earlier this year.
The ETH/USDt chart shows an incoming consolidation even more. After peaking around $3,980, Ethereum faced resistance and has since formed a consolidation pattern, generally fluctuating between $3,770 and $3,900.
Source: TradingView
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently reads at 51.43, indicating a neutral momentum that aligns with the ongoing price consolidation. 
This suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, providing no strong bias towards either bullish or bearish momentum in the near term.
From a technical analysis perspective, the key support level to watch is around $3,770, marked by several touches over the past few days, which have prevented further declines. 
On the upside, resistance is set near $4,000, where Ethereum has struggled to sustain upward movements.
Source: Santiment
Meanwhile, a notable peak in social dominance suggests a recent surge in discussions or interest around Ethereum, which is clearly driven by the ETF hype.

 The moving averages, however, show a downward trend in the long term, predicting an overall decreased interest level in Ethereum.
All in all, Ethereum is not at risk of consolidation. It is already consolidating.

Crypto Fraudster Gets Slammed: Ex-Banker Gets 41 Years In Prison


								In a landmark case highlighting the perils of unchecked cryptocurrency investments, Rashawn Russell, a former investment banker, has been sentenced to 41 months in federal prison.
The Eastern New York District Court handed down the sentence after Russell pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, marking a significant crackdown on digital asset fraud.

Cryptocurrency Fraud Scheme Busted
The Department of Justice estimates that Russell’s cryptocurrency fraud led to approximately $1.5 million in investor losses. His sentencing is part of a broader DOJ initiative to combat rising fraud, which has seen a notable increase in recent years.
Russell’s scheme, which ran from November 2020 to August 2022, targeted friends, former college classmates, and co-workers. With the help of his experience in the industry and his registration as a broker, Russell raised money for his R3 Crypto Fund.
He enticed investors with guarantees of a 25% return and even suggested potential gains of up to 100%, exploiting the widespread excitement and trust in digital currency investments. To maintain the facade of legitimacy, Russell fabricated documents, including doctored bank statements and fake wire transfer confirmations.
These fraudulent documents misled investors about the status and profitability of their investments. In reality, Russell used a portion of the funds to repay earlier investors in a classic Ponzi scheme manner, while diverting substantial amounts for personal expenses and gambling.
The unraveling of Russell’s scheme began with his arrest in April 2023. Further investigations revealed that between September 2021 and June 2023, Russell had acquired nearly 100 credit and debit cards under other people’s names, intending to use them for fraudulent transactions.
This additional layer of criminal activity prompted the revocation of his bail in February 2024, as it became evident that Russell continued his fraudulent behavior even under home detention.

DOJ’s Recent Crackdown Efforts




The DOJ has intensified its fight against fraud and illicit activities, with the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) leading the charge. The agency is targeting crypto exchanges that facilitate criminal activities such as money laundering and investment scams by allowing criminals to easily profit from their crimes and cash out.
The department has been actively pursuing investment scams, known as “pig butchering” schemes, where scammers build relationships with victims over a period of months. In April 2023, the agency seized over $112 million in crypto investments from six such scams.
The DOJ is also focusing on cross-chain bridges, which have been a prime target for malicious attacks, and aims to tackle theft and hacks in the decentralized finance (DeFi) realm. The DOJ’s efforts are not only aimed at combating crypto fraud but also at building infrastructure for a potential future where the Federal Reserve (Fed) introduces its own digital currency at the consumer level, potentially leading to a cashless society.
The FBI estimates that $3.31 billion was stolen from people through investment fraud in 2022, with crypto-related scams accounting for over $2.5 billion of that figure. The DOJ has seen a significant rise in crypto-related criminal incidents over the past four years, with a 183% jump in cryptocurrency scams from 2021 to 2023, representing $2.57 billion in one year.

Sell-off alert as 4 trillion SHIB sent to exchanges in two weeks


    In the past two weeks, over 4 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, valued at more than $103 million, have been deposited into various cryptocurrency exchanges. 



This significant movement suggests a potential profit-taking spree and has raised concerns about increased selling pressure on the popular memecoin.



Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently posted on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that these tokens have been transferred to exchanges within the last two weeks, indicating that investors might be preparing for a significant sell-off.











On-chain metrics indicate selling activity



To verify the rising selling pressure on Shiba Inu, Finbold analyzed on-chain metrics using data from Santiment. The analysis revealed a significant spike in SHIB’s exchange outflow last week, accompanied by an increase in supply on exchanges and a decrease in supply outside of exchanges.

These metrics suggest that investors are actively selling their SHIB holdings, with even whales participating in this trend. This was evident from a slight drop in SHIB supply held by top addresses over the last seven days.



Given the heightened selling pressure, further analysis was conducted to assess SHIB’s future price trajectory.



Finbold retrieved data from Santiment showing SHIB’s NVT (Network Value to Transactions) ratio rising again, indicating the asset might be overvalued and suggesting a potential price decline. 



Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) is close to 71, indicating an overbought condition.

As of writing, Shiba Inu’s price noted a 0.39% fall in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.00002532 with a weekly gain of 3%.



Coinglass data indicates that SHIB’s futures open interest (OI) has spiked to notable levels in recent months, underscoring increased investor interest in the asset. This increased interest aligns with the heightened on-chain activity indicated above.



The transfer of 4 trillion SHIB to exchanges amidst Shiba Inu’s otherwise impressive bull run has stirred considerable debate within the crypto community. 



The dog-themed memecoin, which saw a 144% rise this year, faces the possibility of significant sell-offs due to profit-taking behavior by investors.



Initially trading near $0.000009 at the beginning of the year, SHIB reached a peak of $0.000035 in March before declining. 



As the market watches closely, Shiba Inu’s future price movements remain uncertain. The substantial transfer of SHIB to exchanges underscores potential sell-off intentions, and investors should brace for possible further declines.

BONK: Analyst Predicts Stellar Rise For The Solana Memecoin


																The meme coin market is back in the spotlight, and BONK is no exception. The dog-themed token has seen a price surge of over 40% in the last month, mirroring a broader trend among its rival meme coins.

	Related Reading


This recent rally comes amidst positive sentiment surrounding the crypto market, fueled in part by the long-awaited approval of an Ethereum ETF. Analysts are cautiously optimistic about BONK’s future, with some predicting a potential return to its all-time high.
Analyst Bullish On New ATH For BONK
Renowned crypto analyst CryptoJack has been tracking BONK’s price movement closely. In a recent analysis, he highlighted that the coin is following a bullish pattern he outlined earlier.

However, CryptoJack emphasizes the importance of a crucial support level – visualized as an “orange zone” on charts. If BONK can maintain its position above this zone, the analyst predicts a potential breakout and a surge towards new all-time highs (ATHs).

BONK’s all-time high of $0.00004547, reached in March 2024, currently sits about 25% above the current price. While this historical peak suggests room for growth, some experts remain cautious. Technical analysis, the method CryptoJack employs, relies on past price movements to predict future trends, but it’s not a foolproof science.

Meme Coin Frenzy: Booms And Whimpers
The meme coin market has a reputation for being driven more by hype and social media trends than by underlying fundamentals. This can lead to explosive price increases, but also to equally dramatic crashes. Remember “Dogefather” Elon Musk’s offhand tweets sending Dogecoin prices into a frenzy, only to see them plummet just as quickly? BONK is not immune to such influences.
BONK market cap currently at $2.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com
BONK Price Forecast
Meanwhile, based on the current price prediction, Bonk is anticipated to rise by an impressive 226%, reaching $0.000112 by July 1, 2024. This substantial increase suggests a highly bullish long-term outlook despite the current bearish sentiment indicated by technical indicators.

	Related Reading


The Fear & Greed Index, currently at 72, points towards a high level of greed in the market. This index measures market sentiment and a reading of 72 indicates that investors are exhibiting strong buying behavior, possibly driven by the expectation of future gains.
However, such high levels of greed can often lead to overbought conditions, where the asset’s price may be inflated beyond its intrinsic value, raising the risk of a sharp correction.

ChatGPT-4o predicts XRP's price after rollout of Ripple's stablecoin


    Blockchain company Ripple plans to roll out a stablecoin to take on established players such as Tether (USDT), which dominates the sector. 



Notably, a section of the market believes that the rollout of a Ripple stablecoin will likely impact the price of XRP, which has largely traded in consolidation below $1, failing to catch up with peers such as Bitcoin (BTC).



In this context, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o, to understand how XRP will trade if Ripple finally rolls out a stablecoin.







Factors affecting XRP’s price 



The tool offered a speculative analysis of the potential impact of Ripple’s stablecoin on the price of XRP. According to the tool, introducing a Ripple-backed stablecoin is expected to generate considerable market buzz.



Stablecoins, known for enhancing liquidity and facilitating more transactions within a network, could significantly bolster XRP’s utility and attractiveness. If the stablecoin sees strong adoption, it could lead to a surge in positive sentiment around XRP.



At the same time, the AI platform noted that Ripple’s legal battles, particularly with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), remain a critical factor. A favorable resolution to these legal issues could significantly enhance investor confidence in XRP. Conversely, continued regulatory challenges could dampen market enthusiasm.



The tool also pointed out that besides the stablecoin impact, Ripple’s strategic partnerships and the adoption of its technologies by financial institutions play a crucial role. Increased integration of Ripple’s solutions into the financial sector could drive up demand for XRP. Additionally, broader cryptocurrency market trends will inevitably impact XRP.



ChatGPT-4o XRP price prediction 



With XRP’s current trading price at $0.52, ChatGPT-4o outlined two possible scenarios for the price trajectory if the stablecoin is unveiled. In a scenario where the stablecoin launch is highly successful, leading to increased liquidity and adoption, coupled with a favorable regulatory environment and a bullish crypto market, XRP could see a significant rise from $0.80 to $1.20 in the short to medium term.



Alternatively, if the stablecoin launch fails to generate substantial interest or if Ripple encounters adverse regulatory outcomes, the price of XRP could decline. In a bearish market or under adverse news, XRP could fall from $0.30 to $0.40.

XRP price analysis



As of press time, XRP was trading at $0.52, having registered gains of about 0.65% over the last 24 hours. However, the asset has suffered notable losses on the weekly chart, dropping by over 3% and failing to breach the $0.55 resistance level.

Currently, the $0.50 mark holds significant importance for the asset, as it has recently served as both support and resistance. The price must hold above this level and gain momentum to validate any bullish trend.

Franklin Templeton Embraces Long-Term Strategy with SEC Amid Changing Regulatory Landscape



                    

Financial innovators are taking a long-term approach with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, deems appropriate.



“The SEC, like a lot of regulatory bodies, likes to rely on legal precedents. […] Those precedents are being set in courts of law oftentimes, so this is just the process we’re engaged in,” Bayston told Cointelegraph’s Turner Wright at the Consensus event.




Despite skepticism about the SEC’s “open door” policy, Bayston viewed the agency’s actions as protecting the economy and manageable:



“We wouldn’t be in the business for 76 years — the business of trust — if we didn’t have some discipline and persistence and collaborative behavior with the global regulators we face.”



Bayston noted that things are evolving at the SEC, comparing this year to last. “We’ve been pleasantly engaged with the SEC […] and we’re excited as they shift and change their tone,” he said.




Franklin Templeton launched its Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (the “Benji”) in 2023, but the journey took nearly five years, involving educating the SEC on blockchain technology’s role in mutual funds.



Bayston likened tokenized money funds to stablecoins. 



The saver provides money to the operator, who invests it and returns the principal while keeping the profit from the investments.

“Banks and money funds have existed side-by-side for multiple decades. 



“I think this is the same construct that is likely to move forward,” Bayston said.



Franklin Templeton is optimistic about cryptocurrency, according to Bayston:



“We believe in the technologies and therefore we believe that the [crypto] tokens, properly structured, represent value for these technologies.”



He compared crypto’s significance to investment portfolios to that of technology stocks 30 years ago.



Franklin Templeton filed its application with the SEC for a spot Ether exchange-traded fund later than others. 



Initially, the SEC delayed a decision on the application until June 11 but approved it along with others on May 23.



Bayston was not surprised by the timing. They were “not trying to give anybody an advantage in this nascent marketplace,” he said.

LATAM Crypto Roundup: Top Curated News from Latin America


BeInCrypto comprehensive Latam Crypto Roundup brings the most important news and trends across Latin America. With reporters in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and more, we cover the latest updates and insights from the region’s crypto scene.
This week’s roundup includes AI initiatives in Argentina, Worldcoin’s expansion in Colombia, new crypto features by Brazil’s largest neobank, and other stories.
Argentina’s Javier Milei Meets with Open AI CEO Sam Altman
President Javier Milei met with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during his first visit to San Francisco, aiming to position Argentina as a hub for artificial intelligence (AI). The hour-long meeting was viewed by its organizers as a crucial opportunity to attract new investments. This event occurs amid potential legal restrictions faced by technology entrepreneurs in the United States.
On his official X account, President Milei shared a photo with Altman, expressing his enthusiasm for the opportunities offered by a “libertarian” Argentina. Although Altman generally avoids formal contact with other leaders, he made an exception for Milei, attracted by his passionate defense of capitalism and economic freedom.
Milei and his team criticize European regulations for stifling innovation and view Argentina as fertile ground for technological growth. They believe the country could join the United States, China, and Europe as a leading hub for AI development, thanks to its commitment to economic freedom and minimal regulation.

Popular LATAM Arbitrage Platform Has Been Accused of Fraud
Solesbot, an arbitrage platform popular in Venezuela and Colombia, bills itself as an artificial intelligence-based trading bot that operates in cryptocurrency markets. Its proposal is simple: users deposit funds in a linked account and the bot is in charge of buying and selling cryptocurrencies in different exchanges taking advantage of small price differences to generate profits. 

However, several members of the crypto community in Latin America have raised concerns, labeling it a Ponzi scheme. The pseudonymous developer CryptoSoftDev shared an extensive thread on his X account (formerly Twitter) detailing the platform’s operations.
First, he revealed that Solesbot operates on BSC. He then pointed out that when a user deposits USDT, it goes to one of five “collector” wallets on BSC. These wallets transfer the funds to a “distributing” wallet, intended to pay users requesting withdrawals.

“Reviewing in more detail the ‘COLLECTOR’ wallets, we noticed some infrequent operations, but of very high amounts, for example this one, 345 thousand $ in a single transfer to another wallet 4 days ago. BINGO, we have the ‘DRAINER’ wallet,” CryptoSoftDev pointed out.

CryptoSoftDev noted that the funds received by the “drainer” wallet are sent to Binance and then returned to Solesbot in the form of Ethereum (ETH), “totaling +$900k between them all.”
Despite analysts’ warnings, Solesbot continues to attract followers. Many investors claim it is possible to earn income through the platform, yet the red flags remain.

The company will operate as an international Bitcoin mining hub from El Salvador, implementing a decentralization strategy by installing miners of all sizes to expand its mining reach.
Additionally, Ocean Mining will continue to support Bitcoin education in the country at locations such as El Zonte. A few months ago, Blockstream CEO Adam Back stated that El Salvador’s mining infrastructure would make it “an economic powerhouse,” describing Bitcoin as the evolution of “digital gold.”
Bitcoin mining in El Salvador has garnered global attention. Last January, the Bitcoin NGO “My First Bitcoin” received a new grant from Dorsey’s Block. The non-profit organization will use the funds to scale its digital platform and expand its offerings into new languages.

China Dumps $101,900,000,000 in US Treasuries in 12 Months As Fed Governor Dismisses 'Imminent Demise' of US Dollar - The Daily Hodl


								New numbers show China has sold $101.9 billion in US Treasury securities over the past 12 months.
The Treasury Department says China cut its holdings from $869.3 billion in March of last year to $767.4 billion in March of this year.










China’s holdings have steadily dropped from an all-time high of $1.31 trillion, which was set in November of 2013.
The news comes as China shifts away from the dollar in cross-border trade and as the global economic alliance known as BRICS contemplates the launch of a digital competitor to the US dollar.
The developments are not going unnoticed at the Federal Reserve.
At a recent conference on the global importance of the US dollar, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the demise of the dollar is exaggerated, but acknowledged the role of the world’s reserve currency is evolving.
“There has for some time been commentary predicting the dollar is destined for demise – potentially an imminent demise…
The role of the US in the world economy is changing, and finance is always changing. The dollar remains by far the most widely used currency by a number of metrics.”
Waller points to America’s use of sanctions against foreign nations as a factor in the dollar’s future dominance.
“If these sanctions and policies are long-lasting, the shifting cross-border payments landscape – including the rapid growth of digital currencies – could also pose challenges to the dominant role of the US dollar.”
Back in February, Waller said despite the challenges, nations have “few practical alternatives to the dollar,” noting that “in times of global stress, the world runs to the dollar, not away from it.”

‘We Have To Be About More Than Speculation’: Ripple CEO Questions Whether Dogecoin Has Been Good for Crypto - The Daily Hodl


								Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse doesn’t think that the leading meme token Dogecoin (DOGE) helps crypto.
While speaking at Consensus, Garlinghouse laments that the United States “represents the bottom decile of regulatory clarity” for digital assets and acknowledges that it’s difficult to predict when institutional money will provide upside opportunity for the crypto sector.










The Ripple CEO says the path forward for crypto has to be centered on solving real problems.
“We have to be about more than speculation. I get a ton of shit when I say these things, but I’m going to say it anyway. I don’t think Dogecoin has been a good thing for the industry. And I’m not anti-Dogecoin, but I don’t know what the use case is. I don’t know [if there are] projects being built to solve real utility. And I see lots of real utility across lots of different chains, and I think that is what’s critical.”
DOGE is trading at $0.159 at time of writing, a fractional decrease in the past 24 hours.
Ripple made headlines earlier this week after the San Francisco-based payments firm donated another $25 million to Fairshake, a federal political action committee (PAC) dedicated to supporting pro-crypto candidates during the election. The firm also made a $25 million contribution to the super PAC last year.

Black Doge (BLADOGE) Coin Will Skyrocket 14,000% Before KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Black Doge (BLADOGE) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Black Doge (BLADOGE), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BLADOGE will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Black Doge.



Currently, Black Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BLADOGE on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Black Doge by entering its contract address – 2PE8dLsJa64vymp3RU35wdFYataxZC6dA2rx162CF7pu – in the receiving field.




BLADOGE currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Whale Investments into Bitcoin Hit $100 Billion In 2024, Fueling Insane Investor Optimism ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
In a notable development, data from analytics firm Cryptoquant reveals that whale investors poured a staggering $100 billion into Bitcoin in the first half of 2024.



This revelation, made on Friday by Julio Moreno, head of research at the firm, highlighted a significant trend of wealthy investors accumulating Bitcoin, likely through over-the-counter (OTC) deals, sidestepping conventional exchanges.



Notably, OTC deals, which facilitate direct transactions between parties, have become a preferred avenue for acquiring substantial amounts of Bitcoin, with notable entities like MicroStrategy engaging in such transactions to bolster their corporate treasury strategies.



Moreno’s disclosure coincides with observations from Ki Young Ju, the firm’s CEO, who drew parallels between current market dynamics and those of mid-2020 and in February 2019 when similar patterns of high on-chain activity preceded a remarkable surge in Bitcoin’s value reinforcing the notion of whale activity as a strong bullish indicator. Particularly, this year’s remarkable accumulation could be attributed to the green light given to several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, opening avenues for traditional investors to dabble with crypto asset investments.



Moreover, data from the same firm also indicated a surge in Bitcoin accumulation addresses over the past month, reflecting growing investor interest despite stable prices.

&nbsp



“Despite stable prices and relatively modest growth compared to previous months, there has been a notable increase in the number of new participating accumulation addresses. This phenomenon indicates that even with Bitcoin experiencing price stability, investor sentiment remains bullish. More investors are eager to join the ranks of buyers and invest in Bitcoin,” the firm wrote 







Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price experienced consolidation towards the end of May, partly due to concerns regarding recent outflows from Mt. Gox addresses to a new wallet address in preparation for distribution. However, reassurances from Mt. Gox trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi regarding pending repayments have injected a semblance of stability into the market.



That said, against this backdrop, the crypto community anticipates a robust rally in the second half of the year. Analysts such as “Mags” point to historical precedents, suggesting that periods of sideways movement often precede significant price surges.



“[Bitcoin] broke out above the last monthly resistance in March and has since transformed that level into support…Last year, from March to September, the price remained stagnant for seven months before breaking out and surging by 178%. Therefore, despite the apparent monotony, this sort of sideways movement typically precedes a significant rally. If we witness a similar 178% surge upon breaking out of the current range, we could be looking at $188,000,” wrote Mags.







Elsewhere, “Crypto Caesar” proposed a target of $79,579 for Bitcoin based on an observed inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. According to his analysis, the price has broken above the neckline, and he is currently verifying it as a support level.







Bitcoin traded at $67,701 at press time, reflecting a 0.63% drop over the past 24 hours.

Memeinator price prediction, can MMTR beat Dogecoin (DOGE)? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Dogecoin (DOGE) faces competition as MMTR gains traction and attracts major investors.
Market sentiment points to Memeinator (MMTR) potentially retesting $0.04 before end of this month.
Memeinator is currently listed on Uniswap and MEXC after a successful public presale round.

With the recent surge of meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) capturing the attention of investors worldwide, one particular contender, Memeinator (MMTR), has been generating significant buzz especially after its recent listing on Uniswap and MEXC crypto exchanges.
This article delves into the Memeinator (MMTR) price prediction and whether it stands a chance against the reigning meme coin champion, Dogecoin (DOGE).
Memeinator performance after listing on Uniswap and MEXC
Memeinator’s recent listing on the MEXC exchange has generated significant buzz within the crypto community.
Since its debut on May 29, 2024, MMTR has experienced a rollercoaster ride of price fluctuations. Initially skyrocketing above $0.047, MMTR’s price has since retraced, currently hovering around $0.02409 on MEXC.

Despite the slight dip in value, MMTR’s trading volume remains impressive, with 24-hour trading volume reaching $14.25 million on MEXC alone.
Additionally, trading on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap contributes to MMTR’s liquidity, with a 24-hour trading volume of $78.3K.
These figures highlight MMTR’s growing popularity and investor interest, setting the stage for its potential ascent in the meme coin arena.
Memeinator price forecast
MMTR’s price movements on MEXC provide valuable insights into its market dynamics.
Despite experiencing an 8.30% decline in value, MMTR’s trading volume remains robust, indicating active participation from investors.
The coin’s 24-hour high and low prices of $0.02680 and $0.02271, respectively, illustrate the price volatility characteristic of meme coins.
Moreover, MMTR’s price surge on its first day of trading underscores investor optimism and appetite for this emerging cryptocurrency.
However, market sentiment suggests that Memeinator (MMTR) could retest the $0.04 level before aiming for $0.1 by the year’s end, signaling bullish expectations for its future performance.
Comparing Memeinator (MMTR) to Dogecoin (DOGE)
Despite Dogecoin’s established position and endorsement from influential figures like Elon Musk, MMTR’s recent developments hint at its potential to challenge DOGE’s dominance.
While Dogecoin boasts a vibrant community and widespread adoption for tipping purposes, MMTR distinguishes itself with innovative features like the Memescanner and the Memeinator game, offering genuine utility beyond meme trading.
Moreover, MMTR’s price performance, trading volume, and market sentiment indicate growing investor confidence, positioning it as a formidable competitor to Dogecoin’s throne.
After all, MMTR is already trading above Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), Pepe (PEPE), and Floki (FLOKI), all of which have been making waves within the meme coins’ space lately. Going by its current price, MMTR’s eyes are now on Dogecoin and Dogwifhat (WIF).

Uniswap’s Fee Switch Delay Triggers 5% Drop in UNI Token


Uniswap, the decentralized exchange platform, has indefinitely postponed its fee switch proposal, sparking a significant decline in the UNI token.
Following the announcement, UNI dropped over 5%, sinking below $10, and extending a week-long slide of around 10%.
Uniswap Suspends Fee Switch Vote

On May 31, the Uniswap Foundation announced the delay in a social media post, citing new concerns raised by an unnamed stakeholder. The organization highlighted the need for thorough due diligence due to the irreversible and sensitive nature of the proposed upgrade. 

“Over the last week, a stakeholder raised a new issue relating to this work that requires additional diligence on our end to fully vet. Due to the immutable nature and sensitivity of our proposed upgrade, we have made the difficult decision to postpone posting this vote. This was unexpected, and we apologize for the postponement,” the Foundation stated.

The foundation did not specify a new timeline for the vote or disclose further details about the issues raised. However, it said it would “keep the community apprised of any material changes.”
The postponement has not been well-received within the crypto community. Critics argue that the governance process is being manipulated, while others see the delay as a threat to decentralization. Dan Robinson, a general partner at Paradigm, accused the Uniswap Foundation of succumbing to pressure from a venture capital firm. 

“It’s disappointing to see a large VC try to bully the token governance process and delay community proposals at the last minute in order to advance their own pet projects,” Robinson wrote.

Uniswap’s fee switch proposal has been a topic of extensive debate for years. Previous tries have stalled due to fears of violating US securities laws. The latest proposal, introduced in February, aims to incentivize governance participation by rewarding UNI token holders. Despite unanimous community support, the initiative faces potential legal challenges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
As the community waits for more updates, this situation tests Uniswap’s dedication to being open and following decentralized principles. The result will impact not just Uniswap’s future, but also set an example for other decentralized finance projects facing similar regulatory challenges.

Bitcoin Retreats After Failing To Break Crucial $72,983 Resistance


																Following the failure to break above the $72,983 resistance level, the price of Bitcoin has continued to drop. Although Bitcoin’s price is still trading above the 1-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), this rejection has led to the crypto asset dropping from $71,942 to $66,785 and moving below the SMA both in the 1-hour and the 4-hour chart. This drop below the SMA could trigger a change of character and the price will go bearish. 
As of the time of writing the price of Bitcoin was trading at around $67,635 and was up by 0.14% with a market capitalization of over $1.3 trillion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $25 billion. Its market capitalization and trading volume are both down by 1.14% and 6.07% respectively in the last 24 hours.
Bitcoin Price Conditions In 4-Hour And 1-Day Chart 
From the 4-hour timeframe, BTC has dropped below the simple moving average. This indicates that the price of BTC might begin to move downward from this point. 

The 1-hour MACD also indicates that BTC could go bearish as the MACD histograms are trending below the zero line.  Also, the MACD line and the signal have crossed each other trending below the MACD zero line. 
From the 1-day chart, it can be observed that BTC‘s price is moving toward the 100-day simple moving average. The 1-day MACD also creates a formation suggesting that Bitcoin’s price might go bearish, as the histograms are already trending below the MACD zero line. 

The MACD line and the MACD signal line have crossed each other and are heading toward the MACD zero line. Examining the price formations and that of MACD from both timeframes, BTC could make a huge drop and probably start a bearish trend.
A Path To New All-Time High On The Horizon?
Currently, there is one major resistance level $73,203, and two major support levels $60,146 and $50,604. If the price of Bitcoin goes bearish as predicted, it will start to move downward toward the $60,146 support level. 
Should it break below this level, it could move further to test the $50,604 support level. Also, there are other support levels below $67,635, which BTC could move on to test if there is a break below the $60,146 and $50,604 support levels.
However, given that the digital asset fails to break below any of the support levels mentioned above, it will begin to move upward toward its previous resistance level of $73,203. Meanwhile, if it breaks above this level, it might start a new rally possibly to create a new high.

GALA’s price is still consolidating within the triangle, building up momentum for a potential breakout. Based on the descending triangular pattern the price of GALA is forming, it could either break above or break below.
In this article, we will see the possible price actions when a potential breakout from the triangle occurs and how far it could move.

On the 1-day time frame, the price of GALA is actively bearish as it is seen trading below 1-Day SMA dropping a bearish candlestick.

The 1-Day MACD indicator is also giving a bearish sign as the MACD histograms are going smaller in size, which means buyers are gradually losing momentum in the market. Also, the MACD signal line is attempting to cross below the MACD line and the MACD zero line.
Potential Price Actions In The Event Of A Breakout
Conclusively, if there is a break out above the descending triangle pattern, GALA will begin a move upward toward the $0.06899 resistance level. If the price breaks this resistance level, It could rise even higher to test the resistance level of $0.08714.
On the contrary, should prices break below the descending triangle pattern in continuation of its downtrend, the price might begin to move toward the $0.02041 support level. if this level fails to withstand the price, It could drop more toward the $0.01293 support level to test it.

Dogeverse Presale Ends Monday - Experts Call It The Next Big Meme Coin


This article was paid for*
The buzzworthy Dogeverse presale is set to end in less than 2 days, causing significant FOMO amongst meme coin investors. The ICO has already raised over $15 million in its ICO, with both whales and retail traders among those buying the meme coin early. 
The Dogeverse launch date has also been set for June 5th at 10 AM UTC. 

Experts believe that the meme coin could deliver explosive price action immediately after its IEO, with some suggesting that 10x gains could be within reach in June. In the long term, analysts project that even 100x returns are a real probability. 
Dogeverse – Next Big Meme Coin?
Dogeverse is not an ordinary dog-themed meme coin. Rather, experts believe that its success could give birth to a new meta in the meme token industry. 
Dogeverse is the first true multi-chain meme coin – one that has been built on 6 different blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon. Solana, Base, Avalanche and BNB Smart Chain. 
Even its mascot – Cosmos, the chain-hopping Doge – is a representation of the token’s multi-chain interoperability. 
This strategy is particularly effective in maximizing Dogeverse’s visibility to potential investors. Every blockchain has its own set of popular DEXs, CEXs and on-chain tracking tools. For instance, Ethereum has Uniswap while Solana has Jupiter and Birdeye. 
Price tracking apps such as DEXTools and DEX Screener track tokens belonging to several different chains. 
Owing to its multi-chain status, Dogeverse is set to launch on all the aforementioned platforms. Rumours have it that Tier-1 centralized exchanges could also rush to list this new meme coin on their platforms, owing to its strong community backing and high upside potential.

Joe Biden has vetoed bill aimed at overturning SEC crypto accounting standards - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Biden vetoes bill targeting SEC crypto rules, citing concerns over regulatory authority.
Crypto industry criticizes Biden’s decision, calls it setback for innovation and financial freedom.
The veto raises questions about Biden’s stance on crypto regulation and engagement with industry.

U.S. President Joe Biden has taken a decisive stance in the ongoing debate surrounding cryptocurrency regulation by vetoing the bill that aimed at overturning a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation regarding crypto accounting standards.
The regulation in question, known as SAB 121, set specific guidelines for firms holding cryptocurrency assets, requiring them to record these assets as liabilities on their balance sheets.
Joe Biden upholds SEC’s authority over accounting practices
In an official statement dated May 31st, President Biden emphasized the importance of maintaining the SEC’s authority over accounting practices, stating that a reversal of the SEC’s decision could potentially undermine broader regulatory efforts aimed at protecting consumers and investors.
Biden’s veto underscores his administration’s commitment to implementing regulatory guardrails that ensure the safety and stability of financial markets while also acknowledging the potential benefits of crypto-asset innovation.
As previously reported, the bill, which sought to repeal the SEC’s cryptocurrency accounting guidelines, had garnered bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.
However, despite the House passing the measure with a 228-182 vote and the Senate voting 60 to 38 in favor of the repeal, the veto requires a two-thirds majority from both houses to be overturned.
Backlash over Biden’s decision to veto the bill
The decision to veto the bill has sparked immediate backlash from various quarters, particularly within the cryptocurrency industry.
Critics argue that the veto represents a setback for innovation and financial freedom, with some describing it as a “slap in the face” to those advocating for a more flexible regulatory approach.
The Blockchain Association, a prominent crypto advocacy group, expressed disappointment with the administration’s decision, highlighting the bipartisan consensus reached in both chambers of Congress.
Similarly, Cody Carbone, Chief Policy Officer at the Digital Chamber, disparaged the veto, emphasizing its potential chilling effect on innovation within the crypto space.
The veto has also raised concerns within the crypto community regarding the administration’s stance on cryptocurrency regulation.
Despite speculation that the Biden campaign had been engaging with crypto industry stakeholders to adopt a more pro-crypto stance, the veto suggests a different approach.
In response to the veto, Moe Vela, a senior advisor to Unicoin and former senior advisor to Biden, called for a more nuanced discussion on the integration of crypto into the financial system, urging both candidates to articulate their perspectives and plans for the future of crypto regulation.
Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council, expressed displeasure with the veto, suggesting that publicly stated positions on crypto regulation could be difficult to walk back once articulated.
As the cryptocurrency regulation debate continues in the U.S., all eyes now turn to both houses to see whether they can raise a two-third majority too overturn the president’s veto.

VanEck's Bitcoin Bull CEO: "Crypto Investments Are Experiencing Historic Change" - Bitcoin Sistemi


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s approval of a rule change allowing Ethereum ETFs could mark a historic shift in cryptocurrency investing, according to VanEck CEO Jan van Eck.
Van Eck, who follows developments in the cryptocurrency market closely, called the SEC's move “one of the most surprising things he has seen regarding securities regulation in his career.”


VanEck became the first company to apply to the SEC for permission to list its proposed Ethereum ETF. With initial approval in place, the company can now begin the process of bringing the product to market, although the exact timeline remains unclear.
VanEck expressed concern about the risk of the SEC losing regulatory authority over digital assets. “The first reaction was that the ETF approval was given the green light,” he said, implying that there was a bigger event going on in the background.






According to Van Eck, the excitement around Ethereum this May means the emergence of clearer regulation and increased investor interest in crypto. His company claimed in a statement on its website that “the evidence clearly shows that ETH is a decentralized commodity and not a security.”
Additionally, VanEck CEO stated that the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology Act for the 21st Century, or FIT21, by Parliament on May 8 is another important step towards regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies. However, he remains skeptical about the bill reaching the Senate before the elections.

DOT Gains Steam, TRX Expands DeFi, BDAG Presale Up 850%


Crypto Whales Flock To BlockDAG As It Observes A 850% Surge While Polkadot, and Tron Face Market Troubles
The crypto market is abuzz with significant movements, especially from Polkadot and Tron. Polkadot demonstrates solid bullish trends by stabilizing above $7.40, backed by robust support. Tron, on the other hand, is broadening its reach in the DeFi sector, pulling in an increasing number of users and boosting transaction volumes. Amid these developments, BlockDAG Network emerges as a focal point with an 850% jump in its presale earning $38.3 million, promising a bright future. Thanks to its strategic marketing and cutting-edge technology, BlockDAG is carving out a unique position in today’s crypto scene.
Polkadot Price Prospects: Could DOT Hit $8.20?
Polkadot (DOT) is riding a wave of strong bullish momentum, maintaining its uplift above the $7.40 threshold against the US Dollar. After vaulting over the $7.20 resistance, it touched a peak at $7.69, before cementing its value above $7.40 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. With a solid base at $7.40 and immediate resistance at $7.70, the scene is set.
If it breaks past $7.80, it could usher in additional rises, potentially pushing the price to $8.20 or beyond. Conversely, if it slips below $7.70, it might retract towards $7.00 or dip further to $6.80. The hourly MACD and RSI indicators point to a bullish trend, suggesting a promising future and escalating interest in Polkadot.
Tron’s Growing Influence in DeFi
Tron (TRX) continues to make headway in the crypto sphere. Its blockchain is designed to decentralize the internet and empower content creators to manage their data fully. Tron’s Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism offers a greener alternative to traditional Proof of Work (PoW) systems, with TRX facilitating transactions, staking, and governance.
Recent expansions into decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Tron network have drawn more users and increased transactions. This expansion is further bolstered by strategic partnerships and integrations, enhancing Tron’s ecosystem and overall utility, cementing its role as a strong and scalable platform in the crypto market
BlockDAG’s Marketing Mastery Behind an 850% Presale Surge
BlockDAG’s ongoing presale has indelibly stamped its mark in the annals of crypto history. The BDAG coin, beginning at $0.001 in the first batch, has surged an impressive 850% to $0.0095 by batch 16. This staggering rise heralds BlockDAG as a top contender for 2024, much credited to its savvy marketing tactics.
The promotional saga began with a spellbinding event at Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing, rolling out BlockDAG’s ambitious roadmap and decentralized ecosystem to crypto aficionados. This was followed by a celebratory event at the Las Vegas Sphere for the launch of BlockDAG’s technical whitepaper, addressing the blockchain trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization. The crescendo of excitement peaked at London’s Piccadilly Circus, celebrating BlockDAG’s listing on CoinMarketCap and forecasting an incredible 30,000x ROI for early backers.
These showcases, alongside BlockDAG’s debut on major DeFi exchanges and the launch of a user-friendly crypto payment card, have significantly elevated investor trust. With a robust $100 million liquidity plan in motion, BlockDAG’s presale journey is poised for legendary status.

Final Thoughts
While Polkadot and Tron forge ahead with significant technological advancements and market performance, BlockDAG stands out with its remarkable $38.3 million presale success and strategic endeavors. Polkadot’s steady gains and Tron’s DeFi expansion underscore their potential for growth. Yet, BlockDAG’s 850% presale boost and innovative solutions to the blockchain challenges showcase its potential to leave a lasting mark on the crypto world. As the market evolves, BlockDAG positions itself as a formidable contender in the burgeoning space.

Putin Boss (PUTINBO) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Putin Boss (PUTINBO) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Putin Boss (PUTINBO), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PUTINBO will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Putin Boss.



Currently, Putin Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PUTINBO on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Putin Boss by entering its contract address – 34bBAvQ8kkQrP3LPVcmhLQKY9UJNUkK3dtq42m7DD7Ru – in the receiving field.



PUTINBO currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Coinbase Says SEC is 'Choking' Crypto Industry


Coinbase has intensified its push for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to initiate formal rulemaking for digital assets.
In its closing brief on May 31, the crypto exchange called on the appeals court to compel the financial regulator to establish clear regulations for the emerging industry.
Coinbase Challenges SEC’s Regulatory Approach

Coinbase asserts that the SEC’s enforcement strategy leaves crypto firms in a “Catch-22.” The exchange claims the SEC demands compliance with an overly broad interpretation of its authority while aggressively litigating against firms. Coinbase argues that the SEC imposes major policy changes through punitive measures, overstepping its bounds.
In its brief, Coinbase contends that the SEC’s approach violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which mandates rulemaking for significant policy shifts. The brief highlights that the SEC’s inconsistent policies on digital assets lack a coherent legal standard, making compliance unfeasible for the industry.

“The SEC has exploited [regulation-by-enforcement] approach to assert broad, yet ill-defined, jurisdiction over a new and dynamic industry, without articulating in advance its understanding of the law through rules vetted by public comment and pre-enforcement judicial review,” Coinbase stated.

Moreover, Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, reiterated this stance on social media, stressing the importance of the legal battle. He argued that the Commission has not provided substantive reasoning for rejecting the firm’s call for tailored regulations. Instead, Grewal claimed that the SEC is overreaching its authority without congressional authorization and establishing clear rules for the emerging digital asset industry.


“Remarkably, the SEC’s says – over and over again – that it doesn’t matter if the industry can comply with the rules. The SEC is bent on choking the digital asset industry, and is refusing to provide the necessary rules the industry has requested in order to tighten the squeeze,” Grewal asserted.

Coinbase filed its rulemaking petition against the SEC two years ago. Initially unresponsive to the petition, the regulator said it could not be forced to create specific crypto rules. However, Coinbase and other crypto stakeholders have consistently maintained that the lack of rules harms the industry. The result of this legal battle could greatly impact the future of digital assets in the US, influencing regulations for many years ahead.

Eminem's Spaghetti (EMINSPAG) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Eminem’s Spaghetti could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.



Eminem’s Spaghetti (EMINSPAG), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because EMINSPAG has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Eminem’s Spaghetti can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Eminem’s Spaghetti could become the next viral memecoin.



Eminem’s Spaghetti launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Eminem’s Spaghetti on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Eminem’s Spaghetti by entering its contract address – 2ZWPydBxNByXx8D7m2h8CiFkMpjgMWTsrztXLhw1bohd – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like EMINSPAG.

Bitcoin Poised for Exponential Growth by Emulating Ethereum's Playbook



                    

Bitcoin drawing inspiration from another blockchain may seem unlikely since it was the pioneer. Bitcoin inspired Litecoin, Dogecoin, Monero, and Ethereum, among others. 



However, over the past 15 years, the industry has evolved significantly. 




While Bitcoin’s dominance remains, the focus has shifted from simple “buy and hold” strategies to various methods of deploying digital assets for yield, revenue, and entertainment.



Most of this innovation has come from Ethereum and its multi-token, multi-chain ecosystem. Now, the trend is swinging back to Bitcoin. 



With the introduction of layer-2 solutions, native tokens, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Bitcoin has the potential to see significant growth in active users, total value locked (TVL), and active wallets.



Can Bitcoin replicate the growth Ethereum saw in 2017 and 2020, driven by initial coin offerings and DeFi? By adopting certain features of Ethereum, Bitcoin could experience exponential growth. 



A key feature is interoperability. Ethereum’s success with multi-tokenism is partly due to universal standards like ERC-20s, which are easily transferable between EVM chains. 



Bitcoin, however, faces issues with competing token standards and inscription methods, making its ecosystem more complex.



Bitcoin has several competing token issuance standards and a complex L2 ecosystem. Stacks is the largest Bitcoin L2, followed by the Lightning Network, among many others. 




For Bitcoin to become a hub for DeFi, NFTs, real-world assets (RWAs), and other on-chain uses, it needs to adopt universal standards that facilitate seamless value transfer between chains.



If Bitcoin developers collaborate instead of working in isolation, its ecosystem could grow significantly across metrics like daily active users and TVL. 




Bitcoin’s TVL of $1.15 billion is far behind Ethereum’s $65 billion.

However, Bitcoin’s current TVL is similar to Ethereum’s just before “DeFi summer,” suggesting potential for rapid growth.



In 2016, Ethereum’s ICO craze began, and by 2017, over 75% of crypto assets were based on Ethereum. By 2020, Ethereum shifted focus to DeFi and NFTs. 



Although Ethereum’s NFT sector has declined, Bitcoin Ordinals have gained traction, indicating a rebranding rather than a decline in NFTs.



The rise in BRC-20 tokens and network activity suggests Bitcoin could see similar growth patterns to Ethereum in 2018. With over 14,000 tokens built on Bitcoin, user perception of BTC’s value increases. 



Bitcoin might be on the verge of a parabolic breakout, with BRC-20 tokens’ market cap exceeding $2 trillion and significant growth in inscriptions.



Bitcoin developers should learn from Ethereum’s innovations to foster exponential growth. Despite potential regulatory challenges, even modest growth could significantly increase Bitcoin’s value. 



By adopting successful strategies from Ethereum, Bitcoin could transform into the world’s largest multi-token ecosystem by 2025.

Worrying Signs For XRP: Price Tumbles As Demand Dries Up


																Crypto investors are keeping a close eye on Ripple (XRP) as technical indicators paint a concerning picture for the altcoin’s price. After closing below its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) for four consecutive days, XRP has entered what many analysts interpret as a bearish zone.

	Related Reading


This technical indicator suggests a potential shift in market sentiment, with the average price of XRP over the past 20 days acting as a resistance level. With the current price trading below this key benchmark, analysts fear a decline in demand could be imminent.
At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.52, down 0.3% and 3.1% in the last 24 hours and seven days, respectively, data from Coingecko shows.
Demand For XRP Loses Steam
Adding fuel to the bearish fire are XRP’s momentum indicators, which provide insights into the strength and direction of price movements. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) are currently positioned below their neutral points. This suggests that buying pressure behind XRP is waning, with investors potentially looking to offload their holdings rather than accumulate more.
Source: Santiment
Further dampening the mood is a significant drop in XRP’s active on-chain addresses. According to data from Santiment, the number of daily active addresses on the XRP network has cratered by 30% over the past month. This decline is often seen as a precursor to a price slump, as it indicates a decrease in overall network activity and user engagement.
Profit Amidst The Gloom?
However, there are some glimmers of hope for XRP bulls. An interesting data point reveals that daily traders are still managing to turn a profit. An analysis of XRP’s daily transaction volume in profit compared to loss shows that for every transaction ending in a loss, 1.16 transactions yield profits. This suggests that despite the overall bearish sentiment, short-term trading opportunities might exist for skilled investors who can capitalize on market volatility.
XRP market cap currently at $28 billion. Chart: TradingView.com
MVRV Ratio Offers A Different Perspective
Another factor that could entice some investors is the negative Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio for XRP. This metric essentially compares the current market price of XRP with the average price at which all XRP tokens were acquired.
A negative MVRV ratio suggests that XRP is currently undervalued, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for investors seeking assets trading below their historical price points.

	Related Reading


XRP Price Forecast
Meanwhile, the current XRP price prediction indicates a 20% rise to $0.626627 by July 1, 2024, despite a bearish market sentiment reflected by technical indicators. The Fear & Greed Index at 72 shows high investor greed, suggesting strong buying behavior but also a risk of overbought conditions and potential price corrections if sentiment shifts.
Source: CoinCodex




Over the last 30 days, XRP has had almost an equal number of days with price increases (47%). This shows a balance between buying and selling pressures.
The price has fluctuated by 2%, indicating mostly stable but noticeable changes. This balance suggests the market is steady, contributing to the current bearish outlook despite a positive long-term price prediction.

Ethereum NFT market faces slump: Any impact on ETH? - AMBCrypto














Interest in Ethereum NFTs declined materially as sales plummeted over the past month.
ETH’s price remained stable, but network growth continued to decline.

















Even though the price movement of Ethereum [ETH] was in a positive direction over the last few days, the ecosystem of Ethereum was facing some major problems.





NFT volumes begin to fall
Over the past month, the total sales of Ethereum NFTs fell by 55%. Popular Ethereum NFT collections such as BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club), MAYC (Mutant Ape Yacht Club) and Crypto Punks witnessed a significant decline of more than 40% in terms of sales and floor prices.
NFTs on other networks such as Solana and Bitcoin were gaining traction compared to the Ethereum network.
 
Source: Crypto Slam
Moreover, the daily active addresses on the Ethereum network also fell significantly over the last few days along with the gas usage on the network, implying declining overall activity on the Ethereum ecosystem.
This maybe a sign that Ethereum’s popularity as an ecosystem was waning significantly.
Even though the interest in ETH due to the hype around its ETF has risen and caused the price to grow, a waning interest in the Ethereum ETF’s could cause a problem for ETH in the long run.
Source: Santiment
At press time, ETH was trading at $3,786.76 and its price had fallen by 0.68%. The network growth around the ETH token had fallen significantly, implying that the number of new addresses interesting with ETH had drastically declined.
A lack of interest from new addresses suggested that the market was not ready to buy ETH at its current price.
Some bulls may wait for a correction before accumulating more ETH in the future.
Additionally, the velocity at which ETH was trading at had grown, indicating that the frequency with which ETH was trading at had risen.
Only time will tell whether the price action of ETH co relates with the rising velocity, giving bulls some hope about the future.

How are addresses holding up?
Coming to the state of the holders, it was seen that most addresses were profitable, as indicated by the high MVRV ratio for ETH.
Even though a high MVRV ratio means that more holders are incentivized to sell their holdings, the presence of long term holders showcased by the high Long/Short difference implies that a large sell-off may not happen anytime soon.

Number Of People Who Own Crypto Worldwide Crosses 6.8% Ahead Of Bitcoin Bull Run | Bitcoinist.com


								A new crypto report has disclosed that the number of people who own digital assets has surpassed 6.8%. This surge in adoption comes ahead of the highly anticipated crypto bull run, with many seeing cryptocurrencies as a valuable form of investment. 
Crypto Adoption Skyrocket In 2024
On May 24, digital asset service provider Triple A released a report detailing the global adoption rates of cryptocurrencies globally, underscoring how much the industry has grown since 2023 and identifying countries that have the highest levels of crypto ownership.  

According to Triple A, around 562 million people, equivalent to 6.8% of the global population, now own some type of digital asset in 2024. This massive surge indicates a 34% increase from 2023, which recorded a total of 420 digital asset owners.
The report underscored cryptocurrency ownership in different regions of the world, noting that countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Singapore, Turkey, and Argentina held a significant amount of cryptocurrency owners. 
Particularly, Triple A disclosed that among the top 30 economies with the highest cryptocurrency ownership rate, the UAE tops the chart with 25.3% ownership rates out of the 6.8% global rate, while Singapore goes in second with a 24.4% crypto ownership rate. 
The report also emphasized that emerging markets like Turkey and Argentina, with their different economic standings, also have a significant percentage of crypto investors, as compared to smaller economies like Slovenia and Luxembourg.  
Leading the global cryptocurrency ownership rate is the continent of Asia, which has grown to become a major hub for digital assets and innovative technologies. Asia currently accounts for more than half of the total 562 million cryptocurrency owners globally. In contrast, North America trails behind with approximately 72.2 million recorded cryptocurrency owners. 
Asia has experienced a dramatic surge in cryptocurrency adoption over the years, with the number of crypto owners skyrocketing from 268.2 million crypto investors to 326.8 million in 2024. This significant increase highlights the continent’s growing acceptance of digital currencies, underscoring its commitment towards embracing digital innovation.
Factors Driving Global Crypto Adoption
Factors such as the upcoming crypto bull run, regulatory changes and media sensation have been driving the adoption of cryptocurrencies in different regions. Triple A report reveals that 2024 brought in clearer digital asset regulations which transformed the cryptocurrency industry from a niche market to a dominant player in the financial sector. 
The upcoming crypto bull run has been one of the leading drivers of crypto adoption globally, triggering Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) from curious investors as it offers a chance for them to potentially make huge gains from a legitimate investment bracket. According to various analysts, the 2024 crypto bull run is set to become the largest ever seen, spurred on by the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the recent approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs. 

Additionally, Triple A’s report noted that regulatory changes have effectively bolstered the confidence of investors, paving the way for the discovery of new investment products like Spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Top DEX Altcoin Uniswap (UNI) Dips in Price After Project Delays Protocol Upgrade - The Daily Hodl


								Uniswap’s native asset UNI tumbled by about 9% on Friday after the decentralized exchange (DEX) announced that it had decided to punt on an important protocol upgrade.
The DEX had planned on initiating an on-chain vote on Friday to implement a proposal that would have enabled a fee mechanism to reward UNI token holders who have staked and delegated their tokens.










The upgrade aimed to reduce the burden on Uniswap Governance and to maintain the protocol’s “credible neutrality.”
In the past week, however, a stakeholder raised “a new issue relating to this work that requires additional diligence,” according to the Uniswap Foundation.
Explains the organization,
“Due to the immutable nature and sensitivity of our proposed upgrade, we have made the difficult decision to postpone posting this vote. This was unexpected, and we apologize for the postponement. We will keep the community apprised of any material changes and will update you all once we feel more certain about future timeframes.”
Uniswap is the top DEX in terms of 24-hour trading volume and monthly visits, according to CoinGecko.
Following the news, UNI dropped from $11.04 to $9.86. The altcoin is hovering close to its 24-hour lows and is trading at $9.93 at time of writing.

New Solana Memecoin Pepe Bitcoin (PEPEBTC) to Explode 14,000% Within 48 Hours



                    

Pepe Bitcoin (PEPEBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.



Currently, Pepe Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin.



In fact, many early Shiba Inu and Dogecoin investors have been pouring funds into this new Solana memecoin.



Pepe Bitcoin launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.




To buy Pepe Bitcoin on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 9GX4RGAyW6FZgdEm5WxLzdRaeLQdmvcFHcupcZUeN1nR – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBTC.

Chainlink Is Not Done: Analyst Predicts 300% Rise Against Bitcoin


																A crypto analyst has highlighted the Chainlink remarkable resilience amidst market volatility, predicting that the cryptocurrency is getting ready to witness a 300% surge against Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. 
Chainlink Poised For 300% Increase Against Bitcoin
Chainlink, a decentralized blockchain oracle network has been gaining traction recently, bolstered by the innovative developments within its ecosystem. Popular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe has expressed optimism about Chainlink’s native token, LINK, predicting a major bull rally for the cryptocurrency.

	Related Reading


Sharing a price chart depicting Chainlink (LINK)/ Bitcoin (BTC) price movements from 2021 to 2025, Poppe forecasted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that LINK is on track to witness an exponential increase between 150% to 300% against BTC. 
Source: X
As of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $67,623, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has fallen below key support levels of around $70,000 and reflects a slight decline of 1.05% in the last 24 hours. 
Poppe has revealed that he would not be surprised if Chainlink reaches this price milestone, underscoring his confidence in the cryptocurrency’s price fundamentals and future potential compared to Bitcoin. In the chart analysis, the crypto analyst pinpointed a critical resistance level for LINK/BTC around $0.000448, indicating that this point could trigger strong breakouts upward for Chainlink. 
In an earlier post, Poppe identified Chainlink’s next resistance zone at $21, predicting that the cryptocurrency could see its price trading between $25 and $30 in the coming months. For this to happen, the crypto analyst explained that Chainlink will have to establish a higher low on the weekly time frame.  
Poppe’s optimistic outlook on Chainlink comes after the blockchain platform has initiated several strategic partnerships. Chainlink has collaborated with Circle, a peer-to-peer payments company, to expand developer usage of USDC and Euro Coin (EURC). Additionally, the blockchain platform recently allied with SWIFT, an interbank messaging system, to accelerate the adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).
These innovative developments may serve as a catalyst for a potential price increase for the cryptocurrency, driven by enhanced network utility and increased adoption from new users. 
LINK Price Update
Amidst broader market conditions, Chainlink has been performing better than expected, experiencing consistent price increases since the beginning of the year. Over the past month, Chainlink has risen by 45.01%, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s growing demand and interest from investors.

	Related Reading


CoinMarketCap’s data has also shown that Chainlink has surged by 3.32% in the last 24 hours and 7.79% over the past week. This bullish performance can be said to be attributed to Chainlink’s ongoing development initiatives in its ecosystem alongside the recent approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
As of writing, the price of Chainlink is trading at $18.53, reflecting a 24-hour increase of 14.86% in its daily trading volume.

Putin Boss (PUTINBO) Coin to Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Putin Boss (PUTINBO) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Putin Boss (PUTINBO), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PUTINBO will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Putin Boss.



Currently, Putin Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PUTINBO on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Putin Boss by entering its contract address – 34bBAvQ8kkQrP3LPVcmhLQKY9UJNUkK3dtq42m7DD7Ru – in the receiving field.




PUTINBO currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Here Are Important Shiba Inu Developments You Might Have Missed This Week | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem had an event-filled week with several developments surrounding the meme coin. These developments again highlighted the mixed sentiment towards Shiba Inu (SHIB), with the crypto token running the risk of declining further from its current price level. 
Shibarium Sees Spike In Total Value Locked
Data from DeFiLlama shows that the total value locked (TVL) on the layer-2 network Shibarium spiked this week, peaking at $2.45 million on May 30. This shows a growing confidence among investors in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It also represents a positive development given that Shibarium’s TVL had declined significantly after surging to a record-high of $3.9 million in March. 

The Shibarium network also recorded a significant milestone this week, crossing the 5 million mark in terms of total blocks processed on the network. That highlighted the impressive demand and adoption the layer-2 network has enjoyed since launching last year. Shibarium has also processed over 4 million transactions and boasts almost 2 million addresses on the network. 
However, what remains a concern for the Shiba Inu team and community at large is the dwindling daily transactions on the Shibarium network. The network recorded daily transactions under 20,000 almost throughout May, with May 3 being the only day last month when it managed to record over 20,000 daily transactions. 
This has also negatively impacted Shiba Inu’s token burns, with the number of tokens burned declining lately. Data from the burn tracking website Shibburn shows a 44% drop in the number of tokens burned in the last seven days. 
Shiba Inu’s Price At Risk Of A Significant Crash
Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that 65 trillion SHIB tokens are at risk of being sold off following the meme coin’s recent price correction. These 65 trillion tokens were bought between $0.000025 and $0.000027. The wallet addresses that purchased Shiba Inu at this range could sell their tokens in fear of a further price decline, with such selling pressure sending Shiba Inu’s price spiraling down.  
Shiba Inu also risks facing significant pressure, with crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealing that over 4 trillion SHIB ($103 million) have been sent to crypto exchanges in the last two weeks. Moving these tokens to exchanges usually suggests that holders are about to offload their holdings in a move that can 
A Memorable Moment In Shiba Inu History
The official X (formerly Twitter) account of Shiba Inu highlighted that it had been three years since Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin burned 410 trillion SHIB tokens (almost half of the meme coin’s total supply). 

These burned tokens formed part of the 500 SHIB tokens the meme coin’s founder Ryoshi sent to the Ethereum co-founder. Vitalik’s move is known to have been a pivotal moment for the Shiba Inu ecosystem and is forever etched in its history.

Dogecoin price prediction: Is a June rally likely? - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin’s price increased by over 28% during the last seven days.
Market indicators hinted at a few slow moving days before DOGE turns volatile.

Dogecoin’s [DOGE] performance in May was commendable as it displayed double-digit growth. But the world’s largest memecoin didn’t end the last month on a bullish note as its weekly chart turned red. 
Let’s have a deep look at what’s happening to predict Dogecoin’s price targets in June. 
DOGE’s performance in May
The month of May brought joy to investors, as several of them enjoyed profits. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that DOGE’s price had risen by more than 28% over the past 30 days. 
However, the month didn’t end well for the memecoin, as its value dropped by over 4% last week. At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.1592 with a market capitalization of $23 billion, making it the 8th largest crypto. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that DOGE’s social volume remained high last month, reflecting its immense popularity. 
However, investors’ confidence in the memecoin remained low as its weighted sentiment graph rested in the negative zone for the majority of days. This clearly meant that bearish sentiment around the coin was dominant in the market in May.
Source: Santiment
Dogecoin price prediction for June
Since DOGE ended May on a bearish note, AMBCrypto planned to assess its metrics to find out whether June would be a bullish month. We found that DOGE’s MVRV ratio had a value of -0.5%, which looked bearish.
 Apart from that, most metrics were bullish. For example, whale activity around the coin was high. Its daily active addresses were also stable, indicating consistent network activity. 
Source: Santiment
Additionally, at press time, DOGE’s fear and greed index had a value of 40%, meaning that the market was in a neutral phase. When the metric hits this level, it indicates that the market could turn in any direction. 
Therefore, AMBCrypto assessed DOGE’s daily chart. 
As per our analysis, DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved sideways at the neutral mark. Both its Money Flow Index (MFI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered minor upticks. 
These indicators suggested that investors might witness a few slow-moving days during the beginning of June. 
Source: TradingView
AMBCrypto then checked Hyblock Capital’s data to look for immediate targets for DOGE. If DOGE gains bullish momentum, then its price might first reach $0.167 as liquidation would rise at that level. 
Generally, a rise in liquidation results in a price correction. To the contrary, if DOGE remains bearish, then its value might drop to $0.153.

Going forward, let’s have a look at long-term Dogecoin price predictions. A bull rally in June could send DOGE easily to its April high of $0.21.
 If DOGE breaks out above that level and manages to sustain the rally, then expecting the memecoin to touch $0.28 in June won’t be ambitious.

$XRP Price Could Start Vastly Outperforming Bitcoin, Analyst Reveals | Cryptoglobe


                                
A popular cryptocurrency analyst has recently revealed he believes the price of the native token of the XRP Ledger is set to soon vastly outperform the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) over a key technical indicator.



In a post shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), popular cryptocurrency analyst Cryptoinsightuk revealed that on a monthly timeframe the price o XRP in BTC is in “reversal territory.”



Per his words the XRP/BTC monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at its lowest level ever, and in the last two occasions it dropped so significantly XRP rose 5,251% and 498% against the flagship cryptocurrency.



The analyst noted, however, that he can see “many potential positive catalysts coming for XRP,” and that once something changes its narrative then “sentiment can change extremely quickly.”







It’s worth noting that the price of XRP has been significantly underperforming the flagship cryptocurrency, having dropped around 15% year-to-date and risen just 0.8% over the last 12 months.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin rose 61.5% so far this year and over 150% in the last 12 months, partly with the help of the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, which made it easier for institutional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency.



Notably BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen its BTC holdings surpass those of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), making it the world’s largest exchange-traded fund offering investors exposure to the price of Bitcoin.



Analysts attribute this shift to Grayscale’s higher fees, which have driven investors towards BlackRock’s lower-cost alternative after GBTC was converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF at the same time several of these ETFs started trading in the United States.



Notably, BlackRock’s income and bond-focused funds have recently added exposure to its own spot Bitcoin ETF, with regulatory filings showing that BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund and Strategic Global Bond Fund purchased shares of iShares Bitcoin Trust.

New Solana Memecoin Eminem's Spaghetti (EMINSPAG) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Eminem’s Spaghetti could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.



Eminem’s Spaghetti (EMINSPAG), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because EMINSPAG has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Eminem’s Spaghetti can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.

Uniswap Foundation Postpones Highly Anticipated Vote on UNI Staking and Delegation Rewards



                    

The Uniswap Foundation, which oversees the decentralized exchange Uniswap, has postponed the much-anticipated May 31 vote on UNI staking and delegation rewards.



The postponement was announced on X, attributing the delay to concerns raised by a stakeholder. This prompted a more thorough review and examination of the proposal, leading to a delay in the decision-making process.




The vote was intended to move the decentralized exchange closer to activating its “fee switch” and provide incentives to UNI tokenholders who staked and delegated their tokens.



Erin Koen, the lead official overseeing the Uniswap DAO governance forum, stated in an announcement on the forum that the proposed upgrade requires rigorous vetting due to its sensitive and irreversible nature, emphasizing the importance of thorough scrutiny before proceeding.



The Uniswap DAO has been exploring the possibility of enabling a fee switch for several years, but previous proposals have stalled due to concerns about potential violations of U.S. securities laws. This cautious approach has delayed progress on the issue.




Dan Robinson, a partner at the crypto venture capital firm Paradigm, criticized the Uniswap Foundation’s decision to delay the vote, accusing them of yielding to pressure from another unnamed venture capital firm.

Another user pointed out the irony, questioning if the delay discredits the idea of decentralized governance. 



They implied that the unnamed VC firm’s actions had revealed its significant influence, which could be seen as undermining the decentralized values.




The Uniswap Foundation’s latest proposal, introduced in February, seeks to address previous concerns and has gained community support through an advisory vote, known as a “temperature check,” held earlier this year. 



To prepare for the initially scheduled May 31 vote, UNI holders had to delegate their tokens on the platform before the voting went live, the Uniswap Foundation explained a week earlier.



The Uniswap Foundation recently disclosed holding $41.41 million in fiat and stablecoins and 730,000 tokens as of the end of the first quarter. 



According to a publication by the Foundation, it committed $4.34 million in new grants during this period and disbursed $2.79 million in previously committed grants.

Is Bitcoin ready to rally? Analyzing key indicators for BTC's next move - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s price dropped by over 2% last week.
A key indicator pointed out that BTC was near a market bottom.

Bitcoin [BTC] bears stayed ahead of the bulls last week as the king of cryptos’ price registered a decline. However, if the latest data is to be considered, BTC’s path ahead might not have many break-throughs. 
Let’s have a closer look at BTC’s state to see what the upcoming week might be. 
Bitcoin bears might take a break
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that BTC’s price had dropped by more than 2% in the last seven days. The coin’s price turned bullish days after reclaiming $70k on the 24th of May. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,674.15 with a market capitalization of over $1.33 trillion. 
Nonetheless, the upcoming days might look different. Milkybull, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development. 
As per the tweet, from a short-term perspective, nothing is looking bearish, but rather it’s gathering momentum for the next move. 
This was the case as BTC continued to trade above its crucial support at $66k. Moreover, the 13th consecutive positive ETF inflow was another added advantage for the bulls. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of CryptoQuant’s data revealed that BTC’s binary CDD was green. This meant that long-term holders’ movements in the last 7 days were lower than average. However, the rest of the metrics looked pretty bearish. 
For example, BTC’s net deposit on exchanges was higher compared to the last seven-day average. Its aSORP was also red, meaning that more investors are selling at a profit. In the middle of a bull market, it can indicate a market top.

Is there a bull rally around the corner?
Apart from this, BTC’s fear and greed index had a reading of 72 at press time, meaning that the market was in a “greed” phase. Whenever the metric hits that level, the changes of a price correction are high. 
However, Glassnode’s data pointed out an indicator that hinted at a price pump. 
BTC’s Pi Cycle Top indicator revealed that BTC’s price was just about to touch the 111-day moving average (MA). Therefore, the chances of a rebound are high after BTC touches that support level, which indicates a market bottom.

The possibility of BTC touching its support level seemed high as the coin’s Money Flow Index (MFI) registered a sharp decline. The king of cryptos’ Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar declining trend. 
These indicators suggest that BTC might drop a bit more before it makes a comeback over the coming days.

Bitcoin’s low funding rate is a 'welcome signal,' but BTC needs more - AMBCrypto



The funding rate indicated a bullish signal, however, the Coinbase Premium Index might resist the uptrend.
BTC might have hit a local top, hence, its rise to a new high could be delayed.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] funding rate has been low since mid-May, AMBCrypto confirmed.  Though this implied low investor expectations, it could be good for BTC’s price.
Funding rate is the cost of holding an open contract in the market. When the reading is positive, it means that the perp price is trading meaningfully above the index value
Lower optimism, higher BTC prices?
On the other hand, a negative funding rate suggests that the spot price is higher than the contract price. At press time, Bitcoin’s funding rate was $0.01%.
But despite being positive, this was a lower reading compared to what it was a few weeks ago. From a trading perspective, the low funding rate alongside the declining price indicates that perp buyers were fading Bitcoin’s move.
Source: Santiment
However, it also means that spot traders were becoming aggressive. If this continues, Bitcoin could revisit $70,000 within a short period.
But the revival might not be quick. This is because of the condition of the Coinbase Premium Index. The index is the difference between BTC’s price on the Coinbase exchange and the value on other exchanges.
If the value of the index is high, it means that U.S. investors are buying a lot of BTC, thereby putting good pressure on the price. However, a decline in the metric indicates an increase in sales of Bitcoin by investors in the country.
As of this writing, the Coinbase Index Premium was -0.10, indicating that selling pressure was intense. From the chart below, AMBCrypto noticed that this decrease was one of the reasons Bitcoin kept getting rejected.
Source: CryptoQuant
Bearish forces are still at work
However, if the reading increases, it could trigger a breakout for BTC. Analyst TraderOasis also agreed with this in his analysis on CryptoQuant, noting that,
“As a result, when the price reaches the daily gap, the increase in the Coinbase Premium Index indicator will be our signal.”
Furthermore, AMBCryto examined the investor capitalization provided by Glassnode. Investor capitalization can tell if BTC is close to the bottom or has hit a local top.
At press time, the metric was around the same spot as Bitcoin’s price, indicating that the coin was in a critical area. Should the metric rise above BTC, then it would indicate a local top and force a correction.
Conversely, if the price of Bitcoin jumps much higher than it, the value might appreciate, and it might retest $70,000.

However, volatility around BTC remained low at press time. This indicates that the price might keep swinging in a tight range for some time.
Moving on, there is a chance that the metrics mentioned above could switch to the positive sign. If this is the case, the price of the coin could attempt to surpass its all-time high before the end of June.

The remaining 15 million FTX shares in Anthropic have been sold for $450 million, with the aim of optimizing creditor repayment.

FTX Shares In Anthropic Was Completed $450 Million Sale



The FTX Estate, headed by CEO John Ray III, sold the remaining 15 million FTX shares in Anthropic for $30 each, raking in over $450 million. The total amount received from FTX’s initial $500 million investment is now close to $1.3 billion, with profits of around $800 million.



The biggest buyer was global venture capital fund G Squared, which bought 4.5 million shares for $135 million. The remaining 20 buyers were mostly venture capital funds. This is the second sale; the shares sold in March went for the same price of $30 per share.

FTX Prepares for Full Creditor Repayment with $16.3 Billion Fund



The FTX bankruptcy has cost over $700 million in legal and administrative fees, tracked by creditor Mr. Purple. The main law firm handling the bankruptcy, Sullivan & Cromwell, has faced criticism over potential conflicts of interest, given its past representation of FTX. It has had to defend calls for an independent examiner and a class-action lawsuit.



Despite the best efforts of the firm, FTX has managed to corral $16.3 billion in cash for distribution, far more than the $11 billion owed to approximately two million customers and other creditors. The exchange plans to repay at least 118% of the allowed claims, an unprecedented feat in US bankruptcy proceedings.



FTX CEO John Ray III has charged the estate $5.6 million for his services, billing at $1,300 per hour. The estate’s approach reflects its commitment to repaying creditors and resolving the bankruptcy as soon as possible.

Bitcoin Flashing Signal That Preceded Nine-Month Parabolic Rally, According to Crypto Strategist - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist says Bitcoin (BTC) just flashed a signal last seen before the dramatic rallies of the 2017 bull market cycle.
Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 452,600 followers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin versus M1 money supply chart just breached the resistance of the exponential moving average Bollinger Bands on the monthly chart.










According to TechDev, the same thing happened in the first months of 2017 before Bitcoin printed gains of more than 2,600% in less than a year.
“You’re looking at the first breakout of Bitcoin against M1 money supply since March 2017 when it went historically parabolic for nine months.” 
Source: TechDev/X
M1 money supply tracks the amount of liquidity sloshing in the US financial system by summing up all physical money including coins and currency, demand deposits, traveler’s checks and other checkable deposits.
According to TechDev, the signal suggests that traders and investors are underestimating the upside potential of Bitcoin in this market cycle.
“Comparisons and trend projections involving 2021 may end up dramatically underestimating things…
One interpretation:
In 2021, BTC was carried to new USD highs by increased money supply.
In 2024, it’s gotten there on its own demand (and thus broke out against M1).
Add the anticipated M1 growth this time and we likely see BTC outpace expectations based in part on 2021.” 
TechDev says that BTC may soar to over $400,000 in less than one year if it follows in the footsteps of the 2017 bull market.
“I know it’s ridiculous. Not my call. $70,000 > $420,000 in a year sounds crazy as $1,0000 > $20,000 did. I wouldn’t have called that either.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,844.

Velocore Faces Exploitation, Loses About $10 Million: Report Coin Edition


							

Velocore has been reportedly hacked, resulting in a loss of about $10 million.
The platform has initiated an investigation into the exploitation and froze stolen funds.
However, the hacker managed to move some of the stolen ETH to the Ethereum mainnet.




Velocore, a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol on zkSync and Linea, has reportedly been hacked, causing customers to lose almost $10 million in funds. In response to the exploitation, the Velocore team initiated an investigation into the hack, setting up an “on-chain negotiation process.”







The hack was initially reported by the Chinese crypto reporter Colin Wu on his Wu Blockchain page on X, following which crypto commentator MartyParty also reposted the report.









Velocare shared an “Emergency Notice” after facing the hack, cautioning clients against the exploitation. Consequently, the team halted the platform’s operations, freezing the stolen funds. However, the hackers were reportedly able to transfer a portion of the stolen Ether tokens across chains to the Ethereum mainnet.



The DEX protocol asserted that it had sought the help of the security team to resolve the issue. Velocore’s emergency notice read,







In its recent post, Velocore revealed that the team has identified the exploit mechanism and promised to provide more updates soon. In addition, the team guaranteed guidance for safe withdrawal in the future. Further, the team cited, “Velocore on the Telos mainnet has not been affected, and we are working with the foundation while functionalities are frozen.”

Crypto horoscope from June 3 to 9

New week, new crypto horoscope dedicated to the upcoming week from June 3rd to June 9th.
This week will be characterized by three transits:
Mercury enters Gemini from Monday 3/6;
The New Moon in Gemini on Thursday 6/6 together with the Sun, Venus, Jupiter, and Mercury, creates the Stellium in Gemini;
Marte entra in bull da domenica 9/6.
For several months now, we have been dedicating space to the crypto horoscope written by Stefania Stimolo, an expert in astrology and blockchain. It is a weekly column with the horoscope of each zodiac sign available every Sunday only on The Cryptonomist. 
In our slogan of “Raccontiamo il Futuro”, we wanted to delve deeper into the topic, jokingly speaking, with this entertainment column. 

The crypto horoscope
We call it oroscopo crypto for the simple fact that sector terminology is used. 
Words like NFT, metaverso e Over-The-Counter to describe actions and scenarios, but also trading terminology like bullish, bull run, bear market or dump to identify the mood of each zodiac sign during the days of the week.
Obviously, the famous to-the-moon to indicate the mood of that sign cannot be missing! 
In general, you might experience a period of “hard-fork”, understood as an “inner split”, or pass your lightning torch to the next zodiac sign, meaning that the Sun is moving to the next sign. 
Or, simply, you need to reflect on some situations that go into “verify”, that is when the planet is in dissonance with respect to the zodiac sign. Not only that, with every new change of the Sun’s guard through the constellations of the zodiac, the roadmap of each sign will reach a new step. 
Obviously, no investment advice is given; on the contrary, it is purely for entertainment, just like any other horoscope. It must be said that many beginners in the sector have understood the specific crypto terminology also thanks to the horoscope on The Cryptonomist. 
“Non Fidarti, Verifica”
L’astrologia non è una scienza esatta, ma vuole a suo modo prevedere il futuro. E allora perché non associare la tipica frase della blockchain “Don’t Trust, Verify” anche qui. 
In fact, what the author wants to propose is her interpretation of the planetary transits that occur during the week, describing the reaction of each zodiac sign, following the “logic” of traditional astrology. 
For those who are astrology enthusiasts, they could stay updated even just with the transits that are communicated weekly, which, in some way, influence us. A Mercury Retrograde, rather than the days of Full Moon. 
Others, on the other hand, might access the dedicated page, which is updated every Sunday, and read the horoscope of their zodiac sign, their ascendant, or why not, even the horoscope of friends and loved ones. 
And so, for entertainment purposes only, don’t waste time and click here to read your horoscope for this week!

Velocore Hack Causes Users' Liquidity Pools to Lose $10 Million - Coincu



	

Key Points:




DEX Velocore, operating on zkSync and Linea blockchains, faces a suspected hack resulting in the loss of $10 million in user liquidity.



Linea Blockchain experienced a temporary block production halt during the Velocore hack, but operations have since resumed.




Velocore, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on zkSync and Linea blockchains, has reportedly fallen victim to a suspected hack, resulting in the loss of approximately $10 million worth of users’ liquidity.



Velocore Hack Causes Users' Liquidity Pools to Lose $10 Million 4



Readmore: Velocore Review: Pioneering Platform On zkSync With Ve Model(3,3)



DEX Velocore Hack Causes $10M in Damage to Users



The Velocore hack unfolded as the Linea blockchain, where Velocore operates, briefly halted block production, causing a disruption in operations. Although Linea has since resumed normal functionality, hackers managed to transfer a portion of the stolen Ether (ETH) across chains to the Ethereum mainnet.



In response to the Velocore hack, it confirmed the exploitation, acknowledging the significant impact on its CPMM pools. However, the DEX reassured users that stable pools remained unaffected, allowing for the safe withdrawal of funds from those pools.




Velocore is the project of the AMM DEX operating under the ve(3,3) model on the zkSync Era ecosystem. Ve(3,3) is the name for the model of liquidity that was originally introduced by Solidly. However, Velocore has improved and overcome the limitations that Solidly encountered to increase efficiency and security for users. Additionally, the Protocol Owned Liquidity mechanism is applied by Velocore to optimize profits from liquidity.



Velocore Ensures Security Measures Post-Breach



Velocore’s team swiftly initiated an investigation, identifying the exploit mechanism and implementing an on-chain negotiation process to address the issue. They also assured users of ongoing efforts to track down the perpetrators and provide further updates soon.



Meanwhile, operations on the Telos mainnet remain unaffected, with functionalities temporarily frozen as the team collaborates with the foundation to safeguard user funds and restore normal operations.



The exchange claims to have undergone three rounds of rigorous audits by reputable firms, including Zokyo, Hacken, and Scalebit, to ensure user protection and platform integrity.

Tether In Hong Kong Could Make A Comeback Amid Local Efforts To Attract Crypto Investment - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Tether co-founder Brock Pierce is considering returning to Hong Kong amid government efforts to attract the crypto industry.



Pierce said the potential of Tether in Hong Kong lies in the tradefi sector.



Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission’s new rule prevents licensed exchanges from serving mainland residents.




Brock Pierce, co-founder of the stablecoin Tether and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, has hinted at a potential return to Hong Kong as the city aims to reestablish itself as a major hub for the cryptocurrency industry.



Tether In Hong Kong Could Make A Comeback Amid Local Efforts To Attract Crypto Investment 4



Brock Pierce Shows Potential Of Tether In Hong Kong



Pierce, who initially co-founded Tether in Hong Kong a decade ago, expressed enthusiasm for the city’s recent regulatory advancements designed to attract crypto investments.



During the Solowin and Sequire Asia Investor Summit in Hong Kong, Pierce remarked on the city’s strategic developments. “I’m enthusiastic about what’s happening in Hong Kong, which means the likelihood of something happening is good right now,” he told the South China Morning Post.



Pierce’s comments come in the wake of several prominent cryptocurrency exchanges with ties to mainland China abandoning their attempts to secure licenses in Hong Kong under the new regulations introduced by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). The SFC has stipulated that licensed exchanges in Hong Kong must not serve mainland residents, diminishing a major incentive for establishing operations in the city.




The city’s efforts appear to be yielding results, with the SFC recently indicating that 11 cryptocurrency exchanges, including Crypto.com and Bullish, are closer to obtaining licenses, marking significant progress since the implementation of the digital-asset rulebook.



Tether Makes Major Moves Amidst Industry Changes



Despite this, Pierce remains optimistic about potential of Tether in Hong Kong. He noted that the city’s regulatory certainty and strategic location make it a favorable environment compared to regional competitors like Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. Pierce highlighted trade finance (tradefi) as a particularly promising area for Hong Kong‘s crypto market, suggesting that a Hong Kong digital dollar stablecoin could leverage China’s supply chain advantages.



Meanwhile, Tether recently acquired a $100 million stake in Bitdeer Technologies Group, owned by Chinese billionaire Jihan Wu, with an option to purchase an additional $50 million in shares within a year.

Hacking Event that Shook the Cryptocurrency World: Millions of Dollars Stolen from a DEX - Bitcoin Sistemi


Velocore, the decentralized exchange operating on zkSync and Linea, is suspected of being hacked. The alleged security breach resulted in the theft of all users' Liquidity Provider tokens (LPs), which included a staggering $10 million.
Linea blockchain, which temporarily stopped block production, has now resumed its operations. The stop occurred between the 5081800 and 5081801 blocks and lasted approximately an hour. The reason behind this outage is unknown.


Hackers reportedly transferred some of the stolen Ethereum (ETH) across chains to the Ethereum mainnet, further complicating the situation.

Despite the ongoing crisis, Velocore maintains that it has passed three rounds of inspections. According to official documents, these audits were carried out by reputable companies such as Zokyo, Hacken and Scalebit.





Following the incident, BladeSwap, another Decentralized Exchange (DEX), released a statement acknowledging that Velocore had been hacked on the zkSync/Linea network. BladeSwap explained that the issue was related to Velocore's Fixed Product Market Maker (CPMM) pool contract calculation.
BladeSwap, a fork of Velocore, assured its users that their funds were safe. DEX clarified that Velocore does not use CPMM (Balancer style) pooling.

BNB to $700? Here's why it's possible and here's why it's not - AMBCrypto



Altcoin’s price moved from $593 to $607 after the Open Interest added almost $100 million
Momentum seemed bullish, indicating that the price could climb close to $700

Despite registering a lower value a few days back, Binance Coin’s [BNB] Open Interest (OI) has risen. On 30 May, for instance, the OI was down to $335 million on the charts.
However, press time data obtained from Santiment revealed that the metric soon climbed to $418.54 million. Here, Open Interest is a sign of whether more money is flowing into contracts related to a cryptocurrency or not.
The “god candle” appears
Whenever the OI increases, it means that traders are adding liquidity to the market. However, a decline in OI suggests increased position closure and an exit of liquidity from the market.
For BNB, it was the former. A rising OI could serve as a strength for the price action. At press time, BNB’s price was $607.57.
Here, it’s worth noting that according to AMBCrypto’s analysis, the candlestick that led the price higher was a “god candle.”
Source: Santiment
In crypto-terms, a god candle is a too-good-to-be-true price hike that occurs within a short period. From the chart attached herein, one can clearly observe that BNB’s price was $593, a few hours before this incredible surge.
This surge was proof that rising interest in the coin has been backing the uptrend. Also, the last time BNB made such a move, the price of the token rallied to $641.
If bears reject the uptrend, the price could retrace as low as $585. However, if bulls break past the overhead resistance, the value of the coin could rally towards $686, as AMBCrypto predicted.
Negative sentiment can’t stop the move
It’s also worth looking at the Weighted Sentiment around BNB. At the time of writing, the sentiment was down to -1.156, indicating that most comments about BNB were negative.
However, a further hike in BNB’s price could change the perception of the coin. And, once the sentiment started to become bullish, demand might hike too. In this case, the bullish price prediction could be validated.
Another indicator AMBCrypto examined was the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
The RSI tracks the momentum of a cryptocurrency. If the reading is at 30 or below, it means that the crypto is oversold. However, a reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition.
At press time, BNB’s RSI on the 4-hour chart was 62.49. This reading implied that buying momentum in the market increased.
Source: Santiment
If the momentum continues to move upward, then BNB’s price might follow. However, if the momentum slows down, the value of the coin might not get close to $700. Instead, it could slip below $600.

Realistic or not, here’s BNB’s market cap in BTC terms

By the look of things, traders might continue to open more BNB contracts. Going by the price action, most positions could tilt towards the long side. If this is the case and the price rises, longs might be rewarded soon.

Putin Boss (PUTINBO) to Explode Over 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Putin Boss (PUTINBO) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Putin Boss (PUTINBO), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PUTINBO will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Putin Boss.



Currently, Putin Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PUTINBO on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Putin Boss by entering its contract address – 34bBAvQ8kkQrP3LPVcmhLQKY9UJNUkK3dtq42m7DD7Ru – in the receiving field.




PUTINBO currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

XRP, Solana, Cardano ETFs are all 'inevitable' - Ripple's Garlinghouse - AMBCrypto



Ripple’s CEO criticized the SEC and called for clear U.S crypto regulations.
Many expect the likes of Solana and XRP to soon join the crypto-ETF bandwagon

In light of spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs finally winning approval recently, there has been a lot of chatter around the change in the SEC’s attitude towards crypto. However, with President Joe Biden vetoing the repeal of SEC’s SAB 121 policy as promised, things seem quite uncertain right now. 
Ripple’s step towards crypto-adoption
Despite challenges and anti-crypto sentiments, Ripple’s $25 million investment in Fairshake underscores its dedication to advancing crypto and blockchain adoption. 
Reflecting on the same, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in a recent interview during Consensus 2024 noted, 
“It’s important that the US is competitive when it comes to the policy and regulatory environment in all things crypto. However, the SEC and Gensler have sown confusion by filing lawsuits that sometimes even contradict each other.” 
With his remarks, Garlinghouse stressed that politicians with outdated policies might not be accepted in an evolving financial landscape that includes crypto.
Is an XRP ETF on the horizon?
Garlinghouse further went on to discuss the potential of an ETF for every major cryptocurrency such as Solana [SOL], Cardano [ADA], and of course, XRP.
According to the exec, 
“I think it’s just a matter of time, and it’s inevitable there’s gonna be an XRP ETF, there’s gonna be a Solana ETF, there’s gonna be a Cardano ETF, and that’s great.” 
Garlinghouse isn’t the only one to suggest this possibility though. Just recently, CNBC ‘Fast Money’ trader Brian Kelly ignited a debate on X by suggesting that Solana [SOL] could be the next cryptocurrency to have a spot ETF in the United States.
Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, echoed similar sentiments after she remarked that the approval of Ether ETFs signifies that crypto has become an election issue.
Crypto’s role in U.S elections
These developments mean that despite the SEC’s overreach, the U.S has taken big steps in crypto-adoption. Especially in the context of the upcoming presidential elections.
In fact, Garlinghouse agreed with what Wood said as he claimed, 
“Seeing crypto becoming a presidential topic isn’t a surprise for me.”
Beyond political interest, Ripple’s CEO also believes that the SEC has been unfair to the crypto-industry, criticizing Gensler’s misguided regulatory approach. Additionally, he believes that the lack of regulatory clarity in the United States poses a significant barrier to both institutions and individuals entering the emerging digital asset market.
The exec concluded by stating, 
“It’s critical that the U.S catch up with other leading economies and develop sensible (and CLEAR) rules for crypto.”

7 big cryptocurrency myths, debunked

Illustration: Dado Ruvic (Reuters)Cryptocurrency is based on new technology, and many people do not understand it. As a result, they may mistakenly believe that it is money used by criminals and fraudsters. But that is not true. Bitcoin is the most secure form of digital currency and was created to establish a decentralized digital currency free from the control of governments and central banks.Moreover, fraud, scams, ponzi schemes, money laundering, bribery, illicit financing, and corruption have been prevalent in every society for ages. Cash, which cannot be traced, remains the most popular method for illegal services and goods, not cryptocurrency.

21Shares Updates Ethereum ETF Application and Ends Partnership with ARK Invest



                    

21Shares has filed an updated application for its Ethereum spot ETF S-1, rebranding the fund from Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF to 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. 



Additionally, ARK Invest has ended its partnership with 21Shares and will no longer be involved with the ETF.




The newly amended Form S-1 indicates no updated fees. 



Despite recognizing Ethereum’s groundbreaking potential and long-term value, an ARK Invest representative confirmed that the firm has decided not to proceed with an Ether ETF, citing a need to reassess its investment strategy.



This decision does not affect the ongoing collaboration between 21Shares and ARK Invest on other projects, such as the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF launched in January.



In their partnership, 21Shares sponsored the ETF, with Delaware Trust Company acting as the trustee. Coinbase Custody Trust Company securely holds the underlying Ether assets, while ARK Investment Management played a supporting role as a sub-adviser responsible for marketing the shares to investors.



Apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, the duo launched another product called the ARK 21Shares Blockchain and Digital Economy Innovation ETF. 



This ETF is designed to invest in public equities of companies within the blockchain industry.

According to 21Shares, this provides investors with what it describes as a “holistic exposure” to the growth of blockchain technology.



ARK Invest and 21Shares revised their spot Ether ETF proposal on May 10, dropping plans to stake a portion of the fund’s assets through third-party providers.




In their Feb. 7 filing, the companies included a clause stating that 21Shares anticipated receiving ETH as a reward for staking and intended to classify the resulting earnings as income generated by the fund.



In September 2023, ARK Invest and 21Shares submitted an application for a spot Ether ETF. 



The fund aims to offer direct exposure to Ether and will be traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange, utilizing the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate – New York Variant.



Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 19b-4 forms for eight Ethereum ETFs. Issuers still need their S-1 statements to become effective before trading can begin.

We Asked ChatGPT if Shiba Inu (SHIB) Can Become a Top 5 Cryptocurrency This Year


																TL;DR

Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a price surge earlier this year but has since lost some of its momentum. ChatGPT sees low chances of reaching the top 5 cryptocurrencies despite further growth from Shibarium and a strong community.
Dogecoin (DOGE), backed by Elon Musk and Tesla, has better prospects for entering the elite club, driven by potential celebrity endorsements and market optimism.


Is That a Mission Impossible?
The popular meme coin experienced an impressive revival earlier this year, with its price tapping a two-year high in March. Back then, its market capitalization surged above $25 billion. Despite heading south in the following months, the asset remains one of the hottest topics across the community and one of the 15 biggest cryptocurrencies.
As such, we decided to ask ChatGPT whether it can witness another substantial rally in the following months and whether it can enter the top 5 club before the end of 2024.
The AI-powered chatbot said the chances are relatively low considering the current market dynamics. However, it claimed that SHIB has shown significant progress as of late, suggesting that further advancement of the layer-2 scaling solution—Shibarium—and other developments related to Shiba Inu’s ecosystem can help achieve that goal.
ChatGPT also noted the meme coin’s devoted community, assuming that its potential growth could be beneficial for a price rally. A recent study revealed that Shiba Inu has the strongest community base among all meme coins, with Dogecoin (DOGE) occupying the second spot. 




Last but not least, the chatbot maintained that favorable regulatory developments and endorsements from prominent figures might fuel additional adoption and price surge.
“Overall, while Shiba Inu has opportunities for growth and can achieve significant milestones, becoming a top 5 cryptocurrency would require extraordinary gains and favorable conditions. This remains an ambitious and challenging goal given the current market landscape and competition,” Chat GPT concluded.
Currently, Solana is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of over $77 billion, meaning a gap of over $60 billion between SOL and SHIB.
What About Dogecoin (DOGE)
Dogecoin is the biggest meme coin, and according to ChatGPT, it has better chances to join crypto’s top 5 club this year. The chatbot assumed that the asset’s market cap could head north following possible support from celebrities. 
Recall that DOGE is the favorite cryptocurrency of Tesla’s CEO – Elon Musk. One of the wealthiest people often praises its merits, whereas the EV giant recently integrated the token as a payment option on its website.
In addition, ChatGPT noted that many industry participants are quite bullish on DOGE, expecting its price to soar in the following months. The popular X user Ali Martinez argued that the asset faces “significant resistance” between $0.166 and $0.171, where 75,000 addresses have accumulated approximately 10 billion coins. 
“However, once this barrier is overcome, DOGE has the potential to double, with the next key resistance around $0.322,” he predicted.
As of the moment, DOGE has a market capitalization of more than $23 billion, making it the ninth-biggest in the crypto industry.

Ripple CEO Confident Over Proposed Stablecoin Despite The SEC’s Criticism - Coin Edition


							

JackTheRippler shows confidence in Ripple’s proposed stablecoin.
he RLUSD will be pegged 1:1 by the U.S. Dollar.
The influencer believes the stablecoin would make XRP the bridge to other digital currencies.




The renowned crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X believes the proposed Ripple stablecoin (RLUSD) will take over the stablecoin market. In a recent post, JackTheRippler highlighted that the “high-quality U.S. stablecoin” will be pegged 1:1 by the U.S. Dollar, and XRP will become the bridge between stablecoins and any other digital currency.







JackTheRippler shared a snippet of Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, commenting about the upcoming stablecoin in a CNBC interview. Responding to why Ripple is venturing into the stablecoin market, Garlinghouse explained that it relates to where the crypto market is going.



The Ripple CEO noted that the stablecoins market is forecasted to reach between $2 trillion and $3 trillion in the future, compared with its current size of between $150 billion and $200 billion. He described the stablecoin ecosystem as one of the “fund markets to be in that are growing quickly.”



Additionally, Garlinghouse told the CNBC reporter that he thinks there is some shift in market share, highlighting that Tether is currently the most dominant stablecoin. However, he predicts a market share shift, noting that despite the continued growth of stablecoin giants like Tether and the USDC, there is plenty room for a Ripple-backed stablecoin.



Garlinghouse appeared confident about the proposed Ripple stablecoin despite ongoing legal challenges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In its May 7 redacted remedies reply brief, the SEC accused Ripple of continued engagement in unregulated activities, describing the proposed Ripple stablecoin as an “unregistered crypto asset.”

$10 Million Hack Hits Decentralized Exchange Velocore


Velocore, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the zkSync and Linea blockchains, has been exploited, resulting in a loss of approximately $10 million. 
This incident was initially flagged by “Officer’s Notes,” a threat researcher and writer. It highlights the persistent vulnerabilities in the crypto sector.
Velocore Investigates the Hack

Velocore reported that hackers targeted its liquidity provider tokens. These are integral to the exchange’s operations. Following the breach, the hackers already transferred over 700 ETH across chains to the Ethereum mainnet.
According to Velocore’s documents, the exchange had passed security audits conducted by Zokyo, Hacken, and Scalebit. Despite this, the hackers managed to exploit the decentralized exchange.
Concurrently, the Linea Blockchain experienced a temporary halt in block production during the hack. This pause lasted about an hour before normal operations resumed. The reasons behind this disruption remain unclear.

Fortunately, Velocore’s stable pools were unaffected, allowing the withdrawal of funds from these reserves. The team is working with security experts and has contacted centralized exchanges (CEXs) to freeze the stolen assets, aiming to mitigate further damage.


“We’ve identified the exploit mechanism and are setting up an on-chain negotiation process. A post-mortem article is in the works. Tracking the exploiter with clues left behind. More updates soon. Velocore on the Telos mainnet has not been affected, and we are working with the foundation while functionalities are frozen. We will provide guidance on safely withdrawing all funds in the future,” Velocore updated.

The community members that lost the fund demand refund from Velocore. However, the project has not discussed the compensation and refund plans yet.
This incident is part of a larger trend. Just days earlier, DMM Bitcoin, a Japanese crypto exchange, reported a staggering $305 million loss due to a security breach. These successive hacks underline the sector’s ongoing security challenges. So far, in 2024, excluding the DMM Bitcoin incident, the industry has lost over $473.22 million to various exploits.
Particularly, the crypto industry lost over $52 million through 21 distinct incidents in May 2024.

1.8 Trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 24 Hours: What's Happening?

Almost 2 trillion worth of Shiba Inu tokens have been moved in the last 24 hours, but it is not as much as it may seem. According to IntoTheBlock's indicators, the amount of SHIB transacted by larger whales in the last 24 hours barely reaches the last week's average, which is quite explainable considering the poor performance of Shiba Inu on the market in the last 24 hours.The whale transaction volume is still within normal ranges. SHIB's recent market performance has not been great, which is consistent with general market trends.Altcoins like SHIB are feeling the heat as a result of declines in Bitcoin and Ethereum. SHIB's poor performance is caused by a number of factors. First off, sentiment in the cryptocurrency market turned negative after the correction of Ethereum. Riskier assets like Shiba Inu are being dodged by investors in favor of more reliable ones or assets outside of the crypto industry. This change is reflected in the trading patterns where despite high transaction volumes, the price of SHIB stays largely unchanged.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFurthermore, SHIB's network metrics also do not present a positive image. Both the quantity of active addresses and the quantity of newly created addresses have been declining. Because fewer new investors are joining the market and holders are not as active as they once were, this suggests that there is less interest in SHIB.As for the technical state of SHIB, the upward momentum has been capped, and the 50-day moving average functions as a support right now. However, the 200-day moving average also offers a strong foundational support that could stabilize prices in the near term.An examination of volume reveals that trading activity has surged, especially in the wake of the recent price declines. This may further pressure SHIB's price downward as it indicates a greater level of activity from sellers. RSI is still neutral but trending toward an oversold situation if it continues to move in that direction hovering around 49.

Zap Solutions CEO: Why I Stopped Using USD | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 29 May 2024, Daniela Cambone hosted Jack Mallers, CEO of Bitcoin startup Zap Solutions, Inc., on her show. Mallers, known for his outspoken advocacy for Bitcoin and its underlying technology, shared his perspective on dedollarization and why he transitioned to using Bitcoin exclusively in his daily transactions. Here’s a detailed look at what Mallers discussed during the interview.



The Origins of Dedollarization



Mallers began by addressing the concept of dedollarization, which he traces back to the financial crisis of 2008-2009. According to Mallers, this period marked a significant turning point as the world began to lose faith in the U.S. dollar. He pointed out that the global financial system revealed its vulnerabilities during this crisis, leading to a realization that the U.S. dollar, as the world’s reserve currency, was not as infallible as previously thought:



“Dedollarization started in ’08-’09 because the world realized they don’t care,” Mallers explained, highlighting a perceived neglect by financial authorities to maintain the dollar’s value and stability.



Transition to Bitcoin



In a notable move, Mallers stopped using the U.S. dollar in his daily transactions and switched to Bitcoin in January 2024. He described his decision as a strategic choice driven by the ongoing debasement of fiat currencies. Mallers emphasized that he wanted to avoid holding a currency that continually loses value due to inflation and other economic policies.



“They’re lending me a currency that’s constantly being debased. So I get to spend that currency without actually having to own it,” Mallers said, underscoring his strategy of utilizing Bitcoin for its perceived stability and appreciation potential.



By stating that he gets to spend the dollar without owning it, Mallers refers to using the dollar only as a medium of exchange when necessary, without holding it as a store of value. He may convert his Bitcoin to dollars only at the point of transaction to avoid holding dollars and being affected by its depreciation.



The Philosophy Behind Money



Mallers delved into his philosophical views on money, describing it as a representation of human time and energy. He argued that money should ideally preserve its value over time, allowing individuals to save or exchange their hard-earned resources without fear of devaluation.



“Money is a representation of our time and energy, which can be saved or exchanged,” Mallers stated, advocating for a financial system where the medium of exchange holds its value.



Economic Concerns and Bitcoin’s Role



Mallers expressed deep concerns about the current global economic landscape, particularly the high debt-to-GDP ratios seen in many countries. He argued that governments have borrowed extensively against future growth, leading to unsustainable economic practices.



“The global debt to GDP ratio indicates governments have borrowed extensively from our future without growth to repay it, leaving a loss that must be realized somewhere,” Mallers asserted, highlighting the potential economic crises looming on the horizon.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

In this context, Mallers sees Bitcoin as a crucial tool for preserving wealth and financial stability. He believes that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and finite supply make it an ideal hedge against inflation and economic instability.



The Future of Finance



Mallers concluded by sharing his vision for the future of finance, where Bitcoin plays a central role. He emphasized that adopting Bitcoin could lead to a more stable and fair financial system, free from the manipulations and debasement seen with traditional fiat currencies.



“Tune in to understand Mallers’ perspective on the financial future and why Bitcoin is central to his strategy,” Cambone invited viewers, encapsulating the essence of Mallers’ argument for Bitcoin as a foundational asset for the future.



Mallers’ Price Target for Bitcoin



In the interview, Jack Mallers passionately outlined his vision for Bitcoin as the ultimate safe haven asset. He argued that continuous money printing by governments will inevitably debase fiat currencies, prompting investors to seek refuge in Bitcoin. According to Mallers, this shift could drive Bitcoin’s price to unprecedented heights.



“Because the money printing will debase the currency, investors will start piling into Bitcoin as a safe store of value, sending its price soaring to as high as $1 million by the end of November 2025.”



Mallers expressed skepticism about the willingness of politicians, whether Trump, Biden, or RFK, to address the underlying economic issues. He suggested that politicians are more likely to offer short-term solutions that involve significant spending rather than implementing painful but necessary economic reforms.



“I don’t think Trump or Biden or RFK is going to get up and say, ‘I’m going to take away your healthcare. I’m going to inflate everything around you. I’m going to crash everything you know. All your bank deposits are gone. We’re going to go through the Great Depression because it’s in the best interest of America.’ That’s not what politicians do. I think politicians are going to say, ‘Here’s a bunch of free stuff and this is why you should elect me.’ And they’re going to have to fill the hole of this deficit…”



Mallers provided a bold price prediction for Bitcoin, highlighting a range that reflects both the potential for substantial growth and the inherent uncertainties in the financial system.



“I’m quoted saying $250,000 to $1 million [for a Bitcoin cycle top prediction]. That’s my range, and the range is wide. But you’re asking me to price something in a piece of paper that politicians, who don’t even know how the system works, are actively debasing. So, I think it trivially gets to $250,000. I think $1 million is possible within the next 18 months for that reason.”

FTX Offloads Remaining Anthropic Shares In $450 Million Sale | Bitcoinist.com


								The FTX bankruptcy estate has been involved in several asset liquidations over the past year, as they seek to fully reimburse former customers of the now-defunct exchange. In the latest development in the ongoing proceedings, the estate has sold the last part of its shares in the artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic. 
FTX Rakes In $800 Million From Anthropic Shares Sale
According to the latest bankruptcy filings, the FTX estate has cashed in on its remaining shares in Anthropic, the AI company behind the Claude chatbot. The estate dumped the remaining 15 million shares at $30 per share, receiving more than $452 million in proceeds. 

The top buyer in this sale is G Squared, a venture capital fund, which purchased around one-third (4.5 million) of the remaining shares for roughly $135 million. Other buyers include Fund FG-BLU and over a dozen other hedge funds and investment companies. 

List of the buyers, number of shares, and aggregate purchase price | Source: Kroll
It is worth mentioning that the latest sale comes a little over two months after the exchange sold the bulk of their Anthropic shares at the same $30 apiece, netting about $900 million in returns. This brings the total amount from the selloff of the FTX Anthropic shares to about $1.3 billion.
Originally, the FTX exchange and its sister company Alameda paid $500 million for the 8% stake in Anthropic in 2021. However, the subsequent explosion that rocked the AI industry caused the value of the shares to skyrocket, bringing the exchange’s profits to over $800 million.
As inferred earlier, the Anthropic shares are not the only assets that have been sold in recent months. Most recently, the liquidators in charge of FTX’s assets disclosed plans to sell off real estate properties the exchange acquired before bankruptcy.
FTX Bankruptcy Fees Surpass $700 Million
According to a recent report by a bankruptcy expert, the cost of FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings has exceeded $700 million. This cost includes legal and administrative fees over the past few years following the exchange’s collapse.

The report shows consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal is the highest earner in the FTX estate’s employ, charging a massive $212 million for its service. Sullivan and Cromwell, FTX’s legal counsel, has the second-largest bill of $202 million.
Another expense that caught the eye in the report is FTX CEO John Ray’s bill. The CEO has charged the estate $5.6 million since the start of the bankruptcy case, according to an hourly rate of $1,300.

Researchers Regain Access to 11-Year-Old Crypto Wallet, Recover BTC Worth $3M


																Two cybersecurity researchers have helped an anonymous crypto user recover 43.6 bitcoins (BTC) he lost 11 years ago after he lost access to the wallet holding the assets.
According to a YouTube video detailing the incident, researcher Joe Grand and his friend Bruno hacked time to reverse engineer the password generator used to create the password for the wallet holding the BTC. Although the process was rigorous, it helped them regain access to the wallet and recover the lost coins.
Regaining Access to 11-year-old Wallet
The anonymous crypto user, dubbed Michael, told Grand and Bruno that he set up the wallet sometime in 2013 and used RoboForm to generate its unique password. However, for security reasons, he decided to store the password in an encrypted file instead of on RoboForm.
“At [that] time, I was really paranoid with my security,” Michael stated, disclosing that the stash was worth around $5,300 at the time. Unfortunately, the encrypted file containing Michael’s password got corrupted at some point, and he lost access to the wallet.
Michael first contacted Grand in 2022, but he turned him down. The bitcoin owner persisted and tried again in June 2023. This time, he got Grand’s attention, and they began the process of retrieving the assets.
Grand and Bruno discovered that RoboForm had a vulnerability in its random number generator, which connected each generated password to a date and time it was created on a user’s computer. Although the bug was fixed in 2015, the duo reasoned that it must have affected every password created before then.




HODLing Till BTC Hits $100K
Michael was tasked with remembering the date he created the password, and while the feat seemed difficult, the researchers learned that he moved the bitcoins into his wallet on April 13, 2013. They used time parameters and continued testing hundreds of passwords until they discovered the correct one, created on May 15, 2013.
Upon discovering the correct password, they accessed the wallet and retrieved the bitcoins. Michael gave a portion of the stash to Grand and Bruno when BTC hovered around $38,000, and when the asset climbed to $62,000, he sold some for himself. He is currently left with 30 BTC worth roughly $2 million, and he intends to hold them till the asset is worth $100,000.

Billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya Says It Makes Sense for Countries To Hold Bitcoin in Dual-Currency Environment - The Daily Hodl


								Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya says it would be a smart move for some countries to use Bitcoin (BTC) alongside their local currency.
In a new installment of the All-In Podcast, Palihapitiya says he recently spoke with Wences Casares – a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who introduced him to Bitcoin in 2010 when BTC was trading at around $80.










Palihapitiya says Casares explained a “powerful concept” that maps out a path for the mass adoption of BTC.
“When I talked to Wences about this, how he explained it, which makes a lot of sense to me is there are a lot of countries that will never look at Bitcoin credibly even if they support it. The US may be one of those, but there’s an increasing body of countries that will become dual-currency and they will look at their local currency and then they will look at Bitcoin. They will say both of these two things are needed. 
One when you’re transacting on a daily basis for random goods and services and two when you need to buy a permanent asset that needs to have residual value, you’ll use something like BTC. And I think that’s a very powerful concept.”
The billionaire also says that Casares asked him to look at the performance of Bitcoin after each halving, an event that cuts miners’ rewards in half. Palihapitiya shares a chart suggesting that BTC could skyrocket close to $500,000 by October 2025 if Bitcoin repeats its performance in the last market cycle.
“And if you look at what this price chart could indicate is that if this thing starts to get to these levels of appreciation, it is going to completely replace gold and start to become something that has transactional utility for hard assets. If you marry that with this worry that some folks have about dollar debasement, you start to see some really interesting opportunities.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $67,886.

China, UAE Vow to Crack Down on Crypto-Enabled Crime in Joint Statement - Coin Edition


							

China and UAE pledged to fortify the battle against crypto-related cybercrime.
In a joint statement, they highlighted telecom fraud and online gambling as areas of mutual concern.
In addition to security concerns, the statement stressed supporting bilateral trade and investment partnerships.




China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have united their forces, pledging to fortify their cooperation in the relentless battle against cybercrime linked to cryptocurrency. This came via an official joint statement released following UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s state visit to China. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s state visit to China.



Specifically, the joint statement highlights ‘telecommunications network fraud and online gambling’ as areas of mutual concern. This shared focus suggests a promising future where both nations are determined to curb illegal activities that might exploit cryptocurrencies.



Similarly, the two countries highlighted their commitment to fighting money laundering, human trafficking, drug trafficking, and illegal immigration, potentially signaling a broader effort to address illicit financial flows that could involve digital assets.



While the statement does not mention specific regulations targeting cryptocurrency, it suggests a coordinated approach by China and the UAE to address potential misuse of crypto technologies. 



In addition to security concerns, the statement stressed the importance of supporting bilateral trade and investment partnerships. The two nations pledged to promote trade, facilitate investment, and develop tourism through the Joint Economic and Trade Committee.



A key aspect of the joint statement was the recognition of central bank digital currency (CBDC) in enhancing cross-border trade and investment. Both countries expressed their commitment to deepening bilateral and multilateral cooperation under the Memorandum of Understanding on Strengthening Central Bank Digital Currency Cooperation, signed by their central banks.



China praised the UAE for its pioneering effort in completing the first direct cross-border CBDC transaction, the “Digital Dirham,” valued at 50 million dirhams through the “Multilateral Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” platform. This milestone transaction has opened new opportunities for trade and investment between the two nations.

New Solana Memecoin Eminem's Spaghetti to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Eminem’s Spaghetti could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.



Eminem’s Spaghetti (EMINSPAG), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because EMINSPAG has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Eminem’s Spaghetti can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Eminem’s Spaghetti could become the next viral memecoin.



Eminem’s Spaghetti launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Eminem’s Spaghetti on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Eminem’s Spaghetti by entering its contract address – 2ZWPydBxNByXx8D7m2h8CiFkMpjgMWTsrztXLhw1bohd – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like EMINSPAG.

Ripple could sell 400 million XRP in June; Largest dump in 7 years


    Ripple has prepared its treasury account for what could be the largest monthly XRP dump since 2017. The company has reserved 400 million XRP tokens worth $208 million for its sell-off in June.



Every month, Ripple—the largest XRP holder and entity behind the XRP Ledger development—sells part of its reserves, inflating the circulating supply.



As usual, it unlocked 1 billion XRP, worth $520 million, on June 1. This happened through the XRP Ledger escrow system from two labeled accounts: ‘Ripple (24)‘ and ‘Ripple (25).’ 







However, in addition to the usual 200 million tokens sent to the treasury each month, the dormant account ‘Ripple (35)‘ added another 200 million XRP to ‘Ripple (1),’ which could mean the company is preparing for a larger dump this month.

Ripple XRP reserves and escrow activity in May



As developed, ‘Ripple (24)’ first sent the 200 million XRP for May’s sell-off to ‘Ripple (1)’. Later, the account sent 300 million tokens to ‘Ripple (13)’ and re-locked the amount for an escrow to September 2027.



In the meantime, ‘Ripple (25)’ sent the 500 million unlocked tokens to ‘Ripple (12),’ locking them up until October 2027. All these transactions can be verified on-chain through the block explorer XRP Scan.

Ripple historical dumps



Since 2017, when it implemented escrows, Ripple has systematically reserved no more than 350 million XRP for its monthly dumps.



The company has sometimes kept part of the month’s reserves, waiting for a better sell-off opportunity in the following months. Conversely, other months saw a superior dump of what was previously reserved, never surpassing 400 million XRP.



In 2024, Ripple sold 226 million, 260 million, 240 million, 200 million, and 200 million from January to May, respectively.



Interestingly, Ripple implemented the escrow system in 2017 due to investors’ complaints about the lack of transparency in the ongoing dumps, which heavily affected prices. Nevertheless, despite the increased transparency, the supply inflation economic effects continue impacting XRP performance.



XRP price analysis amid Ripple sell-offs



It is noteworthy how Ripple sales directly impact XRP’s price, considering the supply pressure they create on the spot market. Historically, XRP suffered a local crash most of the time Ripple sold its tokens.



Year-to-date, only five of the 12 sell-off days had positive price action: February 5, 11, April 14, May 13, and 20. All the other seven days were of local crashes, evidencing the importance of monitoring the company’s activities.



Moreover, XRP had a negative monthly performance in three of the first five months of 2024, year-to-date.

As of this writing, XRP trades at $0.515. Therefore, investors should closely monitor Ripple’s dumps in June, as they could slow down an expected bull rally this cycle.

Is WIF's position under threat? MOTHER may have something to say... - AMBCrypto



MOTHER, a memecoin by pop musician Iggy Azalea, surpassed WIF’s trading volume significantly
WIF’s social popularity has declined over the last few days too

A few months ago, Dogwifhat[WIF] was one of the market’s favorite memecoins for whales and retail traders alike. However, the last few weeks have seen newer memecoins garnering significant attention and capturing much of WIF’s own spotlight.
Will WIF holders see red?
MOTHER, a popular memecoin created by Iggy Azalea, is one such memecoin, with the crypto wildly popular across social media. In fact, such has been the scale of its popularity that the altcoin managed to surpass the trading volume for WIF by a significant margin.
Source: DEXScreener
At press time, WIF was trading at $3.25, with its price down by 3.20% in the last 24 hours. The memecoin’s price saw major fluctuations over the past few weeks, moving between the $4.1243 and $1.9586 levels. No bullish or bearish trend has been established due to the high volatility exhibited by this memecoin.
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) for WIF declined to 41.84 over the last few days. This indicated that bullish momentum around WIF had fallen significantly. Moreover, the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) also fell to -0.27. A declining CMF is a sign of capital outflows across WIF’s market.
If this trend continues, the altcoin’s price could retest its $2.479 levels in the future.
Source: Trading View
Looking at market sentiment
Another factor that could influence WIF significantly would be its popularity on social media platforms. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the social volume for WIF fell. Coupled with that, the weighted sentiment around WIF also declined significantly over the last few days.
A falling weighted sentiment meant that the number of negative comments around WIF outweighed positive ones, at the time of writing.
Source: Santiment
Declining social volume and falling sentiment could lend more downward pressure to the market.
Traders shared a similar sentiment. In fact, an examination of Coinglass’ data revealed that the number of short positions taken against WIF had surged over the past few days. The percentage of shorts grew from 48% to 52.5% over the past week.

WIF’s price could see some green in the future, if the popularity of newly introduced memecoins dies down. And, if WIF manages to regain some of its lost market share.

Coinbase vs. Big Brother: Crypto Exchange Accuses SEC of Trying to Kill Digital Assets


								Coinbase, the leading US cryptocurrency exchange, is doubling down on its fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), accusing the regulatory body of attempting to strangle the crypto industry through “regulation by enforcement.”

The SEC-Coinbase Acrimony
In a fiery appeal filed on May 31st, Coinbase paints a picture of the SEC as an innovation-squashing behemoth, prioritizing enforcement actions over establishing clear and fair guidelines for the growing digital asset space.
The crux of the dispute lies in the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase, initiated in June 2023. The SEC alleges Coinbase violated securities laws by failing to register as a broker or exchange.


Coinbase counters that the SEC’s existing regulations are ambiguous when applied to cryptocurrencies, making compliance a near-impossible feat.
This sentiment appears to be shared by some within the SEC itself. Commissioner Hester Pierce, a vocal advocate for clearer crypto regulations, recently proposed a collaborative sandbox program where US and UK blockchain firms could experiment with tokenized securities under defined parameters.
This initiative stands in stark contrast to the SEC’s current approach, which Coinbase likens to “wielding a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.”
The SEC, however, defends its stance. In its initial lawsuit against Coinbase, the agency argued that existing regulations are sufficient and their enforcement actions serve as a clear roadmap for the industry. They likely view the successful lawsuit as vindication of their approach.

Crypto’s Regulatory Crossroads


The outcome of the Coinbase appeal has the potential to be a watershed moment for the crypto industry. A win for Coinbase could force the SEC to the negotiating table, paving the way for a more collaborative regulatory framework.


Conversely, a victory for the SEC might solidify their enforcement-centric approach, potentially stifling innovation and pushing US crypto firms overseas to friendlier regulatory shores.
The larger political scene adds another level of intrigue. Both parties are starting to pay attention to the growing significance of cryptocurrencies in light of the upcoming presidential elections. While some legislators support encouraging innovation within a well-defined regulatory framework, others share the SEC’s apprehensions regarding possible hazards to investors.

The regulation of cryptocurrencies may not be settled in the future. Will the US adopt this technology and become a global center for cryptocurrency, or will strict enforcement spur innovation abroad?

Galaxy Digital CEO on Crypto’s Bipartisan Potential | Cryptoglobe


                                
During a conversation with CNBC corrspondenant MacKenzie Sigalos at the recent Consensus 2024 conference (held May 29-31, 2024, in Auston, Texas) Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz shared his thoughts on the evolving landscape of institutional crypto, political shifts affecting the industry, and the future of digital assets. 



Seismic Shifts in Crypto Politics



Novogratz highlighted the recent political upheavals that have significantly influenced the crypto market. He noted a pivotal moment when the White House announced President Biden’s intent to veto the overturn of SAB 121, an arcane accounting rule filed by the SEC. This action led to a political backlash, particularly from the Republican side, with figures like Donald Trump positioning themselves as pro-crypto. Novogratz emphasized that this move has mobilized the crypto community, making it a potent political force. He pointed out that there are now more crypto owners in America than dog owners, many of whom are single-issue voters.



Bipartisan Support and the Future of Regulation



Novogratz says that the political dynamics around crypto are shifting towards a more bipartisan approach. Novogratz mentioned that significant Democratic figures, such as Senators Schumer and Torres, have started to support crypto-friendly legislation, recognizing the substantial voter base. This bipartisan support was exemplified by the passing of FIT 21 in the House, which aims to bring regulatory clarity to the market.



Novogratz believes that the market infrastructure bill and the overturning of restrictive accounting rules are crucial for integrating traditional financial institutions into the crypto space. He anticipates that these changes will enable major custodians like Bank of New York and State Street to start custodying crypto assets, which will pave the way for a broader institutional adoption.



The Impact of Institutional Involvement







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The conversation also touched upon the current state and potential future of spot Bitcoin and spot Ether ETFs. Despite the regulatory hurdles, Novogratz is optimistic about the institutional adoption of these products. He explained that institutions are slowly warming up to the idea of crypto, driven largely by client demand. However, he noted that regulatory clarity is essential for the full participation of major financial entities like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.



Novogratz highlighted that while the current involvement of institutions in crypto is still in its early stages, the potential for growth is immense. He predicts a significant influx of institutional investment once regulatory uncertainties are resolved.



The Role of Crypto in the Broader Economic Context



Novogratz provided a macroeconomic perspective, linking the crypto market’s resilience to broader economic trends. He pointed out that despite the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance and the absence of expected rate cuts, the crypto market has remained strong. This resilience, according to Novogratz, is due to the U.S. government’s continued fiscal irresponsibility and the growing appeal of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.



Galaxy Digital’s Strategic Direction



Discussing Galaxy Digital, Novogratz outlined the company’s future plans, emphasizing a shift towards on-chain initiatives. He acknowledged the challenges posed by the current regulatory environment but expressed confidence in the eventual resolution of these issues. He also touched on Galaxy’s involvement in the liquidation of the FTX estate, praising the efficiency of the U.S. bankruptcy system in resolving the crisis and returning value to creditors.



Tokenization and the Future of Finance



One of the most forward-looking aspects of Novogratz’s talk was his discussion on tokenization. He believes that the tokenization of assets is a game-changer that will slowly build momentum before rapidly transforming the financial landscape. Novogratz noted that major financial institutions are already preparing for this shift by investing in the necessary infrastructure.

Here's How Much Crypto Was Lost in May Due to Hacks: CertiK


																According to blockchain security firm CertiK, the cryptocurrency sector lost $42.6 million in May to exploits, flash loans, and exit scams.
Despite these setbacks, approximately $96.2 million was recovered, offering some relief from the economic impact.
Flash Loan Attacks Dominate Blockchain Losses
Flash loan attacks caused the largest losses in the crypto sector, totaling approximately $20.7 million. Sonne Finance suffered the most, losing $20 million, followed by TLN Protocol, which lost $746,000. GPU and Saturn Token also faced losses totaling $32,394 and $8,343, respectively.


Exploits also significantly impacted the sector, accounting for approximately $19.7 million in losses. Gala Games suffered the most substantial loss at $21.6 million, followed by AlexLab at $4.3 million, Pump Fun at $1.9 million, GNUS.ai at $1.28 million, and Orion at $947,000.




While less common, exit scams still contributed around $1.8 million to the losses. Among these, Trees On Sol lost $1.11 million, Pii Park $490,000, Novamind $123,019, and Arbalest $91,520.
Interestingly, flash loan attacks have consistently led to significant losses in odd-numbered months throughout the year. January, March, and May saw losses of $15.3 million, $21.9 million, and $20.7 million, respectively. In contrast, losses in February and April were less than $150,000 each.
Meanwhile, February experienced the most severe loss overall due to exit scams, totaling $58.3 million, with less than 10% of this total recorded in other months.
Crypto Hacks and Rug Pulls Persist
In the year-to-date of 2024, security service provider Immunefi reports that over $473 million worth of cryptocurrency has been lost to hacks and rug pulls across 108 incidents.
The decentralized finance (DeFi) market remains the primary target for hackers, while centralized finance companies did not experience any attacks in 2024. Last year, over $2 billion was lost to hacks and exploits, about half the total from the previous year.
In May 2024, Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most targeted chains, collectively representing 62% of the total losses across targeted chains.
Crypto hacks and exploits are still a continuing problem. Just recently, due to a hack, DMM Bitcoin, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, reported losing 48 billion yen ($305 million) of Bitcoin (BTC). In a blog post, DMM Bitcoin stated that 4,502.9 BTC “leaked” out of the exchange.

USDe Hits $3 Billion Market Supply Just Four Months After Launching - Coin Edition


							

USDe hits $3 billion supply mark in four months, sets record.
The ‘synthetic dollar’ accumulated $1 billion since April 5.
The USDe is on track to challenge DAI as the largest algorithmic or decentralized stablecoin.




Ethena Labs’ USDe stablecoin has set a record by becoming the first of its category of cryptocurrency to reach the $3 billion supply mark only four months after it launched. Also known as ‘synthetic dollar,’ the USDe launched in February 2024 and maintains its peg through arbitrage mechanics and a yield-returning cash-and-carry trade.









Available reports show that the USDe’s supply crossed the $2 billion threshold on April 5. Since then, the stablecoin has accumulated an extra $1 billion in supply, putting it on track to challenge DAI as the largest algorithmic or decentralized stablecoin. This assumption is based on the synthetic dollar’s growth rate, knowing it would need to attract an extra $2 billion supply to complete with DAI.



Notably, the USDe’s impressive growth puts it in the fourth position in the overall stablecoin market, posting a 3.3% market share. However, this figure remains pale compared to the flagship stablecoin Tether, which leads the stablecoins market with a 57% dominance.



Conservative crypto users consider USDe’s growth a reminder of the infamous Terraform Lab’s UST stablecoin. However, the former boasts a different token mechanism. The USDe’s yield comes from a cash-and-carry trade and staking revenue, which is then shared with holders. It is also worth noting that Bybit, the renowned cryptocurrency exchange, recently integrated USDe, providing spot trading pairs with Ethereum and Bitcoin.



Another noteworthy event is the project’s recent airdrop launch, promoting awareness and subsequent adoption. USDe started airdropping its governance token, ENA, in April, coinciding with the surge in market supply. The stablecoin’s market capitalization has reached $1.98 billion at the time of writing, according to CoinmarketCap’s data, with the token trading for $0.994, reflecting a 1.99% pullback in the last 24 hours.

‘Hundreds of Trillions’- Sergey Nazarov Says 2024 Is Year Crypto and Global Financial System Merge - The Daily Hodl


								Chainlink (LINK) co-creator Sergey Nazarov says this could be the year that sees a great merger between blockchain and the traditional global financial system.
In a speech at the Consensus 2024 conference, Nazarov says the market for on-chain assets is more than $100 trillion.










The Chainlink co-creator shares a chart showing that the $2.7 trillion debt market and the $106 trillion stock market can move into the blockchain. The chart also shows that other assets such as global real estate and derivatives can be tokenized.
Source: Chainlink/YouTube
Nazarov says that eventually, all financial transactions will take place on-chain, and that 2024 is the year that the global financial system will start moving its settlement systems onto the public blockchains.
“So we’re kind of at another tipping point where the amount of value that you’re seeing in this real-world asset digital asset tokenization trend, even on public chains, has now surpassed DeFi (decentralized finance). And this isn’t even counting all the value in private chains, banks’ chains, and all those more private systems, so it’s even more value than that. 
The world we’re going to is still the world where all the world’s value, all the credits, all derivatives, all commodities, everything is basically on-chain, and represented on-chain and composable on-chain into more and more advanced financial products, in an efficient quick way so we’re not taking months, we’re talking minutes to seconds. 
Right now what takes months, will take minutes to seconds, and as more and more assets get on-chain, they’ll become composable, and they’ll begin to create their own benefits from being composed into more and more advanced baskets of things. 
So right now, we’re basically in the position where we’re at a tipping point, where the numbers have surpassed what they were in the past, and we’re on a trajectory where all the world’s biggest institutions are starting to look at how to put their value on-chain. 
So I would say, basically that this year is when our industry shifts into this new direction about public chains and about the global financial system merging into a single industry, into a single internet of contracts.”

Trading expert sets one condition for Bitcoin to ‘pick back up again’


    Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating above $67,000 after facing rejection at the $70,000 mark, while the market anticipates a potential breakout.



Indeed, crypto trading expert Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin has room for a breakout, but the cryptocurrency needs to clear specific barriers.



Particularly, in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on June 1, the expert stated that Bitcoin’s path to recovery hinges on ceasing its current pattern of forming lower highs.







Rekt Capital’s analysis highlighted a consistent rejection of Bitcoin at decreasing price points, a trend that has characterized the cryptocurrency’s performance over recent months. 



He noted that the price levels of $71,600 and around $70,000 have acted as resistance in Bitcoin’s recent trading history. These zones have repeatedly capped Bitcoin’s attempts to rally, confirming them as significant barriers that must be overcome for a bullish reversal to materialize.








“Bitcoin continues to reject at lower and lower prices, forming a series of Lower Highs. First Bitcoin rejected at ~$71,500. Then, price confirmed the blue square as a local topping area, as per recent history. When this series of Lower Highs ends, that is when Bitcoin will start to pick back up again,” he said. 




Implication of Bitcoin’s price movement 



In technical terms, a lower high occurs when a peak is lower than the preceding peak, signaling a bearish trend as sellers increasingly dominate the market. The identification of successively lower highs at the $71,500 mark, followed by subsequent rejections at progressively lower price points, underlines a persistent downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.



Based on the analysis, when Bitcoin establishes a higher high, it would indicate a shift in market sentiment, potentially paving the way for renewed bullish activity.



On March 26, the expert also pointed out that if Bitcoin successfully retests the $69,170 area, it will enable further upside.







Notably, Bitcoin failed to maintain the momentum established early in the week after the crypto surged to $69,000 on Monday. However, bulls could not sustain the upward trajectory as the crypto retracted. This coincided with the hacking of Japan’s crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin, which lost over $300 million in Bitcoin.



Overall, Bitcoin remains sluggish, failing to make a significant move in either direction.



Bitcoin price analysis



Bitcoin’s consolidation is evident in the asset’s weekly timeframe, which reflects a correction of over 2% during the period. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin is down over 0.1%, trading at $67,485 by press time.

In the meantime, the challenge is on Bitcoin bulls to help the asset exit the current consolidation so that it can have a real shot at reclaiming a new record high.

Whales pour $110 million into DOGE, betting big on meme coin surge


    Dogecoin (DOGE) has attracted significant attention from crypto investors, with a whopping $110 million funneled into the meme coin by whales over the past 72 hours.



This influx signals a renewed interest in DOGE, which has lagged behind other meme coins in recent gains.



Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that DOGE whales have scooped over 700 million DOGE (worth approximately $112 million). 











This trend aligns with a broader shift among traders towards high-beta meme tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE).



According to Singapore-based crypto-trading firm QCP Capital, traders are shifting their focus to legacy meme coins. 



“Traders are shifting focus to higher beta meme tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIBA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Pepe (PEPE), which have seen double-digit gains (10-20%) and are polling in the top 10 for open interest,” 



Adding to the optimism, crypto expert Michael van de Poppe projected in a May 31 X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin is poised for a massive breakout in the future, potentially resulting in a price surge of approximately 566% to reach the coveted $1 mark. 



The $1 threshold has long been a target price for the meme cryptocurrency.



Market sentiment and price movements



Dogecoin, the first and one of the most popular meme coins, initially gained massive popularity and triggered a significant bullish wave within the markets. However, trader activity faded over time, reducing the token’s volatility. 



DOGE 7-day price chart. Source : Finbold



This recent activity suggests that a significant price turn could be on the horizon. Dogecoin has remained below $0.18 for over a month, and a strong rebound from current levels might trigger a fresh rally. 



At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1576, reflecting a 1.09% decrease on the daily chart but an 18% increase on the monthly chart.



Historical price action suggests Dogecoin is slowly yet steadily heading towards its highs.



Despite closing the previous month on a bearish note, bulls have regained some dominance. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator has just turned bullish and entered the positive range, indicating that the rally may continue despite bearish interferences.



Bullish and bearish indicators



Despite a brief downturn where bullish momentum failed to breach the 24-hour high of $0.1613, DOGE found support after dipping to $0.1549. This slight recovery saw DOGE’s market capitalization hit $22.79B, although the 24-hour trading volume dropped by 34% to $536.24 million.



However, bearish risks remain. DOGE’s open interest (OI) has declined by 0.34% to $929.80 million, and derivatives volume has dropped by 39.89% to $1.08 billion. 



These indicators reflect underlying bearish sentiment but do not overshadow the substantial whale activity, which suggests a positive outlook for Dogecoin.



Therefore, while Dogecoin is striving to maintain a bullish trend, investors should remain cautious of the bearish indicators.



A fresh upswing may begin if bulls display strength at these levels, potentially driving a significant rally for the meme coin.

Biden Vetoes Repeal of Controversial Crypto Guidelines, Sparking Criticism from Senator Lummis



                    

United States President Joe Biden has missed the chance to “correct” his stance on cryptocurrency assets by vetoing the repeal of controversial cryptocurrency accounting guidelines, claims pro-crypto U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis.



“Congress gave the administration the opportunity to correct its position on crypto assets,” Lummis stated on May 31 on X, after Biden vetoed a Congressional resolution aimed at overturning the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121.




Lummis argued that Biden acted against the “will of the American people” by preventing the repeal of these guidelines. She emphasized her determination to continue addressing the issue.



“I will not stand idly by as the administration attempts to skirt the law, and I will continue to fight to promote financial innovation and key protections for crypto assets this administration seems hellbent on stifling,” Lummis wrote.

The SAB 121 guidelines require firms holding customers’ crypto assets in custody to record them as a liability on their balance sheet, with a corresponding asset, making it a less attractive option for publicly reporting banks.



Lummis’s statement came just hours after she sent a letter to Biden urging him not to veto the Congressional repeal of the SEC’s SAB 121.



“By inappropriately issuing guidance instead of engaging in notice and comment rulemaking, the SEC’s rulemaking was able to avoid a vote by the full commission on a contentious policy,” Lummis wrote.



Despite the House of Representatives and Senate votes favoring the repeal of the controversial guidelines, support for cryptocurrency is increasing among Senators.




Republican Senator Ted Cruz, another pro-crypto official, shared with his 6.3 million X followers that he has begun Bitcoin mining. 



“I just bought 3 Bitcoin miners that started hashing today in Iraan, TX. I’m proud to join the ranks of Texas Bitcoin miners,” Cruz wrote in a May 31 X post.

Hedera


However, Upbit has recently changed its listing policy. The exchange, which had rarely made listings on the KRW market before, has recently exhibited an unusual behavior by listing 3 different altcoins in a row, especially in the last three days. The reason for the change is thought to be the regulation that will come into force in South Korea in July and will restrict the listings of altcoins.
Upbit has listed Bounce, Stargate and BEAM altcoins in the last three days. However, there are still many altcoins listed on the platform only as Bitcoin pairs, and according to some analysts, these may be candidates for listing on the KRW market in the future. You can find these in our news below.

Bitcoin Startup Babylon Raises $70 Million to Expand BTC Staking


Babylon, a pioneering Bitcoin startup, has secured $70 million in funding to develop a unique staking solution that integrates Bitcoin with other blockchain networks.
Led by Paradigm, a prominent crypto venture capital firm, the funding round also saw contributions from Polychain Capital​, HashKey Capital, and other investors.

Babylon Aims to Expand Bitcoin’s Utility
Babylon aims to leverage Bitcoin’s security to enable staking across different blockchain platforms. Traditionally, staking is a associated with Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains. Babylon’s approach is novel as it seeks to implement Bitcoin, a Proof of Work (PoW) asset, in a PoS-like system. This helps to strengthen the safety of other networks and offer new revenue streams for BTC holders.
This funding milestone highlights growing investor confidence in innovative solutions and the potential for Bitcoin to play a more versatile role in the broader ecosystem. Before Paradigm’s involvement, Babylon raised $33 million across several rounds and secured an undisclosed investment from Binance Labs.

“We will continue to push the technical boundaries and foster the Babylon ecosystem. Achieving this requires dedicated efforts from both our core team and the broader community. The funds raised will ensure we excel in realizing our vision of a Bitcoin-secured decentralized economy,” Fisher Yu, Babylon co-founder, told BeInCrypto.

Babylon’s strategy could bridge the gap between Bitcoin’s secure, decentralized nature and the flexible smart contract capabilities of PoS networks. The startup has already made significant progress. In February 2024, it launched the world’s first trustless Bitcoin staking testnet, attracting over 100,000 stakers within 48 hours.
Babylon’s $70 million raise is a significant step toward integrating Bitcoin into the staking economy of other blockchains. By harnessing Bitcoin’s security for staking purposes on networks like Ethereum and Solana, the project is poised to unlock new opportunities for cryptocurrency users and investors. Its innovative approach could set a precedent for cross-chain integrations, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position.

Notcoin (NOT) Notches 47% Daily Profit To Emerge Top Market Gainer


																Popular play-to-earn token Notcoin (NOT), has continued to retain investors’ attention over the last week with a stunning positive market performance. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Notcoin gained 46.97% in the last day emerging as the top-performing asset in the market.

Notcoin Records Weekly Gains Of 238%
With the general crypto market showing a stable price movement, Notcoin’s explosive performance which indicates a high level of buying pressure has taken center stage among spectators, analysts, and prospective investors. 
The crypto gaming project was initially introduced as a closed beta version in November 2023 by the Open Builders and supported by the Open Network (TON) Foundation. Following its official launch in January 2024, Notcoin quickly garnered much attention, registering millions of users due to its simplistic gameplay and strategic integration with the social media app Telegram. 
In this play-to-earn game, players earn NOT coins by tapping continuously on a virtual gold coin and executing simple tasks. However, in recent times, Notcoin has introduced a new feature known as “earnings missions” which allows users to passively stack up NOT tokens. 
The NOT token was officially airdropped on May 16 and has since showcased both sides of the crypto market’s volatility. Following this release, Notcoin initially dipped by over 60% falling from $0.012 to trade as low as $0.0050.
However, in the last week, the token has put up a remarkable performance gaining by 237.70% to attain an all-time high value of $0.01781. Notably, Notcoin’s market cap value has also grown from $526.77 million to about $1.81 billion pushing the token into the top sixty cryptocurrencies.

What’s Next For Notcoin?
At press time, NOT trades at $0.01735 following a 155.57% rise in its daily trading volume per data from CoinMarketCap. 
According to a prediction by Coincodex, the sentiment around Notcoin is highly bullish with a Fear & Greed Index of 72. With the bulls retaining market control, Coincodex predicts the play-to-earn token to rise to $0.021 and $0.054 in five and thirty days respectively. 
However, on the token’s 4-hour trading chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is well in the overbought zone indicating a trend reversal may lie on the horizon and the current bull trend may soon be over.

Nevertheless, Notcoin’s future trajectory remains uncertain and will likely be influenced by future network developments/features and the project’s ability to retain its growing customer base. All investors are admonished to conduct proper research before investing in any asset as the crypto market remains subject to high levels of volatility.

Investors have been long anticipating a breakout from XRP, especially with the market trends and regulatory outlook swinging in its favor. One top analyst has made a bullish case for the market capitalization of XRP to blast to an astounding $3 trillion in the next cycle phase.



This comes as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse remains convinced that XRP could be the next altcoin to get its own spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.



XRP, Solana, ADA ETFs Are Inevitable: Brad Garlinghouse



Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse predicts that more crypto exchange-traded funds are coming, following the greenlighting of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs and positive progress on ones created to hold Ethereum (ETH) directly. 



Speaking on stage at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Garlinghouse predicted the inevitable approval of XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) ETFs. “I think it’s just a matter of time, and it’s inevitable there’s gonna be an XRP ETF, there’s gonna be a Solana ETF, there’s gonna be a Cardano ETF, and that’s great,” he posited.



In a remarkable policy change, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave the regulatory blessing to several spot ether ETFs, propelling the price of the underlying crypto to the highest level since March. Following the approval of the 19b-4 forms on May 23, the only remaining step is for the S-1 registration statements to become effective before trading can finally commence.

The SEC has reportedly asked would-be issuers to submit their draft S-1 filings by May 31. The SEC will then deliver its first round of comments, which will result in additional amendments. Notably, VanEck handed in a revised S-1 form on the same day the initial key filings were approved. BlackRock followed on May 30, revealing that its ETH ETF would be seeded with $10 million.



The White Channel: XRP’s Galactic Voyage To A $3 Trillion Market Cap



Meanwhile, XRP appears to be on the brink of a parabolic breakout as the crypto expects a massive move before November based on a confluence of technical factors.



Analyst Egrag Crypto highlighted an ascending channel pattern known as “the White Channel,” within which the XRP market cap has traded since 2017. This is a historically reliable indicator of price movement. Once the XRP market value sustainably breaches the channel, the crypto could enjoy an astronomical flight to a $3 trillion market cap.



XRP currently boasts a $28.6 billion market cap. According to pseudonymous analyst Egrag Crypto, even reaching the top of the White Channel would translate to a market cap of nearly $290 billion, a considerable leap from its current level.







He believes this is the point where XRP’s market value will propel like a rocket, possibly kickstarting unprecedented growth for the digital currency. Notably, attaining a $3 trillion market cap would mean XRP dethrones market Goliaths like Ethereum and Bitcoin.



Meanwhile, the price of XRP is currently in a tug-of-war between the bulls and bears, indicating a lack of aggressive buying or selling by the traders. The token is currently trading for $0.517, according to CoinGecko.

Exclusive FED Rate Comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari: Will There Be a Rate Cut? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Minneapolis FED President Neel Kashkari warned that the FED will need to maintain higher interest rates for a long time. This warning came in response to repeated inflation overshoots and resilient demand.
“It's likely that we'll want to hold rates for a while longer,” Kashkari said in an interview with the Financial Times' Monetary Policy Radar before the publication blackout period associated with the Fed's June 12 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.


Although he is not a voting member of the committee this year, Kashkari has been hawkish on the FOMC lately. Its impact increased after inflation surprised upwards for three consecutive months in early 2024.
Kashkari will express his views on the possible course of interest rates in the dot chart, which will be published on June 12 and reflects his hawkish stance.





He said he was watching housing and services inflation particularly closely and believed both would likely remain high in the coming months.
Regarding housing, Kashkari said, “we are not seeing demand decrease as much as expected.” New rents and rentals are rising again, meaning “housing inflation will remain high for some time.”


This contrasts with Jay Powell's view. The current FED President has repeatedly emphasized that falling rents will be an important factor in reducing inflation in the future.
Regarding services more broadly, Kashkari disagrees with the recent narrative that labor demand in the US has noticeably softened.





He bases his view on anecdotal evidence from his district, which is home to a wide range of industries from agriculture to mining to healthcare. Many businesses report that the labor market is still tight and they are still competing to attract workers for vacant positions.
The fact that the labor market is so strong is beneficial to the FED, as it means that the FED will not have to compromise between its dual goals of 2 percent inflation and full employment.
If the Fed were still facing skyrocketing unemployment along with high inflation, it would be much worse off.

But the combination of a strong economy and continued high inflation means that “the cost to our credibility of prematurely declaring victory is so high that we should not rush to cut rates,” Kashkari notes.
He believes that his hawkish stance is shared by the US public. When asked why U.S. consumers feel so negatively about the economy, he said they “really instinctively hate inflation,” but because most U.S. mortgage holders borrow at long-term fixed rates, most people haven't yet noticed the higher interest rates.

Speaking to the Financial Times, Kashkari stated that the FED “will never want to ignore raising the policy rate” but that keeping interest rates constant would be enough to reduce inflation.





However, Kashkari said that if a rate hike is necessary, this move would not jeopardize the FED's credibility because the central bank has never completely closed the door to this possibility.

The Rise of Re-Staking in Crypto: A High-Risk, High-Reward Trend | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to Reuters, Seattle-based startup EigenLayer has taken the crypto world by storm, attracting $18.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency to its platform in just six months. The company, founded by former University of Washington assistant professor Sreeram Kannan, has invented a new investment strategy called “re-staking,” which has quickly become a popular choice among traders seeking high yields.



EigenLayer is a groundbreaking protocol developed on the Ethereum blockchain, introducing the concept of “restaking.” This allows users who have already staked their Ethereum (ETH) to leverage their staked assets further, enhancing both security and potential rewards within the Ethereum ecosystem.



Restaking in EigenLayer enables Ethereum stakers to use their already-staked ETH or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to secure additional decentralized applications (DApps) and services on the network. By opting into EigenLayer’s smart contracts, stakers can restake their assets, which helps increase security for these new applications. This is achieved without unstaking the original ETH, thereby maximizing the utility and efficiency of the staked capital.



EigenLayer provides numerous benefits. It significantly boosts protocol security by allowing protocols to tap into Ethereum’s robust security layer by incentivizing ETH stakers. This increases the security of new applications built on Ethereum. The protocol offers a high degree of flexibility, allowing developers to retain control over their projects while leveraging Ethereum’s security. This flexibility facilitates developer success by lowering the barriers to building new validator pools, thus promoting innovation and development of new projects.



However, EigenLayer also introduces some risks and complexities. Stakers face slashing penalties on the consensus layer and any additional slashing conditions set by the protocols they support, potentially affecting up to 100% of their staked ETH. The promise of increased yield might lead stakers to redirect their assets to EigenLayer, centralizing a significant portion of Ethereum’s staking power. Moreover, competition among protocols to offer higher yields could lead to unsustainable practices and potentially lower overall yields for users.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

A practical application of EigenLayer’s capabilities is EigenDA, a data availability layer that enhances scalability by offloading data storage tasks. This approach helps reduce transaction fees on Layer 2 solutions and improves data bandwidth, making it a vital tool for the Ethereum ecosystem.



EigenLayer represents a significant advancement in Ethereum’s staking and security model. By allowing ETH stakers to restake their assets across multiple protocols, it enhances security, rewards, and capital efficiency. However, it also introduces new risks and complexities that need careful consideration. As the protocol evolves, it promises to play a crucial role in shaping the future of decentralized applications on Ethereum.



Reuters’ report says that the growth of re-staking platforms has been fueled by users seeking airdrops and other giveaways, with the expectation of future rewards. However, experts like David Duong, head of institutional research at U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, warn that re-staking is “very risky,” as users are investing in anticipation of rewards without knowing what they will receive.



The Reuters article also mentions that. despite the risks, re-staking is catching on with institutional investors. Some, like Standard Chartered’s crypto arm, Zodia Custody, have observed significant interest in staking but consider re-staking a step too far due to the difficulty in establishing a clear “paper trail” of asset movements and reward distribution. Others, such as Nomura’s crypto arm, Laser Digital, have partnered with re-staking platforms like Kelp DAO to participate in this emerging trend.

Cardano Creator Breaks Silence on ADA Price


The Cardano community has been abuzz with humor and speculation as ADA remains steadfast around the $0.45 mark. Such price stability has spawned a number of memes and jokes, with enthusiasts referring to the token as a "stablecoin."One particularly popular meme shows the Grim Reaper knocking on doors labeled $0.45 per ADA token, symbolizing the token's stable price level.This wave of humor has not gone unnoticed by Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano. Known for rarely addressing the ADA price directly, Hoskinson made an exception and joined in the community's lighthearted take on the situation. He pinned his own version of the Grim Reaper meme, depicting Death in disbelief at ADA's unyielding price. While humorous, Hoskinson's response subtly acknowledged the frustration and curiosity surrounding ADA's price movements. Cardano (ADA) price outlookHistorically, ADA has experienced similar periods of price stagnation. A look at its monthly chart reveals a pattern of prolonged stability at certain price points. Five years ago, ADA hovered around $0.04, and in 2021, it hovered near $1 per token.ADA to USD by CoinMarketCapThe current price level of $0.45 is not unprecedented; it has tested traders' patience before. However, unlike the downward trajectory of two years ago, the current trend appears to be upward.The critical question on the minds of Cardano enthusiasts is whether this stability indicates a bullish accumulation phase. If ADA is indeed poised for an upward surge, the waiting period may seem more bearable. However, the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market means that certainty is elusive.

Notcoin hits new high as Piggy Bankster aims for dominance - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Notcoin surged to a new all-time high above $0.2, with trading volumes spiking on Binance, OKX and Bybit.
Piggy Bankster (PIGS) is the new memecoin on Solana that’s creating a huge buzz today.
PIGS is set for a fair launch on June 4, priced at $0.00012.

 Notcoin (NOT) began June with a bang, soaring amid a wave of interest across the crypto market. 
Today, the Telegram-linked token reached a new all-time high above $0.2 as trading volumes more than doubled. Yet, with Notcoin dominating the trading market, the hot trend among memecoins has investors’ sights set on Piggy Bankster (PIGS). 
Here’s why the soon-to-launch Solana memecoin could be the one to watch this week.
Notcoin surges amid new interest in tap-to-earn coin
Notcoin’s entry into the market was as a viral tap-to-earn Web3 application on Telegram. The launch on leading exchanges in mid-May saw its massive community push NOT into the top 100 by market cap.
This week, the Notcoin team announced the project’s quest to shift focus away from being just a mining app. With aspects such as Notcoin Explore, Games and Contests, it’s growth that will provide more value to NOT holders.
It’s an announcement that seems to have provided new impetus for Notcoin price, with today’s 59% spike seeing its market cap rise to nearly $2 billion.
As the strategic shift eyes more for users of the tap-to-earn game, interest in the token has surged. Recently, Notcoin noted it had surpassed Shiba Inu, Bonk and Pepe in on-chain holders. 
On June 2, traders positioning for potential gains pushed daily trading volume up by more than 283% to over $2.1 billion. CoinMarketCap data shows NOT outpacing top coins in 24-hour volume on Binance, OKX and Bybit.
Piggy Bankster (PIGS) – the next big memecoin on Solana?
Solana’s recent momentum slowed as Bitcoin and Ethereum pared gains, and as memecoins took the market by storm amid huge events around crypto and the US political landscape.
US President Joe Biden’s vetoing of a crypto bill that would have allowed highly regulated US financial firms to custody Bitcoin and crypto contrasts sharply with former President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Indeed, Trump has become the first US President to accept Bitcoin Lightning payments for his campaign donations.
This sets the upcoming election as probably the first crypto election, with politics dominating new memecoin sensations like MAGA (TRUMP) and Super Trump (STRUMP).
Amid this, analysts are bullish on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. For Solana, its memecoins ecosystem is currently hot with WIF, BONK and MEW among other. However, the next big thing could be Piggy Bankster (PIGS).
What to know about Piggy Bankster’s tokenomics
PIGS is the new pig-themed memecoin poised to go live via a fair launch this week – on June 4, 2024.
Piggy Bankster will have all 100 million tokens available to the community in a sale priced at $0.00012 per token. The transparency and equitability that a fair launch offers has Piggy Bankster already hailed as a winner ahead of its launch.
As highlighted, Piggy Bankster is set to launch with a full 100 million PIGS as the circulating supply. This gives the project an advantage – not just the community-driven approach, but also that price discovery will follow as the market opens.
Investors likely to have missed Notcoin may find PIGS’ $0.00012 price a lot more attractive as an entry point.

El Salvador’s Economic Future Bright With Bitcoin-Centric Vision


On June 1, President Nayib Bukele began his second term at the National Palace in San Salvador, riding on a popularity that has strengthened his power and influence in El Salvador.
In his speech, the 42-year-old president vowed to take decisive action to address the Central American nation’s economic challenges. This pledge follows his earlier success in tackling gang violence during his first term. 
How El Salvador’s Economy Will Scale With Bitcoin

Many Salvadorans are optimistic that he will fulfill his re-election promise of ushering in a “period of prosperity,” driven by his pro-Bitcoin policies. After a recent meeting with Bukele, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood predicted that El Salvador’s GDP could increase tenfold in the next five years, thanks to his focus on Bitcoin and artificial intelligence.

“President Bukele’s determination to turn El Salvador into an oasis for the bitcoin and AI communities — two of the biggest economic and technology revolutions in history — is the reason I believe that its real GDP could scale 10-fold during the next five years,” Wood wrote.

Max Keiser, a senior Bitcoin adviser to President Bukele, outlined how the country could achieve this growth. He envisions El Salvador operating on a circular Bitcoin standard with no debt and generating 10% of the global Bitcoin hash rate using geothermal energy from volcanoes.

“The country’s wealth will be controlled by Salvadorans running their own Bitcoin nodes. Central bankers will have no power, and the IMF will be long gone,” Keiser added.

Bukele has been dubbed the “first Bitcoin president” by many in the industry. In 2021, he made Bitcoin a legal tender after the passage of the historic “Bitcoin Law.” Since then, citizens have been able to use Bitcoin for goods, services, and taxes. Additionally, the nation earns the flagship digital asset through various services, including a citizenship passport program, mining, and government services, which convert Bitcoin to US dollars for local businesses.
Already, Bukele’s initiative has significantly boosted the country’s economy, with its BTC treasury showing over $70 million in unrealized profit.
Indeed, other countries are taking notice and exploring how to replicate this success. Last week, BeInCrypto reported that leading Argentine officials met with their Salvadoran counterparts to discuss Bitcoin regulation strategies used in El Salvador.

New Bitcoin Step from Donald Trump: A First in History - Bitcoin Sistemi


Former President Donald Trump became the first American leader to accept Bitcoin Lightning Network payments for campaign donations.
The Trump campaign partnered with OpenNode, a leading Bitcoin and Lightning Network infrastructure provider, to make these donations. Trump supporters can now contribute to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign using Bitcoin via the Lightning Network, a technology designed to enable fast and low-cost transactions.


“OpenNode is proud to partner with Anedot to bring Bitcoin into the political donation process,” OpenNode said in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine.

“This is the perfect combination of OpenNode's leading Bitcoin technology stack and Anedot's robust platform for political and non-profit organizations. “The Trump campaign's adoption of our solution is a powerful testament to how political campaigns and nonprofits across the country can seamlessly accept Bitcoin donations.”


In his speech at the Libertarian Party convention last weekend, Trump emphasized his commitment to creating a Bitcoin-friendly environment in the United States, declaring that “the future of crypto and Bitcoin will be produced in the United States” and promising to “support the self-custody rights of the country's 50 million crypto holders.” gave.

Putin Boss (PUTINBO) Coin to Explode Over 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Putin Boss (PUTINBO) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Putin Boss (PUTINBO), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PUTINBO will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Putin Boss.



Currently, Putin Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PUTINBO on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Putin Boss by entering its contract address – 34bBAvQ8kkQrP3LPVcmhLQKY9UJNUkK3dtq42m7DD7Ru – in the receiving field.



PUTINBO currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Ethereum ETFs May Have Ended the SEC’s War on Crypto - Decrypt

About the AuthorCarlo D’Angelo is a lawyer, former law professor, and crypto and NFT enthusiast. Carlo’s practice focuses on advising clients in all areas of blockchain technology law. Carlo is also the host of Lex Line, a weekly crypto and blockchain law podcast.
The views expressed here are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Decrypt.May’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was the chef’s kiss on what can only be described as a banner month for crypto policy—and the move could severely undermine the SEC’s ongoing crypto crackdown.As the deadline to approve the Ethereum ETFs loomed, a bipartisan group of House of Representatives members sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler urging the Commission to not only approve the funds, but to also consider approval of “other” digital asset ETFs in the future. And finally, the SEC finally went public late on that fateful Thursday and announced approval of eight spot Ethereum ETF applications.According to Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, the SEC’s approval of spot ETFs effectively deems Ethereum (ETH) to be a commodity. If Grewal is correct in his assessment, then an ETH commodity would fall under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as opposed to the SEC, which is tasked with regulating securities.This is a key distinction for ETH, because the SEC’s mandate is to police securities and protect investors. The CFTC instead regulates commodities such as raw materials and agricultural goods, with a focus on preventing market manipulation and fraud. The CFTC’s regulatory framework over commodities is therefore generally less stringent compared to the SEC’s treatment of securities.As digital assets continue to gain mass adoption, there remains an ongoing debate over which federal agency should have jurisdiction over the regulation and enforcement of this new and innovative technology.Back in 2021, former CFTC Commissioner Dawn Stump gave a speech on the now-infamous XRP SEC enforcement action case, and noted that she was “watching the outcome of this case closely because it will help to establish the scope of the SEC’s authority in the digital assets space.” Commissioner Stump added:
The regulatory application to digital assets, much like the assets themselves, is evolving every day. It is exciting, yet also frustrating to those who seek more certainty. But the incredible transformation in this space requires adaptation and creative thinking, and let’s be honest, neither are among a regulator’s natural tendencies. 
…
That is where the regulatory state of digital assets currently sits: We must enable innovators to think creatively such that the story can evolve, we must acknowledge there will be differences of opinion as to the utility and potential of various products, and we must expect some storms to arise. These are the considerations that should guide us as regulators in exercising the authorities to fulfill our mission such that the market can develop and meet its full potential.
Perhaps the Ethereum ETF approval brings just the sort of regulatory clarity this sector has been looking for. If ETH and other similar cryptocurrencies are not securities, then the SEC lacks jurisdiction to regulate these assets under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.That means that the SEC can no longer argue that these tokens are investment contracts under the Howey Test. If ETH and similarly situated tokens are commodities, then crypto lawyers could argue in court that these cryptocurrencies are not investment contracts that come with an “expectation of profits from the efforts of others”—critical elements that the SEC must prove under the Howey Test. Crucially, by tacitly acknowledging that Ethereum is a commodity, the SEC may have just undercut its own legal arguments raised in several pending crypto enforcement court cases.If courts are receptive to ETH and potentially other cryptocurrencies being commodities, then this could turn the tide on pending SEC lawsuits against major crypto trading platforms like Coinbase and Kraken. These lawsuits hinge on the SEC’s argument that selected tokens traded on these platforms are securities. But if Ethereum and similarly situated tokens are instead commodities, then this could green light a renewed motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuits against both Coinbase and Kraken.If the federal judges in these cases agree with this argument, then this would essentially gut the SEC’s claims that both Coinbase and Kraken offer trading of unregistered securities.Such a ruling would deal a devastating blow to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is already under intense scrutiny from critics who believe his aggressive approach to regulation by enforcement actions is stifling the growth of the digital asset technology sector in the United States—and pushing innovation overseas to more favorable jurisdictions. As noted in Grewal’s recent Twitter (aka X) post, now that the SEC has effectively said that “ETH sales can’t be securities because Ethereum ETFs may be registered by funds with an S-1,” the SEC has essentially agreed that ETH has no more of an “‘ecosystem’ any more than does Bitcoin.” The SEC’s recent approval of Ethereum ETFs has profound potential implications for both pending and future legal battles in the digital asset sector. By suggesting that ETH, and other similarly situated tokens are commodities, the SEC may have dramatically limited its power to aggressively police the crypto sector.The Ethereum ETF decision may therefore further embolden players in the digital asset sector to push back against overzealous enforcement actions, resulting in fewer settlements and more court battles.Getting long-awaited clarity on whether ETH is a security or commodity may also curtail the SEC’s jurisdiction over Ethereum and other similarly situated cryptocurrencies. This could in turn lead to a dramatic narrowing of the SEC’s regulatory reach in the digital asset sector. Crypto lawyers will no doubt use the ETF decision to aggressively push back against pending SEC enforcement actions and lawsuits, and argue that the agency has overstepped its mandate.If more digital assets are treated as commodities similar to what the Ethereum ETF decision suggests, then legislators may finally pass laws to vastly curtail the SEC’s reach over these assets. As a result, these tokens could be subject to potentially less stringent regulation under the CFTC. Such a shift in agency oversight would create fewer regulatory hurdles for crypto startups, and foster a new wave of innovation in this sector.Crypto lawyers will likely leverage the ETF decision to reshape existing strategies with respect to how they advise clients in the digital asset space. These strategies may include advising crypto sector clients to place greater emphasis on the commodity nature of their tokens and platforms, in an effort to better insulate them from the SEC’s reach.If the Coinbase and Kraken legal defense teams are successful in dismissing pending SEC lawsuits based on the Ethereum ETF decision, then this could generate highly favorable legal precedents that would influence future regulation of the digital asset sector—and usher in a fresh wave of blockchain innovation in the U.S.A new era of clarity with respect to digital asset laws would also benefit investigators and lawyers employed within both the SEC and the CFTC, by creating a potentially more predictable and stable regulatory environment. This would result in a more efficient use of agency resources, as opposed to the legally ambiguous environment we currently operate under. Regulatory clarity would also bring much-needed consistency for the judges who preside over digital asset cases, and generate more consistent and predictable outcomes.It’s my firm belief that crypto lawyers are the guardians of the blockchain, and play a vital role in the continued growth and adoption of crypto technology in the United States. The recent Ethereum ETF decision will only further empower crypto lawyers to better advise and navigate clients in the digital asset sector—and I’m excited to see how they creatively use this opportunity to do just that.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Could XRP hit a $3 trillion market cap? Here's when it might happen


    The cryptocurrency market in 2024 has seen a surge of activity, with significant rallies for major cryptocurrencies, approvals of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the BTC halving event in April.



Amid these developments, XRP has garnered substantial attention. Despite being largely absent from the bull run, XRP is generating optimism due to recent legal advancements between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



EGRAG CRYPTO, a noted analyst, recently highlighted a potential major price increase for XRP based on two key patterns: “The White Channel” and the “White Triangle.”











The White Channel pattern is observed on the monthly logarithmic chart, tracking XRP’s market cap from March 2014. Anchored at its first peak in December 2014, the channel includes a high in April 2021.



The analyst suggests that if XRP breaches the upper boundary of this channel, its market cap could surge to nearly $290 billion from its current level of around $28.7 billion. 



Additionally, the White Triangle breakout pattern has historically been a reliable indicator of positive price movements, setting a short-term price target for XRP between $1.20 and $1.50, with an expected breakout on the horizon.



The likelihood of XRP reaching a $3 trillion market cap 



Despite these optimistic indicators, there is significant skepticism about XRP reaching a $3 trillion market cap. 



At  the press time,XRP is priced at $0.5167, with a circulating supply of 55.45 billion XRP, giving it a market cap of approximately$28.68 billion. 



To reach a $3 trillion market cap, XRP’s price would need to rise to about $54.11, representing a nearly 104-fold increase from its current price.



For XRP to achieve this, it would not only need to surpass major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and challenge Bitcoin’s dominance but also sustain unprecedented growth and adoption. 



Bitcoin, with a market cap of over $1.3 trillion, and Ethereum, with a market cap of over $450 billion, represent substantial competition. 



XRP, currently the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, would need to outperform these established cryptocurrencies, which boast more extensive adoption, higher liquidity, and stronger market positions



Additionally, the White Channel’s resistance level appears arbitrarily drawn without substantial justification, casting doubt on the projection.



While the White Triangle pattern has been historically reliable, it does not account for broader market conditions and the significant challenges XRP faces.



Assuming XRP can reach a $3 trillion market cap without considering market dynamics, competition, and the overall environment is overly optimistic.



XRP price analysis

As of this writing, XRP trades at $0.5167. In the past 24 hours, XRP has experienced a 0.75% decline, reflecting bearish market sentiment.



XRP  faces additional scrutiny with the possibility of Ripple selling 400 million XRP in June, marking the largest dump in seven years, as reported by Finbold.  This significant sale could impact XRP’s market dynamics and potentially slow down an expected bull rally this cycle. 



Therefore, investors should consider these factors carefully, recognizing the speculative nature of such predictions and the formidable hurdles that XRP must overcome to achieve unprecedented growth.

Coinbase Slams SEC’s Destructive Crypto Policies: Report Coin Edition


							

Coinbase slams the SEC, claiming that its regulatory policies destroy the crypto industry.
The platform asserts that the SEC hasn’t taken the initiative to frame convenient regulatory policies.
The exchange states that the SEC tried to misrepresent their authoritarian control as little dangerous.




Coinbase, one of the prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently slammed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s destructive regulatory stance. In its closing brief for the rulemaking petition, filed on May 31, 2024, Coinbase alleged, “The SEC is serious about the destruction of digital assets.”









Paul Grewal, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer, shared insights on the exchange’s arguments against the regulators in the filing. Grewal cited, “The SEC is bent on choking the digital asset industry, and is refusing to provide the necessary rules the industry has requested in order to tighten the squeeze.”







Coinbase argued that the SEC hadn’t initiated to frame convenient crypto regulatory laws despite the exchange’s repeated efforts. The platform added, “Giving the agency further opportunity to explain itself is both pointless and exquisitely undeserved.”



Further, Coinbase argued that the SEC tried to misrepresent its authoritarian control over the crypto sector as little dangerous, claiming that the rules would only harm a small segment of the industry. The exchange stated, “The SEC tries to minimize its oppressive stance by asserting that only a “small set of market participants” “may” experience “compliance difficulties” under “discrete provisions” of existing rules.”



Concern has been raised about the need for a clearer and more convenient regulatory framework. Individuals, industry experts, and political leaders have urged authorities to implement new crypto laws.



For instance, former US President Donald Trump recently pointed out the significance of regulatory clarity in the nation. Accepting crypto donations and promoting the development of a crypto army, Trump questioned the SEC and the Biden Administration’s anti-crypto stance.

Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash? Vitalik Buterin delves into the blocksize war


    The blocksize war, a contentious debate within the Bitcoin (BTC) community, led to a chain split in 2017 and remains relevant seven years later. In particular, the dispute centered around whether to increase the block size limit from 1 MB to accommodate more transactions. This split resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a separate cryptocurrency with a larger block size.



In a recent blog post, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum (ETH), shared his reflections on the blocksize war. Buterin, who recently finished reading two books presenting opposing perspectives on the conflict, offered his unique insights into the debate.



Notably, the two books, “The Blocksize War” by Jonathan Bier and “Hijacking Bitcoin” by Roger Ver and Steve Patterson, provide contrasting narratives. Bier’s book presents the pro-small-block perspective, while Ver and Patterson’s work advocates for the pro-big-block side.

Bitcoin blocksize war in retrospective



Vitalik Buterin noted that both sides agreed on the object-level debate: small blockers prioritized ease of running nodes, while large blockers emphasized cheaper transaction fees. However, their depictions of the underlying issues differed significantly.



According to Bier, the small-block side stood for users against powerful cabals trying to control the chain. In contrast, Ver portrayed the big-block side as defending users against self-appointed high priests and profit-seeking companies.



Buterin, who initially sided with the big blockers, found merit in their arguments about Bitcoin’s original promise of digital cash. He also questioned the small blockers’ “consensus of users” narrative and criticized their censorship of opposing views on social media, in agreement with Ver’s book.



However, Buterin also acknowledged the big blockers’ shortcomings, such as their inability to agree on a block size limit. He found fault in their argument that miners should control Bitcoin and their displays of technical incompetence, in agreement with Bier’s book.



On June 1, Sal the Agorist also mentioned the blocksize debate in a post on X showing Andreas Antonopoulos revisiting the topic while highlighting that the known small-blocker advocate blocked him, a known big-blocker, for saying the same thing years ago.







Vitalik Buterin’s conclusion on the blocksize war



Buterin described the blocksize war as a “one-sided competence trap,” where one side monopolizes competent people but pushes a narrow perspective. Meanwhile, the other side recognizes the problem but fails to develop the technical ability to execute its vision.



The Ethereum creator emphasized the importance of new technology in diffusing political tension, citing examples from Ethereum’s development. He expressed concern about Bitcoin’s ability to become a tech-forward ecosystem and highlighted the lessons Ethereum has learned from Bitcoin’s experiences.



In conclusion, Buterin recommended reading both books to understand this defining moment in Bitcoin’s history. He stressed that the lessons from the blocksize war extend beyond Bitcoin and are relevant for other digital communities seeking to build their own visions for the future.

FTX's $500 Million Investment in Anthropic Yields $1.3 Billion


Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has agreed to sell its remaining stake in AI startup Anthropic for $452.2 million, according to a court filing on May 31.
FTX disclosed that G Squared, a global venture capital fund, bought about one-third of the 4.5 million shares for $135 million. Over 20 other venture capital funds, including Gemini Ventures, Fund FG-BLU, and Fund SCVC-PV-LXVI, also participated in the purchase.
FTX to Net $800 Million From Anthropic Share Sales

FTX’s Anthropic shares sales, still pending Judge John Dorsey’s approval, could total about $1.3 billion, netting the company around $800 million. Initially, FTX invested $500 million in Anthropic in 2021, holding a 7.8% stake.
Anthropic, an AI company known for its chatbot Claude, aims to release AI models with stricter guardrails than ChatGPT and other rivals. Founded by former OpenAI employees, Anthropic has attracted significant investments from tech giants like Google.
The sale could be the most profitable for FTX as it seeks to repay creditors following its November 2022 bankruptcy. However, some creditors argue that the shares should have been allocated to FTX customers, whose deposits funded the purchase.

Moreover, the rising costs of FTX legal fees have drawn sharp criticism from FTX creditors, who accuse the advisors of destroying over $10 billion of creditor value. Recent bankruptcy filings reveal that FTX has incurred $700 million in legal and administrative fees, as tracked by X user Mr. Purple. Consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal billed $212 million, while legal counsel Sullivan & Cromwell invoiced $202 million. Additionally, FTX CEO John Ray III billed $5.6 million at an hourly rate of $1,300.

“FTX advisors billed $700 million while destroying over $10 billion of creditor value. John Ray charged $5.6 million for making all business decisions, such as not restarting FTX despite multiple bids and selling assets at a 90% discount. Plan administrators need to change,” wrote FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri.

FTX’s efforts to sell Anthropic stake and manage rising legal costs remain under scrutiny as it navigates its complex bankruptcy proceedings. The results of these sales and Judge John Dorsey’s decisions will be crucial in shaping FTX’s future and its creditors’ recovery prospects.

May Madness: Crypto Industry Suffers $385 Million Loss To Hackers


								In May, the crypto community endured devastating losses to hackers, resulting in the highest loss tally recorded in 2024 to date.. According to a report from blockchain security firm Peckshield, hackers made away with $385 million in May, highlighting the sophistication of these bad actors and the consistent need for effective security measures in the digital asset industry.


Crypto Losses Up By 666% In May – Peckshield
Based on Peckshield’s report, the crypto space experienced approximately 30 hack cases in May 2024. 
Of these incidents, the attack on Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin on May 31st resulted in the loss of over 4,500 Bitcoin, valued at $305 million. This heist represented the largest hack of the month and 2024 so far. It was also the second-largest crypto hack in Japan following the $533 million heist of Coincheck in 2018.

Another major hack involved the crypto gaming project Gala Games which suffered a significant network breach on May 20, where bad actors were able to mint 5 billion GALA tokens worth about $212 million. However, via swift security measures, Gala’s development team was able to mitigate the losses to around $22.4 million. 
Other major hacks in May involved DeFi protocol Sonne Finance and a Coinbase account drainer which resulted in the loss of $20 million and $18 million worth of assets, respectively. In total, $575 million was stolen by hackers, albeit, the bad actors made a profit of only $385 million following the Gala Games’ impressive recovery.
In comparison to April with total losses of $60 million, the figures reported in May represent a staggering 666% rise in assets stolen by attackers. More alarmingly, these figures indicate a 2,300% increase on the $14.6 million losses in May 2023.
Undoubtedly, this sharp increase in hacking incidents and asset loss signals the constant need for more robust security measures for the digital asset space especially as the novel industry strives for mainstream adoption in the global financial scene.


Crypto Market Overview
In other news, the cryptocurrency market remains relatively stable, with major assets experiencing minimal fluctuations over the past 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market cap saw a modest increase of 0.65% on Sunday, reaching $2.54 trillion.
Bitcoin, the market leader, is currently valued at $67,812, reflecting a slight gain of 0.11% in the last day. Similarly, other major tokens such as Ethereum and BNB recorded small increases, with daily gains of 0.31% and 0.35%, respectively.

Exclusive: 36.8% of investors now have memecoin investments! - AMBCrypto



Q1 and Q2 performances dictating why investors are allocating more to memecoins – Survey
PEPE, WIF, BONK prices might hit new highs, but respondents expect BTC to do the same

After speaking to 557 respondents from different parts of the world, AMBCrypto’s exclusive survey revealed that 53.7% of traders, investors, and analysts would choose memecoins over Bitcoin [BTC]. And yet, a significant number believe that Bitcoin will hit the $100,000-level before the end of 2024. The result of this study might not come as a surprise to active players in the market though, and the reasons are obvious.
Are memecoins this cycle’s hedge?
First off, Bitcoin’s price has risen by 53.32% on a Year-To-Date (YTD) basis. However, that is nothing compared to the performance of memecoins — Especially those based on Solana’s [SOL] blockchain.
For instance, dogwifhat’s [WIF] value has jumped by a mind-blowing 1,768% this year, while Bonk [BONK] recorded a 123% hike. Another notable memecoin has been PEPE. Despite Ethereum’s [ETH] lagging behavior, this memecoin registered gains of 945%.
However, the respondents did not just say this out of desire. Instead, AMBCrypto’s survey found that they are putting their money where their mouth is. Specifically, 36.8% of all respondents have allocated some part of their portfolio to memecoins.
Another 25.5% have done so for AI-themed tokens, with DeFi and GameFi sectors finding a place within the holdings of 25.5% and 15.4% of all the respondents. This, despite the second quarter (Q1) of the year starting at a slower pace compared to Q1.
As Q2 began, memecoins shed a good part of their Q1 gains. However, the resurgence of the GameStop (GME) stock put prices back on the uptrend. This was one of the reasons PEPE seemed to surpass its all-time high almost every week.
Source: TradingView
Bitcoin is still in the conversation
Regardless of the bullish conviction around memecoins, 65.5% of the respondents owned Bitcoin – A sign that the coin remains a big bet, despite the buzzing narrative.
Furthermore, AMBCrypto’s report also revealed that most believe BTC could hike by 80% by December 2024. If this happens, then the price of Bitcoin could be worth $121,953 by the end of the year.
Where does that leave memecoins though? Beyond the report, AMBCrypto looked at the number of holders and sentiment around some of these frog and dog-themed tokens.
According to data from Santiment, the number of PEPE holders in February was less than 160,000. At press time though, that number had risen to 238,000.
Source: Santiment
An almost 50% hike in less than three months may be evidence that the memecoin supercycle might not stop anytime soon. Should this be the case, other altcoins with real-world utility might be starved of liquidity.
Finally, AMBCrypto’s report discovered that the emergence of SocialFi has been something to watch out for. For instance, platforms like Friend.tech and Fantasy.Top have been accruing millions of dollars in trading volume.

Realistic or not, here’s PEPE’s market cap in BTC terms

Despite the notable uptick in money flows, memecoins might continue to attract more market participants over any other sector in the market. Still, this does not imply that ETH would continue to lag or BTC would fail to hit $100,000.

Overlooked Indicator Hinting at ‘Stealth’ Bitcoin (BTC) Rallies to Fresh New All-Time Highs: Jason Pizzino - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst says that one under-the-radar indicator is hinting at a sudden Bitcoin (BTC) rally to new all-time highs.
In a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 328,000 YouTube subscribers that the top crypto asset by market cap has historically made “stealth moves” to the upside when its average true range (ATR) indicator reaches a local low while price continues to consolidate or put in higher lows.










According to the analyst, if the crypto king can maintain a daily trading range average of between $1,500 and $2,000 while staying above the $56,000 to $60,000 level, it could mean BTC is ready to break out to a new all-time high.
Pizzino uses the Bitcoin rally witnessed during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic as an example of a stealth move.
“If we did get into that zone of $1,500 to $2,000 per day and Bitcoin was still putting in roughly higher lows or maintaining that sort of $56,000 to $60,000 level, that might be a sign that we’re getting ready to turn around and head higher…
That entire Covid move was the longest one yet, about 222 days and I’m measuring that from the low to basically that breakout day… 
More importantly, that was a breakout day of the tops so you can see the tops here at about $12,000 – it broke out and then basically skyrocketed from that point with the range and the normies beginning to enter. 
So the stealth move – higher lows, higher lows, higher lows, [and] the range – lower lows, lower lows, lower lows, so the supply is getting absorbed and people are still selling into that which is causing the bars to be quite small, so you’re getting more sell pressure more buy pressure.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube
Pizzino also says that TOTAL3, which measures the entire market cap of cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins, looks similar to the sudden breakout of 2020.
“I want to show you the stealth move on the total cryptocurrency market cap excluding Bitcoin and ETH, so this is for all of the altcoins… It’s just the mindset, the market sentiment [is] showing signs of dying out here which to me is more of a stealth move.”

Bitcoin is trading for $67,717 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours.

Crypto Hiring: Polygon co-founder now has larger role - Blockworks


Polygon’s co-founder is now also the company’s chief business officer.
Sandeep Nailwal, an original founder of what was in 2017 called the MATIC network, has been executive chairman of Polygon Labs, and will continue to be. 
But under a new expanded role, Nailwal is set to focus more on Polygon’s zero-knowledge solutions, like Polygon CDK — an open-source software toolkit for developers to create layer-2s on Ethereum.
“Polygon Labs is in the midst of building incredible, transformational technology that will provide developers and enterprises with countless opportunities to scale quickly and securely while having access to liquidity,” Nailwal said in a statement.

Beyond the additional responsibilities for Nailwal, two crypto-focused companies fresh off of fundraises have also named new leaders.
Tokenized asset platform Centrifuge added a chief operating officer and a head of product as the on-chain asset management space gains momentum.
Centrifuge’s new COO, Julia Merkey, was previously the chief financial officer at venture capital firm BlueYard Capital.
The company has also tapped Sonam Joshi — a former pro at UBS, Google and Amazon — to lead its product unit. Joshi was also previously a director of product at Abra.
Centrifuge facilitates pools of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), including assets like loans, credit and real estate. Centrifuge has roughly $280 million worth of assets in its liquidity pools.
“They join at a perfect time as Centrifuge looks to scale to meet the widespread, increasing demand for tokenized real-world assets,” Centrifuge co-founder Lucas Vogelsang said in a statement.

The hires come after Centrifuge raised $15 million in April as part of a funding round co-led by ParaFi Capital and Greenfield.
Also raising money in April was Movement Labs. PolyChain Capital led the blockchain company’s $38 million Series A round. 
Now, Movement Labs welcomes Franck Cassez as its head of research. 
A former researcher at Consensys and a blockchain research lead at Windranger Labs, Cassez looks to help the startup bring Facebook’s Move Virtual Machine to Ethereum. 
Other notable hires

LMAX Group appointed Chris Knight as a managing director — a role he will step into this summer. A former executive at XTX Markets and Standard Chartered Bank, he will first oversee LMAX’s institutional crypto exchange.
Ross O’Leary has joined Coinbase’s global communications team as an associate manager.

FTX Sells Off AI Startup Shares for $450M Amid $700M Bankruptcy Cost - Coin Edition


							

The FTX liquidates the final 15M Anthropic shares at $450 million.
FTX’s total earnings from Anthropic shares now hit $1.3B with $800M profit.
FTX’s bankruptcy legal and administrative fees reportedly exceed $700M.




The FTX bankruptcy estate, led by CEO John Ray III, has divested its remaining stake in the AI startup Anthropic, the creators of the chatbot Claude. The latest bankruptcy filings reveal that FTX sold its final 15 million shares for $30 each, amassing over $450 million from the sale.









This transaction marks a substantial return on FTX’s initial $500 million investment in Anthropic. Total earnings now reach approximately $1.3 billion, resulting in a $800 million profit. Notably, the share price remained consistent with the first sale conducted in March.



In this latest round of sales, the primary purchaser was the global venture capital fund G Squared, which acquired around one-third of the shares on offer, amounting to 4.5 million shares for $135 million. Venture capital funds also represented most of the other 20 purchasers of Anthropic shares.



Meanwhile, the FTX bankruptcy continues to be costly, with legal and administrative fees now exceeding $700 million, as reported by bankruptcy specialist Mr. Purple. 







In parallel, creditors have raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest as Sullivan and Cromwell, the leading law firm overseeing FTX’s bankruptcy, had previously represented the company. This has led to the appointment of an independent examiner and a class-action lawsuit.



An investigation by the New York Times last year highlighted that law firms have billed crypto companies hundreds of millions of dollars in bankruptcy fees. In the case of FTX, CEO John Ray has charged the estate $5.6 million based on his hourly rate of $1,300 since the commencement of the bankruptcy case.



Despite the staggering costs, the FTX estate remains optimistic about repaying its creditors. Plans are underway to reimburse 98% of the creditors with at least 118% of the allowed claims, with the valuation based on the dollar amount when FTX filed for bankruptcy.

Hong Kong Discloses List of To-Be-licensed Crypto Exchanges


On June 1, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) unveiled a list of cryptocurrency exchange platforms with licenses nearing approval.
According to the SFC website, 11 applicants, including Matrixport HK, Accumulus, Crypto.com, and Bullish, are “deemed to be licensed.” Other platforms on the list are HKbitEX, PantherTrade, DFX Labs, Bixincom, xWhale, YAX, and WhaleFin.
Hong Kong’s Stringent Requirement Dissuades Top Exchanges

If approved, these firms will bring the number of licensed exchanges in Hong Kong to 13. Currently, only OSL Exchange and HashKey hold licenses granted before the new regulations took effect in June 2023.
However, the SFC clarified that these “deemed to be licensed” exchanges are not yet formally licensed. Additionally, it advised investors to be cautious when trading on these platforms, as they may not receive a license and might have to cease operations in Hong Kong.
Over the past year, Hong Kong has aimed to become a digital asset hub. However, its strict rules, while designed to protect investors and prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, have created significant barriers for many exchanges. Reports indicate that the SFC instructed its exchange license applicants to ensure they do not make their products available to mainland Chinese users, even though China has banned crypto.
These stringent requirements have led major exchanges like OKX, Gate.io, KuCoin, Binance, and HTX (formerly Huobi) to withdraw their applications for a virtual asset trading platform (VATP) license in Hong Kong.

Notably, these platforms’ withdrawals have drawn scrutiny to SFC’s application process handling. Hong Kong legislator David Chiu questioned whether the city can truly become a hub for financial innovation given the many restrictions imposed at this early stage.

“Many industry insiders are worried that the new licensing system will turn into a replica of the ‘food truck incident’ or even become a case of the government’s promotion of virtual banks, with much ado about nothing. They are worried that the authorities will repeat the same mistakes and that even if operators are granted licenses, it will be difficult for them to develop a profit model,” Chiu reportedly said.

Furthermore, Chiu claimed that the new licensing system shakes market confidence. He pointed out that many approval conditions borrow from traditional finance, which is too strict for Web3. The industry’s response to these challenges will be crucial in shaping the future of cryptocurrency exchanges in the region.

Bitcoin registers an all-time low transaction volume, spot trading fades away


    Since February 2024, Bitcoin (BTC) has traded in a price range between $60,000 and $72,000, with two deviations. This has carved a mostly neutral momentum for the leading cryptocurrency, now seeing its trading and transaction volume fade away.



Finbold retrieved data from Santiment on June 2 showing both metrics with the BTC price, currently at $68,100. In particular, the seven-day trading volume plummeted below $14 billion to the same level as 2023, when Bitcoin traded below $30,000.



Moreover, the chart evidences a lack of interest in Bitcoin trading and on-chain transaction volumes, with the second remarkably low. As observed, the network registered only 722,000 BTC moved in seven days. This contrasts with the 1.79 million BTC in October 2023, with a similar trading volume and half the price.

If we zoom out of the chart, Bitcoin’s current on-chain transaction volume shows its lowest value since the beginning. This highlights a remarkably low network activity, which has not followed the increased demand for speculative BTC over the years.

Bitcoin ETFs and derivatives volume



Meanwhile, this year’s approved Bitcoin spot ETFs have made $1.73 billion, according to data retrieved from IntoTheBlock and Yahoo. Overall, these ETFs‘ last seven trading days totaled $12 billion in volume, similar to BTC’s spot volume on crypto exchanges.

This suggests an increased interest in trading the regulated and custodial exchange-traded funds instead of Bitcoin itself.



The derivatives volume also highlights the increased interest in purely speculative demand for the leading cryptocurrency. Data from CoinGlass shows a daily volume superior to $34 billion—nearly three times the seven-day volume for spot trading.



Notably, the exchanged volume of futures contracts and other Bitcoin derivatives financial products has remained stable after peaking in March 2024.

In conclusion, these indicators suggest a higher market interest in BTC price speculation through Bitcoin ETFs and derivatives. This is opposed to acquiring Bitcoin for self-custody or long-term hold from cryptocurrency exchanges or using the permissionless blockchain for real peer-to-peer transactions.

What Is Hamster Kombat? The Telegram Crypto Game and Airdrop - Decrypt

Are hamsters fighting now? Not exactly—but while Hamster Kombat’s title might be a little misleading, this Telegram-based clicker game has quickly become a dominant leader in the play-to-earn space by expanding upon Notcoin’s winning model.The Hamster Kombat team recently announced that they will conduct an airdrop on The Open Network (TON), rewarding players for racking up in-game coins by eventually dropping them real, tradeable crypto tokens.That’s sure to drive many more people towards the game, but as of this writing, new players can still dive in and rack up coins ahead of the airdrop. Here’s what you need to know about Hamster Kombat, how to play it, and what we know about the token and airdrop so far.What is Hamster Kombat?Similar to Notcoin, Hamster Kombat has players tapping away to earn coins in a Telegram-native application (or “mini app”)—which means to play the game, you just open a chat on Telegram.The game developers claim that they’ve amassed over 60 million users, all eagerly tapping away in-game in order to earn coins that will presumably be used to determine how many tokens players receive in the upcoming Hamster Kombat airdrop. While Hamster Kombat has been around since March, the game recently picked up serious steam after the Notcoin airdrop concluded—perhaps due to tap-addicted gamers migrating to a new game with an upcoming token and airdrop in the works.Hamster Kombat’s core concept is similar to Notcoin, with some slightly richer game mechanics layered on top of it. In short: It’s a tap-to-earn game mixed with a crypto exchange simulator.In Hamster Kombat, you’re the CEO of an up-and-coming crypto exchange, and it’s your job to grow the exchange to new heights never before seen… in the world of hamsters. In order to do so, players tap a golden coin to earn coins, and then use those coins to buy upgrades for their exchange.How to play Hamster KombatHamster Kombat starts off in a manner familiar to Notcoin users, with players tapping away at a golden coin in the Telegram app. With Hamster Kombat however, the first step is—for some reason—shaving your hamster so he or she can become the CEO of a crypto exchange. Similar to Notcoin, players can use their in-game points to purchase “Boosts” that increase stats, such as how many points are earned per tap, or how long you can tap before having to take a break and wait for your energy bar to refill. There are also free daily boosters that players can claim six times per day. Hamster Kombat screenshots. Image: DecryptOnce players have earned some points, they can start using them to upgrade their exchange in the “Mine” tab of the game. This tab shows all kinds of upgrades that players can purchase (purely with in-game coins) for their exchange, and include things such as adding coins like Bitcoin to be traded at your exchange, setting up a KYC process, or even going on the Joe Rogan podcast.Every upgrade you purchase for your exchange earns you more coins passively. For example, adding the BTC pair to your exchange costs 250 points, but then earns you 40 points per hour. In other words, these additions quickly pay off and help propel your exchange further along.'Wen airdrop?'What’s the point to earning in-game coins? Similarly to Notcoin, Hamster Kombat has also announced an upcoming airdrop, though it has been much more transparent about it than Notcoin was at first.Within the Hamster Kombat app, there is an “Airdrop” tab that claims that exchange and market maker alliances have already been negotiated—but it doesn’t give an exact date for the airdrop itself.Notcoin ran for three months before pausing gameplay, and then launched its token more than a month later. Hamster Kombat may not follow the exact same routine, of course—but given how much hype Notcoin harnessed and turned into market value, we wouldn’t be surprised to see Hamster Kombat mimic such methods as well.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Bank Manager Steals $208,939 From Customer, Drains Accounts Before and After Victim's Demise: US Department of Justice - The Daily Hodl


								A former bank manager has admitted to stealing from a customer’s accounts in a scheme that lasted even after the victim’s death.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey says 43-year-old James Gomes has pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud affecting a financial institution.










The DOJ says Gomes, who worked as a branch manager for an unnamed international bank, concocted a scheme that siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars from the victim.
From January to April of 2020, Gomes accessed the customer’s accounts more than a dozen times without authorization. He created an email address under the victim’s name and used it to enroll the customer’s accounts to the lender’s online banking services. Gomes also linked his personal mobile number to the customer’s online banking account.
With complete control of the victim’s online banking profile, Gomes transferred a total of $208,939 from the customer’s accounts to his personal accounts at other banks and his personal investment account.
In an effort to conceal his crime, Gomes also used the fake email account to send messages to his official work account to make it seem that the victim was instructing the bank to make the transfers. The former branch manager continued the scheme after the victim’s death on April 6th, 2020.
Gomes is now facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million. His former employer took on losses to reimburse the victim’s estate.

Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP) Will Surge 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Loves Trump presents a similar opportunity.



Doge Loves Trump has a market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Doge Loves Trump could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Doge Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Doge Loves Trump on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Loves Trump by entering its contract address – AQSeJZGNc2UD9okyyy6uWmUGdxKK1DYrr7eEQ9mstQbc – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOTRUMP.

This Week on Crypto Twitter: Celebrities Dive (Back) Into Crypto - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for DecryptAnyone nostalgic for the long-gone heyday of random celebrities diving headfirst into crypto, rejoice! We appear to be back at that absolutely absurd part of the cycle.In a Mad Lib-esque turn of events, this week kicked off with Caitlyn Jenner shilling a Pump.fun Solana meme coin named in an apparent attempt to aid Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.The prospect of Jenner abruptly getting so involved in such a degenerate corner of the cryptosphere led many to doubt the post was legit—prompting the reality star to post a video confirming it all was real. From there, the plot only thickened. Apparently, the token’s launch was partially guided by a controversial crypto promoter named Sahil Arora. Within hours of the token’s launch, Jenner tweeted at a Decrypt reporter, claiming Arora had scammed her. Jenner told Decrypt that Arora went “radio silent” on her shortly after the token’s launch, in what she took to be a rug pull. Though Arora claimed at the time to have worked with several other celebrities on crypto projects, other public figures, including rapper Rich the Kid, took to Twitter to lambast the influencer as a scammer.Soon, Jenner announced she had launched a new token by the same name on Ethereum. By this point, Crypto Twitter wasn’t having it. The original  token on Solana immediately crashed.If only the inanity had ended there. In the midst of the Jenner saga, the rapper Iggy Azalea leaped into crypto discourse with a vague pro-crypto tweet.Turns out, nothing’s a coincidence in this industry. Azalea soon revealed she had also been in contact with Sahil Arora about launching a meme coin. Until she determined that “he’s a bitch.”Madness soon ensued, with Arora amassing hundreds of thousands of dollars in proceeds from a presale of a rogue, apparently unauthorized Azalea token, and Azalea launching her own token. The narrative got so convoluted that some theorized that the whole plot—controversy and all—was orchestrated by Arora from the beginning. Soon, Azalea became a darling of Crypto Twitter, attending Twitter Spaces and convincing many that she was entering the industry for the right reasons. At some point, it appeared sentiment may have turned on Azalea, after on-chain activity suggested some insider trading activity on her “Mother” token. But the "Mother" token has since become a smash hit. It boasts a $74 million market capitalization as of writing. Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Funding Wrap: Babylon announces $70M raise led by Paradigm - Blockworks


Another week, another slew of venture capital rounds. 
Bitcoin staking protocol Babylon led this week’s raises, announcing a $70 million raise led by Paradigm on Thursday. 
Bullish Capital, Polychain Capital and Galaxy also participated in the round. 
“This latest round of investment will accelerate Babylon’s mission to enable a Bitcoin-secured decentralized economy. Babylon Bitcoin Staking protocol allows PoS systems like PoS chains, [layer-2s], DA layers, oracles, etc., to acquire staking capital from Bitcoin.”
PitchBook analyst Robert Le previously told Blockworks that he believes infrastructure projects will capture the attention of venture capital at this point in the cycle. 
Read more: Let’s talk Bitcoin staking: Babylon’s litepaper
“I still think infrastructure is still underdeveloped,” he told Blockworks at the time, citing prices he’s seen on Base. “There’s no way that we can say infrastructure [and blockchains are] mature when you pay $5 to sign a transaction.” 
“Trustless staking is a novel and fundamental primitive for bitcoin and the broader ecosystem,” Paradigm’s Arjun Balaji said in a statement. He added that the team is “at the frontier of bitcoin innovation.”
The week was quieter on the funding front, though it followed Farcaster’s announcement of $150 million. 
Speaking of Farcaster, Fortune reported that Neynar — which allows developers to build social applications on Farcaster — raised $11 million from Haun Ventures and Coinbase. 
Other notable funding news:

OpenSocial, an infrastructure layer to build social applications, announced a $5 million seed funding round, which closed in January 2024.*
DeFi platform Aperture announced a Series A raise, totaling $12 million across its rounds to bring its valuation to $250 million. The raise included Skyland Ventures, and Blockchain Founders Fund. 
Swiss-based crypto asset financial services company Scrypt announced a $5 million strategic funding round led by Braza Bank. 

*Note: Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz participated in the OpenSocial round.

These two cryptocurrencies show recovery potential this week


    As the cryptocurrency market stabilizes following a recent downturn, opportunities for strategic investments are emerging, particularly in assets that have recently entered oversold territories. 



Leveraging the 24-hour RSI heatmap from CoinGlass’s momentum indicator, Finbold has identified these opportunities, identifying potential undervalued assets poised for recovery.



Following a period marked by fear and significant sell-offs, the market is gradually trending upward, unveiling new opportunities for investors. 







The average Relative Strength Index (RSI) across the market currently stands at 53.26, indicating balanced trading conditions.



The RSI is a crucial tool for spotting buying opportunities as it gauges the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate whether an asset is overbought or oversold.



By comparing current RSI values to the average, investors can identify potential undervalued assets poised for recovery.



Bluzelle (BLZ)



Bluzelle (BLZ) demonstrates a strong buy signal due to its significantly low RSI values across various timeframes. The 24-hour RSI at 35.79,still indicates weakness and potential undervaluation compared to the market average.



Crypto market RSI heatmap, BLZ. Source: CoinGlass



The 12-hour RSI of 43.28 supports this trend of diminished momentum. Despite a recent 4% price increase, BLZ remains attractive for those anticipating a rebound.



Historically, BLZ has experienced substantial price recoveries from similar RSI levels, suggesting these conditions could precede a significant upward movement.



Ontology Gas (ONG)



Ontology Gas (ONG) is also showing clear signs of being weak, with RSI values across different time frames all below the average of 53.26. This consistent indication of oversold conditions points to potential undervaluation. 



Even though ONG has seen a slight price decrease of 0.54%, the stable, low RSI values suggest a potential for rebound.



Crypto market RSI heatmap, ONG. Source: CoinGlass



For investors, this represents an opportunity to buy into ONG at a low point, making it a strategic investment choice.



Nevertheless, understanding that a status of market weakness does not guarantee a price recovery is vital for investors looking for buy signals.



Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets, and everything can change in the blink of an eye.

DEX Velocore falls victim to $10M exploit - Here are the details - AMBCrypto



Velocore, a DEX on zkSync and Linea blockchains, suffered an exploit resulting in a $10 million loss
Activity on ZkSync and Linea remained unaffected though

Velocore, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the zkSync and Linea blockchains, was exploited today, leading to an estimated $10 million loss. The incident was initially flagged by Officer’s Notes, a threat researcher and writer, highlighting persistent vulnerabilities in the crypto sector.
Hackers get to work
Velocore reported that hackers targeted its liquidity provider tokens, which are integral to the exchange’s operations. Following the breach, the hackers transferred over 700 ETH across chains to the Ethereum mainnet.
Source: X
Despite Velocore passing security audits conducted by Zokyo, Hacken, and Scalebit, the hackers managed to exploit the decentralized exchange. Concurrently, the Linea Blockchain saw a temporary halt in block production during the hack, lasting about an hour before normal operations resumed. The reasons behind this disruption remained unclear at the time of writing.
Fortunately, Velocore’s stable pools were unaffected, allowing for the withdrawal of funds from these reserves. The team is currently working with security experts and it has contacted centralized exchanges (CEXs) to freeze the stolen assets in an effort to mitigate further damage.
According to Velocore, the team has identified the exploit mechanism and is now establishing an on-chain negotiation process. A post-mortem review is being prepared too, with the team also tracking the exploiter using the clues left behind.
Here, it’s worth noting that Velocore on the Telos mainnet remained unaffected. They are collaborating with the foundation while functionalities are frozen.
Source: X
As expected, community members who lost their funds were quick to demand a refund from Velocore. At press time, however, the project was yet to address its compensation and refund plans.
Collateral damage
Velocore’s native token VC was also affected by news of this exploit. At the time of writing, VC was down by 5%, with the altcoin trading at $0.02267. Subsequently, as news of the hack broke out, volumes hiked by over 600% too.
For their part, protocols zkSync and Linea remained relatively unaffected by this update. The overall number of transactions remained relatively the same for both networks. Moreover, the daily active addresses on the network also remained stable despite this unfortunate episode.

AI sets Solana (SOL) price for June 30


    Solana (SOL) has exhibited a bullish bias for most of 2024, with the decentralized finance (DeFi) token surging over 170% in the last six months.



Amid bullish sentiments primarily driven by increased activity on the Solana blockchain, the $200 price target has become a key goal for the asset. Investors believe that reclaiming the $200 mark will pave the way for another all-time high.



To determine the next SOL price trajectory, Finbold consulted artificial intelligence (AI) that leverages machine learning algorithms from CoinCodex to gather insights into the asset’s potential valuation at the end of the month.







According to data retrieved on June 2, the tool predicted that SOL will likely trade at $188.59 on June 30, reflecting an increase of almost 15% from the current price.

Technical analysis take on Solana’s price 



In addition to the AI price projection, analysts at Vantage Markets shared insights into key price levels to watch. In a TradingView post on May 31, the analysts noted that SOL is approaching a critical resistance level aligned with the 50% Fibonacci retracement, indicating a potential reversal.



The experts suggested that traders consider entering at $175.23, targeting this overlap resistance for its strategic significance. The stop loss is set at $188.78, where a pullback resistance level provides a safeguard.

Overall, Solana’s price movement has been heavily influenced by on-chain activity, with the meme coin frenzy being a significant driver. The price has rallied thanks to surging investor interest in Solana-based memecoins like Dogwhifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK). This frenzy has boosted Solana’s network activity, leading to increased transactions and revenues.



Additionally, the influx of new meme coins has significantly enhanced the total value locked (TVL) across the Solana ecosystem. According to data from DefiLama, Solana’s TVL stands at $4.787 billion, having surged 239% in 2024.

Solana price analysis



As of press time, Solana was trading at $164, with a 24-hour correction of almost 1.5%. Over the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has gained about 1%.



Solana seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold



Meanwhile, Solana’s technical indicators remain largely bullish for the next month. Data from TradingView shows that a summary of the 30-day technical indicators aligns with a ‘buy’ sentiment at 9 while moving averages indicate a ‘strong buy’ at 7. Oscillators recommend ‘buy’ at 2.

Overall, with Solana dominated by bullish sentiments, the token’s bulls must sustain the price above the $160 support to realize steady upward momentum.

Controversial Move by Cryptocurrency Company: Dumped All of This Altcoin to Binance as the Price Soared - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Onchain data, cryptocurrency trading company Amber Group moved some of its altcoins to Binance.
Data shows that $4.26 million of Frontier (FRONT) altcoins belonging to the company in question were transferred to Binance. The company purchased these tokens by paying a total of $2.69 million. So, if the tokens sent to Binance were indeed sold, the company made a profit of $1.57 million from this trade.


In addition to Binance, FRONT is also traded on cryptocurrency exchanges such as OKX, Kucoin and Binance TR. At the moment of writing this article, it is at $ 1.47, with a 5.76% increase in the last 24 hours, and the total market value is around 132 million dollars.

However, Amber Group still has a large amount of altcoins in its known cryptocurrency wallets. The company's total cryptocurrency wallet asset value is at $57 million. The majority of these, with $32 million, are Ethereum (ETH) assets. Then comes ID with 10 million dollars, GAL with 6 million dollars, USDC with 2 million dollars, USDT with 1 million dollars and DYDX with 900 thousand dollars.





Prior to the sale, FRONT was one of the company's largest altcoin holdings.

Ethena's USDe Becomes Fourth-Largest Stablecoin


Ethenas’ synthetic dollar, USDe, has quickly reached a $3 billion supply just four months after its launch.
This achievement highlights the growing demand and confidence in stablecoins within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
Ethena’s Synthetic Dollar Breaks $3 Billion Barrier

USDe is a dollar-pegged stablecoin created by Ethena Labs. It generates returns by staking ETH and managing derivatives. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, USDE is fully backed on-chain and can integrate with other blockchain protocols.
As of June 2, USDE’s market valuation reached approximately $3.02 billion, surpassing First Digital’s FDUSD with its $2.9 billion supply. This milestone has made USDE the fourth-largest stablecoin. Ethena’s founder, Guy Young, noted that USDe became the fastest USD asset in crypto history to reach this mark.
According to EtherScan, USDE is held by approximately 13,235 unique addresses. Ethena’s smart contract holds the largest share with 1.22 billion USDE, over 40% of the total supply, while the LP staking address holds 511.2 million USDE, or 16.8%. Other significant holders include Pendle Finance, Morpho, and Zircuit.

However, Ethena’s rapid growth has raised concerns. DeFi expert Andre Cronje warned that USDe might face a collapse similar to TerraUSD (UST) due to its use of perpetual contracts and reliance on yield-based collateral. CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju echoed this opinion, questioning its ability to maintain a delta-neutral strategy during bear markets.

Despite the criticism, the project keeps gaining traction. At the time of writing, Ethena offers a 33.5% annual percentage yield (APY) for USDe, attracting many DeFi enthusiasts. While 200,200 users already joined the platform, new participants still need an inviting code. 
Read more: How To Use Ethena Finance To Stake USDe
In conclusion, USDe’s quick growth to a $3 billion supply within a short period stresses the increasing demand for innovative stablecoin solutions. Ethenas’ success demonstrates the viability of synthetic stablecoins and sets a new benchmark in the DeFi space, signaling future adoption​.

$517,000,000,000 in Unrealized Losses Hit US Banking System, FDIC Says 63 Lenders on Brink of Insolvency - The Daily Hodl


								Unrealized losses in the US banking system are once again on the rise, according to new numbers from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
In its Quarterly Banking Profile report, the FDIC says banks are now saddled with more than half a trillion dollars in paper losses on their balance sheets, due largely to exposure to the residential real estate market.










Unrealized losses represent the difference between the price banks paid for securities and the current market value of those assets.
Although banks can hold securities until they mature without marking them to market on their balance sheets, unrealized losses can become an extreme liability when banks need liquidity.
“Unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities increased by $39 billion to $517 billion in the first quarter. Higher unrealized losses on residential mortgage-backed securities, resulting from higher mortgage rates in the first quarter, drove the overall increase. This is the ninth straight quarter of unusually high unrealized losses since the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in first quarter 2022.” 
The FDIC also says that the number of lenders on its Problem Bank List rose last quarter. According to the agency, these banks are on the brink of insolvency due to financial, operational, or managerial weakness or a combination of such issues.
“The number of banks on the Problem Bank List, those with a CAMELS composite rating of ‘4’ or ‘5’ increased from 52 in fourth quarter 2023 to 63 in first quarter 2024. The number of problem banks represented 1.4% of total banks, which was within the normal range for non-crisis periods of 1% to 2% of all banks.  Total assets held by problem banks increased $15.8 billion to $82.1 billion during the quarter.” 
While the FDIC says that the health of the US banking system is at no imminent risk, it warns that persistent inflation, volatile market rates and geopolitical concerns continue to put pressure on the industry.
“These issues could cause credit quality, earnings, and liquidity challenges for the industry. In addition, deterioration in certain loan portfolios, particularly office properties and credit card loans, continues to warrant monitoring. These issues, together with funding and margin pressures, will remain matters of ongoing supervisory attention by the FDIC.”

Tether Co-Founder Reveals "Whether China Will Return to Cryptocurrencies" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Cryptocurrency investor and Tether co-founder Brock Pierce has hinted at a potential return to Hong Kong, a decade after launching his stablecoin there.
This comes at a time when the Hong Kong government is taking steps to attract the crypto industry back to its territory.


Pierce, who also serves as president of the Bitcoin Foundation, refrained from providing information about the details of his new initiative or whether Hong Kong would be its permanent headquarters. He expressed his excitement for the city and noted that this is part of an ongoing conversation.
“Big things can come from this,” Pierce told the South China Morning Post at the Solowin and Sequire Asia Investor Summit in Hong Kong.






“I'll go where I think my time is most valuable. I'm enthusiastic about what's going on in Hong Kong, which means I'm enthusiastic about working here, which means there's a good chance something will happen right now.”

This comment follows recent developments in which several major cryptocurrency exchanges, most of which are affiliated with mainland China, have withdrawn their applications to become licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong. This was due to new regulations introduced last year by the Securities and Futures Commission, which stated that Hong Kong-licensed exchanges should not provide services to mainland residents.
Although commercial crypto activities are strictly prohibited in mainland China, the prospect of Hong Kong serving as a gateway to this massive market has appealed to many in the industry. The idea was a hot topic at this year's Bitcoin Asia conference, although mainland regulators have shown no signs of reversing their stance. But Pierce is confident that change is on the horizon:



“Will China open up to crypto? I would say this is inevitable. “The question is not if it will happen, but when.”


Pierce is hopeful about Hong Kong's recent efforts to provide regulatory certainty to investors. He thinks the city is moving in the right direction and is well positioned in the region compared to Singapore, Japan and South Korea, which have all introduced their own crypto-specific policies.
“I think Hong Kong is ahead in many ways,” he said. “I think its main opportunity in Hong Kong is in traditional finance, and that's where the Hong Kong digital dollar stablecoin has tremendous potential.”





Pierce attributes this situation to China's supply chain advantage. “Clearly there is a huge opportunity here if you get the right system in place,” he said.

Vitalik Buterin Donates 30 Ethereum (ETH) to Tornado Cash Developers’ Legal Fund: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin just gave a substantial amount to support the legal battle of Tornado Cash developers Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm.
Data from Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan shows that Buterin transferred 30 ETH worth $113,678 to the “Free Alexey & Roman” legal fund on May 30th.










Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based coin mixing service that facilitates anonymous crypto transactions. In 2022, the US imposed a sanction on the platform claiming that it is used to launder illicit funds and pose a threat to national security. 
The developers of Tornado Cash were subsequently charged. Earlier this month, a district court in the Netherlands sentenced Pertsev to 64 months in jail for laundering billions of dollars worth of crypto.
US authorities also arrested Storm last year. The Justice Department charged him and fellow developer Roman Semenov for allegedly helping the North Korean hacking group Lazarus launder their criminal proceeds.
In January, Storm asked for donations to help fund his legal defense, and in a video posted on the social media platform X, he said that the outcome of his trial would have significant implications on the future of digital assets.
The legal fund on the decentralized fundraising platform Juicebox has so far raised 597.07 ETH worth $2.25 million. The initiative says Roman and Alexey’s legal expenses range between $90,000 and $100,000 per month.
“Roman and Alex need your help to build a strong defense not just for their sake, but for crypto users and developers worldwide. In response to the arrests, a group of sympathizers came together to form WeWantJusticeDAO to advocate on their behalf and help raise funds for legal defense. However, time and money are running out, and we need your support.”

Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP) to Surge 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin

Find Out 3 Major Token Unlocks of Next Week


Token unlock involves releasing tokens that were previously blocked under fundraising terms. Projects carefully schedule these releases to avoid market pressure and prevent a drop in token prices.
However, factors like lack of liquidity or early investor profit-taking can significantly impact an asset’s dynamics. While next week lacks massive token unlocks, these three events are still worth keeping an eye on.
Liquity (LQTY)

Unlock date: June 5
Number of tokens unlocked: 657,350 LQTY
Current circulating supply: 96,08 million LQTY


Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows users to take out loans against Ethereum with 0% interest. It operates through a stablecoin, LUSD, which is pegged to the US dollar. The LQTY token is the native utility token of the Liquity platform, used for governance and staking rewards. 
The next LQTY token unlock is scheduled for June 5. The release will include 657,350 tokens, reserved for team and advisors.

Other unlocks of the next week include Pendle (PENDLE), Euler (EUL), and 1inch (1INCH), with total value exceeding $12 million. Although many consider token unlocks bearish, a well-planned schedule can strengthen a project’s long-term viability. Aligned with milestones and development progress, unlocks will motivate team members, boost community engagement, and promote ecosystem growth.

Ripple Strengthens Commitment to Blockchain Amid Regulatory Challenges, Eyes Future Crypto ETFs



                    

Ripple remains steadfast in its commitment to blockchain technology despite regulatory hurdles, exemplified by its $25 million investment in Fairshake. 



This move aligns perfectly with their goal of driving global crypto adoption.




In a recent interview at Consensus 2024, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted the urgent need for improved U.S. policies and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. 



Garlinghouse stressed the importance of clarity in regulation, criticizing the SEC’s inconsistent approach to the crypto industry:



“For the U.S. to remain competitive, it is crucial to establish clear and consistent crypto regulations. The SEC’s contradictory lawsuits create confusion.”



He argued that updated policies are essential to keep up with the rapidly evolving financial landscape, especially in the realm of cryptocurrencies.



The discussion at the conference also touched on the potential for cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana [SOL], and Cardano [ADA] to be included in ETFs. 



Garlinghouse expressed confidence in the inevitability of such financial products:



“The introduction of ETFs for XRP, Solana, and Cardano is just a matter of time. Such advancements are favorable for the market.”




This viewpoint is supported by other industry experts. Brian Kelly from CNBC’s ‘Fast Money’ speculated that a Solana spot ETF might soon be approved in the U.S. 



Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, also noted the significance of Ethereum ETFs’ approval, signaling wider acceptance of cryptocurrency investments.

Garlinghouse also commented on the increasing role of cryptocurrencies in political discussions, especially as elections approach. 



He criticized the SEC’s approach under Gary Gensler, which he believes complicates participation for both institutional and retail investors:



“It’s not surprising to see crypto becoming a focal point in presidential debates. The lack of clear regulations hinders market growth.”



He concluded by calling for the U.S. to formulate sensible and transparent regulations to match the pace of global economic leaders in the cryptocurrency space.



In summary, Ripple’s proactive approach towards regulatory clarity and substantial investments in blockchain technology highlight its ongoing commitment to the crypto industry. 



The ongoing discussions about crypto-ETFs and regulatory frameworks underscore the intersection of U.S. politics and cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the need for modernized regulations to foster innovation and market expansion. 



Clearer and more comprehensive guidelines will be crucial for the continued development of the digital asset market.

Short-selling opportunity as this crypto registers high funding rates


    The meme coin mania is back in the cryptocurrency market, and cryptocurrencies like PEPE show signals of being overvalued. This could foreshadow a short-selling opportunity, as suggested by increased open interest (OI) and high funding rates.



Previously, the meme coin boom marked a local top, followed by a market crash that rewarded these crypto short-sellers. Should a similar pattern play out, this asset class is at the peril of suffering another hit despite positive social activity from influencers.



As of this writing, PEPE has $644.85 million in open interest, ranking fifth on CoinGlass. This value represents 10% of the meme coin’s $5.98 billion market cap, trading at $0.0000142. Despite a drop of 20.34% in the $1.55 billion 24-hour volume, the market’s open interest has fallen by 6.37% on the meme coin.

PEPE funding rates and a short-selling opportunity



In particular, the consolidated exchanges’ funding rates for PEPE indicate an open interest weighted to long positions. Currently, long-position traders pay an APR of 42.57% to short-sellers to remedy derivatives imbalances.



Therefore, this high funding rate creates an opportunity to open shorts against PEPE and profit from the current imbalance. Short-selling PEPE now represents a bet against the market and presents risks, as the landscape could quickly change.

On that note, cryptocurrency traders have already started positioning within this short-selling opportunity, which is visible on the liquidations heatmap. As these traders place their bets, accumulated liquidity upwards could trigger a short squeeze, punishing these bearish speculators.



Recently, PEPE’s price action has already liquidated long positions through a long squeeze to the current levels.

Still, the meme coin could move either way according to the capital volume that enters for short or long positions in the following days. Cryptocurrency traders and speculators must understand the volatile nature of these digital assets and act cautiously moving forward.

Tether Co-Founder Announces His Potential Return To Hong Kong Coin Edition


							

Brock Pierce has recently shared insights on his potential return to Hong Kong with his new business.
Though Pierce stated that he had conversations with Hong Kong’s authorities, he did not disclose the venture’s details.
The Tether co-founder remains optimistic about mainland China’s potential acceptance of cryptocurrencies.




Brock Pierce, an American entrepreneur and co-founder of Tether, recently shared insights on his possible return to Hong Kong amidst the government’s efforts to establish the crypto hub. During the Solowin and Sequire Asia Investor Summit in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Pierce hinted at his new enterprise in Hong Kong, though the details of his business remained undisclosed.









According to a recent report by the South China Morning Post, Pierce has been in a “continued conversation” with the authorities to bring his new venture into the city. The entrepreneur cited,




Big things may come from this. I’m going to go where I think my time is most valuable. I’m enthusiastic about what’s happening in Hong Kong, which means I’m enthusiastic about working here, which means the likelihood of something happening is good right now.










Further, Pierce expressed his optimistic approach to the potential establishment of crypto markets in mainland China, where cryptocurrencies are currently banned. He believes that Hong Kong, with its enthusiasm for crypto expansion and efforts for a full-fledged crypto hub, would act as a gateway to the mainland. He added it’s just a matter of time, stating,




Is China going to open up [to crypto]? … I’d say it’s inevitable. The question is not so much if, it’s a matter of when.




In a recent development in the Hong Kong crypto market, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced the list of exchanges, including Crypto.com and Bullish, which are poised to receive a license in the region. However, platforms such as ByBit and OKX have withdrawn their license applications. Hong Kong’s move is part of the government’s initiative to bring regulatory clarity to Hong Kong’s crypto markets.

Bitcoin Runes Resurgence? Why Asia’s Institutional Investors Could Fuel Growth - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIn crypto, where most histories are reduced to one-liners, the tale of the Runes protocol—an optimized framework for creating meme coins on Bitcoin—goes something like this: It started with a bang and faded out, just as fast, with a whimper. Barely a month has passed since Runes’ blockbuster debut alongside the Bitcoin halving in April; and yet, the protocol’s subsequent failure to meet lofty benchmarks has led many to write the whole endeavor off as a misfire. But could growing institutional excitement for Runes in East Asia signal a possible second act for the budding protocol?While mainstream chatter around Runes has quieted in the West, buzz in Asia surrounding the protocol has only continued to snowball—particularly among institutional investors and more centralized building teams who see it as a more sophisticated riff on the theme compared to the earlier BRC-20 fungible token standard.BRC-20 tokens, the first wave of Bitcoin meme coins, created heaps of organic excitement when they took crypto by storm in 2023, birthed from a makeshift tweak to Bitcoin Ordinals code. Their debut was chaotic, highly experimental, and decentralized—the perfect storm for success in the cryptosphere. The Runes protocol, by contrast, was rolled out far more methodically, by a team of reputable engineers who focused on security, scalability, and easily navigable building tools. In fact, it came from the original creator of the Ordinals protocol, Casey Rodarmor, who believed he could make a better fungible token protocol than the one that riffed on his own earlier code.That emphasis arguably hasn’t yet made much of an impression on degen traders. But investors in East Asia say it’s already made a world of difference to them. “Runes is structured to potentially meet the stringent requirements of institutional investors, emphasizing scalability, efficiency, and security,” Ciara Sun, founder and managing partner of Asia-focused crypto investment firm C Squared Ventures, told Decrypt. “This alignment might make Runes more appealing to a broader institutional base.”Some Asian investment firms, like the Hong Kong-based Newman Group, have already jumped headfirst into Runes. The company says it's actively pushing Runes development via portfolio  companies like Xverse and Liquidium, given what the firm sees as Runes’ potential to become a fundamental infrastructure layer for the entire crypto industry. “We believe Runes could end up being bigger than BRC-20, especially considering institutional interest,” Adrian Lai, Newman Group’s founder, told Decrypt. “Runes' technical advantages and potential for efficient cross-chain transactions could make it a preferred choice for institutions looking to access DeFi on Bitcoin.”Some of crypto’s most prominent companies have already lined up behind the protocol. Leading cross-chain NFT marketplace Magic Eden launched a dedicated Runes platform in April. OKX, one of Asia’s top centralized crypto exchanges, has eagerly embraced the protocol; it was the first such exchange to offer zero-fee Runes trading.Paige Xu, an investor at OKX, says Runes were almost perfectly designed to check every box on an institutional investor’s wishlist. She particularly noted the protocol’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, which allows tokens to interact far more seamlessly with crypto wallets, layer-2 networks, and DeFi apps than BRC-20 tokens or Ordinals inscriptions currently can. “Runes has the right stuff—efficiency and a slim blockchain footprint—that institutions typically look for in tech, that can handle heavy demand securely,” Xu told Decrypt, adding that her personal views do not necessarily reflect that of her employer. The investor noted, however, that Runes’ ascendancy to dominance via institutional support is far from a done deal. “Adoption of Bitcoin-based tech like this is still pretty new, and a lot depends on how well we can educate and integrate these assets into the broader financial world,” she said. In the days following its April 19 launch, interest in Runes soared; three days in, the protocol saw over a million transactions, according to on-chain data from Dune. Transaction volume then plummeted by as much as 90% in the following weeks, amid a broader cooling-off period across the crypto ecosystem.In late May, however, activity on Runes more than tripled. For the first time ever, the total market capitalization of assets on the protocol hit $1 billion, according to GeniiData. That figure has since eclipsed $2 billion, indicating that Runes may be enjoying something of a comeback (despite being barely a month old). There is no guarantee that institutional excitement about Runes will lead the protocol to dominate the crypto industry, as many once assumed. But if current sentiment in East Asia is any indication, then crypto’s largest players are coming to the conclusion that there is only one road to mainstreaming fungible Bitcoin tokens—and that road runs through Runes. “If issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain is the right move, then deciding between Runes and BRC-20 comes down to which has a better chance of long-term viability and diversity,” MiXWeb3, the pseudonymous founder of the Runes China community, told Decrypt. “That makes the choice much clearer.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Trader That Called May 2021 Crypto Collapse Unveils Potential Max Target for Bitcoin Bull Market Top - The Daily Hodl


								A veteran trader with a history of several accurate macro crypto calls is revealing what he thinks could be the maximum upside price target for Bitcoin (BTC) this market cycle.
Pseudonymous trader Dave the Wave shares with his 146,000 followers on the social media platform X a chart using his version of the logarithmic growth channel (LGC) curve, which aims to predict Bitcoin’s longer-term cycle lows and highs while filtering out shorter-term volatility.










According to the trader, his LGC model is suggesting that Bitcoin’s current market cycle could peak out somewhere around a maximum of 3x above current prices, or roughly the $205,000 level.
“BTC price has always been relatively close to previous highs at the time of halvings.
Of interest, this time round, is the 4x off the bottom as compared to the previous 3xs. This suggests some front-running of price relative to the halving.
The LGC model suggests a max of 3x from here. Also why you might want to consider trading the extra volatility of alt/ USD in order to take some profits while continuing to sit on BTC for the longer term.”
Source: Dave the Wave/X
In the shorter term, Dave the Wave says that Bitcoin is currently approaching an ascending diagonal level that has in the past acted as a strong support for BTC.
“BTC price closing in yet again on what has acted as strong support…”

At time of writing, BTC is trading at $67,702.

America’s Wealthiest Prisoner: Former Binance CEO CZ Starts Four-Month Jail Sentence ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has surrendered to a California-based federal facility where he will serve his sentence for financial crimes that led the cryptocurrency exchange he founded to agree to pay a mammoth $4.3 billion fine. 



Zhao pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws in November. With a $37 billion fortune, he has made history as the richest US inmate ever.



CZ’s Prison Sentence In California Prison Kicks Off



Changpeng Zhao has officially started his four-month prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc in Lompoc, California. It’s a low-security prison located northwest of Los Angeles.



The 47-year-old billionaire had pleaded guilty to federal money laundering charges last year, which focused on a corporate culture at Binance that U.S. prosecutors claimed dismissed fraud prevention in favor of the company’s growth. He was forced to step down from the world’s largest exchange he founded and cough up a $50 million personal fine.



The U.S. Department of Justice had recommended Zhao be sentenced to three years in prison for the egregious violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. But the crypto kingpin was given a tremendously light sentence of four months.

&nbsp



Since flying to Seattle to enter the guilty plea, CZ had been barred from leaving the United States as travel restrictions were imposed on him by Judge Richard Jones. Prosecutors warned that the former Binance chief, with an estimated wealth of $37.2 billion, was a flight risk.



It’s unclear how long Zhao will serve at the prison camp in California. Still, he will potentially receive credit for time already served, and the four-month sentence could include as little as 10 months in jail with the remaining time under supervised release.



Post-Jail Plans



Zhao’s prison time will likely be more of a blip in his story than the end of his line. After doing his time, CZ plans to focus on global online education for children — most likely through the Giggle Academy, which he revealed in March while awaiting his sentencing.



CZ also plans to maintain his existing crypto holdings and remain a passive investor, suggesting his continued confidence and commitment to the crypto industry. Earlier last month, he observed that Binance had been “under the microscope” yet customer funds remained SAFU, underscoring the importance of compliance with regulations.



Following Zhao’s resignation, Binance outlined an optimistic vision for the future. “We are confident that Binance will emerge as a stronger company as we lay the foundation for the next 50 years,” the exchange asserted.

$1 XRP Price Nigh as Ripple's Move To Become Stablecoin Giant Proves Weighty with Whales Moving Millions ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The XRP community is on edge as significant cryptocurrency movements to exchanges surge, raising concerns among investors alike about a possible dump.



Since Tuesday, Whale Alert, a crypto analytics firm focused on highlighting huge crypto transactions, has been reporting a series of substantial transfers involving XRP, totaling over $50 million, to various exchanges.



Notably, on May 29, the firm highlighted a transfer of 28,050,000 XRP, valued at $14.6 million from an unknown wallet to Bitstamp, before detecting another transfer of 23,130,000 XRP, worth roughly $12 million, to Mexico-based crypto exchange Bitso.



These transactions follow a pattern observed earlier on Tuesday, May 28, with a transfer of 19,880,000 XRP, equivalent to approximately $10.4 million to Bitso. Subsequently, another transfer of 29,280,000 XRP, valued at $15.4 million, was sent to Bitstamp.



This consistent influx of XRP into exchanges without corresponding withdrawals has rattled the XRP community, fueling speculations of an impending market downturn. This comes when XRP grapples with establishing a firm footing amid a prolonged consolidation phase, with suppressed volatility hindering clear patterns or direction for the cryptocurrency to follow.

&nbsp



Meanwhile, investors are eagerly banking on factors such as legal clarity for the crypto sector, more so after the conclusion of the Ripple lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, anticipation mounts as investors hope for a spot XRP ETF approval and the imminent launch of Ripple’s stablecoin.



That said, amidst these developments, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed confidence in crypto’s impact on the upcoming US elections, with Ripple recently donating $25 million to pro-crypto committee Fairshake. In a statement following the donation, Garlinghouse noted they aimed to counter negative sentiments surrounding crypto, particularly from “backward-looking politicians” like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler, by supporting crypto-friendly legislation and candidates.



Echoing Garlinghouse’s optimism, lobbying groups such as the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council for Innovation have advocated for favorable regulatory frameworks, culminating in recent successes like the passage of the FIT21 crypto bill by the US House of Representatives.



That said, as the XRP community grapples with the implications of significant whale activity and regulatory developments, the path to a $1 XRP price remains uncertain. Yet, amidst the turbulence, stakeholders remain committed to steering XRP towards stability and growth, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s resilience amidst evolving market dynamics.



At press time, XRP was trading at $0.5179, reflecting a 1.47% price drop over the past 24 hours.

Massive Shiba Inu Burn Ignites Hope For Price Recovery Despite Market Downturn - Benzinga

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu SHIB/USD has seen a significantly increase in token burns, with a 207% surge in the last several hours. What Happened: The Shiba Inu community has burned 4,796,486 SHIB tokens in several hours. This represents a 207.81% increase in the burn rate.This spike in token burns comes amid low trading activity for Bitcoin BTC/USD and other major cryptocurrencies, including SHIB.The market is eagerly anticipating a significant price shift. Shiba Inu's price has declined 2.18% to $0.00002473.This coincides with a broader market downturn affecting most cryptocurrencies.The market's response to the current profit-taking phase will be crucial in determining SHIB's short-term price direction.Also Read: Crypto Trader Says These Two Meme Coins Are Set To Spike — And Neither Of Them Are Dogecoin Or Shiba InuIf buyers absorb selling pressure, the price may stabilize or rise. However, a sustained sell-off could test SHIB's support levels.Maintaining a price above the daily SMA 50 at $0.00002454 could be critical for Shiba Inu to sustain its upward momentum and prevent further losses.Why It Matters: The recent surge in Shiba Inu's burn rate is part of a broader trend observed over the past few weeks. Earlier in March, there was a 103.45% increase in SHIB tokens burned, with 34,681,610 SHIB tokens sent to inaccessible wallets.This consistent burning of tokens is seen as a strategy to reduce the circulating supply, potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens.

Scaramucci Warns Biden's Veto Of Crypto Custody Bill Will 'Cost Him More Than He Realizes': 'Out Of Step With The Future' - Benzinga

Former White House Director of Communications Anthony Scaramucci did not take kindly to President Joe Biden’s vetoing of the crypto custody bill. On Saturday, the financier and founder of investment firm SkyBridge Capital warned about the potential ramifications of the president’s decision.What Happened: Biden’s position on crypto “may cost him more than he realizes,” said Scaramucci in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “It was a really bad decision to veto that bill. Especially at this critical time.”Warren Slammed: Scaramucci also took shots at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), alleging that she had a role in the latest development. “Warren 70+ Biden 81 think this isn't a big deal put younger democrats know they are out of step with the future. Could be very costly,” he said in a separate post.The ex-White House aide went a step further and called her the “worst senator in America,” adding that she should retire. He also called for support for Republican Massachusetts Senate candidate John Deaton, a former Marine and cryptocurrency attorney.See Also: How To Buy Bitcoin BTC/USDWhy It’s Important: H.J.Res. 109, which Biden vetoed, is a congressional resolution that would have overturned the SEC’s current approach to banks and crypto. The SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 currently requires banks to classify customers’ crypto assets as liabilities and significantly increases the banks’ cost of handling cryptocurrencies. This has led to opposition from banking groups.  Regulators, however, are in favor of erring on the side of caution, given the risks associated with holding cryptos in the wake of collapse of crypto companies such as FTX and several other scandals involving cryptos.Before it was tabled  before Biden, the e H.J.Res. 109 was passed by Congress, with mostly Republican support.While rejecting the proposal, Biden said, “By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, this Republican-led resolution would inappropriately constrain the SEC's ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues.”“This reversal of the considered judgment of SEC staff in this way risks undercutting the SEC's broader authorities regarding accounting practices.”On the contrary, the president expressed his willingness to work with the Congress on a “comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system.”Scaramucci is a crypto bull and predicted Bitcoin BTC/USD would hit $200,000 after the halving that occurred in April.At last check, Bitcoin traded up 0.54% at $68,088.37, according to Benzinga Pro data.Read Next: ‘Took Guts To Own Bitcoin:’ SkyBridge’s Anthony Scaramucci Says It Would Need ‘Brains’ To Reap BTC RallyPhoto: Shutterstock

Bitcoin Bull Nayib Bukele is President of El Salvador Again: Here's How Much BTC His Country Owns - Bitcoin Sistemi

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele was sworn in for a second term on Saturday, vowing to address the country's economic problems with the same determination that marked his campaign against gang violence in his first term.
Bukele, who was re-elected in February with more than 80% of the vote after a controversial court decision, has declared his intention to cure the country's economic “illnesses”.


Speaking from the balcony of the National Palace in San Salvador, Bukele, 42, reassured the public that the gang-related violence plaguing the country was largely under control. “Salvadorian society is still sick, but it is no longer cancerous,” he said, referring to the criminal gangs that once made El Salvador one of the most dangerous countries in the world.
With security largely restored, Bukele now faces the difficult task of reviving the stagnant economy. “Now that we have ensured the most pressing issue, which is security, we will focus on important problems, starting with the economy,” he said.






Despite Bukele's popularity for improving security in the country of 6.3 million, his economic policies have faced obstacles. The ambitious Bitcoin City project, designed as a tax-free, cryptocurrency-supported center, has had difficulty attracting investment. Additionally, El Salvador's public debt has risen to over $30 billion, nearly 84% of its gross domestic product.
There are currently 5,769 Bitcoins worth approximately $389 million in the country's treasury. Bukele reported that his country purchased 1 BTC every day.

Brad Garlinghouse on $DOGE: “I Don’t Know What the Use Case Is” | Cryptoglobe


                                
At the recent Consensus 2024 conference (held May 29, 31, 2024, in Austin, Texas), Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made headlines by directly criticizing Dogecoin, questioning its value and use case. 



Dogecoin (DOGE) began as a parody cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in December 2013. Initially intended as a joke, it features the Shiba Inu dog from the “Doge” meme as its mascot. Despite its humorous origins, Dogecoin quickly garnered a substantial following due to its active and engaging community on platforms like Reddit.



The appeal of Dogecoin lies in its friendly and fun nature. It was designed to be more accessible and lighthearted compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin transactions are faster and cheaper, typically costing just a fraction of a penny, which makes it practical for everyday use and microtransactions. The unlimited supply of DOGE contrasts sharply with Bitcoin’s capped supply, aiming to promote spending over hoarding.



A significant factor in Dogecoin’s sustained popularity is its high-profile endorsements and social media influence. Celebrities like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons have frequently tweeted about Dogecoin, driving spikes in its price and keeping it in the public eye. This celebrity backing, coupled with its meme-driven culture, has kept Dogecoin relevant and highly popular.



In 2021, Dogecoin experienced a meteoric rise, driven by social media buzz and celebrity endorsements. This period saw its price surge from fractions of a cent to over $0.70, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Although its price has since stabilized and dropped from its all-time high, Dogecoin remains a favorite for short-term trading due to its high liquidity and volatility.



Despite criticisms regarding its lack of intrinsic value and infinite supply, Dogecoin’s strong community, low transaction costs, and ongoing celebrity endorsements ensure it remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency market. Its potential future integrations, such as with the X platform for payments, hint at continued growth and utility.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Garlinghouse highlighted the irony of the United States, the largest economy in the world, ranking low in terms of regulatory clarity. He stressed that clear regulations could unlock the potential of the U.S. economy, attracting significant institutional investment. This, in turn, could create substantial opportunities for growth and innovation in the crypto space.



Despite the popularity of speculative assets like Dogecoin, Garlinghouse underscored the importance of focusing on projects that provide real-world utility. He pointed out that while Dogecoin has garnered significant attention, its lack of a clear use case raises questions about its long-term value. Instead, he called for the industry to concentrate on developing blockchain projects that address tangible problems and offer practical solutions.



Garlinghouse noted that there are many blockchain projects currently demonstrating significant utility across various sectors. He believes that the future of the industry should be built on these practical applications rather than speculative investments. According to him, the next decade for cryptocurrency must prioritize solving real-world problems to achieve sustainable growth and widespread adoption.



Garlinghouse said:



“You know, I get a ton of s**t when I say these things, but I’m going to say it anyway. I don’t think Dogecoin has been a good thing for the industry, and I’m not anti-Dogecoin, but it’s like, I don’t know what the use case is. I don’t know, like, are there projects being built to solve real utility? And I see lots of real utility across lots of different chains, and I think that is what is critical, and for me, the 10-year prediction has to be about … solving real problems.“

Ripple's XRP Sees $1.5 Billion Transferred in 24 Hours


Ripple’s XRP token has experienced substantial activity over the past 24 hours, drawing attention from the crypto community.
Blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported the transfer of 3 billion XRP tokens, valued at approximately $1.5 billion, in several transactions. This large-scale movement has sparked concerns about potential price impact.
Ripple Escrow Activities Triggers Market Concerns 

Typically, Ripple releases around 1 billion XRP tokens from its escrow wallet at the beginning of each month. However, this month’s unusual asset movements have surprised the community, leading to various speculations about these transactions.
Crypto commentator Marty Party noted that the 3 billion tokens represented 5.45% of XRP’s total circulating supply and were transferred between Ripple-affiliated wallets within 30 minutes. Some community members clarified that these asset movements were standard fund consolidations related to escrow activities. They highlighted that of the 3 billion tokens, 1 billion worth $520 million was unlocked from Ripple’s escrow address.

“Majority of these are internal movements and escrow relock ups. Everyone it says ‘unknown’ account the bot was wrong and it was still a Ripple account,” crypto analyst Michael Nardolillo explained.

Historically, XRP’s price tends to fluctuate in response to Ripple’s escrow releases, often influenced by the prevailing market sentiment. Despite a 1% decline in the last 24 hours, XRP’s price remains stable at $0.51, indicating that the recent escrow release has not significantly impacted its performance.

However, some market experts believe the token release could introduce additional selling pressure, hindering XRP’s potential recovery. Reports suggest Ripple may be preparing for its largest monthly XRP dump since 2017, reserving 400 million XRP tokens worth $208 million for a sell-off in June.

These actions would have a telling impact on XRP’s price. While XRP remains among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, it has been one of the worst-performing major tokens this year.

Notcoin Records 335% Weekly Gains, Closing in on Top 50


Popular play-to-earn token Notcoin (NOT) continues to attract investors with its impressive price performance. 
With the overall crypto market staying steady, NOT’s massive surge has caught the eye of traders, showing strong buying interest.
Notcoin Surpasses $2 Billion Market Cap

The NOT token officially launched on May 16. After the release, it dropped by over 60%, falling from $0.012 to as low as $0.0050.
However, in the last week, the token has made a stunning recovery, rising by over 335% to reach an all-time high of $0.028. NOT’s market cap has grown to about $2.3 billion, pushing it close to the top 50 cryptocurrencies. The 24-hour trading volume surged to $4.3 billion, a 265% increase from the previous day.
The crypto community is actively discussing Notcoin’s dynamics. Prominent trader Crypto Steam suggested that the main triggers of the current rally were the launch of the staking function, token burning, and market maker actions.

“Around 18m $NOT have been burned and taken out of circulation forever (reduced sell-pressure). While this doesn’t seem a lot investors might price in additional burns in the future, it is crypto after all and valuations don’t have to be reasonable”, Crypto Stream noted.

Listings on major centralized exchanges have fueled its growth by increasing trading volume and market cap.

Last week, Notcoin launched “earnings missions,” boosting the token’s functionality and value. This new feature allows users to earn passive rewards by participating in various quests, increasing community activity.

Ripple Escalates Pro-Crypto Advocacy with $25M Fairshake Fund


																Ripple has contributed $25 million to the Fairshake super PAC, aligning with an industry-wide effort to advocate for pro-crypto policies and politicians.
Ripple’s decision to boost Fairshake’s efforts comes amid its own ongoing legal battle with regulatory bodies like the SEC. The agency’s lawsuit prompted the company to take a more proactive stance in advocating for fair and balanced regulation within the industry.
Ripple Advancing Pro-Crypto Agenda
In a press release, Ripple stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s strategy of attempting to regulate the cryptocurrency industry through enforcement has proven ineffective.
While Congress is presently progressing with comprehensive legislation for the sector to ensure a bright future for American innovation, competitiveness, and expansion, the United States lags behind other nations that have embraced the asset class and its underlying technology.
Ripple highlighted the critical importance of the 2024 elections for the industry, emphasizing the choice between candidates supporting or hindering technological innovation. It also highlighted the need for leaders who understand and promote policies fostering innovation, consumer protection, and market fairness.




While speaking about the contributing Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said,
“Our contributions to Fairshake are just one of the many ways Ripple will actively invest in educating voters on the role crypto will play in the future and the dangers of the anti-crypto stance some policymakers are clinging to in Washington.”
The exec also added that the company as well as the rest of the industry should refuse to remain silent in the face of unelected regulators’ attempts to stifle progress and economic advancement, which millions of Americans benefit from.
The development comes almost six months after Ripple gave $20 million to Fairshake, which has already used $11.3 million for federal elections. This increase in contributions marks a significant rise in the company’s political activity. According to FEC records, the San Francisco-based company had only donated $500,000 during the 2022 election cycle.
Ripple’s contributions make up nearly half of the $100 million-plus raised by Fairshake from major figures in the cryptocurrency sector, including industry giants like Coinbase and Gemini exchanges, venture capital leader Andreessen Horowitz, and asset management powerhouse ARK Invest.
Ripple-SEC: Legal Showdown
Ripple has been engaged in a prolonged legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for several years, following accusations by the regulatory watchdog that the company unlawfully raised $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP, which it deemed an unregistered security.
The SEC recently filed a remedies brief contesting Ripple’s stance on penalties in their ongoing legal dispute. It essentially seeks fines against Ripple despite Judge Torres’ ruling that XRP is not a security in programmatic sales. The blockchain company, on the other hand, argued that fines should not surpass $10 million, citing a lack of fraudulent intent. Both parties await a final ruling.

Shiba Inu Loses Vital Support: Critical State of SHIB, Ethereum (ETH) to Hit $4,000? Solana (SOL) Might Show Massive Reversal Soon

Shiba Inu is on the verge of losing some important ground for the price, and it may lead to some serious issues for the token. However, there are some support levels below the aforementioned support. Luckily, the volume is descending, which, in case of a dropping price, is a good sign for the asset.There is a worrying trend in the SHIB technical indicators. The price has been attempting to maintain a higher level above $0.00002476 while testing the lower bounds of its current trading range.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThis scenario implies the possibility of a further decline in SHIB should it be unable to hold its position above these support levels. Another bearish signal on the chart is the descending triangle pattern, which usually indicates that the downward trend will continue.Regarding volume, this bearish scenario of decreasing trading volume is encouraging. The price may short-term stabilize, if lower volume on a downward trend typically signifies waning selling pressure. But SHIB will require a large boost in buying interest — which is not there at the moment — for a meaningful recovery.Bearish signals are also visible in the relative strength index, which is hovering near the oversold area at 44. This suggests that there may be room for a price bounce, but the next move will largely depend on how the market feels overall. Investors need to monitor the $0.00002310 support level closely.Ethereum stays putEthereum could be on the verge of hitting $4,000 as the price remains stable and does not drop below the bottom of the trading channel at around $3,700. Luckily, that fact brings us closer to the potential return above the $4,000 threshold and the upcoming surge of inflows to Ethereum. But, of course, always keep in mind the broader market perspective.A break through this barrier could lead to a more significant decline that could take the price down to the next major support level, which is $0.00001940 (200 EMA). Based on the chart, Ethereum appears to be stabilizing, which is encouraging.The price has been holding its position above the crucial $3,700 support level. The medium- to long-term trend can be clearly seen using the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages. At the moment, the 50-day moving average is serving as a support level. It is common for a consolidation pattern to form near the upper end of a trading range to precede a breakout in the recent price action.Solana's reversal planSolana could be closer to a reversal than you may think. The price of the asset has secured a placement at around 26 EMA, which acts as a trendline support for now. Hopefully, the price of SOL will be able to regain some momentum and finally show us the possibility of a reversal.The price action in Solana is creating what appears to be a bullish setup on the chart. Around $163, the 26-day moving average (EMA) is a strong support level that the price is presently trading above. This support has remained stable, halting additional drops and indicating that buyers are intervening at this point.As the price rises further, the 50-day moving average is beginning to turn upward, which may indicate the start of a new upward trend. Before confirming a long-term bullish reversal, Solana still has some ground to cover as seen by the downward trend of the 200- and 100-day moving averages.As is often the case prior to a possible breakout, volume analysis reveals a decline in trading volume during the most recent consolidation phase. Relative strength index (RSI) values around 50 indicate that the asset is neither oversold nor overbought.The price could move in either direction, as indicated by this neutral position, but the current support levels offer a promising future. In order to verify a reversal, Solana must make a strong break above the $170 resistance level.

Crypto Whales Suddenly Gobble Up $112,000,000 Worth of Dogecoin Amid Bearish DOGE Sentiment: Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto analyst says whales have abruptly accumulated tens of millions of dollars worth of Dogecoin (DOGE) in just a matter of days.
Crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 63,100 followers on the social media platform X that deep-pocketed investors have snapped up 700 million DOGE worth $112 million in just 72 hours.










Source: Ali Martinez/X
Using data from analytics platform Santiment, Martinez says that the sudden DOGE accumulation of whales comes as sentiment for the leading memecoin has dropped close to 2024 lows.
“Market sentiment for Dogecoin is as bearish as it was in early February, just before DOGE skyrocketed by 200%!” 
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Dogecoin ignited a big surge in February when it rallied from $0.077 on the first day of the month to $0.228 on March 28th. At time of writing, DOGE is worth $0.159.
Looking at Dogecoin rival Shiba Inu, Martinez says that crypto exchanges are suddenly witnessing a massive influx of SHIB.
“Shiba Inu: over four trillion SHIB have been sent to crypto exchanges in the last two weeks, worth around $103 million!” 
Source: Ali Martinez/X
At time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000025.
Turning to the top smart contract platform Ethereum, the crypto strategist says that the number of mega whale ETH wallets is on the up and up.
“There’s been a notable increase in Ethereum addresses holding 10,000+ ETH, indicating a shift from distribution to accumulation!”

At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,790.

Notcoin Surpasses Major Meme Tokens in Onchain Holders and Price Surge



                    

The recently introduced Telegram-linked cryptocurrency, Notcoin (NOT), has been making waves in the crypto market due to its notable price surge. 



On May 30, 2024, a significant milestone was announced via X (formerly known as Twitter), stating that Notcoin’s onchain holder count has surpassed that of other popular meme tokens like Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Pepe.




The announcement detailed that Notcoin now boasts 1.6 million onchain holders, surpassing Shiba Inu’s 1.4 million, Bonk’s 731,000, and Pepe’s 235,000. 



This substantial increase is a testament to the growing investor interest and confidence in Notcoin.



The rise in Notcoin’s onchain holders coincides with a sharp increase in its price. 




Over the past 24 hours, the price of NOT has soared by 28%, currently trading near $0.0116. 



This surge is part of a broader trend observed over the past week, with NOT experiencing a 130% increase, despite a 20% decline over the past month.



The positive price movement of Notcoin is partly attributed to a recent promotional staking offer, which has since concluded, signaling strong market demand. 



READ MORE: Franklin Templeton Fires First Shot in Ether ETF Fee War with 0.19% Sponsor Fee Disclosure




Technical analysis suggests that NOT is on a bullish trajectory, evidenced by a significant breakout and the closing of its first daily candle in positive territory.



The optimism surrounding Notcoin is further bolstered by external factors such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. 



Given that NOT is built on the Ethereum blockchain, this development could have indirect positive implications for its value.



In contrast, other major meme coins are struggling to maintain momentum. 



Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF), and Bonk (BONK) have seen declines of 3.54%, 2.5%, 4.5%, 7.5%, and 10% respectively over the same period.



This comparative performance emphasizes Notcoin’s recent success not only in expanding its onchain holder base but also in achieving substantial price gains, distinguishing it from its peers in the volatile meme coin market.

Musk's Cyborg (MUSKCYB) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Musk’s Cyborg could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.



Musk’s Cyborg (MUSKCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because MUSKCYB has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Musk’s Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin.



Musk’s Cyborg launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Musk’s Cyborg on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Cyborg by entering its contract address – zA67dhDYz4AzQ2rtfySpq7SNCo8aopw64AjuDbGfo6q – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCYB.

Why 'struggling' Bitcoin may be good news for market's memecoins now - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin discussions seem to be slipping, with traders now more focused on altcoins
Memecoin mania going strong, but this could be a warning for traders

Bitcoin [BTC] has retraced almost all of its gains after breaking out past the $67k resistance level on 20 May. It extended upwards to $71.9k, but fell to test $67k again on 23 May.
This consolidation implies that Bitcoin’s bullish strength is not as high as investors would have hoped. In fact, a recent AMBCrypto report explored some relevant Bitcoin metrics, finding that many of them remained bearish.
Memecoins have succeeded in capturing the public interest

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Santiment shared some insights into the crypto trends on social media. Memecoins have captured more of the public’s attention since mid-April due to their superior performance as a sector.
Tokens like dogwifhat [WIF], FLOKI [FLOKI], and Shiba Inu [SHIB] registered good performances over the past week. Pepe [PEPE] also saw remarkable gains over the past two weeks, with the altcoin up by 63% since 20 April. This came at a time when Bitcoin tried to break past $67k, but did not see a strongly bullish result.
The heavy engagement with memecoins could be a sign that the market is greedy and speculative and not in a phase of organic development, one where the public pursues tokens with good tech and utility.
Now, the Bitcoin ETF inflows have been positive lately and the month of May ended well too. However, it remains to be seen if that is enough to begin another rally this week.

The data also showed that Bitcoin discussions were sliding downward. According to Santiment, this was because traders have been increasingly fixated on altcoins for potential gains while Bitcoin dithered below the $70k resistance.
Large-cap momentum was bullish for the most part

The RSI on the 1-day interval revealed that most of the major tokens were near or above the neutral 50-mark, signaling bullishness. Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL] were the strongest with readings of 67 and 55, respectively.
Meanwhile, Cardano [ADA], XRP, and Avalanche [AVAX] struggled to gain bullish traction on the charts.

Here, it is also worth noting that the trading volume of major altcoins has fallen dramatically, when compared to March. Crypto analyst Axel Adler pointed this out in a post on X, claiming that Bitcoin’s lack of momentum has been affecting sentiment across the market.

The volatility and trading volume behind Bitcoin has declined since March, and the price continues to trade within the range of $60k-$72k. Investors need to be patient, while traders need to watch out for range formations and not get caught out by false breakouts.

The price is now trading below $0.5150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.5180 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could continue to move down if the price stays below $0.5250.

XRP Price Extends Losses
XRP price remained in a short-term bearish zone like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price struggled to start a recovery wave and extended losses below the $0.5220 support zone.
It even declined below the $0.5120 support. A low was formed at $0.5080 and the price is now attempting a fresh recovery wave. There was a move above the $0.5120 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5405 swing high to the $0.5080 low.

The first key resistance is near $0.5250 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5405 swing high to the $0.5080 low. A close above the $0.5250 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5320.

If there is a close above the $0.5320 resistance level, there could be a steady increase toward the $0.5450 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance.
More Downsides?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.5180 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5120 level.
The next major support is at $0.5080. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5080 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline and retest the $0.50 support in the near term.
Technical Indicators

Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Pepe Loves Solana (PEPELSOL) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Solana (PEPELSOL) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Pepe Loves Solana (PEPELSOL), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PEPELSOL will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Pepe Loves Solana.



Currently, Pepe Loves Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PEPELSOL on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Solana by entering its contract address – 5wjHhZyWzpCgCr7DtSwctAEH8ujGkJYuyXG9DeQKnX6R – in the receiving field.




PEPELSOL currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Tether Dominates Polygon's Stablecoin Market with $792M Cap, Growing 29% QoQ


																Polygon has witnessed a remarkable surge in its stablecoin market capitalization this quarter.
According to the latest report from Messari, the Ethereum Layer 2 solution’s stablecoin market cap soared to a whopping $1.5 billion, reflecting a significant 19% increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
Stablecoin Adoption on Polygon Soars
Tether’s solidified its position as the dominant stablecoin on Polygon, with its market cap growing by an impressive 29% QoQ to reach $792 million, according to Messari’s report. This accounted for a significant 53% of the total stablecoin market cap on the network.
This growth in stablecoin adoption on Polygon has been further boosted by several notable developments during the period.
For instance, In April, Sony Bank initiated trials exploring the use of stablecoins on the Polygon blockchain, with the end goal of evaluating their potential as a settlement method for digital sales across the Sony Group, including video games.




Additionally, the Belgian tech company Settlemint announced plans to develop a stablecoin leveraging Polygon, further underscoring the Layer 2 network’s growing prominence in the stablecoin ecosystem.
“Polygon’s stablecoin market cap increased to $1.5 billion, marking a 19% growth QoQ. USDT extended its position as the leading stablecoin, with its market cap growing by 29% QoQ to $792 million, representing 53% of the total stablecoin market cap.”
Gaming, DeFi, and NFT on Polygon
The gaming sector on Polygon also flourished during the first quarter of 2024. Messari observed that the number of daily active addresses associated with gaming on the platform skyrocketed by 1,615% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 207,000 addresses.
Additionally, the daily gaming transactions on Polygon experienced a 469% QoQ increase, climbing to 734,000 transactions. This growth in gaming activity was primarily driven by the immense popularity of MATR1X’s MATR1X FIRE game.
Beyond the gaming sector, Polygon’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem also experienced notable growth, with the number of daily active DeFi addresses increasing by 67% QoQ to reach 50,000 addresses.
While the non-fungible token (NFT) and social sectors also saw an uptick in activity, their scale remained relatively smaller compared to the gaming and DeFi domains within the Polygon ecosystem during the same period.

Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP) Coin to Surge 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Doge Loves Trump (DOTRUMP), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Loves Trump presents a similar opportunity.



Doge Loves Trump has a market cap below $10,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Doge Loves Trump could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Doge Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Doge Loves Trump on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Loves Trump by entering its contract address – AQSeJZGNc2UD9okyyy6uWmUGdxKK1DYrr7eEQ9mstQbc – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOTRUMP.

Coinbase Accuses SEC of Stifling Crypto Industry with Regulation-by-Enforcement Strategy



                    

Coinbase has accused the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of employing a regulation-by-enforcement strategy to deliberately stifle the cryptocurrency industry. 



In a May 31 filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals, Coinbase critiqued the SEC’s reluctance to establish clear and equitable regulations for the crypto sector, which they argue is intended to “choke” the industry’s growth.




In the document, Coinbase expressed frustration with the SEC’s approach, stating, “The SEC is serious about the destruction of digital assets.” 



The filing highlighted the agency’s apparent disinterest in negotiating fair rules, noting that giving the SEC more opportunities to clarify its position would be “both pointless and exquisitely undeserved.”



Coinbase also argued that the SEC does not see it as its responsibility to ensure compliance is feasible, claiming that the agency finds its current rules “workable enough” as evidenced by its litigation against various firms for rule violations. 




This stance was reinforced by the mention of other SEC Commissioners who agree that the SEC’s actions are detrimental to the progress of digital assets and innovation.



The situation has been further complicated by legal actions the SEC has taken against firms like Coinbase. In June 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase for operating without proper registrations as a broker, securities exchange, or clearing agency. 



Despite efforts to dismiss the lawsuit, Coinbase has faced opposition from the SEC at every turn.

Even with a forecast by Bloomberg’s senior litigation analyst Elliott Stein, suggesting a 70% likelihood of a full dismissal, the case remains unresolved.



Amidst these tensions, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce has proposed solutions like a cross-border sandbox program to facilitate cooperation between U.S. and U.K. firms experimenting with tokenized securities. 



During a panel at Consensus 2024, Pierce criticized the SEC’s unyielding bureaucracy, noting, “One of the problems that we’ve had is that people have tried to come into the SEC to get relief, but, you know, you sort of come in, and nothing happens. 



“This would […] force the SEC’s hand a little bit.”



While Coinbase acknowledges that the SEC’s stringent rules might only affect a small portion of the market, it argues that the overall approach remains oppressive. 



The company and other stakeholders in the crypto industry continue to push for fairer regulatory treatment as the SEC maintains its stringent stance.

Veteran Trader Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $150,000 by 2025


A well-known trading veteran, Peter L. Brandt, recently shared a bold forecast for Bitcoin. According to Brandt, Bitcoin could surge to $150,000 by September 2025.
This prediction stems from historical patterns observed in Bitcoin’s market cycles, specifically related to its “halving” events.
Bitcoin’s Halving Events: A Symmetrical Cycle

In his latest analysis, titled “The Beautiful Symmetry of Past Bitcoin Bull Market Cycles,” Brandt emphasizes the crucial role of Bitcoin’s halving dates. These events, where mining rewards are halved, have historically marked the midpoints of Bitcoin’s bull market cycles. Brandt notes that the time intervals from the start of a bull market to the halving dates closely mirror the intervals from the halving dates to the subsequent market peaks.

“More specifically, the number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle (the low following a 75%-plus decline) to the Halving dates has been almost equal to the number of weeks from the Halving dates to the subsequent bull market highs,” he wrote.

If this pattern holds, Brandt forecasted that Bitcoin could reach its next peak around late August or early September 2025. He suggests that the price might soar to between $130,000 and $150,000, following an inverted parabolic curve that has characterized previous bull markets.
However, Brandt remains cautious, acknowledging that no analysis method is infallible. He assigns a 25% probability that Bitcoin has already peaked for this cycle. He advises traders to monitor Bitcoin’s performance closely, particularly if it fails to achieve a new all-time high and drops below $55,000.
Other prominent analysts also share optimistic outlooks for Bitcoin. Crypto technical analyst CryptoCon points to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator as a critical metric for identifying cycle tops and bottoms.
According to CryptoCon, Bitcoin’s price reached levels in March 2024, consistent with the initial tops seen in previous cycles. This indicates room for further growth.
Renowned crypto analyst PlanB also supports a bullish view. He highlighted Bitcoin’s post-halving performance in June, noting its alignment with the Stock-to-Flow model.

VIDEO

Based on his analysis, Bitcoin is still on track to be in a bull market post-halving. PlanB highlighted that Bitcoin shows a similar pattern in the Stock-to-Flow model to the three previous halvings.

“The big change in the Stock-to-Flow and the Stock-to-Flow model outcome is around the halvings. So, big jump around the halving in the model value and then a price of Bitcoin that shows a little bit of a lag, but it eventually catches up with that model value, and that is exactly what happened in the last three halvings, and I expect [it] will be happening next year,” PlanB said.

Musk's Cyborg (MUSKCYB) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Musk’s Cyborg could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.



Musk’s Cyborg (MUSKCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because MUSKCYB has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Musk’s Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin.



Musk’s Cyborg launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Musk’s Cyborg on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Cyborg by entering its contract address – zA67dhDYz4AzQ2rtfySpq7SNCo8aopw64AjuDbGfo6q – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.

Industry Pushback Leads Matter Labs to Drop ZK Trademark


Matter Labs, the entity behind Ethereum layer-2 (L2) scaling solution zkSync, has dropped its attempt to trademark the term “ZK.”
The decision came after leading researchers and community members criticized the move.
Strong Opposition from Industry Experts and the Community

After facing intense criticism, Matter Labs announced on June 2 via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that they would withdraw all trademark applications related to ZK. The company acknowledged the challenge of establishing a group perceived as neutral and fair by the global community.

“As a result of these conversations, we decided to drop all trademark applications for the term ‘ZK.’ These discussions came down to one important fact: it would be impossible to agree on a group of people perceived as credibly neutral by nearly everyone. What could have worked for Ethereum would not necessarily work for the entire world,” Matter Labs wrote.

Read more: What Is zkSync?
Matter Labs initially said it applied for ZK-related trademark applications in nine countries to claim “zero-knowledge.” Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology uses cryptographic protocols to allow one party to prove a statement’s truth to another without revealing any specific information about the statement itself, ensuring privacy and security.
The company argued the application aimed to ensure ZK can be used freely in the context of “zkSync,” “ZK Stack,” and other firm-related names. However, efforts to solidify its ownership over ZK technology sparked significant criticism from the crypto community.
Several prominent figures in the ZK technology industry issued a joint public letter to address their concerns about Matter Labs. In the letter, they emphasized the importance of keeping ZK technology for the public good. They argued that commercializing such a fundamental technology would go against the principles of freedom and openness that the crypto industry stands for.

“ZK shouldn’t be a trademark of a corporation: it should rather be accessible to all. Those of us that work on ZK technology understand that we are standing on the shoulders of giants, of researchers and engineers that created and developed the technology that we use. In return, we are asked to contribute back to a body of knowledge that is owned by the collective, not by a single corporation,” the public letter reads.


The letter’s signatories included Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali, co-inventors of ZK proofs. Other key industry leaders, like Eli Ben-Sasson, CEO of StarkWare, and Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, also endorsed the letter.
The disagreement over Matter Labs’ trademark applications resonated deeply within the broader crypto community. Data from the Web3 information platform Kaito showed a significant dip in the sentiment analytics score for zkSync, reflecting the community’s negative response in the last few days of May.

Despite the backlash, zkSync is one of the most popular L2 solutions in the Ethereum ecosystem. Growthepie data reveals that zkSync has 767,730 weekly active addresses, representing a 10.2% share of total L2 addresses.

Matter Labs Trademark Application Now Withdrawn Amid ZK Community Controversy - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Matter Labs trademark applications for “ZK” have been withdrawn after backlash from the ZK community.



Leading ZK figures, including co-inventors of ZK proofs and Polygon leaders, condemned the move.

Matter Labs Trademark Application Now Withdrawn Amid ZK Community Controversy 4



Matter Labs Trademark Applications Now Withdrawn



The Matter Labs trademark application withdrawal decision was made after significant backlash from leading figures in the zero-knowledge (ZK) community, who argued that ZK technologies should remain a public good accessible to all.



The controversy began when Matter Labs trademark applications were filed for “ZK” in nine countries, asserting exclusive intellectual property rights over the term “zero-knowledge.” Notable critics included Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali, co-inventors of ZK proofs, and leaders from Polygon and StarkWare, such as Sandeep Nailwal and Brendan Farmer, and Eli Ben-Sasson. 



They collectively issued a statement condemning Matter Labs’ actions, emphasizing that ZK should not be monopolized by any single corporation and must remain a public good. They also warned that going through with the trademark would alienate Matter Labs from the ZK community.




The trademark controversy emerged just as zkSync was preparing for a highly anticipated airdrop in mid-June. Coinciding with Polyhedra’s use of the ZKJ ticker for its own token listing further complicated matters. Polyhedra, Polygon, and StarkWare reiterated that ZK should not be a corporate trademark but should continue serving as a public resource.



Matter Labs Responds to Community Backlash



In response to the criticism, Matter Labs announced on June 2 via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that it would abandon its trademark efforts. The company acknowledged the difficulty in establishing a neutral body to manage such trademarks globally and recognized that what might work for Ethereum wouldn’t necessarily apply universally.



Matter Labs emphasized that its intent was to protect the term “ZK” within the scope of its projects, such as ZK Sync and ZK Stack, without restricting its broader use in the community. Despite this, the firm conceded to the community’s concerns and decided to drop all trademark applications.

Crypto Analyst Says Historic Move Imminent for Bitcoin, Predicts Steep and Rapid Rallies for BTC - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto strategist known for macro Bitcoin calls thinks that BTC is gearing up for a big price explosion en route to a blow-off top.
Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 456,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s trading range on the five-day chart is at its tightest level in eight years.










A tight trading range in a bullish trend suggests that buying activity is inching closer to sellers’ desired price level, causing price compression that often leads to a breakout. TechDev uses logarithmic Bollinger bands to quantify Bitcoin’s volatility history.
Says TechDev,
“Historic move imminent.
Bitcoin’s five-day bullish compression has reached its highest level in eight years.” 
Source: TechDev/X
As Bitcoin’s trading range becomes narrow, TechDev says the ensuing breakout will likely lead to steep and rapid rallies. The analyst highlights the BTC versus M1 money supply chart, which he says recently witnessed a “textbook breakout.”
According to TechDev, the breakout suggests that Bitcoin will ignite a parabolic surge and end this cycle with a blow-off top similar to what happened during the 2017, 2015 and 2013 bull markets.
“Significant.
Bitcoin has only seen blow-off tops after breakouts against M1 money supply.
And the longer it’s consolidated, the longer it’s run.
This breakout follows the longest consolidation yet.
In fact, it represents a textbook breakout of a five-year broadening wedge.
The last five years have been corrective against M1. BTC is once again impulsive against it for the first time since 2017.
We’ve never seen a Bitcoin breakout like this one.” 
Source: TechDev/X
M1 money supply tracks the amount of liquidity sloshing in the US financial system by summing up all physical money including coins and currency, demand deposits, traveler’s checks and other checkable deposits.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $69,060, up more than 1% in the past day.

Global non-fungible token (NFT) sales totaled US$604 million in May, the lowest monthly performance since last October and the first month this year with sales below US$1 billion.



Ethereum, the world’s leading blockchain for NFT sales with a historic sales volume of over US$43 billion, had US$164 million in sales last month, its lowest since September.



The network must look even further back in time to match its latest number of unique buyers. 



Last month, Ethereum had 56,914 unique buyers, according to CryptoSlam data, the blockchain’s lowest NFT buyer count since June 2021.

	
	
	
	


The NFT sales slump was also apparent on the Bitcoin network, which had US$160 million in monthly sales, the lowest since October. It saw a decline in both buyers and sellers, recording the lowest count this year.



While the sales slump was evident in most major blockchains, Solana bucked the trend in terms of activity. 



Solana had US$93 million in monthly sales, the first time the blockchain recorded under US$100 million since last November. 



Solana set new records for monthly unique buyers and sellers, with 346,229 and 594,555 addresses respectively. 

	
	
	

	


However, the network’s average NFT price is falling. Its US$37.8 average monthly sales value is the lowest this year.

Can Solana reignite 'Solana Summer' amid price stagnation? - AMBCrypto



SOL is currently consolidating, trading between $165 and $190.
SOL needs to decisively break past the 200-day moving average to confirm a continuation of its bullish trend.

Solana [SOL] has been the cryptocurrency market’s best performer in the past year. Solana’s memecoins have been major catalysts of this bull cycle, and the crypto community is even calling this summer “Solana Summer.”
 However, as of press time, SOL hasn’t seen an increase in over a week.

Solana’s struggle
The consistent trading range for SOL prices between $165 and $190 over several days highlights a consolidation phase.
The derivatives data for SOL reveals a mix of increasing interest and declining trading volumes, reflecting a cautious yet attentive trading environment.
Source: Coinglass
Interestingly, the data on ‘rekt’ (losses from liquidated positions) shows minimal losses on short positions in the last hour, suggesting that downward price movements were not severe enough to trigger massive short liquidations. 
In other words, the bulls are still majorly in control.
Source: Coinglass
Turning our attention to social volume data from Santiment, we see massive spikes, particularly around March. It likely had to do with Bitcoin breaking two all-time highs that month. 
Source: Santiment
However, in recent days, there’s been a noticeable decline in social volume. The Solana Fear and Greed Index presents a neutral sentiment at 45%. 
Source: CFGI
SOL’s price is currently hovering just above its 50-day moving average (MA50), suggesting a tentative hold in bullish territory but struggling to maintain upward momentum. 
The 200-day moving average (MA200) sits slightly above the current price, serving as a possible resistance zone that SOL needs to breach to stage a bullish takeover.
Source: TradingView
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) near the midpoint (around 47) aligns with this consolidation.

Solana must break past the $190 level to turn the current resistance into support and initiate a stronger rally.
All in all, we see a market that is hesitantly bullish but not fully committed, likely due to SOL’s recent performance plateau. This could lead to continued consolidation until a new catalyst either confirms a bullish continuation or initiates a bearish reversal.

Pepe Loves Solana (PEPELSOL) Memecoin to Explode 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Solana (PEPELSOL) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Pepe Loves Solana (PEPELSOL), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PEPELSOL will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Pepe Loves Solana.



Currently, Pepe Loves Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PEPELSOL on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Solana by entering its contract address – 5wjHhZyWzpCgCr7DtSwctAEH8ujGkJYuyXG9DeQKnX6R – in the receiving field.



PEPELSOL currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Whales Transfer Trillions of SHIB Tokens, Triggering Price Fluctuations and Strategic Burns in the Crypto Market



                    

Recent data highlights significant activities involving Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, with large holders or “whales” moving trillions of tokens to various cryptocurrency exchanges. 



From mid-May to the end of the month, the volume of SHIB on trading platforms escalated from 144 trillion to over 147.5 trillion coins.




This transfer of over four trillion SHIB, valued at approximately $103 million, suggests notable market behaviors. 



On May 29, a significant price fluctuation was observed as SHIB’s price spiked to $0.000029, marking a 21% increase. 



This peak was followed by a decline of 12.16%, likely influenced by substantial sell-offs. The latest trading data shows SHIB at around $0.00002584.




The Shibburn tracking platform has also reported an uptick in SHIB burning activities. 



In recent efforts, nearly 9.85 million SHIB were sent to irretrievable addresses in 13 transactions. 



Notable among these were burns of 2.92 million, 2 million, and 1.5 million SHIB. 



These actions are part of an ongoing effort by the SHIB community to reduce the circulating supply and potentially boost the token’s value.

Highlighting the history of such activities, three years ago, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin performed a significant burn of 410 trillion SHIB, a move that decisively impacted the SHIB ecosystem. 



This event took place in 2021 after Buterin received half of the total SHIB supply from its anonymous creator, Ryoshi. 



Buterin decided to destroy most of these tokens, allocating the remainder—90 trillion SHIB—to a crypto charity supporting pandemic relief in India. 



This monumental burn is often mentioned as a crucial moment that enhanced SHIB’s reputation in the cryptocurrency market.



In summary, the recent movements of SHIB by whales and the community’s burning initiatives represent strategic maneuvers aimed at affecting the token’s market dynamics. 



As the cryptocurrency environment evolves, these activities are expected to continually influence SHIB’s valuation and its standing in the digital asset realm.

Shiba Inu Team Urges 'Extreme Caution', Here's Why


								The Shiba Inu team issued a stern warning against a rising tide of fraudulent activities targeting the Shibarium platform. Digarch (@Digarch) posted via X, “SHIBARMY extreme caution is advised in these volatile times,” and referred to DaVinci, a prominent member of the Shiba Inu team. He communicated his warning through a series of posts on Discord, addressing the entire Shibarium community.
Shiba Inu Users Must Be Very Vigilant
DaVinci’s initial message detailed the new sophisticated tactics employed by fraudsters: “It has come to our attention that deceitful individuals are launching tokens falsely claiming involvement with Shiba developers and the future of Shibarium. These malicious actors have now shifted tactics, moving from the misuse of Ryoshi Research mediums to the exploitation of Shiba State and Canine code.”
Fraudsters have reportedly escalated their schemes by associating themselves with the official Shiba site, shib.io, using its address in their promotional videos to lend unwarranted credibility.

In response to these activities, DaVinci stressed the importance of vigilance and informed decision-making: “We urge you to exercise caution and conduct comprehensive research before engaging with any tokens. To be clear, Treat has not been launched yet. Any tokens claiming association with it are attempting to deceive and defraud the community.”
One of the core challenges highlighted by this incident is the decentralized nature of Shibaswap, the platform’s native decentralized exchange, which inherently limits the ability of the Shiba Inu team to directly intervene and ban fraudulent tokens. Despite this, the team is actively taking steps to publicly denounce these scams and discourage community members from engaging with them.
Expanding on the need for critical evaluation, DaVinci posted a follow-up message emphasizing the dangers of blindly following influential personalities within the Shibarium ecosystem. “I’ve seen too many projects that receive glowing endorsements from well-known X personalities only to collapse later. This underscores a fundamental truth: the longevity and resilience of a project are key indicators of its foundation. If a project can’t withstand a few months, it likely wasn’t built on a solid foundation,” he explained.

DaVinci further cautioned against recurrent patterns of failure observed in some project leaders, indicating potential red flags for investors: “Be cautious of individuals who repeatedly fail with one project and quickly move on to launch another. This pattern should raise red flags. Ask yourself: Does the new project have what it takes to succeed? Is there genuine demand? Is the community robust and engaged? Is there sufficient funding for sustainable development?”
He advised the Shibarium users to assess projects based on technical merits, including scalability, security protocols, and the feasibility of their roadmaps. The ability of the team to navigate the complex landscape of blockchain technology and its commitment to the project are critical for success.
DaVinci concluded his advisory by reminding the community of the inherent risks of cryptocurrency investments: “Remember, investing in crypto is a long-term game. Be mindful of the risks and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Your due diligence and prudent decision-making are paramount to navigating this volatile space successfully.”
At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002474.

Binance Token Delistings Signal Shift in Crypto Exchange Standards


							

Binance has decided to delist and stop the trading of OMG, WAVES, WNXM, and XEM pairs.



The platform’s decision follows a periodical review that verifies certain factors and assures the standards of tokens.



The exchange has stopped the cash payment feature in its Indian branch, aligning with the government’s regulatory requirements.




Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has decided to delist several tokens, including OmiseGo (OMG), Waves (WAVES), Wrapped NXM (WNXM), and NEM (XEM). According to Binance’s official announcement, the exchange will remove all spot and margin trading pairs for these tokens on June 17, 2024.



Binance periodically reviews the digital assets listed on its platform. The exchange verifies certain factors to ensure that tokens meet a high level of standard and industry requirements. These factors include development activity, commitment, trading volume and liquidity, regulatory adherence, and public communication. Binance added:




 “When a coin or token no longer meets these standards or the industry landscape changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it. Our priority is to ensure the best services and protections for our users while continuing to adapt to evolving market dynamics.” 




The specific trading pairs being removed from Binance are:




OMG/USDT



WAVES/BTC



WAVES/ETH



WAVES/TRY



WAVES/USDT



WNXM/USDT



XEM/USDT.




The exchange announced that deposits of these tokens will not be credited to user accounts after June 18. Additionally, the platform will not support withdrawals of these tokens after September 18, 2024.



Meanwhile, Binance India closed its cash payment feature, aligning with the government’s insistence on stricter regulatory compliance. Binance’s move aims to mitigate the risks of peer-to-peer cash transactions, as noted by Purushottam Anand, founder of Crypto Legal, a Bengaluru-based blockchain and crypto-focused law firm. Anand said, “P2P cash transactions, with or without the involvement of any exchange, expose parties to serious physical and financial risk.” He added:




 “There have been cases where traders have been physically assaulted and forced to transfer their virtual assets or hand over cash during physical meetings. Victims hesitate in filing criminal complaints due to regulatory uncertainty regarding the legality of such cash transactions.”




Binance’s regular token review and amendments demonstrate the platform’s commitment to regulatory norms. The exchange prioritizes the security and privacy of its clients, avoiding any potential breach of security laws.

Solana's Answer To Dogecoin Is Correcting But Analyst Says It Could Be Confirmation That Bonk Has More Upside (CORRECTED) - Benzinga

Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of Bonk coin.Dog-themed memecoin Bonk BONK/USD has corrected since hitting its peak last week, but an analyst feels such retests are great confirmation signals for further upside.What Happened: On Sunday, prominent cryptocurrency trader Rekt Capital took to X, formerly Twitter, to express his views on the trajectory of the Solana SOL/USD-based token. He suggested that the cryptocurrency could see a bit more downside in June, which could potentially lead to a macro retest of its previous breakout range.This viewpoint comes in the wake of BONK’s continued slide ever since it recorded its all-time high of $0.000043 last week. See Also: Massive Shiba Inu Burn Ignites Hope For Price Recovery Despite Market DownturnA few days ago, Rekt Capital noticed a pattern in BONK’s trajectory in which it retests old range highs as support after breaking out.“Post-breakout retests don’t always happen, especially when the buy-side pressure is strong, but such retests are great confirmation signals for further upside,” the analyst had said.Why It Matters: Despite the pullback, BONK’s recent performance has been noteworthy. The coin was one of the biggest market gainers over the last month, and the third-best performing memecoin in the period, with gains of more than 23%.In doing so, BONK outperformed senior dog-themed cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USDThe number of traders taking bullish long positions for BONK in the derivatives market started to increase in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass, reflecting confidence in the coin’s upsides. Price Action: At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.00003232, following a 3.5% drop in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Image via ShutterstockRead Next: Roaring Kitty’s’ New Social Post Pushes GameStop-Themed Crypto By 200%, Kitty-Themed Coins SurgeDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

Six Things to Watch This Week as Bitcoin's Price Inches Toward $69K


																This is the last week of employment data before the June 12 Federal Reserve meeting kicks off.
Investors will examine several economic reports that will be incorporated into the Fed’s future policy considerations. Friday’s crucial job market reports will be one to watch.
Crypto markets have gone through the weekend with very little movement either way for most digital assets.
Economic Events June 3-7
Monday will see May’s ISM Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index) report which shows business conditions in the U.S. manufacturing sector.
This data is considered a reliable leading indicator for assessing the state of the U.S. economy and can be used to help anticipate changing economic trends.
The services sector may be considered more important as it contributes over 70% of the U.S. GDP. On Wednesday, the May ISM Services PMI will be released, which will also serve as a leading indicator of changes in economic conditions.


Friday’s Payrolls and Unemployment reports from the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics provide the number of new jobs created during the previous month, along with the percentage of active employment seekers.
These are the most significant reports of the week as policymakers follow these figures which are strongly associated with the overall health of the economy. The Fed also pays close attention to the labor market changes when determining its policy decisions.
“It will be key to see whether the US labor market continues cooling,” commented Global Macro Investor before adding:
“Wall Street analysts expect 180,000 new jobs to be added and the unemployment rate to stay at 3.9%. Meanwhile, revised US labor market data already points to a recession.”
Crypto Market Outlook
It is unlikely that this week’s employment and economic reports will have much of an impact on crypto markets, which are more closely affected by CPI inflation reports.
Total market capitalization hasn’t moved much over the past few days and remains at $2.68 trillion.
However, Bitcoin prices started to move upwards during the Monday morning Asian trading session, adding 1.4% on the day to reach $68,619 at the time of writing. It has remained tightly rangebound since it failed to top $70,000 again in late May.
Ethereum had recovered minor losses to return to $3,800 and the altcoins were mostly flat aside from Toncoin which added 10% over the past 24 hours.

Exploring the Impact: How a $500,000 Bitcoin Could Skyrocket Shiba Inu's Market Value



                    

The cryptocurrency market, with its frequent and often dramatic fluctuations, presents an intriguing scenario of Bitcoin potentially reaching $500,000 and the ensuing effects on altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB).



 This analysis delves into the implications of such a milestone for Bitcoin and its ripple effects on SHIB’s pricing structure.




Bitcoin is regarded as the benchmark for the digital currency landscape, often influencing trends across the cryptocurrency market. 



Historical data suggests that spikes in Bitcoin’s price precede similar movements in altcoins. 



With Bitcoin having already surpassed its previous peak by hitting $73,000 in March 2024, speculation about its future trajectory continues to captivate analysts and investors alike.




Several prominent industry experts have voiced their predictions, creating a broad spectrum of possibilities for Bitcoin’s peak. 



Mike Novogratz and Robert Kiyosaki suggest a future price of $100,000. 



More conservative estimates by figures like Richard Teng and Standard Chartered place it around $150,000.

Meanwhile, Raoul Pal envisions it reaching $250,000, and Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest proposes a bold forecast of $1 million within the next six years, a sentiment echoed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.



In a scenario where Bitcoin reaches $500,000, its market capitalization would soar from $1.330 trillion to an impressive $9.85 trillion. 



This growth would likely catalyze significant gains for altcoins, including Shiba Inu. 



If SHIB’s market cap were to increase by 650.7%, similar to Bitcoin’s, it would climb from its current $14.3 billion to around $93 billion.



Under these conditions, Shiba Inu’s price could theoretically rise to $0.000166 per token, up from its current price of $0.000024, based on its circulating supply of approximately 589 trillion tokens. 



This price adjustment would be necessary to achieve the projected market cap of $93 billion, highlighting the potential scale of impact a high Bitcoin valuation could have on smaller cryptocurrencies like SHIB.



However, it’s important to stress the speculative nature of these projections. 



Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and numerous external factors such as technological advancements, regulatory changes, and shifts in market sentiment could dramatically alter SHIB’s price trajectory. 



The interconnectedness of Bitcoin’s movements with the broader crypto market adds another layer of complexity to these predictions, making any forecast highly conjectural.

US Senator Ted Cruz Has Officially Become a Bitcoin (BTC) Miner


																U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a long-time supporter of crypto, has announced the purchase of three application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) Bitcoin miners, initiating mining operations in Iraan, Texas.
Notably, Cruz has been an outspoken advocate for pro-crypto legislation.
Ted Cruz Joins Bitcoin Miners
In the announcement, made on X, the Senator said that he had joined the ranks of Texas Bitcoin miners, a post that was accompanied by a picture of his mining setup.


Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel praised Cruz’s initiative, welcoming him to the Bitcoin mining community. He also highlighted his contribution to improving network security.




Texas supports Bitcoin mining due to its business-friendly laws and affordable energy resources, including wind, solar, and natural gas. The environment has increased Bitcoin mining in smaller towns like Iraan, creating jobs, boosting energy infrastructure investments, and generating tax revenue.
A financial disclosure revealed that Cruz bought Bitcoin worth between $15,000 and $50,000 on January 25, when the price was around $37,000. With Bitcoin currently trading at $69,000, his investment stands well in the green, assuming he hasn’t sold his holdings.
Meanwhile, Cruz is not the only lawmaker embracing crypto. Several senators have disclosed their crypto holdings, reflecting growing political support. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has allocated funds in Bitcoin, purchasing approximately $250,000 worth, making her the most heavily invested U.S. lawmaker in the asset.
Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, another crypto advocate, revealed his investments in Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF.
Ted Cruz’s Crypto Advocacy
In 2021, Ted Cruz opposed a crypto tax proposal in the Senate’s infrastructure bill, which aimed to raise about $28 billion in new tax revenue over a decade. He also introduced a resolution for merchants and vendors on Capitol Hill to accept cryptocurrency payments.
Cruz is also opposing the Federal Reserve’s development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). He has consistently introduced legislation to prevent the Fed from creating a CBDC, citing concerns about privacy, government overreach, and financial surveillance.
Meanwhile, Oklahoma lawmakers passed House Bill 1600 on May 30, offering tax credits to digital asset mining operations. Pending the governor’s signature, the bill aims to exempt commercial mining machinery, including servers, computers, and transformers, from taxes.
The Oklahoma Bitcoin Association emphasized the bill’s significance, stating it would make state power prices highly competitive for miners and attract investments to revitalize rural areas. The bill is expected to optimize Oklahoma’s electricity grid and reduce power costs for residents.

Toncoin: Does the surge in TON holders signal a shift in market sentiment? - AMBCrypto



The number of retail and large TON investors increased, triggering a notable price jump.
Open Interest climbed, indicating strength for the uptrend.

A renewed round of increases has hit Toncoin [TON], and this time it was not limited to the price or market cap.  Instead, AMBCrypto found that the number of addresses holding TON across every group increased.
According to on-chain data from Santiment, the number of holders with 0.01 to 1 TON in their portfolio jumped. The same goes for the whales who own 100,000 to 1 million tokens.
This is a rare sight to behold for any project. For Toncoin, it is good news and indicates there are more participants with the belief that TON’s price could trade higher.
Source: Santiment
All hands on deck in TON support
Three days ago, AMBCrypto reported how whales had flocked to the Toncoin network. Little did anyone know that the retail cohort was also looking to the cryptocurrency as a haven.
Interestingly, TON seemed to be in the mood to reward this loyalty. At press time, the price of the token was $ 6.59, representing an impressive 5.01% increase in the last 24 hours.
As a result, the total supply in profit jumped. As of this writing, the percentage of TON in profit was 79.04%.  A few weeks back, almost 100% of the Toncoin holders were in the green.
Source: Santiment
The selling pressure the token experienced was one of the reasons the ratio declined. But with the recent uptrend, TON could be walking its way back to $7.65.
However, there is a chance that Toncoin could trade higher as speculation of an altcoin season continues to spread.
The term “altcoin season” refers to the period when non-Bitcoin [BTC] cryptocurrencies experience a notable price surge more than BTC.
Can the price hit $15?
In this instance, at least 75% of the top 50 altcoins should outperform the king coin. If this is the case, TON’s return to $7 could be child’s play as the price might head for a double-digit value.
In addition to the metric above, AMBCrypto looked at TON’s Open Interest (OI). Open Interest is the value of all open contracts in the market
When the OI decreases, it means that a lot of traders are closing their existing positions. This takes money out of the market and could be bearish for the cryptocurrency.
For Toncoin, Coinglass data showed that the OI increased by 11.70% in the last 24 hours. This increase implied that new money was entering the market, and could be bullish for the token.

Should the indicator continue to move higher, TON’s price could surpass its all-time high, and a possible increase to $15 could be possible in the mid-term.
However, holders of the toke might need to watch out. If the OI grows too high, it could be a sign that a change is coming into the market, and selling off at that point could be a good option.

Is This The Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Ever? Analyst Says Yes!


																Crypto analyst TechDev (@TechDev_52) recently shared a detailed chart analysis suggesting that Bitcoin might be on the cusp of its most significant breakout to date. This analysis, backed by historical patterns and technical indicators, points to a potential shift in the market that could lead to unprecedented price levels for Bitcoin.
The chart provided by TechDev illustrates Bitcoin’s price action in USD alongside its price relative to the M1 money supply (BTC/M1). Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited distinct phases of parabolic price increases, known as “blowoff tops,” followed by sharp corrections. These blowoff tops are marked with green check marks on the chart, occurring in 2011, 2013, and 2017. Each of these peaks was followed by significant corrections.

Notably, the 2021 peak did not result in a blowoff top, as indicated by the red cross on the chart. This deviation from historical patterns is significant because it suggests a possible change in market behavior.
TechDev’s chart also highlights a key pattern known as the “descending right-angled broadening formation.” This technical pattern is characterized by a series of lower highs and lower lows, creating a broadening wedge shape. The pattern typically signals a period of consolidation, where the price oscillates within the broadening trend lines before a decisive breakout. The chart shows that Bitcoin has recently broken out of this broadening wedge, indicating a potential shift from a consolidation phase to a new bullish trend.

The analyst commented, “Significant. Bitcoin has only seen blow-off tops after breakouts against M1 money supply. And the longer it’s consolidated, the longer it’s run. This breakout follows the longest consolidation yet. In fact, it represents a textbook breakout of a 5 year broadening wedge. The last 5 years have been corrective against M1. BTC is once again impulsive against it for the first time since 2017. We’ve never seen a Bitcoin breakout like this one.”
Bitcoin Could Outpace The 2021 Cycle
Another critical aspect of TechDev’s analysis is the breakout of Bitcoin against the M1 money supply. The M1 money supply includes physical currency and checkable deposits, representing the most liquid forms of money in the economy. TechDev points out that Bitcoin has broken out against M1 for the first time since March 2017. This breakout is particularly significant because it suggests that Bitcoin’s recent price increase is driven by intrinsic demand rather than merely an increase in the money supply.

TechDev comments on this breakout, stating: “You’re looking at the first breakout of Bitcoin against M1 money supply since March 2017 when it went historically parabolic for 9 months. Comparisons and trend projections involving 2021 may end up dramatically underestimating things. One interpretation: In 2021 BTC was carried to new USD highs by increased money supply. In 2024 it’s gotten there on its own demand (and thus broke out against M1). Add the anticipated M1 growth this time and we likely see BTC outpace expectations based in part on 2021.”
TechDev’s analysis underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s performance relative to macroeconomic indicators like the M1 money supply. By breaking out against M1, Bitcoin demonstrates strong intrinsic demand, which is a bullish signal for future price movements. The historical patterns of blowoff tops following similar breakouts suggest that Bitcoin could be entering a new phase of price discovery, potentially leading to new all-time highs.
At press time, BTC traded at $69,032.

MANTRA debuts a new RWA savings vault with Ondo


    MANTRA, a real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, has unveiled a new RWA savings vault, an on-chain product backed by Ondo’s USDY, as per the information shared with Finbold on June 3. 



The new project brings together two prominent players in the RWA sector to bolster liquidity for RWA tokenization, a facet of decentralized finance (DeFi) that has recently garnered considerable institutional interest.



High-quality yields with a new multi-chain vault 



To mark the new liquidity milestone, MANTRA and the Ondo Foundation are incentivizing a multi-chain vault. 







Users who contribute USD Coin (USDC) to the vault will gain immediate access to high-quality yields. 



Those who stay invested until MANTRA Chain’s mainnet launch will also receive ONDO tokens and mainnet OM coins along with the underlying yield. 



The vault is expected to open to the public in June on Ethereum (ETH) and Base.



Institutional-grade DeFi composability



MANTRA’s mission is to merge DeFi composability with institutional-grade finance on-chain. 



USDY’s features, such as over-collateralization, third-party oversight, and institutional-grade investor protections, make it a cornerstone asset for the growing RWA ecosystem.



To manage returns effectively as participation increases, MANTRA and the Ondo Foundation have designed a ratcheting schedule of increasing rewards distributed as community participation milestones are achieved.



Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance, expressed his enthusiasm about the project, stating, 




“We are excited to see the USDY vault launching on MANTRA, furthering our mission to bring institutional-grade assets to the world. This yield-bearing vault is an exciting step in our journey to bridge traditional finance and decentralized finance at scale.”
— Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance




John Patrick Mullin, co-founder and CEO of MANTRA, further commented on the plan to create the most liquid Layer-1 blockchain built specifically for RWAs:




“Enabling Ondo USDY, the market-leading tokenized US treasury product, marks a significant expansion of our ecosystem. Having a fungible interest-bearing base layer of liquidity via USDY is critical to enhancing our on-chain liquidity profile. This cutting-edge product launch is part of MANTRA Chain’s broader strategy to work closely with all leading RWA projects to create the most liquid Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for RWAs.”
— John Patrick Mullin, co-founder and CEO of MANTRA




The launch of MANTRA’s new blockchain



MANTRA’s new blockchain, set to launch later this year, will feature Ondo’s flagship interest-bearing tokenized note, USDY, as its genesis asset. 



USDY offers holders exposure to short-term US Treasury yields while retaining the utility of stablecoins. 



Not being registered under the US Securities Act, USDY is not available for sale in the US or to US citizens.

Second term for the pro-Bitcoin President of El Salvador

The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, a supporter of Bitcoin, has been sworn in for a second term. 
Starting a new five-year period, Bukele has received the support of the cryptocurrency industry for his leadership, which is positioning the country as a “world leader”. Let’s see all the details below. 

El Salvador continues the Bitcoin revolution: President Bukele is re-elected
As anticipated, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, a supporter of Bitcoin (BTC), has been sworn in for a second term presidential of five years, after a landslide victory in February. 
This event has generated great enthusiasm in the cryptocurrency sector, thanks to its favorable position towards Bitcoin. The crypto commentator Cory Bates in a post on June 1st stated: 
“It is the demonstration of his commitment: best wishes for another five years. God bless El Salvador.”
Also Pete Rizzo, an expert in crypto media, commented: 
“Exactly five years ago, Nayib Bukele became President of El Salvador. Since then, the country has become a world leader, a symbol of freedom, security, and innovation. The first Bitcoin president.”
The inauguration ceremony took place on June 1st at the National Palace of San Salvador, where Bukele highlighted the significant drop in crime during his term, attributing the credit to the tough crackdown on criminal gangs: 
“In two years, we resolved a situation that had remained unresolved for over half a century, with more than 70,000 terrorists controlling the country and causing more victims than the armed conflict.”
In addition to the support of the citizens for his efforts in the fight against crime, Bukele has also gained the support of the global cryptocurrency industry for the decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.
In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, following the approval of the Bitcoin law. However, initially, more than three-quarters of Salvadorans were skeptical, according to a Reuters survey from July 2021.
The majority of Bukele’s party consolidates power in El Salvador
According to the February data, the Nuove Idee party obtained 54 of the 60 seats in the legislature, giving Nayib Bukele the political power necessary to continue leading the country.
The results come from the elections of February 4. On February 5, Bukele claimed victory before the official announcement, asserting that the Nuevas Ideas party had obtained 58 seats instead of 54.
Recently, reports have emerged suggesting that Argentina might follow El Salvador’s example in adopting Bitcoin and other plans related to cryptocurrencies.
Not by chance, the Argentine securities regulatory authority, the National Securities Commission (CNV), met with the National Digital Resources Commission (CNAD) of El Salvador to discuss the adoption and regulation of cryptocurrencies in the two countries.
During the meeting on May 23, the president of the CNV Roberto Silva, the vice president of the CNV Patricia Boedo, and the president of the CNAD Juan Carlos Reyes discussed El Salvador’s experience with Bitcoin. 
The officials shared approaches and concepts on the use of cryptocurrencies in global economies, focusing in particular on the case of Bitcoin in El Salvador. 
Silva highlighted that El Salvador has not only emerged as a leader in the adoption of Bitcoin, but has also excelled in the broader cryptocurrency sector. 
He also emphasized the importance of the insights from the CNAD, which supervises and regulates the digital asset market in El Salvador, stating the following: 
“We want to strengthen ties with the Republic of El Salvador and, therefore, we will explore the possibility of signing collaboration agreements with them.”
The vice president of the CNV Boedo, who in March visited El Salvador to participate in meetings on market development, emphasized the crucial role of El Salvador’s experience in the cryptocurrency sector.
On the other hand, Reyes, an official from El Salvador, added:  
“Argentina is a pioneer in technology and the National Securities Commission wants to work with the industry efficiently to create appropriate regulation.”

Roaring Kitty Reveals $180 Million GME Bet: Meme Coins Surge


GameStop (GME) stock soared by 19% in overnight trading on Robinhood following a revelation by Keith Gill, famously known as “The Roaring Kitty.” 
On Reddit’s “DeepFuckingValue” account, Gill disclosed that he holds a notional value of over $180 million in GME shares and call options. This marked his first Reddit post since April 2021.
Crypto Traders Bet on GME Meme Coins

The post included a screenshot showing Gill’s investment of $115.7 million for 5 million GME shares and an additional $65.7 million in call options. This bold wager hinges on GameStop’s share price reaching at least $20 by June 21. 
Although his portfolio showed over $9.3 million gain from the shares, his options currently reflect a loss nearing $2.5 million.

Gill’s strategic disclosure also triggered a significant rally in the meme coin sector. Specifically, it impacted the Solana-based GME meme coin. This digital asset witnessed a 220% surge in value, pushing its market capitalization beyond $85 million within 24 hours. 
Market enthusiasts on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) speculate that GME will surge further. 

“If the rumors I’m hearing are true, this might be a one-off event in the history of Solana. We can be looking at a $2-3 billion market capitalization,” a crypto enthusiast, G-Chairman said.

Furthermore, the sentiment around meme investments has visibly intensified. Community members recall the trading restrictions during the 2021 GME short squeeze. Consequently, investors, wary of potential similar restrictions, are diversifying their bets to include meme coins like GME on the Solana blockchain.

Moreover, the hype has not been limited to GME-related assets. Other kitty-themed cryptocurrencies, including Kitty AI, have also seen their values double in response to the current market excitement.
This surge mirrors the broader impact of Gill’s influence, reminiscent of the meme stock and meme coin rallies spurred by Gill’s return on X in mid-May. Then, GameStop and AMC shares leaped over 70%.
Today, Gill posted a green UNO reverse card on X, adding an element of mystery. This move is typical of his cryptic communication style, which often precedes significant market movements.

Analyzing BNB's bullish pennant: Will it lead to a price surge? - AMBCrypto



Market sentiment around BNB has improved over the last few days.
Most indicators looked bullish on the coin.

After a week-long decline, BNB finally came back on track as the coin’s daily chart turned green. Notably, while that happened, the coin’s price was consolidating inside a bull pattern, which might allow the coin to reach new highs in the coming days. 
A bull pattern on BNB’s chart
According to CoinmarketCap, bears dominated the previous week as the coin’s price dropped to $587 on the 30th of May.
However, bulls stepped up in the last 24 hours and pushed the coin’s price up by over 1.4%. At the time of writing, the coin was trading at $613.41 with a market capitalization of over $90 billion, making it the fourth largest crypto. 
Thanks to the recent price uptick, the coin’s weighted sentiment has improved. This clearly shows that bullish sentiment around the coin has increased over the last few days. 
Its social volume also remained relatively high last week, reflecting BNB’s popularity in the crypto space. 
Source: Santiment
While all this happened, a bullish pennant pattern formed on the coin’s daily chart. The coin’s price entered the pattern in March and since then has been consolidating inside it. 
At press time, it was close to testing the upper limit of the pattern. A successful breakout could allow BNB to go above its March high over the coming weeks. 
Source: TradingView
Is a rally possible?
AMBCrypto then analyzed the coin’s on-chain metrics to check the odds of BNB successfully breaking above the bullish pennant pattern.
 As per our analysis of Santiment’s data, BNB’s open interest increased along with its price. Generally, a rise in the metric suggests that the chances of the on-going price trend continuing further are high. 
Nonetheless, BNB’s funding rate increased. As prices tend to move the other way than the funding rate, there is a possibility of BNB turning bearish soon. 
On top of that, BNB’s fear and greed index had a value of 61, meaning that the market was in a “greed” phase. Whenever the metric hits that level, it indicates a possible price correction.

Realistic or not, here’s BNB’s market cap in BTC terms   

We then took a look at the coin’s daily chart to better understand whether a bullish breakout was possible. According to our analysis, technical indicators looked pretty bullish on the coin. 
For example, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick from the neutral mark. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar trend, hinting at a continued price increase.

Evolution of Web3 with AI

Artificial intelligence and Web3 have been two of the most revolutionary technologies of this era. AI has already become a significant part of the central building block of the world’s software. According to PwC estimates, AI will contribute a staggering $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, resulting in a 14% increase in global GDP. As we as a generation are on the cusp of a new technological era, the transition to Web3, AI, will play a significant role in shaping the digital world we will live in.
AI will revolutionize the Web3 world by adding remarkable automation, personalization, security, advanced data analytics, and improved smart contracts. Integrating AI with Web3 will redefine how Web3 works by focusing on what’s best for users.
Let’s delve into each topic one by one to learn more about the evolution of web3 with AI, starting with what is web3.

Are you new to the Web3 ecosystem? Here’s a comprehensive guide about what Web3 is and how it’s different from Web2 by Droomdroom.

What is Web3?

Web3, widely known as web3.0, is the third generation of the World Wide Web. It is a next-generation on the internet that envisions a decentralized, secure, and user-centric digital ecosystem that works on Blockchain technology. 
Web 3.0 is an innovation over Web 2.0. Here, data is controlled by users rather than one giant entity or company, resulting in more privacy and no censorship. Rewards earned are distributed equally among all the stakeholders or users in this case. 
The Main Pillars of Web 3.0
Decentralization 
Decentralization is a core aspect of web3. As Web2 uses HTTP to locate information, web3, being Blockchain-based, stores information at multiple locations across a network. It gives users more data control than big tech giants like Google and Meta. It enables users to sell their data according to their own will.
Connectivity
Information and content are more accessible in Web 3.0 as it’s stored at multiple locations and can be accessed by various devices worldwide.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Web3 will use technologies like NLP ( natural language processing) and semantic web to make their systems more advanced and receptive, like human intelligence.
Web3 will also utilize machine learning, which uses a large amount of data to train algorithms, improving accuracy and results.

Are you new to Web3? Here’s a Comprehensive guide to know all about Blockchain forks by Droomdoom.

What is AI?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by computer systems, capable of performing complex tasks that require reasoning and problem-solving. AI systems run by consuming large amounts of data that are later used to train machine learning algorithms. 
They then analyze the data to find patterns to model their decision-making or predict future states. This type of learning is called supervised learning. But some AI systems learn without supervision, for instance, by playing a video game repeatedly until the system knows every rule and way to win. This type of learning is categorized as unsupervised learning.
There are three cognitive skills on which AI programming is based – reasoning, learning, and self-correction.
Types of Artificial intelligence
Weak AI
Systems designed to perform particular tasks only. Personal assistants, Amazon’s Alexa, and video games are examples of weak AI.
Strong AI 
Systems that can perform tasks that require human intelligence and are more complex and complicated. For example, self-driving cars.
Ways Evolution of Web3 with AI is Made Possible
Automation
AI’s ultra capability to learn and automate tasks can help Web3 users escape tedious and time-consuming tasks. From minting new NFTs to managing digital wallets, AI can seamlessly shoulder these responsibilities and liberate users to focus on more creative tasks.
Personalization
AI can significantly personalize Web3 users’ journeys and make their experiences more customized and engaging by analyzing user data like browsing history and using machine learning algorithms like collaborative and content-based filtering. AI algorithms can generate personalized recommendations and services that align with users’ needs and interests.

Learn 6 helpful strategies to diversify your crypto portfolio using altcoins, maximizing your investment potential, with this comprehensive article.

For example, AI can be used in advertising to make targeted marketing campaigns by analyzing user data to make it appealing and most relatable to individual users, resulting in better advertising and conversion rates.
Data Analysis and Insights 
AI-driven analysis can play a crucial role in developing the Web3 ecosystem. The key aspect of AI analysis is that it can process large amounts of vast, complex, and diverse datasets generated by decentralized platforms, users, transactions, and execution of smart contracts. AI can find uncovered patterns and insights that can contribute highly to the growth and development of the Web3 ecosystem.
Security
AI can play a vital role in enhancing security and trust within the Web3 ecosystem by identifying potential risks, vulnerabilities, threats, or hacks. By proactive detection of any future cyber threats or dangers, AI can help Web3 maintain a secure and safe environment by keeping data private through advanced encryption and anonymization.
Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large data sets to identify future cyber threats, such as phishing attacks or unauthorized access to an account. 
AI can be used for unique protection by providing personalized authentication to each user by analyzing their behavioral patterns or user-specific characteristics like facial features. This will help web3 platforms to become more robust and less vulnerable to fraud and impersonation.
Smart Contracts 
AI implementation can significantly revolutionize the functionality of smart contracts in Web3 by integrating advanced decision-making capabilities and enabling dynamic transactions on any Web3 platform. 
Smart contracts are, like any contract, executed an agreement with terms and conditions written into a code. It does not need any broker or intermediaries to execute the agreement, thus reducing the probability of manipulation and ensuring trust and transparency.

Are you new to the crypto world? Here’s a comprehensive guide on the role of smart contracts in Decentralized Finance. 

What Factors Contribute to WEB3 Adopting ML Technologies From a Top-Doen Approach?
Adopting machine learning (ML) technologies follows a top-down approach mainly due to its complex infrastructure, which needs experts to implement ML technologies into the Web3 ecosystem.
The top-down approach is adopted in Web3 for ML technology for several reasons: 
Technical Complexity
Integration of ML technology in Web3 space requires a deep understanding of both Decentralization Infratech and ML algorithms. Seamless integration of ML technologies in decentralized infrastructure demands expertise as it’s very intricate.
Security and Privacy
Providing security and privacy is one of the primary goals of Web 3.0. Integrating ML technology through a top-down approach allows experts to design and implement ML solutions that align with the core principles of Web3, ensuring that these goals are not compromised.
Scalability and Performance 
Implementing ML technologies requires addressing significant challenges with Web3, including scalability and performance. The top-down approach helps ensure that ML solutions designed are intended to make the Web3 ecosystem more efficient and scalable.
Standardization and Interoperability
For effective adoption of ML technologies across Web3 platforms, standardization and interoperability must be achieved. Top-down adoption allows a more unified approach and promotes collaboration among stakeholders. 
Key Challenges Faced by AI: Web 3.0 as a Solution
With large language models like ChatGPT and Midjourney, we have seen a drastic change in digital content creation and businesses.
While these technologies offer many advantages, such as high-quality content, increased productivity, and efficiency, they also come with many new challenges.
Here, we have uncovered some critical challenges in generated content and potential threats that must be addressed.
Fake Spread of News 
One of the significant problems of AI-generated content is the propagation of fake content. With language models like ChatGPT and Midjourney, producing realistic news articles and pictures is easy, making it more challenging to differentiate from human-written content. Keeping track is more complex as the line between reality and fiction becomes blurred. It can result in a potential collapse in the perception of reality.
Solution
Various tools have been developed to check the content’s origin, with metadata tracking and reverse image searches. Many organizations like factcheck.org are working to burst fake news stories and maintain a trustworthy ecosystem. Blockchain can play a vital role in tracking the authenticity of the content by storing their metadata, the author’s identity with a  timestamp of publication, on a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger where readers can verify the origin of information.
Trust Collapse
The rapid increase in AI-generated content can result in the trust collapse of the public as it becomes harder to look into the authenticity of the content. Trust collapse can raise implications for journalism and businesses that highly run on public trust, only undermining the credibility of the content produced. This makes establishing accountability for any wrongful facts or inaccuracies presented in the range harder. As a result, the public becomes skeptical about any content they come across. 
Solution
Transparency with the origin of the content, such as watermarking or labeling the source, can help. Blockchain can play an important role here as any piece of content stored on Blockchain is verified. by validators, which makes every piece of information stored there unique with the help of hash value allotted to every individual piece of information, which is interlinked with previous information stored, hence making a chain.
Exploitation of Law
AI-generated content can be used to exploit loopholes in laws and regulations. For example, AI can create convincing, deep, fake videos and audio, altering court proceedings and results. 
Solution
Lawmakers should be aware of AI advancements and develop policies and regulations restricting cause mishaps. Collaborative work between AI researchers and Lawmakers will ensure that.
Blackmails and Threats 
AI-generated blackmail can take many forms:  

Deepfakes: AI can generate very realistic videos, images, and audio, which can be used to threaten anyone and put them in compromising situations with the threat of public exposure.
AI-generated threats: AI’s capability of producing personalized content can raise considerable dangers of creating convincing and personalized blackmail, playing on their fears and vulnerabilities. 
Fabricated documents: AI-generated content can be presented as authentic documents, which become more complex to differentiate from the original one. This can result in coercing victims to pay huge ransoms and comply with the blackmailer’s demands.

Solutions
Machine learning algorithms can be trained to identify patterns and commonalities of AI-generated threats and signs of manipulation. To combat AI-generated threats, collaborative work of lawmakers and cybersecurity professionals to detect and restrict any mishaps.
A decentralized reputation system can help users identify trustworthy content and counterparts and promote transparency.

Ethereum exodus: $3 billion ETH leaves crypto exchanges after SEC greenlights spot ETFs


    In just over a week since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), cryptocurrency exchanges have seen substantial ETH outflow, demonstrating the impact of regulatory decisions on market dynamics.



As it happens, since the securities watchdog’s approval of Ethereum spot ETFs on May 23, 2024, approximately 777,000 ETH – valued at around $3 billion – has left crypto exchanges, according to the chart data and observations shared by renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez in an X post on June 2.

Indeed, the Glassnode chart shared by the analyst showcases the massive changes in the total balance of Ethereum on all crypto exchanges, which has witnessed a significant drop in the days following the approval to the areas of around 12.5 million ETH, coinciding with a price increase.







Ethereum price analysis



At press time, the second-largest asset in the crypto sector by market capitalization was trading at the price of $3,821.12, suggesting an increase of 0.75% in the last 24 hours, declining 2.43% across the previous seven days, while advancing 22.94% on its monthly chart.

More recently, this crypto asset has demonstrated significant strength against the market representative and flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, Bitcoin (BTC), reclaiming a key trendline that has been immensely important for more than seven years, as Finbold reported on June 1.



Ethereum ETF effect



As a reminder, the price of Ethereum started to increase on May 20, not long after Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that he and his colleague James Seyffart believed that the chances for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF were 75%, as opposed to the earlier 25%.







In the same period, Martinez also noted that Ethereum whales had bought 110,000 ETH, worth about $341 million at the time, during the 24 hours leading up to his X post on May 20, indicating a major increase in interest from the market’s largest holders in the expectation of the spot ETF approval.



All things considered, the massive withdrawal of Ethereum from exchanges suggests a growing preference among crypto traders and investors to secure their holdings in anticipation of further price growth and reduced selling pressure on exchanges, which is typically a bullish sign.

Bitcoin (BTC) Taps $69K, Binance Coin (BNB) Shoots Up to 3-Month Peak (Market Watch)


																Bitcoin had a quiet weekend with little to no actual movements, but Monday began on a high note as the asset jumped to and above $69,000 for the first time this month.
The altcoins are also slightly in the green. BNB stands out with a 5% increase now, but the asset went even higher earlier this morning.
Bitcoin’s Fight With $69K
Last Monday was also quite positive for the primary cryptocurrency as it pumped from under $69,000 to a weekly high of over $70,500. However, BTC failed to maintain its run and started losing value by the end of the day, especially on Tuesday. The retracement culminated with a price drop to $67,200.
More choppy waters followed, with the most substantial surge on Thursday to $69,500. However, bitcoin was stopped there and was later pushed south to a weekly low of $66,600.
After an immediate recovery that saw BTC jumped to $67,500, the asset calmed there during the weekend and failed to produce any big moves. However, this business week started on a familiar note and bitcoin jumped to just over $69,000.

Crypto Crime Busters: China, UAE Vow to Combat Telecom Fraud and Online Gambling


								In a move signaling a global shift, China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have forged a strategic alliance to combat cybercrime involving cryptocurrency.

Joint Effort Against Crypto Crime
This partnership comes amidst a surge in crypto fraud activity in Hong Kong, highlighting the growing need for international cooperation in the Wild West of digital finance.
The pact, outlined in a joint statement following UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s visit to China, targets specific areas like telecom fraud and online gambling.
This collaborative effort transcends crypto-crime, with both nations vowing to crack down on money laundering, human trafficking, and other illicit activities that could exploit digital assets.
While the statement doesn’t detail specific cryptocurrency regulations, it suggests a coordinated approach to prevent the misuse of these technologies. This could pave the way for a global framework for crypto governance.
But the alliance isn’t solely focused on security concerns. The document emphasizes the potential of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to revolutionize cross-border trade and investment. Both countries plan to deepen their cooperation on CBDC development, building upon a signed Memorandum of Understanding.
Bitcoin is now trading at $68,943. Chart: TradingView
UAE Pioneers Cross-Border CBDC
The UAE’s pioneering role in completing the first-ever cross-border CBDC transaction using the mBridge platform hasn’t gone unnoticed. This landmark 50 million dirham transfer signifies a potential game-changer, offering an alternative to the dominant Swift payment system. Experts believe this could lead to a future with fragmented regional payment networks.
This development aligns with ongoing projects by Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority (HKMA). Their mBridge and e-HKD initiatives are testaments to the growing global interest in CBDCs.
The mBridge project, expected to launch by mid-2024, could offer a faster, cheaper alternative for cross-border transactions, potentially impacting traditional financial institutions.
The China-UAE alliance marks a significant step towards a more regulated and secure cryptocurrency landscape. Their collaboration on CBDCs suggests a future where digital currencies play a central role in international finance.

As the digital asset ecosystem evolves, this partnership could model a future where innovation and security coexist.

$3 Billion ETH Withdrawn After Spot Ethereum ETF Approval


Significant movement has occurred in the crypto market since the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) preliminary approval for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
A recent analysis by CryptoQuant highlights that unidentified entities have withdrawn over 800,000 Ethereum (ETH) from crypto exchanges, valued at approximately $3 billion.
Surge in Ethereum Withdrawals Signals Investor Optimism

Burak Kesmeci, an analyst at CryptoQuant, assumes that these transactions originated from either individual crypto whales or institutional investors. He speculated that the individual whales anticipate an increase in the ETH price following the approval of a spot ETF. Meanwhile, institutional investors are likely getting ready for the launch of these ETFs.

“These institutions may want to meet the demand of their investors with the launch of the spot Ethereum ETF,” Kesmeci wrote.

Despite the anonymity surrounding these transactions, both are drawn to the market behavior observed after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.
The migration of such a large volume of ETH from exchanges typically indicates a preference for holding assets in self-custodial platforms. This situation leads to tighter supply conditions on crypto exchanges.
Therefore, Kesmeci projected that the current withdrawals would positively influence Ethereum’s price in the medium term. The reduction in exchange-held ETH often hints at a future supply squeeze, potentially driving prices higher as availability diminishes.

Indeed, the preliminary approval for spot Ethereum ETFs has infused renewed optimism in the market and broader crypto industry. BeInCrypto previously reported that some protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem, like Aave and Uniswap, experienced a total value locked increase (TVL) during the period.
Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have weighed in. They predict that the Ethereum ETFs could capture 10% to 20% of the flow seen by their Bitcoin counterparts. According to SoSo Value data, spot Bitcoin ETFs have garnered a total net inflow of $13.6 billion since their inception.

Seyffart and Balchunas expect final approval for the Ethereum ETFs by July, suggesting that the market could see even more significant movements in the coming months.

'Rigged Casino with Dumb People': Dogecoin Creator Slams Crypto


Nate Alex, a popular NFT artist and collector, recently expressed a critical opinion on the current state of the crypto market. He compared it to a rigged casino, suggesting that most of the focus is on onboarding retail investors so insiders can profit by selling "scamcoins."This opinion resonated widely and caught the attention of Billy Markus, one of the creators of Dogecoin, who goes by the pseudonym Shibetoshi Nakamoto. Markus echoed this sentiment, describing the crypto market as a place where many people pretend to be smarter than they are.Interestingly, despite his harsh criticism, Nate Alex remains heavily invested in the cryptocurrency market, in his own words. He stated that nearly all of his liquid capital is tied up in crypto and believes the market trend will continue to rise, at least for the remainder of the year.  Is it really a rigged casino?The latest cryptocurrency market cycle has seen a shift toward less serious ventures, with new meme cryptocurrencies like PEPE, BONK and WIF gaining significant attention last year, laying the foundation for a major meme cryptocurrency mania, which we can observe today. As a result, Solana has exploded with thousands of new meme cryptocurrencies of varying quality, which eventually morphed into celebrity tokens that are just as often a means of taking money from less selective crypto enthusiasts.Against this backdrop, more fundamental and older projects are getting less attention, and their prices, unlike meme cryptocurrencies and especially in this cycle, have not risen. DOGE to USD by CoinMarketCapInterestingly, even DOGE, as the largest and most famous meme cryptocurrency, has not experienced a special surge of interest and consequent growth in volume and price, as all attention has shifted from it to smaller meme coins.

Bitcoin's $150,000 Potential: Peter Brandt's Bull Market Cycle Analysis | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a recent report, renowned trader and analyst Peter Brandt shed light on the fascinating symmetry of Bitcoin’s bull market cycles, particularly in relation to Bitcoin’s “Halving” events.



Peter Brandt is a highly experienced trader with a deep background in the commodities trading sector. Initially gaining recognition for his work with commodities, Brandt has expanded his reputation over the years to include forex and cryptocurrency trading. His expertise is particularly evident in his ability to analyze market patterns and trends, insights he frequently shares through social media and various trading publications.



Brandt is especially renowned for his use of classical charting principles in trading, a methodology he has honed over decades. He has authored a book detailing these principles, offering readers a glimpse into his strategies and thought processes. His forecasts and analyses, especially regarding major market movements in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, have garnered him a significant following among traders who value his experienced perspective on market dynamics. In addition to trading, Brandt contributes to the trading community by providing mentorship and educational resources, helping others navigate the complexities of financial markets.



The Bitcoin Halving is a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency’s journey, occurring approximately every four years. During these events, the mining rewards for Bitcoin are cut in half, effectively reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation. Interestingly, Brandt has observed that these Halving dates have coincided with the halfway points of Bitcoin’s bull market cycles.



Brandt’s analysis reveals a striking pattern: the number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle (marked by a low following a 75% or greater decline) to the Halving date is nearly equal to the number of weeks from the Halving date to the subsequent bull market peak. He says this symmetry has been consistent throughout Bitcoin’s history, suggesting that the cryptocurrency’s price action is influenced by these key events.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

If this pattern continues, Brandt predicts that the next bull market cycle high could occur in late August or early September 2025. This projection is based on the observed symmetry and the timing of the previous Halving events.



But how high could Bitcoin potentially reach during this upcoming bull run? While no method of analysis is infallible, Brandt notes that the peaks of past bull markets align closely with an inverted parabolic curve. If this trend persists, he suggests that the high of the current bull market cycle could fall within the range of $130,000 to $150,000.



However, Brandt is cautious not to be overly dogmatic about his predictions. As a seasoned trader, he acknowledges that there is always a degree of uncertainty in the markets. While his preferred analysis points towards a bullish outcome, he also assigns a 25% probability to the possibility that Bitcoin’s price has already topped for this cycle.



In an alternative scenario, outlined in a separate analysis, Brandt explores the concept of “Exponential Decay.” This theory suggests that if Bitcoin fails to make a decisive new all-time high and instead falls below the $55,000 mark, the probability of a bearish trend would increase.

Important Ripple v. SEC Lawsuit Update, Bitcoin (BTC) Price Swings, and More: Bits Recap June 3


																TL;DR

Bitcoin’s price fluctuated between $67,000 and $70K, settling at the upper mark. It’s up 8% monthly but below its all-time high, with potential for a substantial rally.
Ripple’s current trial stage against the SEC over sealing financial documents continues after a new filing from the company.
Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 solution, surpassed five million blocks and 417 million transactions, aiming to foster the development of the meme coin.


BTC’s Ups and Downs
The leading cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization witnessed mild volatility in the past few days, hovering from $67,000 to around $69,100. It consolidated around $67,700 over the weekend before climbing to its current level of over $69K (per CoinGecko’s data).
BTC is up 8% monthly but is still well below the all-time high of over $73,500 registered in mid-March. Multiple analysts believe the asset is gearing up for another substantial rally, naming some important factors as catalysts.
The X user Quinten claimed that the price of the asset may start a bull run after the US presidential elections (scheduled for November this year). He based his forecast on BTC’s historical ascents following previous campaigns. 
KALEO – a crypto analyst with over 600,000 followers on X – was bullish, too, envisioning a price jump above the $100,000 milestone sometime this summer.




Ripple v. SEC
The legal battle between the entities escalated last week after Ripple filed a reply letter in further support of its motion to seal data related to the regulator’s motion for judgment and remedies. The company sought to seal and redact some evidence and financial documents a few months ago, but the SEC opposed the move. 
“The Court should deny Ripple’s request to conceal financial and securities sales information because that information constitutes “judicial documents” as it is at the heart of the arguments the parties have presented in support of their remedies motion and could, therefore, tend to influence the Court’s remedies decision,” the agency stated in May.
The watchdog insisted that such information could give more clarity about Ripple’s XRP sales from years ago and contribute to the outcome of the legal process. According to the firm, though, historical contracts have “no continuing relevance” because it has enforced certain amendments on its XRP sales procedures.
The case’s potential resolution might significantly impact the price of Ripple’s native token. Those willing to learn why, feel free to check our dedicated video below:

Shiba Inu Advancements
The popular meme coin also made the headlines as of late, with its layer-2 scaling solution – Shibarium – blasting through another huge milestone. As CryptoPotato reported, the total blocks processed on the network exceeded the five million mark.
The number of total transactions on Shibarium currently stands at over 417 million, while wallet addresses surpassed 1.8 million.
The blockchain solution aims to foster the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem by improving speed, lowering transaction fees, and boosting scalability. Last month, it underwent two upgrades to allow compatibility with popular self-custody wallets and enhance the overall user experience.

Landwolf (WOLF) Joins ProBit Global, Reinventing Meme Coin Standards - Coin Edition


							

Landwolf (WOLF) lists on ProBit Global, emphasizing trust and community.



WOLF token opposes hidden transaction taxes, ensuring fairness for users.



Landwolf burns its initial liquidity pool, giving control to the community and preventing rug pulls.




The ProBit Global exchange has welcomed Landwolf (WOLF), a meme coin with a refreshing focus on trust, transparency, and community building. In particular, WOLF has become one of the newest meme tokens to be listed on ProBit Global. 



Landwolf stands out by prioritizing genuine connections and fostering a supportive environment. Their mascot, Wolf, embodies loyalty and strength, reflecting their core value of “real friends stick together.”  Their mantra is supported by characters like Boy’s Club friends Pepe and Andy, underscoring their commitment to creating a supportive community.



One of Landwolf’s key differentiators is its approach to transactions. The project has opposed hidden taxes on swaps, ensuring that every transaction is transparent and equitable for its users. 



This commitment extends to managing their liquidity pool. Specifically, Landwolf burns the initial liquidity pool tokens and relinquishes control over the community. This assures its community that they can trade and hold WOLF tokens without the threat of liquidity being unexpectedly withdrawn.









Furthermore, Landwolf’s dedication to its community is evident in its decision to avoid pre-allocating WOLF tokens to developers, team members, or marketing campaigns. This approach seeks to foster a free market environment to allow the community to engage with the token on an equal footing and free from concerns about tokenomics or uneven distribution.



Ultimately, the Landwolf team considers the introduction of WOLF on ProBit Global a significant moment for the meme coin niche. Landwolf seeks to redefine what it means to be a meme coin with its commitment to fostering trust, ensuring transparency, and nurturing a supportive community.



Crypto enthusiasts are invited to explore the Landwolf (WOLF) listing on ProBit Global, participate in the trading competition, and remain in the loop for the upcoming WOLF Megadrop to win a share of 520,000,000 WOLF tokens on ProBit Global.

XRP Ledger Turns 12 Years Old


XRP, one of the biggest cryptocurrencies, has celebrated its 12th birthday on June 2. On that day in 2012, Ripple Labs co-founder Arthur Britto submitted the lines code that had created 100 billion XRP tokens.It is worth noting that the earliest days of the XRP Ledger have been lost forever due to a critical bug. Hence, the XRP Ledger can be traced back only to December 2012 instead of its actual birthday. "We were still madly squashing bugs as these were early days. We reset the Ledger seq multiple times (for binary format changes) and transaction history was erased," the Ripple CTO said back in December 2019.  Ripple CTO David Schwartz was working with Ripple co-founders Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb starting in late 2011. Schwartz's first commit was submitted back in November 2011. A major upgrade Earlier this year, the XRP Ledger got a major update with the launch of the automated market maker (AMM) feature. As reported by U.Today, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that he was "particularly excited" about the new feature.   The total XRP locked has now surpassed five million, according to a recent update. Meanwhile, the number of active liquidity pools is now in excess of 500. "With 500 pairs we also reached 25% of Uniswap V3 total pairs. Optimistic for volume and swaps to catch up, the AMM/DEX is in the center of all DeFi," Vet, operator of the XRP Ledger dUNL, said on the X social media platform.

Spider-Verse Producer Promises to Never Use Generative AI in Franchise - Decrypt

Christopher Miller, the co-writer and producer of Sony’s beloved “Spider-Verse” series, has promised the franchise will never use generative AI.“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” was originally released in 2018 and won the Oscar for Best Animated Film. The sequel, 2023’s “Across the Spider-Verse,” remains one of the best-reviewed animated movies of all time. Both used a variety of animation styles with the franchise regularly praised for evolving what an animated film could be. The final chapter in the trilogy, “Beyond the Spider-Verse”, is currently in the works.However co-writer and producer Christopher Miller has been forced to deny the film will be using generative AI following comments from CEO of Sony Picture Entertainment Tony Vinciquerra.Speaking at an investors conference last week, Vinciquerra said the company was “very focused” on AI and wanted to use the tech to produce films and TV shows “more efficiently”. Vinciquerra’s comments follow on from DreamWorks founder Jeffrey Katzenberg 2023 prediction that AI will cut the cost of animated movies by as much as 90 per cent.Some fans are worried about what the use of Generative AI will mean for their favourite movies, with one taking to X to write: “Dear Sony Animation. Keep generative AI away from Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse.”“AI robs people of their jobs & produces nothing but slop. We don’t want that anywhere near this film or any film for that matter. Please keep it away from the filmmaking process,” they added, tagging Miller and fellow “Spider-Verse” co-writer and producer Phil Lord.“There is no generative AI in Beyond the Spider-Verse and there never will be,” replied Miller. “One of the main goals of the films is to create new visual styles that have never been seen in a studio CG film, not steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work.”“When we say that we want to feel and see the hand of the artist in every frame, We mean it,” added visual effects supervisor Michael Lasker while production designer Patrick O’Keefe said the studio preferred working with artists. “My favourite part of making these films is the collaboration between humans,” he added.However, other fans are still worried about the crunch many animators and VFX artists may face to get the movie completed with over 100 animators reportedly quitting the production of “Into the Spider-Verse” due to unsustainable working conditions.“Beyond the Spider-Verse” had been due to be released this year, but was removed from Sony’s slate of upcoming releases following the writer’s strike. A new release date has yet to be announced.Over the weekend, AI Film Academy’s inaugural AIFA Awards took place to recognise the “extraordinary diversity of stories and the radically new visual language of AI.”AI Film Academy co-founder Leo Crane told Decrypt: “We're trying to prove this idea that the emerging technology opens up the field on a global scale.”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Cardano Tech Lead Packs The Bitcoin Chain Into One Block


								The Technical Director at the Cardano Foundation, Matthias Benkort (also known as @KtorZ), has successfully encapsulated the entire Bitcoin blockchain within a single block on the Cardano blockchain. This announcement, made via X (formerly Twitter), has sent ripples through the blockchain community, highlighting the potential for advanced data management and interoperability between blockchains.
A Breakthrough For Cardano And Blockchain Technology
Benkort’s revelation came with the release of a new open-source library on GitHub, titled “Merkle Patricia Forestry.” The library introduces a set of both on-chain and off-chain tools designed to work with Merkle Patricia Tries on Cardano. As described in the release documentation, a Merkle Patricia Trie is “a persistent & authenticated data structure to map between arbitrary keys and values.” Essentially, it functions as a highly efficient and secure hashmap.
The documentation elaborates on the structure, stating, “Items are represented in a space-optimized trie (a.k.a prefix tree) of radix 16. The hash digest of their keys provides the path to values in the trie.” This approach offers numerous use cases, such as maintaining large on-chain registries (e.g., domains), or providing vast oracled datasets of intrinsic data (e.g., a map of delegators/delegatees) or extrinsic data (e.g., GitHub data related to an ecosystem of projects). It is particularly well-suited for long-running datasets that grow at a slow rate, such as a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain.

Key features of the Merkle Patricia Forestry library include rapid membership, insertion, and deletion of any key/value item in a large store, facilitated by a root hash digest (32 bytes) and a succinct proof (<1KB). The library incorporates several optimizations inspired by Ethereum’s Modified Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT), but introduces a novel approach for organizing nodes as tiny Sparse Merkle Trees. This innovation results in much smaller proof sizes and is the basis for the library’s name: Merkle Patricia Forestry.
Benkort explained the performance trade-offs, noting that the optimization sacrifices some memory and CPU execution units to achieve smaller proof sizes. Despite this, the library strikes a good balance between proof size, memory usage, and CPU efficiency, as detailed in the performance tables included in the documentation. These tables summarize the proof size, memory units, and CPU units required for various trie sizes, highlighting the efficiency of the library in different scenarios.
Detailed Explanation And Demonstration
In a series of detailed posts on X, Cardano Foundation’s Benkort provided further insights into the implementation and capabilities of the library. He explained that the library consists of two parts: one implemented in Aiken for specific utilities to smart contracts, and another in Node.js for off-chain operations. This comprehensive implementation of modified Merkle Patricia Tries, with a unique twist, is what Benkort calls ‘Merkle Patricia Forestry.’
“Fundamentally, this is an authenticated data structure for mapping arbitrary keys to arbitrary values,” Benkort stated. “Yet, it is done in such a way that it is possible to perform some operations from only a small hash and a succinct proof, without the need to carry the entire data structure.”
For those familiar with blockchain technology, Merkle Trees are a similar, albeit simpler structure, primarily used for representing lists of items and verifying their membership using a root hash. However, Merkle Patricia Tries (MPTs) extend this functionality, allowing not only membership verification but also the insertion and deletion of key/value pairs. Ethereum employs MPTs for its blockchain state and transaction storage, enabling light clients to query balances without storing the entire blockchain.

One significant issue with traditional MPTs is the large size of proofs, which can span multiple kilobytes for extensive data stores. This isn’t as problematic for off-chain operations, but on-chain, every byte is precious. Benkort’s implementation addresses this by using tiny Sparse Merkle Trees of 16 items at each level, effectively creating trees within tries. This structure drastically reduces the size of proofs, trading off some computational steps for Cardano’s efficiency gains.
Benkort demonstrated this capability through a recent transaction that spent a UTxO containing the root hash of a Merkle Patricia Forestry representing the entire Bitcoin block header hashes, compressed into just 32 bytes. The transaction proved the ability to continue the chain by inserting a new block into the trie, maintaining an authenticated chain of over 850,000 blocks with minimal data overhead.
“The transaction I just linked is doing something quite unexpected,” Benkort explained. “It spends a UTxO that contains the root hash of a Merkle Patricia Forestry representing the entire Bitcoin block header hashes, mapped to their transactions. That’s about 850,000 blocks, compressed in 32 bytes.”
To spend this UTxO, a proof must be provided on-chain to show the continuation of the chain by inserting a new block in the trie. The updated root hash stored on-chain must represent the previous chain plus one block. The entire validator for this operation fits into just 26 lines of Cardano’s Aiken.
Future Implications And Use Cases
Benkort highlighted the potential applications of this technology, ranging from trustless bridges to arbitrarily large key/value stores managed fully on-chain. “Imagine the realm of possibilities with such large datasets,” he suggested. “A domains registry? A feed of financial market data? GitHub stats? I do see a world where institutions or committees publish large datasets in the form of a simple root hash on-chain, effectively serving as oracles for a variety of smart contracts down the line.”
Benkort concluded by reflecting on the journey of this project, which began as a side project at the end of last year. “It feels good to finally release this,” he said. “It was originally something I started at the end of last year, a bit as a side project. Given the many conversations about this lately, I thought I’d resurrect and properly package that code. Open sourcing for the win.”
At press time, Cardano (ADA) traded at $0.455.

Notcoin surpasses Solana, BNB in volume: NOT to $0.1 now? - AMBCrypto



Notcoin’s price rallied, volume hits $4.54 billion, only behind BTC, ETH, and USDT.
The price could drop to $0.015 as indicators showed that the token was overbought.

The 24-hour volume of Notcoin [NOT], fueled by the tremendous price increase, was more than that of Solana [SOL] and BNB. As of this writing, NOT’s volume was $.4.54 billion, according to Santiment.
The price, on the other hand, was $0.021. This value was at a 287% hike in the last seven days. However, the price mentioned was a decline as Notcoin had initially hit $0.028 on the 2nd of June.
During the same period, BNB’s volume was $1.75 billion while Solana recorded $1.72 billion in trading volume. The metric is an indicator of interest. Therefore, the surge meant a lot of capital was deployed in the token’s favor.
Source: Santiment
Back-to-back jumps
For those unfamiliar, Notcoin launched about a month ago. And previously, AMBCrypto had reported how its launch was marred by selling pressure.
However, another article explained what led to the price surge and the jump into the top 100 per market cap. In the mentioned piece, we had predicted that NOT would hit $0.01.
Interestingly, it did not take long for the project to do that. Moreso, Notcoin is now part of the top 60 in terms of market cap, rising above Bonk [BONK].
Apart from that, the Open Interest (OI) around the token surged over the weekend. According to Coinglass, Notcoin’s OI was as high as $273.02 million.
Source: Coinglass
When the OI decreases, it means that money is exiting the market as more contracts get closed. However, an increase in the metric is a sign of the presence of new liquidity.
For the price, the rising OI was one of the reasons NOT was able to sustain its uptrend. This is because increasing Open Interest can serve as a strength for the direction a token is moving.
However, traders, as well as NOT holders might need to be careful.
NOT becomes overbought, hurts traders’ positions
For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour timeframe was 72.60. The RSI measures momentum.  A reading below 30 indicates that an asset is oversold.
But a reading over 70 indicates that the cryptocurrency is overbought, and that was the situation with Notcoin. Considering this position, NOT’s price could fall.

If the potential decline continues, the price of NOT could drop to $0.015. However, a resurgence in buying pressure could push the price back in the upward direction.
Beyond that, the Weighted Sentiment was a lot higher than normal, suggesting that many market participants were bullish on NOT. However, this metric seemed to have reached an extreme level. As such, it could validate the bearish prediction above.
Meanwhile, interesting things were happening with Notcoin in the derivatives market.

Realistic or not, here’s NOT’s market cap in SOL terms

According to Coinglass, NOT was only behind Bitcoin [BTC] in terms of 24-hour liquidation.
For that period, shorts were the most affected by the $23.48 million liquidation. However, that has changed within the last hour as the decline in NOT’s price has forced longs to record a large part of the $1.75 million wipeout.

These Altcoins Plunge by Double Digits Following Delistings From Binance: Details


																TL;DR

Binance will halt trading services for some cryptocurrencies. The announcement was followed by significant price drops for the involved assets.
It recently introduced new trading pairs like BTC/MXN and removed some older ones, continuing to adjust its offerings to enhance user experience and respond to latest market trends.


The Affected Cryptocurrencies
Binance will terminate trading on all spot and margin pairs for the following tokens: OmiseGO (OMG), Waves (WAVES), Wrapped NXM (WNXM), and NEM (XEM). Withdrawals of these assets from the platform will not be supported after September 17, while the delisted coins may be converted into stablecoins on behalf of users after September 18.
“Binance Simple Earn will delist the tokens mentioned above after 2024-06-13 03:00 (UTC). Users may choose to redeem their Flexible and Locked Products positions beforehand. Otherwise, these Flexible and Locked Products positions will be automatically redeemed at the above-mentioned time and subsequently transferred to users’ Spot Wallets, together with any accrued rewards, from 2024-06-13 03:00 (UTC). 
Binance Auto-Invest will cease trading services with the tokens after June 7, while Binance Loans and VIP Loan will close the offering four days later.
The company did not provide an exact reason behind its move, reminding it periodically reviews each listed cryptocurrency to ensure it meets “a high level of standard and industry requirements.” Some of the important factors considered by Binance include the team’s commitment, level and quality of development activity, trading volume, liquidity, and more.
Some of the affected digital assets, such as OMG and WAVES, witnessed a double-digit price drop following the announcement. XEM was the worst affected, plummeting by over 30% on a 24-hour scale. Currently, it trades at a seven-month low of approximately $0.025 (per CoinGecko’s data).

Delisting cryptocurrencies from a major trading venue like Binance can significantly impact their price performance. The process may cause a negative perception of the tokens’ credibility and future potential, reputational damage, and other setbacks.
A similar price decline of an affected token occurred in February this year when the exchange halted trading services with Monero (XMR) and three other altcoins. The popular privacy coin saw its valuation drop by over 20% shortly after the announcement. 
Other Recent Binance Updates
The company enforced several amendments on its platform in the past few days, including the introduction of new trading pairs.
Last week, it added BTC/MXN, XRP/MXN, ENS/USDC, and LDO/USDC on Binance Spot. Two of the pairs touch upon the Mexican peso (MXN) – the national currency of the Latin American country. Earlier this year, the exchange launched a direct pair between USDT and MXN.
On the other hand, Binance removed some previously listed pairs, such as CAKE/TUSD, DYDX/BNB, and LAZIO/BTC.

Ethereum's Ether Token Surges 67% in 2024, Bullish Patterns Suggest Continued Rise



                    

Ethereum‘s native token, Ether, has seen a significant increase of approximately 67% in 2024 and might continue to surge in June according to various on-chain, fundamental, and technical indicators. 



As of June 1, Ether was observed in the breakout stage of a falling wedge pattern, a bullish reversal setup known for its two converging descending trendlines. 




The typical resolution of this pattern occurs when the price surpasses the upper trendline, potentially increasing by the height of the wedge.



On May 20, the price of ETH surged above the upper line of the wedge, accompanied by higher trading volumes, indicating a potential target of about $4,255 by the end of June—an increase of 12.65% from its current price.



Additionally, Ether seems to be forming a bull flag pattern, featuring parallel downward-sloping lines. This pattern suggests a price breakout above the upper trendline, possibly reaching $6,000 by the end of June or early July.




The possibility of Ether reaching $4,000 is further supported by increased holdings among its largest investors. 



On-chain data from Santiment shows a 0.5% increase in Ether holdings by accounts possessing between 10 million and 100 million ETH since May 20. 



This period coincides with speculation about the SEC reevaluating its stance on Ether ETFs.

Following the SEC’s approval of spot Ether ETFs on May 23, the ETH/USD price experienced a 19.25% surge. 



In contrast, holders of 1 million to 10 million ETH decreased their positions, indicating profit-taking. 



Moreover, the overall Ether reserves on crypto exchanges have also diminished, signifying a strong hodling sentiment among investors, which could drive prices further up in June.



Analyst views on Ether are optimistic, particularly after BlackRock updated its SEC filing for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). 



Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented on May 29, “This is a good sign. 



“We’ll probably see the rest roll in soon.” 



Balchunas had earlier suggested that Ether ETFs might capture 10-15% of the initial inflows seen by Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted $13.85 billion since their inception in January.



The successful introduction of Ether ETFs and the expected capital inflows indicate a rising demand for ETH, potentially pushing its price beyond $4,000 in the coming month.

Nvidia Unveils New Chip Architecture, Analyst Forecasts $10 Trillion Valuation By 2030 - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the dominant AI chip market player, announced its latest AI chip architecture, Rubin, on June 2, 2024. This announcement comes just months after the company unveiled its Blackwell model in March 2024, which is expected to ship later this year. The rapid turnaround from Blackwell to Rubin underscores the intense competition in the AI chip industry and Nvidia’s dedication to continuing to be at the forefront of the industry. Meanwhile, analyst Beth Kindig recently made an optimistic forecast for the company’s shares, expecting the firm to hit a projected $10 trillion valuation over the next six years.



Nvidia’s Rubin Architecture and Competitive Edge



CEO Jensen Huang has pledged to release new AI chip technology on a yearly basis, accelerating the company’s previous two-year timeline.



The Rubin platform will feature new GPUs and a central processor called “Vera,” showcasing Nvidia’s focus on innovation in AI and accelerated computing. With competitors like AMD, Intel, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon vying for market share, Nvidia aims to maintain its dominant position through its hardware and software integration.



The company’s CUDA platform, often compared to Apple’s iOS for its dominance and influence, gives Nvidia an impenetrable advantage over its rivals.





Projected $10 Trillion Valuation by 2030



As of June 2, 2024, Nvidia’s market capitalization stands at approximately $2.7 trillion. However, Beth Kindig, lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, predicts that the company’s market cap will surge another 270% to reach $10 trillion by 2030.



This projection is driven by the high demand for Nvidia’s chips in data centers and the expected growth in the automotive sector. CEO Jensen Huang has described the current industry phase as the start of the next industrial revolution, highlighting the crucial role of Nvidia’s chips in training large language models and AI applications.



Nvidia’s Stock Has Soared Over 200% in the Past Year



Nvidia’s stock has soared more than 200% in the past year, closing in on the valuations of tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).



As of the market close on May 31, 2024, Nvidia’s stock price stood at $1,095.95, with a market cap of $2.70 trillion. The company has demonstrated impressive returns over the past five years, with a 3,069.25% increase in stock price. Nvidia’s strong financial performance is further evidenced by its profit margin of 53.40%, return on assets of 49.10%, and return on equity of 115.66%. The company also boasts a healthy cash position, with $31.44 billion in total cash and a low total debt/equity ratio of 22.37%.

Binance has announced the delisting of four altcoins, news that has seen the said tokens nosedive amid market reaction.
The exchange notified the crypto community of the impending delisting on Monday, June 3, with OMG Network price falling sharply alongside that of the other tokens.
Binance delists XEM, OMG and WAVES
According to Binance, trading support for the four altcoins will cease on June 17, 2024, at 03:00 (UTC). Specifically, the exchange will end support for spot trading pairs for OMG Network, NEM, Waves and Wrapped NXM. 
The action against the four cryptocurrencies follows internal reviews that target adherence to industry standards and requirements.
“When a coin or token no longer meets these standards or the industry landscape changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it. Our priority is to ensure the best services and protections for our users while continuing to adapt to evolving market dynamics,” the exchange wrote in the announcement.
Per the notice, reviews involve factors such as team’s commitment to the project, development activity, trading volume and liquidity and network security.

Key details
According to the exchange, the trading pairs to be removed include MG/USDT, WAVES/BTC, WAVES/ETH, WAVES/TRY, WAVES/USDT, WNXM/USDT, and XEM/USDT. 
Withdrawals will halt on September 17, 2024 at 03:00 (UTC).
Binance has previously announced delistings for tokens such as Monero (XMR), Aragon (ANT) and Multichain (MULTI) based on such due diligence.
OMG, XEM and WAVES tumble
OMG Network, (OMG), Waves (WAVES), NEM (XEM) and Wrapped NXM (WNXM) are all down as the altcoins tumble amid the major announcement from Binance.
According to data from CoinGecko, OMG Network price was down 27% to near $0.50, while NEM traded 30% down at $0.025. Meanwhile, WAVES, which traded at highs of $4.81 in mid-March, was down 27% to around $1.70.

GME crypto on Solana soars over 300% as GameStop stock heats up


    Since the recent post by Keith Gill, also known as ‘TheRoaringKitty,’ disclosing that he holds $65 million worth of GameStop’s (NYSE: GME) call options with a $21 strike price, set to expire in 19 days, the price of GME cryptocurrency on the Solana (SOL) blockchain briefly skyrocketed by more than 300%.

This surge follows the broader trend of GameStop’s stock, which has also experienced a significant increase in premarket climbing close to 100%.



Trader profits big on GME crypto token



One particularly savvy trader has capitalized on this market movement. This trader had set a limit order that was triggered, resulting in the sale of 3.5 million GME for 260 SOL (approximately $43,000) at a price of $0.01226 per GME.

Despite this sale, the trader still holds a substantial position of 108 million GME, valued at approximately $1.5 million. To date, the total profit from these trades amounts to around $1.37 million. 



For those who followed this trader’s moves and bought GME when recommended, the profit would currently be more than five times their initial investment when viewing the transactions and holdings on Solscan.

Attention! New Method from Hackers! This is How 1 Million Dollars of Binance User Was Stolen! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Binance users are being warned about possible security breaches after reports emerged that accounts were compromised due to a Google plugin called Aggr, promoted by Key Opinion Leaders (KOL).
Binance Users Warned About Security Breach Via Google Plugin Aggr
The plugin has been linked to many cases of significant theft of funds from user accounts.


A Chinese Binance user reported having $1 million stolen after using the Aggr plugin. The funds were stolen through cross-trading mechanisms, indicating a sophisticated attack.
Hackers use compromised cookies to bypass standard security measures such as passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA). This method allows unauthorized access to users' Binance accounts, allowing the theft of significant amounts of money.






Binance users are strongly advised to avoid downloading and using unverified third-party add-ons, especially those promoted through KOL channels.
Users should remain vigilant and monitor their accounts for unusual activity. Regularly updating security protocols and ensuring robust 2FA can provide an additional layer of protection.


Suspicious activity or possible violations should be reported to Binance support for immediate action.
Recent breaches underscore the importance of cybersecurity in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. While Binance and other platforms work to protect users, the community is called on to adopt best practices for online security.

Boeing Continues to Face Pressing Challenges Amid Safety Crisis - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Boeing (NYSE: BA), once a leading force in the aerospace industry, is grappling with an unprecedented safety crisis and production issues that have eroded customer trust and shareholder value. The company’s long-term safety concerns, recent incidents, and regulatory scrutiny have overshadowed its prospects.



Recently, Emirates president Tim Clark discussed the firm and how it could take years for Boeing to get its house in order. The company’s shares have lost over 49% in the last five years, a period of significant turbulence for the aviation giant.



Safety Crisis at Boeing has Been a Decade in the Making



The safety crisis at Boeing has been a decade in the making, with many speculating that the company’s shift from engineering excellence to cost-cutting and profit maximization was at the heart of the problem. Boeing’s push to extract cost cuts from suppliers and outsource work previously done in-house has led to significant quality issues and supply chain disruptions.



The company’s governance model, which became more focused on financial metrics, has negatively impacted its engineering and quality control processes.



Following the Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK) incident in January, where a door plug detached mid-flight, the FAA has capped the production rates of the 737 Max planes and increased oversight on Boeing’s production lines. The FAA has emphasized the need for systemic change at Boeing, focusing on meeting quality and safety milestones before any increase in production can be approved.



In response, Boeing has developed an 11-page Product Safety and Quality Plan, which includes investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and elevating the safety and quality culture.





Alaska Airlines Incident and Future Challenges



The ongoing issues at Boeing have taken a toll on the company’s business, with customers expressing frustration and disappointment over the production issues. Boeing revealed it burned through £1 billion a month in the first quarter of the year after slowing production and paying £347 million in compensation. The company’s shares have fallen by nearly a third since the Alaska Airlines incident, reflecting the financial impact of the crisis.



Boeing’s problems are not limited to the company itself. They affect the global aviation industry, with supply chain disruptions also impacting Airbus and other manufacturers. Emirates president Tim Clark predicts a five-year hiatus for Boeing to address and recover from these issues, highlighting the long road ahead for the company.



As Boeing works to address its safety and production issues, it faces increased scrutiny from regulators and legal authorities. The FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board, and the American government are all closely monitoring the company’s actions. Additionally, the US Department of Justice has filed a case accusing Boeing of breaching its obligations in a 2021 agreement that shielded the company from criminal prosecution over past crashes.

Flood of Cash from Coinbase Gives Crypto One of the Biggest U.S. Election War Chests

"When it comes to our mission of increasing economic freedom by growing the adoption of cryptocurrencies, we are deeply engaged in policy efforts," Coinbase said in a company statement. "The House and Senate help determine what crypto legislation gets passed, amongst other things, so growing the number of pro-crypto members is critical."
