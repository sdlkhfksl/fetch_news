Why Bitcoin Miners Brace for Capitulation After Halving


As Bitcoin prices continue to face intense volatility after the halving, the stability of the entire crypto-mining industry could hinge on a critical support level. 
Currently trading around $57,000, Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop from its March 14 all-time high of $73,750. This downturn places immense pressure on Bitcoin miners, who grapple with the effects of the latest halving event that reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.
Will Bitcoin Miners Capitulate Following the Halving?
Despite these challenges, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently highlighted that Bitcoin miners have yet to show signs of capitulation. Typically, capitulation occurs when miners, unable to cover operational costs due to falling Bitcoin prices, are forced to sell their holdings, potentially driving prices down further. 
However, Ju’s analysis suggests miners hold onto their assets, betting on a future price recovery.

“Bitcoin miners’ revenue has dropped to levels seen in early 2023 following the halving. Now they have two options: 1. Capitulation, or 2. Waiting for a rise in BTC price. There are no signs of capitulation for now,” Ju said.

This optimism is echoed by some analysts who foresee a potential recovery. Following the previous halvings, Bitcoin usually undergoes price fluctuations, historically leading to rallies due to increased asset scarcity. This pattern suggests a possible price uplift, aligning with the miners’ decision to hold.

However, Charles Edwards, Founder of Capriole Investments, believes the recent downward price action could soon wreak havoc on Bitcoin miners. The electricity cost to operate the Bitcoin network is currently an astonishing $77,400 per BTC mined. This figure represents the direct energy expenses associated with mining each Bitcoin.
When the price falls below the electrical cost, it typically lasts only a few days every four years. According to Edwards, this scenario can lead to one of three outcomes: 

The price of Bitcoin could surge dramatically.
Approximately 15% of miners might cease operations.
Transaction fees could remain significantly higher than average.


This scenario highlights miners’ fragile balance between operational costs and market prices.

For this reason, the market’s next movements are highly anticipated, with analysts keenly watching the $57,000 level. If this support breaks, it could trigger a wave of sales from miners, fulfilling the capitulation scenario.

Bear Analyst il Capo Evaluated Bitcoin Decline and Shared His Latest Predictions! Short Announced the Altcoins He Closed! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, spent April with declines. As the declines continued on the first day of May, BTC fell below $ 57,000.
While the decline in BTC is getting deeper, Capo of Crypto, who is known for his bearish views and is frequently criticized by investors with his bearish comments, made a new assessment after today's decline in Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market.


Stating that BTC reached its previous target of $57,000-59,000 and Ethereum reached $2,700-2,800, il Capo said that a local bottom could be seen at these levels.
However, the analyst stated that there is a strong demand below these levels and said that he will not enter any position until he sees a strong downward reaction or approval in BTC and altcoins and that he will be careful before taking a position.





Also adding that he closed CRO and BNB shorts profitably, il Capo added that there is a possibility of further decline.

“BTC reached its base level of $57k – $59k, while ETH reached $2700 – $2800. What should we expect now?
We can see a local bottom formation here, but for that we need a strong bullish PA.
There is significant demand below these levels, and that's a good thing. But I will be careful before entering any position until I see a strong reaction or confirmation.
I made a profit on my CRO and BNB shorts. They may fall further, but profits are already very good and we are currently at support level.
Let's see how prices react here. For now, I'm going to wait until we see a reversal.”

SynFutures v3 Overtakes Uniswap and dYdX By Daily Volume - The Defiant

Points farmers have driven SynFutures v3's daily DEX dominance up to 12%.SynFutures v3, the surging decentralized exchange for perpetual futures, has emerged as the top DEX by 24-hour trading volume with $1.47 billion.According to data from CoinMarketCap, SynFutures v3 accounted for 12% dominance over decentralized exchange (DEX) volume in the last 24 hours. SynFutures beat out the top spot decentralized exchange, Uniswap, and incumbent perpetuals DEX, dYdX V4 — which boast market shares of 11.3% and 11.2% respectively.SynFutures has risen to the top of the decentralized exchange rankings despite the platform managing a total value locked (TVL) of only $50.47 million, according to data from DefiLlama.For comparison, GMX v2, a top decentralized perpetuals exchange, boasts a TVL of $325 million, while dYdX holds $320 million, and the Jupiter Perpetual Exchange hosts $291 million.SynFutures is the latest example of web3 protocol quickly establishing impressive market share on the back of a successful points campaign.The project launched its v3 iteration on the Blast Ethereum Layer 2 in February and unveiled a points campaign dubbed “Oyster Odyssey” in March. Oyster Odyssey incentivizes users who contribute liquidity or refer other users onto the platform with points, which are expected to qualify holders for an airdrop in the future.SynFutures said it onboarded more than 400,000 users within two weeks of launching the points campaign.Oyster AMMSynFutures v3 also introduced a new exchange mechanism dubbed the Oyster AMM.Oyster AMM combines elements from order book trading and automated market makers (AMMs) to increase capital efficiency compared to traditional AMM decentralized exchanges.AMMs were pioneered by Uniswap v1, and allow users to execute trades by interacting with smart contract-based liquidity pools. Liquidity providers supply assets to the pools in exchange for earning trading fees, while price data is provided by third-party oracles, facilitating permissionless on-chain trading."Oyster AMM embraces two-sided liquidity but only requires a single token, eliminating the need to provide liquidity for both ends of a token pair and enhancing the overall efficiency of the trading ecosystem,” Synfutures said.The first version of SynFutures launched in June 2021 on the Polygon PoS Sidechain and zkSync Era networks. The protocol offered a Synthetic AMM, requiring that liquidity providers only provide a single asset to pools rather than both sides of a pairing.In December 2022, the project launched SynFutures v2, allowing users to list futures pairings permissionlessly.SynFutures v3 is already outperforming its previous incarnations, with daily trade volume on v2 peaking at $30.1 million alongside a TVL of just $6.5 million, while v1’s TVL topped out at $7.85 million.Collectively, v1 and v2 have processed roughly $23 billion in trade volume from more than 10,000 users, according to Messari. However, SynFutures v3 beat out its past incarnations during April alone, with the exchange hosting more than $30.1 billion worth of trades last month.

BlackRock's BUIDL overtakes Franklin Templeton's FOBXX in tokenized fund race - Crypto Briefing




BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, known as BUIDL, has surpassed Franklin Templeton’s Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), to become the world’s largest equity tokenized fund, with $375 million in assets under management (AUM) as of April 30, according to data from Dune Analytics.As of April 28, Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX held the previous top position with $376 million in AUM while BlackRock’s BUIDL was close behind with $349 million in AUM.The growth comes just six weeks after BUIDL’s debut. The AUM gap between BUIDL and FOBXX widened to $8 million, with BUIDL taking the lead.BlackRock launched BUIDL in partnership with Securitize in March 2024. The fund captured over $240 million in its first week. Last week, BUIDL attracted $70 million, including a significant $50 million from its OUSG token product, Ondo Finance. Meanwhile, FOBXX experienced a 3.7% decrease in its AUM.The tokenization of real assets is heating up following BlackRock’s participation. Last week, Franklin Templeton announced that it has enabled direct shareholder transfers of FOBXX shares on the public blockchain, a move seen as the fund’s efforts to hold its leading position in the market.Tokenized government securities gain momentum in the asset marketIn a recent post on X, 21Shares analyst Tom Wan suggested that tokenized government securities could grow in their share of the total tokenized asset market, moving from about 1% currently to over 10%.According to Wan, the current demand for tokenized traditional financial assets is not strong. Even among investors who are familiar with crypto, there is a hesitancy to invest in tokenized equities due to low liquidity.Despite these challenges, there’s a better outlook for tokenizing assets like US Treasuries because there’s already remarkable demand within the crypto space, Wan noted.

Crypto Market Falls, But Azuki NFT Sales Reach New Heights


As the cryptocurrency market experienced significant downturns, with Bitcoin (BTC) plunging to its lowest since February, Ethereum-based Azuki soared to new heights in the non-fungible token (NFT) sector. 
Azuki’s sales reached a striking $1.13 million, marking it as the top-selling NFT collection of the day, according to CryptoSlam data.
Azuki NFT Sales Are Booming as Crypto Market Drops
The contrast between the declining crypto market and Azuki’s sales spike is stark. Bitcoin fell about 6.3% over the past 24 hours, dropping below the critical $60,000 support level. 
Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) saw a decrease of around 5%, falling under $3,000, with other major altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) also losing about 6%. The overall crypto market capitalization has dropped by over $20 billion, highlighted by the $540 million outflow from US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since April 20. 
According to 10x Research, the average entry price for US Bitcoin ETF holders is around $57,300, which may serve as a pivotal support point if the downtrend continues.

“There might have been a lot of ‘TradeFi’ tourists in crypto – pushing longs until the halving – this time is now over. We expect more unwinding as the average Bitcoin ETF buyer will be underwater when Bitcoin trades below $57,300. This will likely lower prices to our target levels and cause a -25% to -29% correction from the $73,000 top – hence our price target of $52,000 to $55,000 during the last three weeks,” 10x CEO Markus Thielen wrote.

The cryptocurrency market’s instability contrasts with the thriving NFT sector. Azuki emerged as the only collection to achieve over $1 million in sales. This surge has pushed Azuki’s total sales volume to approximately $1.12 billion. Subsequently, positioning it as the eighth-largest NFT collection in terms of sales.
Other NFT collections like DMarket and Dokyo also witnessed considerable sales but trailed behind Azuki. DMarket, featuring in-game items on the Mythos network, garnered nearly $887,880, while Avalanche-based Dokyo accumulated about $716,860 from 948 transactions.

Noteworthy, too, is the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks, each recording just over $500,000 in sales, showing resilience amidst a challenging market. These figures reflect a growing divergence where select NFT collections continue to attract significant investment despite broader market challenges.
This trend suggests a robust, enduring interest in high-value NFTs like Azuki, even as traditional cryptocurrencies face volatility.

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a significant price drop in the last 24 hours, shedding nearly 15% of its value. At the time of writing, SHIB had trimmed some of its intraday losses and was down 10.36% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002097. On-chain data suggests that the actions of short-term traders may have precipitated the SHIB price downturn. In this regard, IntoTheBlock's holding time of transacted coins indicator seems to offer a clue to Shiba Inu's current investor sentiment. The holding time of transacted coins indicator often provides powerful insights into the level of investor confidence and market sentiment.For SHIB, the holding time of transacted coins stays low, between two weeks and one month, suggesting investors are now more focused on short-term gains.On April 30, when the SHIB price dropped considerably, the average time held of coins transacted was one month, indicating activity from short-term traders who had bought at the peak of Shiba Inu's rally in March.SHIB/USD Daily Chart, Courtesy: TradingViewShiba Inu rapidly surged to highs of $0.000045 in early March, which was followed by profit-taking. As buying pressure remained on the market, Shiba Inu managed to pan out highs of $0.00003285 on March 28 before steadily declining in the weeks that followed.While the influence of short-term traders remains, it might be essential to consider the broader market context. The entire cryptocurrency market, driven by Bitcoin, is experiencing substantial losses. Bitcoin fell over 9% on Wednesday, posting its worst monthly performance in April since late 2022, as investors withdrew money from cryptocurrencies ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later today.However, the good news is that Shiba Inu appears to be forming a bull flag on the daily chart. According to crypto analyst Ali, validating this pattern might trigger fresh highs for the Shiba Inu price.A price rebound from about $0.000018343 might lead to a bullish breakout, sending SHIB prices to highs of $0.000072323.

Flying Penguin Poised to Rally 9,300% and Take on Shiba Inu and Bonk



                    

Flying Penguin (FLYPEN) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK).



Flying Penguin (FLYPEN), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK).




Early investors in SHIB and BONK made astronomical returns, and Flying Penguin presents a similar opportunity.



Flying Penguin has market cap below $30,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $300,000-$700,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 9,300% in the coming two days, and Flying Penguin could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Flying Penguin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Flying Penguin on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Flying Penguin by entering its contract address – 37Tfn3F5E84KvitHHQVK37KzZZ3qAPCdxjGgBJd8XoVs – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, BONK and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like FLYPEN.

$479M Lost as Over 140K Traders Face Liquidation Nightmare


							

Over $479 million liquidated in 24 hours as Bitcoin plunges 9% to $56K.



The largest single-trader liquidation occurred on the OKX exchange, involving $6 million.



Despite the massive sell-off, analysts remain optimistic about a bullish comeback.




After the overly bearish April, the crypto market is again starting the new month of May on a red note, with crypto traders languishing in staggering capital losses. Data from market tracker Coinglass shows that 141,808 crypto traders faced liquidation over the last day. These traders have lost over $479 million in their investment across various assets. 



The most significant single-trader liquidation occurred on the OKX exchange, involving an ETH-USDT-SWAP valued at $6.07 million. This nearly half-billion-dollar fortune wiped out of the crypto scene emerged following Bitcoin’s instability in the last 24 hours. 



As of yesterday, Bitcoin traded at a high of $62,121. However, at press time, it had already plummeted by 9% to trade at a low of $56,555. This sudden turn of events has left crypto bulls reeling from significant losses.









In particular, crypto bulls lost over $401 billion within the past day, while shorters lost only about $63 million. The losses were more pronounced for Bitcoin optimists than other assets, with $150 million liquidated at press time. 



On the other hand, Ethereum investors who bet for higher prices have incurred $107 million in liquidation. Significant liquidations were also recorded for other prominent assets like Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Crypto Liquidations | Coinglass 



Bitcoin’s retest of the $56K range comes about two weeks after the Bitcoin network halved on April 19. Prior to the halving event, there was similar intense selling pressure in the market, with Bitcoin crashing to $60K from the recently attained all-time high of $73,850.In his latest analysis, market watcher Rekt Capital has highlighted that Bitcoin’s revisit of $56K is officially the deepest retrace in this emerging bull cycle. Accordingly, market analysts continue to maintain confidence that the bullish comeback is around the corner.

How Wormhole Becomes Key Infrastructure for Web3 Growth and Cross-Chain Operations | Cryptopolitan

Wormhole is one of the most widely used and known cross-chain bridges. The hub has proven resilient, despite going through one of the biggest exploits, losing $321M in 2022. Since then, Wormhole has grown its connection pairs and interchain features. Wormhole Targets Developers AgainDevelopers are a scarce resource in the blockchain space. The best may create the next wave of successful projects. Wormhole and Borderless Capital are offering grants to developers who want to create cross-chain features and products. The grant program is open for application now and will distribute a total of $50M in locked liquidity. Wormhole aims to build a space where the end user can move seamlessly between any two chains, without extra steps or attention. Cross-chain tokens and identities also mean more opportunities for account abstraction, where a user does not need to create a new wallet for each chain.Wormhole Introduces Native Cross-Chain TokensThe seamless Wormhole technology means there are now tokens that can exist on several networks, with seamless transfers and locked liquidity. Wormhole itself recently launched its W token, available on some of the most high-profile Web3 networks. Wormhole is also adding new tokens with cross-chain mechanisms. Some of the recent additions can move between Solana and Arbitrum, two of the most active chains for decentralized apps. The activity of Wormhole varies, but the protocol showed an inflow of transactions in Q1, 2024. In the past 90 days, Wormhole also went through activity spikes, with thousands of cross-chain transactions each day. At baseline, Wormhole handles around 2K transactions, based on DappRadar data.The protocol retained its high credibility, especially after increasing security to avoid more exploits. As of May 1, the Portal bridge by Wormhole received more deposits than withdrawals and supports a reasonable level of baseline activity. Wormhole is used often to transfer different cross-chain versions of stablecoins like USDT, USDC, BUSD and others.Wormhole Offers Staking for Native TokenOne of the reasons for heightened activity is the launch of the W token. Wormhole partnered with DappRadar to further boost W token distribution. W token buyers can stake through DappRadar in a special program and receive passive returns. The W token has been trading for only about a month and is still at the stage of early price discovery. W peaked right after its launch, reaching highs of $1.54. Since then, it has slid to its current price of $0.64, trading sideways for the past two weeks. After the initial enthusiasm, W token’s trading volumes remain close to $200M per day, with $1.2M in liquidity for each 2% downward slippage. After its launch, the W token also managed to defy the market slide, which pushed down major assets. W climbed while Bitcoin (BTC) slid toward the $60,000 barrier. Wormhole’s W reached an all-time low at $0.46 and showed its capabilities to bounce and find a higher price range.Extreme predictions see W breaking as high as $3 in the medium term, as more buyers redirect to the new asset.A further slide for W may put the token in the accumulation zone, preparing for new attempts at trading higher. Some predictions view W as almost done with the slide after the launch. W was intended as a utility token within the ecosystem.Wormhole Invests Back into Crypto SpaceWormhole is a hub for money to enter and flow through crypto space. The project itself is well-funded, raising $225M during a token sale in Q4, 2023. Wormhole is one of the projects to delay the creation of a token, surprising the markets with a late but very successful ICO. The bridge and cross-chain platform has been around for more than three years and is among the first tokenless projects to airdrop an asset.On its side, Wormhole supported seven other projects like Curvance, NodeKit, Synonym Finance, Omega, Oyl, Zoth and Mayan.

Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Suggests $40,000 Pit Stop for Bitcoin Before Rally

Legendary trader Peter Brandt, renowned for his insights into financial markets, has suggested a potential pit stop for Bitcoin before its next rally. In the wake of Bitcoin's recent 9% price drop, Brandt's analysis points toward a scenario where the leading cryptocurrency could dip into the high $40,000s before resuming its bullish trajectory.Brandt's assessment comes amid growing uncertainty following Bitcoin's significant loss since the beginning of the week, marking its largest drop of the year. With prices plummeting from $64,700 to $57,400, market participants have been gripped by panic and doubt regarding the future of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market.BTC to USD by CoinMarketCapWhat's resolution?Having witnessed numerous market cycles throughout his extensive career, Brandt highlights a crucial observation: despite past halving events and the launch of ETFs, Bitcoin has failed to surpass its highs from three years ago. This insight underscores the importance of resolving current market dynamics, especially as BTC struggles to maintain its upward momentum. Despite acknowledging a 25% probability that Bitcoin had already reached its local peak at $74,000, Brandt remains cautiously optimistic about the ongoing bull market. However, he suggests that corrections may accompany this upward trend, with the potential for the Bitcoin price to correct by more than 25% from current levels.Notably, Bitcoin has not revisited the $40,000 mark in the past three months, underscoring the significance of Brandt's proposed pit stop.

What's Going On With Bitcoin Mining Stock Riot Platforms? - Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) - Benzinga

Riot Platforms Inc RIOT shares are trading higher Wednesday on the heels of the Bitcoin BTC/USD mining company’s first-quarter results. Here’s a look at the highlights from the quarter.What Happened: Riot Platforms reported first-quarter revenue of $79.3 million, which missed the consensus estimate of $94.859 million, per Benzinga Pro. The company reported positive earnings of 82 cents per share, beating estimates for a loss of 14 cents per share. Riot said it produced 1,264 bitcoin during the quarter, down 36% year-over-year. The company said the decline was primarily due to a significant increase in bitcoin network difficulty. Riot anticipates achieving a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 31 EH/s by the end of 2024.“This quarter, Riot reported net income of $211.8 million and earnings per share of $0.82 which are new record highs for our quarterly results. Additionally, we reported $245.7 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, another record high for Riot, rounding out strong financial performance for the quarter,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot. Riot noted that it has placed three purchase orders with MicroBT for additional mining systems. Deployment of the miners is expected to begin in the second quarter and be completed in the third quarter. Riot expects that it will reach a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 41 EH/s in 2025 upon full deployment. Management will hold a conference call to discuss these results at 8:30 a.m. ET.See Also: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Pumped After The Last FOMC Meeting—Will History Repeat On Wednesday?RIOT Price Action: Riot Platforms shares were up 2.56% at $10.37 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.

Patrick McHenry Questions SEC's Transparency On Ethereum As A Security - Benzinga

In an escalation of tensions between Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has openly criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler for his evasive responses during a congressional hearing. What Happened: McHenry alleged that Gensler knowingly avoided clarifying whether the SEC considers Ethereum‘s ETH/USD cryptocurrency, ether, as a security. This accusation was spurred by revelations from court documents indicating the SEC was actively investigating ether’s status just before Gensler’s testimony.“The refusal of Chair Gensler to address questions about the SEC's stance on ether during the hearing appears to be a deliberate misrepresentation of the agency’s position,” McHenry asserted on social media platform X, referring to evidence presented in a lawsuit filed by blockchain company Consensys.Read Next: US Stablecoin Regulation Talks Stall, But Progress Is NearThe debate over whether ether should be classified as a security is not just a legal technicality; it carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Should ether be deemed a security, it could set a precedent for the regulation of numerous other digital tokens, potentially stifling innovation and investment within the sector.In response to these developments, crypto attorney Grant Gulovsen offered a perspective that highlights the complexities of the SEC’s investigative processes. “The initiation of an investigation by the SEC does not necessarily equate to an official stance or determination,” Gulovsen explained, indicating that the SEC's inquiry into ether does not confirm its classification as a security.As these events unfold, the discussion around digital assets continues to evolve, emphasizing the importance of regulatory clarity. What’s Next: This topic is also poised to be a focal point at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin Grinds Lower: Catalysts Traders Will Watch For Their Next MovesImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Former FTX exec pays $1.5M for watch worn by Titanic's richest passenger


A former FTX executive who was head of the exchange’s European operation when it collapsed in 2022 has reportedly purchased a gold pocket watch worn by property tycoon John Jacob Astor IV when he was killed in the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 1912. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, former head of FTX Europe Patrick Gruhn paid £1.175 million (roughly $1.5 million) for the watch at the Henry Aldridge & Son auction. This is the highest price ever paid for a piece of Titanic memorabilia.
Astor, who was the richest passenger aboard the doomed liner with an estimated fortune of around $90 million — equivalent to several billion dollars today — was apparently last seen smoking a cigarette and chatting to his fellow passengers as the ship sank after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic.
His body, along with the 14-carat gold Waltham pocket watch, was recovered a week later.
Astor’s gold watch engraved with his initials pictured on Henry Aldridge and Son’s website.
After outbidding his competition, Gruhn said, “We want people in the US to be able to see and admire this historic relic,” and plans to display the watch in a museum. 
The museum might be a better place for the watch than the secondary market with the Financial Times reporting that luxury watchmakers are struggling with a slump in profits this year. Market prices reportedly peaked in May 2022 and have fallen across the seven quarters since. 
FTX overspent $323 million buying Patrick Gruhn’s firm
FTX sued Gruhn and the founders of the Swiss firm Digital Assets DA AG in 2023. The lawsuit claimed that Sam Bankman-Fried’s $323 million acquisition of the firm was a ‘massive overpayment‘ that used FTX customer funds.

Read more: FTX owes more in legal fees than it does to creditors
FTX attempted to sell the firm back to its founders for the full amount but eventually settled with Gruhn and the other founders on a price of just $33 million for the firm. 
Gruhn claims he’s used funds from the sale of his companies to buy the watch and denies knowing anything about Bankman-Fried’s fraud before its collapse.

Anchorage, Arca Labs link up in bid to advance tokenization adoption - Blockworks


Anchorage Digital is now custodying shares of a tokenized Treasury fund via a partnership with Arca Labs meant to advance institutional participation in the segment. 
The link-up comes as the tokenization of real-world assets is set to continue as a “defining trend” for institutional crypto in 2024, Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley told Blockworks.
The innovation unit of crypto investment firm Arca first issued shares of its US Treasury Fund as digital asset securities, known as ArCoin, in 2021. The company has argued that ArCoin can replace US Treasurys in enterprise workflows while reducing costs and improving transparency.
The company has now turned to Anchorage — a crypto-focused bank chartered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) — to custody the shares.

Anchorage Digital Co-Founders Nathan McCauley and Diogo Mónica
The alliance allows Anchorage clients to keep ArCoin in custody at the bank. Institutions can now access the tokenized shares from the Anchorage platform as it would for the hundreds of assets the company supports.

McCauley has said Anchorage meets the Securities and Exchange Commission’s definition of a “qualified custodian.” The term was included in the regulator’s February 2023 proposal that would “entrust safekeeping of client assets” to such entities.
“Now that institutions have validated the benefits of blockchain technology, companies are seeking the most secure and seamless digital assets solutions that meet US regulatory standards,” Arca Labs president Jerald David said in a statement.
The Anchorage platform uses hardware security modules, which keeps assets offline in segregated, on-chain vaults while keeping them accessible. The model serves as a “major unlock” for institutional participation in tokenization, McCauley argued.
Tokenizing assets — from real estate to funds — has made headlines in recent years as some of the biggest fintech companies and traditional finance players delve deeper into blockchain-related experiments.Read more: Citi the latest TradFi player to test out asset tokenization
The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, launched the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in March, marking the firm’s first tokenized offering. 
Fellow fund behemoth Franklin Templeton, which debuted its OnChain US Government Money Fund in 2021, started allowing institutional investors to transfer shares of the fund — represented by BENJI tokens — to other shareholders last week.
Roger Bayston, Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, previously told Blockworks that BENJI essentially acts as a stablecoin while also generating income. 
“Looking ahead, we will continue to expand our custody support for tokenization projects to advance institutional participation in the ecosystem for the long term,” McCauley said.

Another commonly occurring technique was the use of so-called "nested services," businesses that move funds through accounts at larger cryptocurrency exchanges, sometimes without the awareness or approval of the exchange. A nested service might receive a deposit from one of their customers into a cryptocurrency address, and then forward the funds to their deposit address at an exchange.

Andreessen Horowitz Invested $90 Million in This Ethereum (ETH) Based Altcoin! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of Silicon Valley's leading venture capital companies, follows cryptocurrencies closely.
At this point, a16z invested a large amount in an Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin.


According to Unchained, a16z purchased Optimism (OP) tokens worth approximately $90 million.
The news drew attention to the Optimism Foundation's statement in early March that it had sold approximately 19.5 million OPs worth approximately 90 million dollars.






“Leading venture capital firm a16z has acquired Optimism (OP) for $90 million, according to two sources familiar with the matter.”

One source commented on a16z's latest crypto investment: “Optimisim did pretty well. They're still doing airdrops.” said
While a16z and Optimisim spokesperson did not make a statement regarding the OP investment, an Optimisim spokesperson said, “We are excited about the energy and momentum Optimisim has achieved and are excited for the future.”


Despite the general decline, OP, which increased by 13% in the last 24 hours, continues to be traded at $ 2.64 at the time of writing.

Buy signal for the two most oversold cryptocurrencies today


Following this week’s cryptocurrency market crash, digital assets currently display bearish technical indicators like a weak relative strength index (RSI). However, two popular cryptocurrencies have a potential buy signal, with an extremely oversold status on May 1.
As reported by Finbold, long-position traders lost $400 million since April 30, as $250 billion in capitalization left the market. The crash impacted Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traders, mostly, but all cryptocurrencies suffered meaningful losses.
Previously, crypto traders registered $100 million in total liquidations within a 4-hour time frame, which started the major sell-off. As a result, the average RSI dropped to a weak status below 34 index points, suggesting an overall bearish momentum.


Conversely, while some traders panic sell, others may see a buy signal opportunity for cryptocurrencies with discount prices. In particular, Finbold identified Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) as the two most oversold cryptocurrencies in CoinGlass‘s 4-hour chart.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Most oversold crypto
First, Bitcoin Cash was the most oversold cryptocurrency at press time, with a 21.07 4-hour relative strength index. BCH holds a neutral 52.4 in the weekly time frame despite having a weak 24-hour RSI of 33.37.
As of this writing, the coin trades at $406.2, down 1.41% in the last four hours.

Finbold previously reported two other buy signals for Bitcoin Cash due to high negative funding rates and short-squeeze liquidations. The renowned Bitcoin competitor stood out as an alternative as BTC fees reached record highs above $100 per transaction.
Buy signal for Dogecoin (DOGE)
Meanwhile, Dogecoin has the second-highest oversold signal among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the 4-hour time frame. DOGE was trading at $0.12 at the time of publication, with a 23.9 RSI.
Like Bitcoin Cash, the leading meme coin has a neutral 50.03 and a weak 31.1 weekly and daily RSI, respectively.

Notably, having an oversold status does not guarantee short-term positive price action and is often seen as a bearish indicator. For now, cryptocurrency investors await a leading signal that could come from macroeconomic decisions from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.

Decentralization of Social Media: A Path to User Empowerment

Social media is evolving towards decentralization, shifting control back to users—a stark contrast to traditional, centralized platforms. This is a welcome change because the decentralization of social media prioritizes user empowerment by restoring control,  offering a stark contrast to the dominance of traditional and centralized social media giants!
When talking about traditional social media, it’s not new news that companies like Meta, whose subsidiaries include Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, hold all the power. They control user data, dictate what users see and can even censor content. Remember, if something is free, you are the product.
While we can imagine the societal harm of users chasing dopamine hits in the unending pursuit of likes and comments, these companies are cashing in on our data, which fuels a multi-billion dollar advertising machine.Decentralization of social media breaks away from corporate-controlled platforms, but what’s the value in that?
In decentralized social media, user data and content are stored across multiple computers, enhancing security and resistance to censorship
Just like Neo in The Matrix, decentralized social media offers us a red pill, a chance to wake up, break through the facade of an artificially constructed reality designed to control us, to not only see things for how they truly are but empower us with the tools necessary to set others free by inviting them to join us.
Our current social media experience is like a walled garden–it’s beautiful, and meticulously curated but ultimately restrictive. In this article, we will discuss the shift towards decentralization of social media from traditional social media. We will also take a closer look at platforms like SuperDapp where users have more control, creators are fairly compensated and online interactions are more transparent and user-driven.

Decentralized Social Media (DeSo) clashes dramatically with the traditional social media platforms we are familiar with, offering a new paradigm built on the foundation of user empowerment and data ownership.  But first, we need to see the light in order to break free from the beautiful prisons or walled gardens of centralized social media.
The Dissatisfaction with Current Revenue Models and the Potential For Fairer Structures in DeSo
The creator economy on traditional social media platforms is influenced by factors such as platform design, revenue sharing, and the distribution of creator capabilities. We must recognize the prevalence of questionable compensation structures for the content creators who give people a reason to engage with these sites in the first place. 
For example, Meta is known to take a considerable 30% share while YouTube takes an incredible 45% cut from revenue generated by content creators. Of course, some compensation is better than none, and it could definitely be worse, but is it really fair?
One of the key shifts driving the decentralization of social media is the more attractive value proposition made to content creators. After all, thanks to their decentralized nature, there simply isn’t as much overhead needed to pay for things like offices, superfluous departments, or executive bonuses.
This presents an opportunity for decentralized social platforms like SuperDapp to disrupt the status quo, but what is SuperDapp?
SuperDapp is an AI-infused, decentralized SocialFi platform that allows users to interact with others with features like encrypted messaging between individuals and groups, voice and video calls while having their experience enhanced with Web3 features all rolled into a single application. It enhances user experiences with its AI companion, AiDA, which is powered by GPT4. SuperDapp’s integration with Sycoin NEVM and Sycoin Rollux enables it to bridge different blockchain networks so that it brings out a holistic communication environment for users.

The shift towards decentralized social media marks a pivotal moment in online interaction as it empowers users to take control of their data and experience. 
Jagdeep Sidhu, CEO of SYS Labs.

Syscoin collaborated with Polyhedra Network and NodeKit to unveil zkDA (Zero Knowledge Data Availability), which sets a new benchmark in blockchain scalability and security. Read more in this article.

The Rollux ecosystem spans across seven sectors including DeFi, Bridges, Gaming, Tool, Exchanges, NFT and On/Off Ramp
Having discussed the overarching benefits of decentralized platforms like SuperDapp, let’s delve deeper into how they empower users and creators through innovative governance and monetization models.
SUPR Tokens and User Governance
SuperDapp introduces innovative features that enhance user empowerment and creator revenue. For instance, its revenue-sharing model offers a more equitable distribution compared to traditional platforms like Facebook and YouTube.
While platforms like TikTok and Twitter address basic social needs, their business models don’t prioritize user empowerment or data control. In contrast, decentralized social media platforms like SuperDapp not only provide fairer revenue distribution but also grant users more control over their content and interactions.
SuperDapp’s economy will be supported through the application of its utility token, SUPR. Holding SUPR tokens empowers users, granting them voting rights on platform developments. This empowers users to directly influence revenue generation and distribution, ensuring a user-centric approach, unlike the top-down models of traditional social media.
Direct Content Monetization
Traditional platforms like YouTube and TikTok have paved the way for content monetization, yet they retain a significant portion of the revenue generated. In contrast, decentralized platforms like SuperDapp allow creators to earn directly from their audiences, bypassing the middlemen and their onerous fees.
SuperDapp takes this a step further by enabling users to directly monetize their content through engagement-based SUPR token rewards within Super Groups. These groups are vibrant communities where content creators and their followers interact, contribute, and grow together, fostering a supportive environment. This system directly links creators’ efforts to their earnings and enhances community engagement, offering a transparent and equitable model that benefits creators and their communities alike. Learn more about Super Groups from the graphic below.
Super Groups, a feature that allows users to connect and monetize content.

In today’s digital age, data has become as valuable as traditional assets like factories or land. As we pivot to Web3, understanding how it changes data control is crucial.
Under Web 2.0, giants such as Meta and TikTok, claim ownership over the data we generate—our posts, our likes, our digital interactions. This ownership translates into power—the power to leverage our data for advertising, the power to influence and even sell our digital profiles.
Research by Crypto.com in 2022 shows we spend about 2.5 hours daily on social media—a significant portion of our waking lives immersed in a digital space that’s meticulously recording our every click.
Daily time spent on social networking by internet users according to crypto.com research.
But it’s not just about data—it’s also about our voices. Centralized platforms can silence us by censoring content or removing users entirely.
Web3 and SocialFi: A New Era of Digital Empowerment
Enter Web3 and SocialFi, a merger of social networking with the principles of decentralized finance (DeFi). Here, you reclaim control over your data. Encryption enhances your privacy, shielding your digital activity from prying eyes.
SocialFi isn’t just about data control; it’s about economic participation. You can monetize your social engagement and creative content directly, establishing a more equitable ecosystem for creators.
Platforms like SuperDapp champion this new era with end-to-end encryption for all communications, ensuring that conversations remain between the intended parties alone. SuperDapp also anonymizes user data, making personal information and metadata indecipherable to anyone but the user.
Moreover, the decentralized and censorship-resistant fabric of SuperDapp ensures that no single entity can control or censor user data, preserving the freedom of expression. This independence from central control is not just a feature; it’s the foundation of a platform where users truly own their digital existence.
Transparency and Algorithmic Fairness
The transition to Web3 social media is reshaping the digital landscape into a collaborative environment. Here, creators, users, and the platform work in tandem fostering a scenario where everyone wins. Web3 redefines the social media framework, ushering in a new age of openness and fair market practices for algorithms and app features.
SuperDapp, at the forefront of this change, champions AI-powered SocialFi, ensuring a transparent approach to content ranking and rewards. Gone are the days of opaque algorithms—SuperDapp’s transparency gives everyone an insight into what content gains traction and why.

Powered by blockchain and smart contracts, AiDA, SuperDapp’s AI companion, dynamically adapts based on user interactions, refining the platform to cater to individual preferences. This not only heightens user satisfaction but also encourages a tailored experience for each user.

SuperDapp’s AiDA provides a personalized approach to enhance user experience. Read more about it in this extensive article by DroomDroom.

Furthermore, SuperDapp rewards developers directly through its innovative monetization strategy for AI plugins. As users engage with AI features, developers reap the benefits, all enabled by SuperDapp’s flexible payment system, which supports subscription models seamlessly.

Our journey through the emerging world of decentralized social media illuminates a path of autonomy and fairness, with SuperDapp leading the charge. It’s clear that platforms like SuperDapp aren’t just altering the digital landscape; they are setting new standards for creator compensation, user agency, and data stewardship.
SuperDapp transcends the limitations of traditional platforms by offering a user-driven ecosystem where the value generated is shared equitably, bolstering both creator sustainability and community engagement. The privacy, security, and transparency ingrained in decentralized systems are not just features—they’re foundational pillars that reshape our online interactions and content consumption.
As we close this discussion, it’s evident that the shift towards platforms like SuperDapp represents more than an evolution in social media—it heralds a renaissance of digital empowerment and connection, unshackled from the constraints of centralized control. In this new era, every like, share, and interaction is a step towards a more inclusive, secure, and user-centric online world.

Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price trajectory has fueled speculation and uncertainty, particularly as the cryptocurrency struggles amidst a three-day losing streak. Currently hovering around $57,280, with an intraday low of $56,750, Bitcoin’s performance in the market remains lackluster.
 This decline coincides with broader market movements, with the global crypto market cap slumping by 6.4%, standing at $2.22 trillion presently. Investors are closely eyeing the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision, reflecting apprehension about its potential impact on cryptocurrency investments.
Bitcoin Price Drops Pre-FOMC Meeting Amid USD Strength

Bitcoin‘s price has declined over the last three days ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with investors bracing for a potentially hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) stance. The Federal Reserve’s policy committee is expected to affirm a cautious and gradual strategy towards reducing interest rates in 2024. However, greater focus may be placed on the Fed’s plans regarding its balance sheet.
The CME FedWatch Tool indicates a mere 4.4% chance of a rate cut, with 95.6% anticipating rates to remain steady between 525 and 550 basis points.  The Federal Open Market Committee will wrap up its two-day April policy meeting today and announce its decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will then speak at a press conference starting at 2:30 p.m. Futures markets have largely priced in the likelihood of no adjustment to interest rates during this meeting.

Bitcoin, now trading around $56,500, has plunged over 7% in 24 hours amid renewed economic uncertainty.
Investor sentiment leans towards the Fed refraining from rate cuts this year, adversely affecting assets like cryptocurrencies.
The US dollar has strengthened on upbeat Employment Cost Index data and Fed officials’ remarks signalling no immediate rate cut necessity, exacerbating pressure on BTC prices and the crypto market overall.

Bitcoin Price Prediction











Bitcoin (BTC/USD) encountered a substantial decline. It is now priced at $57,332, reflecting a 6.4% downturn. The pivotal price levels and indicators are essential to the technical landscape. At present, the pivot point rests at $59,008, with immediate resistance observed at $61,569, followed by subsequent hurdles at $64,654 and $67,084. Conversely, support levels stand at $55,051, $53,072, and $51,035. Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewNoteworthy indicators include an oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 25, signalling a potential reversal, and the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (50 EMA) positioned at $63,473, potentially acting as resistance. Below the pivotal level of $59,008, the outlook remains bearish, with a breakthrough indicating a shift towards a more bullish sentiment, while a failure may reinforce the prevailing bearish bias. Traders should closely monitor these levels for strategic decision-making.Unlock Cryptocurrency Rewards: Join the 99Bitcoins Presale Now!

                            Mollars Token Presale Extended As First Crypto Exchange Confirms It Will Launch                        
                        

                         Mollars token presale has had an exhilarating 2024, becoming the top  verifiable cryptocurrency initial coin offering. Transparent with their ICO wallet addresses, every bit of the 1.2-million-dollars raised thus far is able to be verified by investors as it surpasses 67% sold out.   Now, the store of value token for Ethereum Blockchain has extended the presale,  allowing Bitmart crypto exchange the time to confirm its launch on their CEX.“#BitMart is thrilled to announce the upcoming listing of Mollars token (MOLLARS) @mollarstoken” wrote the popular crypto exchange on X [fka twitter].9-Million Crypto Traders Confirmed To Get Access to Mollars
 The prominent cryptocurrency exchange has over 9-million users internationally and is the first to confirm that Mollars token will launch.  With just a total token supply of just 10-million, perhaps the one exchange would be enough to exhaust all whole $MOLLARS tokens.Regardless, it’s not the only exchange set to list Mollars. According to an official reddit post, multiple exchanges have already confirmed they will list the new Bitcoin rival.   Due to the policy of CEXES however, the names cannot be released before the token has launched.The listings come with a slight price however;  Mollars token has had to push back their launch date to the end of the month, May 31st.  Reason for ICO Extension
The pullback will allow crypt investors more time to invest in the new cryptocurrency during its initial coin offering stage but also help ensure the liquidity pool is $1-million-dollars or as close to it as possible.This token presale has a hard cap of $2-million-dollars, which will be distributed between liquidity pool and brand development according to the tokenomics report [via Mollars.com].Crypto News Youtube show host, ‘Ari,’ did a review on the Mollars tokenomics calling the structure legitimate and showing potential for an ‘explosive’ token growth; possibly a 20x in ROI yields for ICO investors..VIDEO Other reasons cited for the extension include the loss of 45 days during the ICO.  Earlier, domain registry shell company “NJAL.LA,” which is owned by one of the cofounders of SilkRoad, attempted to hijack Mollars.com.  The action was quickly reversed after CryptoNews.com put out a report on the situation, including names of parties involved. Before the situation, Mollars token presale was averaging around 90,000 token sales per day.   It tools nearly 1.5 months for the ICO to reach similar averages.Today, Mollars initial coin offering is back to its normal pre-sales totals.   Crypto investors bought nearly $28,000 [9.3ETH] of $MOLLARS tokens in the last 24 hours alone.If the these stats continue,  excluding weekends, Mollars should raise over $650,000 between now and the May 31st deadline; Enough to put the ICO very close to hard cap.  This would help solidify the store-of-value token’s liquidity pool and maximize the token’s price potential on listing day.

Forbes Warned About These 20 Altcoins! "XRP, Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) are also on the list!" - Bitcoin Sistemi

Forbes, a well-known American magazine with a history of more than 100 years, recently published a striking report.
Although Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins are becoming more used and adopted day by day, Forbes described some blockchains and altcoins as “zombies”.


Mentioning 20 altcoins, Forbes also included popular altcoins such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classis (ETC).
According to Forbes, these altcoins do not meet traditional measures of success, exhibiting minimal utility and user adoption.





It was stated that the common feature of these altcoins is that they do not have any practical denominator and a significant user base. Forbes argues that all of these altcoins have a speculative structure.
These altcoins were listed as follows: XRP, ADA, LTC, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Internet Computer (ICP), ETC, Stellar (XLM), Stacks (STX), Kaspa (KAS), Theta (THETA), Phantom (FTM) , Monero (XMR), Arweave (AR), Algorand (ALGO), Flow (FLOW), MultiversX (EGLD), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Mina (MINA), Tezos (XTZ) and Eos (EOS).

Shiba Inu is currently one step away from a potential catastrophe, as it faces potential selling pressure that could theoretically push it below $0.00001. The asset has recently landed on a strong support level at $0.000021, as indicated by the blue line on the chart. This level is crucial for Shiba Inu’s short-term stability, and any breach below could intensify selling pressure.Currently, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average is playing a pivotal role in providing support to the price. This technical indicator often acts as a psychological barrier for traders and can either bolster buying confidence or, if broken, lead to increased selling. If Shiba Inu's price falls below this EMA, it will encounter the next major support at the 200-day EMA.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewUnfortunately, if the price breaks down below the 200-day EMA, the next significant level of support is notably lower, below $0.00001. Such a move would practically negate the uptrend Shiba Inu has enjoyed throughout 2024, possibly resetting market expectations and investor sentiment around the asset.In terms of resistance, Shiba Inu faces immediate barriers at $0.0000228 and $0.0000245. These levels represent short-term goals for the asset to reclaim to sustain its bullish momentum. Overcoming these could push the asset back into bullish territory and rekindle investor interest, potentially leading to a price surge. It would also mark the recovery of the cryptocurrency market in general.Looking ahead, the future of Shiba Inu is tied to its ability to maintain above these critical support levels. A sustained breakdown below $0.000021 could trigger a cascade of selling, weakening recent gains and aggravating the sentiment surrounding the meme coin.

Ethereum Founder Buterin Warns Against Hardware Wallet Use


								In a statement on X that counters the prevailing wisdom among crypto enthusiasts, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has recently expressed reservations about the reliance on hardware wallets for securing digital assets.
Buterin’s commentary emerged during a broader conversation on crypto security, which featured insights from several leading figures from the Ethereum ecosystem.
Why The Ethereum Founder Doesn’t Use Hardware Wallets
The debate illuminated the complexities of digital asset security and showcased a range of opinions on how best to protect these assets. Peter Watts, founder of Reservoir, pointed out the inherent risks associated with hardware wallets. He emphasized the potential personal errors that can undermine the security of such devices.
“Counterpoint: when using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself. Beware of the footguns: Someone finds your stashed seed, You hide the seed so well you forget, You put the seed in a bank safety deposit then hastily move overseas due to covid,” Watts commented, reflecting a critical vulnerability — human error, which can lead to significant security breaches even with robust technological safeguards.
Responding to these concerns, Buterin elaborated on his personal approach to crypto security. He stated, “The above is why I use a multisig (@safe) for >90% of my personal funds. M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don’t reveal who those other people are, even to each other. Decentralize your own security.”
Buterin’s approach involves a multisig configuration, which requires multiple keys to authorize transactions, thereby dispersing the risk and reducing the chances of theft or loss due to a single point of failure.
During the discussion, tobbykitty.eth proposed an alternative method known as Shamir’s Secret Sharing, a cryptographic scheme that divides a secret into multiple parts. He argued for its benefits in eliminating the need to trust others during the recovery phase, asserting that this method allows full control over the cryptographic keys without involving others.

However, Buterin countered this suggestion, pointing out the practical difficulties associated with implementing Shamir’s Secret Sharing correctly, noting, “It’s way easier to screw up than a multisig.” He also cautioned about the practical use of Shamir’s method.
“It depends who’s storing the shamir shares! I think the questions (i) ‘trust your other devices’ vs ‘trust your friends’ (ii) shamir vs multisig are orthogonal,” Buterin concluded. Thus, he underscored the complexity and potential for user error inherent in implementing Shamir’s method effectively.
The starting point of the debate was a post by Kofi, associated with gasfees.io. He provided a real-world perspective on the importance of using hardware wallets despite their potential drawbacks. He vividly described the emotional and financial impact of losing significant crypto holdings and advocated for the use of hardware wallets as a fundamental component of a comprehensive security strategy.

He said, “Buy a hardware wallet today and start using it ASAP. Send a little ETH to your hardware wallet from your hot wallet (Metamask, Phantom, Rainbow .etc). Then move the majority of your funds to your hardware wallet, everything you won’t critically need for the next few days. Store the wallet somewhere safe.”
Kofi’s advice reflects a pragmatic approach to crypto security, emphasizing the importance of protecting against online threats. However, he later also acknowledged in response to the Ethereum founder that investors with a large portion of their net worth in cryptocurrencies should consider using a multisig wallet. “With a multisig, multiple keys (can be a combination of hardware and hot wallets) are needed to sign any transaction,” he added.
At press time, the Ethereum price was at $2,916.

Why did Ethereum dive below $3K? Decoding ETH's sudden 6% fall - AMBCrypto



Ethereum has dropped below the $3,000 price range.
ETH supply in profit dropped by around five million.

The Ethereum [ETH] market witnessed a substantial price downturn as trading activity concluded on the 30th of April. This decline had notable repercussions on several key metrics associated with the asset.
Ethereum falls 6%
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Ethereum revealed a negative conclusion to April, marked by a significant price drop. 
On the 30th of April, ETH experienced a decline of 6.29%, trading at approximately $3,013, just managing to hold onto the $3,000 price level.
 However, as of the latest update, the decline persisted, pushing Ethereum below the $3,000 threshold. Its price was around $2,972 at press time. 
Source: TradingView
Initially, Ethereum seemed poised to breach its short-term moving average (yellow line), which acted as resistance in the $3,300 to $3,500 range. 
However, the recent downturn has pushed it further away from this target, and forced Ethereum to cross another significant threshold on its Relative Strength Index (RSI). 
At press time, ETH dipped below 40 on the RSI, signaling a strong bearish trend.
Longs feel the heat of the dip
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Ethereum’s liquidation chart on Coinglass revealed a notable surge in liquidation volume on the 30th of April. 
The king of altcoins witnessed its highest liquidation volume in weeks, totaling over $115 million by the end of trading that day. 
Further examination of the chart highlighted that long positions bore the brunt of the liquidation, accounting for approximately $97.4 million. In comparison, short positions contributed $18.11 million to the total. 
Source: Coinglass
This spike in long liquidation marked the most significant volume seen in weeks, signifying that traders who had taken long positions or anticipated an increase in Ethereum’s price had their positions forcibly closed.
Possible reasons for the Ethereum decline
There has been discussion surrounding the Hong Kong ETFs launched on the 30th of April, with some observers expressing disappointment in their performance, citing low volume. 
Figures indicated a total volume of around $12.7 million, with Bitcoin comprising over $9.7 million and Ethereum over $3 million. 
However, contrasting views suggest that the volume was decent and not a failure, as suggested by other observers. The sluggish start contributed to the negative movement in Ethereum’s price. 
Additionally, concerns about the Federal Reserve potentially maintaining its hawkish stance at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on the 1st of May may have fueled the decline. 
With no expectations of a rate cut due to persistent inflation in the US economy, the crypto market has historically exhibited declines leading up to FOMC meetings as investors exercise caution in anticipation of policy shifts.

Ethereum supply in profit declines
Ethereum’s supply in profit revealed a sharp decline. Per AMBCrypto’s analysis via Santiment, between the 28th and the 30th of April, ETH’s supply in profit dropped from over 87% to approximately 83%. 
This shift indicated a decrease in volume from over 119 million to around 114 million ETH. It suggested that more holders were increasingly retaining their ETH assets at a loss as the price continued to decline.

Yuga Labs CEO Initiates Overhaul Amid Layoffs and Restructuring



                    

Yuga Labs CEO Greg Solano faced a challenging day, as he conveyed to company employees in a message subsequently shared with the public. 



Following an all-hands meeting where layoffs were disclosed, some staff members experienced an even tougher time. Solano attributed Yuga’s struggles to losing its original direction.




In his internal communication, Solano reflected on his two-month tenure as CEO, lamenting the erosion of the company’s creative ethos:



“The creative-first spirit that drove this company from inception has been getting muddied by labyrinthine corporate processes. 



“We work hard and we care but somehow end up with groups and committees. 




“We plan more than we ship.”“Creator royalties were thriving and made our whole ecosystem electric. Now we’re in hard mode,” Solano said, but he has a plan.



Solano outlined initial steps in the restructuring, citing the spinout of HV-MTL and Legends of the Mara on April 17. 



Yuga’s gaming properties were acquired by game developer Faraway, with Yuga’s chief gaming officer Spencer Tucker joining them.

Solano’s message on April 26 emphasized Yuga’s focus on developing its Otherside metaverse project.



Shortly before Solano’s announcement, Won Kim was appointed as Yuga’s head of brand partnerships. Kim, co-founder of the Bored Room Ventures NFT fund and consulting agency, left his previous position for Yuga.



The X crypto community had mixed reactions to the layoffs, though Solano’s post garnered overwhelming support. 



Amidst supportive responses, there were also dissenting voices. One individual, Ricefarmer, claimed to have been laid off from Yuga Labs and highlighted their former role as a Discord moderator.



Yuga Labs, known for pioneering NFT collectibles, has faced challenges amid market evolution. In October, the company underwent restructuring, which included a round of layoffs.



When approached for further comment, Yuga Labs declined to provide additional information.

Bitcoin's correction might extend to $50,000: Standard Chartered - Crypto Briefing




Stubborn inflation, the unlikelihood of near-term rate cuts, and cooling demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – all of these factors could prolong Bitcoin’s price correction to $50,000, according to Standard Chartered.“BTC’s proper break below $60K has now reopened a route to the $50-52K range,” Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered told The Block, adding that the downward trend is attributed to a mix of crypto-specific factors and broader economic conditions.Bitcoin’s ongoing price decline coincides with a series of outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs and the lukewarm reception of similar products in Hong Kong.Kendrick points out that liquidity measures in the US have deteriorated, which negatively affects assets like cryptos that typically benefit from high liquidity environments.The backdrop of strong US inflation and the reduced likelihood of Fed rate cuts are further contributing to tightening liquidity, impacting investment flows into riskier assets like Bitcoin, he noted.Bitcoin wobbles ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting. Yesterday, Bitcoin’s price plunged as low as $59,500 and extended its correction to $57,000 earlier this morning in the lead-up to the Fed’s key decision.Kendrick suggests that a potential re-entry into Bitcoin could be considered in the $50,000 to $52,000 range, especially if upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data proves to be favorable, potentially easing some macroeconomic pressures.“Of course, liquidity matters when it matters, but with a backdrop of strong U.S. inflation data and less likelihood of Fed rate cuts, it matters at the moment,” he explained. “Re-enter BTC in the $50-52k range or if US CPI on the 15th is friendly.”Standard Chartered doubles down on its $150,000 price target by year-endKendrick stated in an interview with Bloomberg BNN last month that Bitcoin could hit $150,000 by the end of this year and rise to $200,000 by the end of 2025.Despite the current market dynamics, he reaffirmed these price targets for 2024 and 2025. The analyst told The Block that while progress might be slow at first, a significant rally could be expected closer to the anticipated Trump election victory, particularly from September through to the end of the year.

Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht Fears He May Be Silenced in Prison Forever: Details


Ross Ulbricht is the founder of the ill-famed darkweb marketplace The Silk Road, shut down in 2013 after running for two years under Ulbricht’s leadership. Having spent more than a decade in prison already, he has tweeted that now, U.S. authorities may deprive him of his connection to the crypto community – his social media presence.Ulbricht announced that he may be deprived of his voice on social media soon. According to his tweet, the Bureau of Prisons is considering preventing prisoners from using any social media in the future - even those who have accounts run by their close relatives.The founder of The Silk Road confessed that he is afraid of being unable to write on the X platform anymore to share his life with the crypto community. Thus, he fears he may be silenced in prison until the end of his life. The cryptocurrency community has expressed their concerns and support of Ulbricht over this development.Ulbricht recently celebrated his 40th birthday after having spent 11 years behind bars. He was given two life-time sentences without the chance of parole.He often uses his X account to share the details of his life inside prison with his followers and well-wishers.Earlier this year, former “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver emphasized the importance of Ulbricht and The Silk Road for early Bitcoin adoption – all the illegal trade, a lot of which was about trading illicit drugs, was powered by BTC as a new form of money not controlled by the U.S. government.As reported by U.Today, Roger Ver was arrested in Spain yesterday on charges of tax evasion in the U.S. He is now awaiting extradition to the U.S.

Bitcoin L2s set to explode as Runes congest BTC network

The need for Bitcoin layer-2 (L2) solutions has become more apparent than ever following the launch of the Runes protocol. Runes are a new Bitcoin (BTC) token standard allowing users to create fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. They were created by Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, which enabled Bitcoin nonfungible tokens.While notable, Runes’ popularity has resulted in astronomical Bitcoin transaction fees and unprecedented network congestion. A Dune Analytics dashboard shows that millions of Runes transactions have been processed, accounting for 68% of all Bitcoin transactions made since the protocol launched. According to research from blockchain asset management firm Spartan Group, the introduction of Ordinals resulted in Bitcoin fees increasing as much as 280% year-to-date by December 2023. The report notes that this marked heightened activity on the Bitcoin network, reflecting demand for Bitcoin L2 scaling solutions. Rena Shah, vice president of products and operations at Trust Machines, told Cointelegraph, “641,668 Bitcoin transactions occurred on Bitcoin because users wanted to etch Runes and make their BTC productive. Transaction bloat is the canary for Bitcoin builders in the coal mine. It’s time for L2s to scale in the direction users are going.”Shah believes that a “Bitcoin L2 summer” is unfolding, which will result in an influx of scaling solutions.“Similarly, when Ethereum transaction fees became unbearable for daily use, the community quickly embraced L2s,” she added. Recent: Changpeng Zhao four-month prison sentence lighter than expectedDaniel Fogg, CEO of Rootstock Labs, told Cointelegraph that while Bitcoin can handle Runes’ increased activity, the main chain fees present an opportunity for L2s that can successfully scale the network and expand its functionality. “Runes (like Ordinals and inscriptions) have brought excitement back to the idea of building on Bitcoin. But if you are going to build a new economy, storing and transferring value are not enough. You need Turing-complete smart contracts, developer tools and much more,” he added.Bitcoin L2s in developmentGiven these needs, a number of Bitcoin L2 solutions are coming to fruition. For example, Fogg said that Rootstock is a Bitcoin L2 solution that combines the security of Bitcoin with the programmability of Ethereum. Rootstock falls into Spartan Group’s “Big Four” category for emerging Bitcoin L2 solutions. According to Spartan Group’s Bitcoin Layers Report, Rootstock brought Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible smart contracts to Bitcoin through its RSK Virtual Machine, known as RVM. The report notes, “With RVM, developers can port Ethereum contracts on top of Bitcoin.” Comparison of “Big Four” Bitcoin L2s. Source: Spartan GroupFogg noted that Rootstock is one of the longest-running Bitcoin sidechains, with over $460 million bridged in total value locked.“Over 60% of the hashing power of Bitcoin secures Rootstock through its unique merged mined consensus mechanism. Even Bitcoin’s latest halving block contained a Rootstock tag,” Fogg remarked.The Stacks network, which launched in January 2021, is another well-known Bitcoin L2. The Stacks Bitcoin L2 uses a proof-of-transfer consensus mechanism that runs parallel to and reuses the computational power of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus.Shah said that while Stacks has been in development for years, the network will soon receive a major upgrade that will finally make it a usable Bitcoin L2.She said, “The Stacks Nakamoto is a major upcoming upgrade for the Stacks layer, making it faster and more secure.” Specifically speaking, Shah explained that the upgrade will create faster block times, Bitcoin finality and miner extractable value upgrades.“With these changes, Stacks is moving into a true, usable L2 category that unlocks BTC capital from the layer-1 for use in L2 apps. Think DeFi [decentralized finance], Web3 identities, real-world assets and more. $1 trillion in BTC capital can finally shift from a passive asset to a productive asset,” said Shah. More Bitcoin L2s underwayWhile Rootstack and Stacks are some of the longest-standing Bitcoin L2s, Fogg believes that more solutions are on the horizon. Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder of Build on Bitcoin (BOB), told Cointelegraph that he estimates at least 40 Bitcoin L2s have recently been announced. “I’ve been following this space closely and have come across a few websites that list emerging Bitcoin L2s,” said Zamyatin.Zamyatin added that BOB — a hybrid L2 solution — will launch its mainnet on May 1.“BOB combines Bitcoin features with the innovation capabilities of Ethereum like EVM, smart contracts and self-custody Web3 wallets,” he said. Bitcoin L2s create more use casesWhile these innovations will likely positively impact the Bitcoin network, it’s important to understand their impact on Runes.Knut Arne Vinger, chief technology officer and co-founder of Coinweb Labs, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin L2 solutions can extend Runes’ functionality, making them more composable with other Bitcoin data. This is important, as it’s been noted that Runes are currently akin to memecoins with little, if any, utility. Yet Vinger explained that a Coinweb reactive smart contract can be used to monitor transactions involving Runes to add mechanisms such as collateralization and other incentive mechanisms to extend use cases. “Coinweb is about to activate its unifying L2 computation layer on top of Bitcoin, which will allow users to run smart contracts on Bitcoin using their existing Bitcoin wallets. We believe that this, combined with mechanisms for settlement in native Bitcoin, will be a game changer,” he said.Recent: Q-Day approaching: Can Ethereum survive a quantum emergency?Fogg added that other Bitcoin L2 solutions are focused on creating stronger, safer bridges to Bitcoin using BitVM. ZeroSync project lead Robin Linus announced BitVM in a white paper titled “BitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin” on Oct. 9, 2023. BitVM enables Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without altering Bitcoin’s consensus rules.“This opens up the possibility of developing optimistic rollups connected to Bitcoin,” said Fogg. “Most of the L2s that have published white papers or launched testnets in recent months are doing some variant of this.”However, Fogg warned that many Bitcoin L2 solutions being developed today may just be for hype. “Rootstock’s view is that in order to be considered a Bitcoin L2, the blockchain must use BTC as its native asset, use Bitcoin as a settlement mechanism to enforce transactions and demonstrate a functional dependence on Bitcoin. Everything else is just affinity marketing,” he remarked.

Tokenized real-world assets nears $8 billion in value as demand grows


The total value locked (TVL) in Real-World Assets (RWA) has seen explosive growth over the last year, with the TVL surging to $8 billion.
The Real-World Assets sector has experienced substantial growth over the past year, with new protocols emerging that broaden the range of tokenizable assets. This expansion has propelled the TVL from approximately $2 billion at the start of 2023 to nearly $8 billion.
According to a detailed analysis by Messari released in May, stablecoins like USDC and USDT have dominated asset tokenization, representing the bulk of on-chain tokenized assets. 


However, the landscape began to shift significantly over the past year with the advent of protocols aimed at broadening the spectrum of tokenized assets. This expansion has been pivotal in increasing the TVL to almost $8 billion now.

Real-world assets growth and demand
RWA protocols offer exposure either to off-chain interest rates or to the price movements of non-interest-bearing assets. They are further categorized by the nature of the investment—either as debt or equity—each carrying distinct risk and return profiles. The clear trend is toward protocols that provide stable and high returns, with debt instruments particularly favored due to their lower volatility and straightforward yield generation.
The decentralized finance (DeFi) analytics platform DeFiLlama supports these findings but reports a slightly lower TVL of $6 billion. Despite the discrepancy, both sources underscore a monumental 700% growth in protocol TVL since the beginning of 2023, painting a picture of rapidly increasing market interest and investment in these types of assets.
Not only has the total value locked seen impressive growth, but the number of active users on RWA protocols has also risen markedly since February, signaling a boost in popularity among smaller retail investors, according to Dune Analytics. Protocols like the digital carbon market platforms Toucan and KlimaDAO, and the real estate tokenization protocol Propy, have experienced significant user growth.

One of the key growth areas within RWA protocols is the focus on yield-bearing assets, designed to bridge the gap between off-chain yields and on-chain users. The divergence between on-chain and off-chain yields, especially noticeable during periods of rising interest rates, has renewed interest in these tokenization models.

Protocols like MakerDAO, which uses U.S. Treasury bills as collateral for its DAI stablecoin, and others such as Ondo and Mountain Protocol, are significant contributors to this segment. These platforms have helped stabilize the yield-bearing stablecoin market, despite it being a smaller part of the RWA ecosystem with just over $1 billion in TVL.
Consumer trends and investments
Despite the diverse offerings within the RWA market, consumer trends show a pronounced preference for yield-bearing assets, which now account for over 90% of the sector’s TVL. This preference is further highlighted by the minimal market traction of non-yield-bearing assets like tokenized gold and real estate, suggesting that the market is skewed towards investments that offer direct returns.
The world’s largest tokenized treasury fund, BlackRock’s Ethereum-based Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), and Franklin Templeton’s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) have made significant contributions to the RWA sector’s expansion. These funds have not only attracted substantial capital but have also set new standards for integrating traditional financial assets with blockchain technology.
As the landscape for tokenized real-world assets continues to mature, the sector’s growth trajectory suggests a strong market shift towards assets that offer tangible yields. This shift is largely driven by the blockchain community’s preference for investments that merge traditional financial stability with the innovative potential of digital assets. 
With nearly $8 billion in TVL and rising user engagement, the future of RWA protocols looks promising as they bridge the gap between conventional asset markets and the digital finance realm.

This Meme Coin Defies the Negative Market Trends With a 800% Weekly Surge: Details


																TL;DR

The cryptocurrency market has recently suffered heavy losses, with major assets experiencing significant declines.
Despite the downturn, there is one meme coin that saw a dramatic increase, surging 800% in a week after being launched on PancakeSwap and receiving backing from Crypto.com.


The cryptocurrency sector recently erased much of the gains recorded in the last few months, with its global market capitalization plunging to as low as $2.2 billion. The leading digital assets – Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and many more – are deep in the red on a 7-day scale.
The bloodbath in the meme coin is even more severe. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 22% weekly, while dogwifhat (WIF) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) have lost nearly 30% of their valuations for the same period. 
However, one asset of that type stands well in the green amid the grim reality, and its name is Crow With Knife (CAW).




The meme coin saw the light of day in mid-March, but its price started rallying by the end of last month. It is up almost 50% on a 24-hour scale and a whopping 800% weekly. In addition, its market capitalization surpassed the $100 million mark. 
CAW Price, Source: CoinGecko
CAW’s latest price explosion coincides with the asset’s launch on the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap. Previously, it received support from the popular cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com, which opened trading services with it.
Other meme coins that have turned into sensations in the past several months include dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), BOOK OF MEME (BOME), and more. Interestingly, they are all built on the Solana blockchain, whereas CAW is a token part of the Cronos ecosystem.
The rapid price movements in the meme coin sector as of late are yet another example of the cohort’s infamous volatility. If you are about to jump on the bandwagon, please check our dedicated video to protect yourself from some common mistakes:

Agora raises $5M for solve 'chaotic' protocol governance - Crypto Briefing




Agora, a cross-chain platform offering a new standard of governance tools for decentralized protocols, has raised $5 million in a seed funding round led by Haun Ventures. The round also saw participation from Coinbase Ventures, Seed Club Ventures, and Consensys Ventures, among others. Agora aims to help protocols organize their voting systems and tackle the often chaotic nature of token-holding voter governance.Co-founder Yitong Zhang, a former designer at Coinbase said in an interview that current systems for governance voting were “chaotic.” With Agora, however, Zhang believes that users can “have all the benefits of having your equity directly on the internet without the chaos.” Agora’s other co-founders, Charlie Feng and Kent Fenwick, bring experience from multibillion-dollar fintech Clearco, where Feng was a co-founder and Fenwick served as an engineering executive.Agora has already attracted notable customers such as Uniswap, Optimism, and Nouns. The startup plans to use the new funding to invest in its product and keep up with the increasing demand it has seen in the last quarter. The company is committed to building for the long term and open-sourcing its software under the MIT license to advance the ecosystem.This approach has also led to contributions from various developers, governance tooling teams, and startups in the development of Agora’s API.The company believes that token-backed voting and collective governance are the best ways to move the internet away from “walled gardens” and transition it from private enterprises to common protocols. While the Web2 era may have mastered private apps, Agora sees collective protocols as being in their infancy. Unlike static, traditional protocols like HTTP that require little to no management, crypto protocols are constantly evolving ecosystems that require consensus from a complex array of stakeholders.According to Zhang, protocols may be perceived as “fundamentally less effective” than equity-governed apps (private companies) due to a lack of investment in tooling. Agora’s mission is to address this issue by making the development of MIT-licensed software for running protocols its top priority. The company acknowledges that the outcome of this venture is uncertain and the work is challenging, but it believes the goal and timing are right.

Four New Solana Memecoins That Could Surge 8,000% and Take on Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Market Bloodbath: $500 Million Worth of Crypto Longs Liquidated


Over $500 million worth of cryptocurrency long positions were liquidated recently, signaling a reversal on the cryptocurrency market. This catastrophic drop, obviously caused by Bitcoin's drop below $60,000, has not only impacted major cryptocurrencies but could cause troubles for smaller tokens.The Bitcoin chart demonstrates a severe drop below the critical support level of $60,000, cascading down to around $57,000. This massive sell-off triggered widespread panic selling and liquidations. Such extensive liquidations can exacerbate market declines, pushing prices further down as traders rush to close positions, either voluntarily or through forced liquidations.Source: CoinGlassInterestingly, while long liquidations dominated the structure of the market, the last few hours saw a noticeable increase in short liquidations. As traders awaited further drops and positioned themselves in shorts with some leverage, a slight squeeze occurred. This unexpected shift led to a minor rebound in prices, suggesting a short-term recovery might be possible. However, do not place too much hope in it as it could be purely speculative. For Bitcoin, the next support level to watch is around $55,000. If this level fails to hold, the next significant support lies near the $52,000 mark. Resistance, on the other hand, can be found at $60,000 and then at $63,000. A break above these levels could signal a potential recovery, but the source for such a move remains unclear.The current market situation paints a grim picture for the long-term outlook. The high volume of liquidations indicates a lack of confidence among investors, which could discourage the inflow of new capital essential for sustaining higher price levels. For smaller assets like Shiba Inu, Cardano or even XRP sentiment and investor enthusiasm, the outlook is even darker. The loss of confidence from major cryptocurrency holders can ripple down to these smaller assets, potentially leading to significant declines.

These Are the Top Crypto News that Will Make Headlines in May


May 2024 is poised to be a pivotal month for the crypto market, influenced by several critical events that could shape its trajectory.
From key economic indicators to significant regulatory decisions, here’s an overview of what market watchers anticipate this month.
Macroeconomic Factors: Federal Reserve Meeting and April CPI Report
The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, concluding on May 1, is among the most anticipated events. Despite ongoing concerns about persistent inflation, the Fed will likely maintain the borrowing rate steady between 5.25%-5.5%.
This decision could signal a continued conservative approach amidst economic uncertainties, impacting investor sentiment in the crypto sector.
On May 2, the US Treasury Department is slated to announce its refunding plans for the upcoming quarter, potentially offering some relief to markets. After three consecutive quarters of increasing auction sizes, the Treasury plans to steady most of its auction sizes. 
Investors are particularly keen on the details of an anticipated debt repurchase program and its implications for long-term US financing strategies amid escalating debt concerns. Although there may be increases in specific issues like the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), most auctions are expected to remain unchanged, which could influence market liquidity and interest rates.
Another noteworthy development is the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on May 15. As shelter costs contributed to over half of the 3.5% CPI inflation rate as of March 2024, the financial market will keep a close eye on this report. Any significant change might influence the Fed’s monetary policy, impacting crypto market stability.

Spotlight on Hong Kong: The Bitcoin Asia Conference
On the global stage, the Bitcoin Asia Conference in Hong Kong on May 9-10 stands out as a key event. This conference will bring together top figures from the crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) industry, including Han Tongli of Harvest Global Investment Limited and Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs.
The insights and developments shared here could influence market trends, particularly as Hong Kong embraces spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

Legal Challenges: The Tornado Cash Trial and Its Implications
The market is also watching the legal proceedings against Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev in the Netherlands, with a verdict expected on May 14. Pertsev faces charges of money laundering, with prosecutors recommending a 64-month jail sentence.

BeInCrypto reported in August 2022 that the Netherlands Crime Agency (FIOD) arrested Pertsev in Amsterdam following the sanctions from the US treasury upon Tornado Cash. FIOD alleged Persev for sponsoring illicit financial flows, money laundering, and mixing cryptocurrencies through a decentralized Ethereum mixing service, Tornado Cash.
Meanwhile, other Tornado Cash developers in the US, Roman Storm, and Roman Semenov, faced several charges from the Department of Justice (DOJ). The charges include conspiring to commit money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitter, and violating sanctions imposed by OFAC.
The crypto community keenly awaits the outcome of Tornado Cash’s case, which fears it may establish a precedent that threatens developers of privacy-focused software within the ecosystem.
SEC Decisions: The Fate of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs
At the end of the month, the crypto community is also anticipating the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) responses to the spot Ethereum ETF filings. The spotlight is on VanEck’s and ARK’s applications, with deadlines for the SEC’s decision set for May 23 and May 24, respectively.
Despite the anticipation, skepticism runs high among industry experts regarding the SEC’s approval. Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, doubts the spot Ethereum ETF approval.


“The way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs — and right now, pins are dropping as far as Ethereum is concerned,” van Eck explained earlier in April.

VanEck isn’t alone in its pessimism. Industry analysts like James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg Intelligence echo the sentiment. Balchunas himself reduced his approval odds from 70% to less than 35%.
Read more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works 
In addition to the Ethereum ETF filings, the SEC has also postponed decisions on options trading for spot Bitcoin ETFs. A recent notice indicated that the Commission has set May 29, 2024, as the deadline to approve, disapprove, or begin proceedings to decide on the disapproval, thereby allowing the New York Stock Exchange to list options on spot Bitcoin ETFs potentially.

These events collectively bear the potential to either stabilize or volatile the crypto market throughout May 2024. The crypto community remains on high alert, prepared to navigate the outcomes of these developments.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Flashes Epic Bull Flag, What This Means

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently sitting on the edge, with some of its most visible metrics pointing toward an imminent sell-off. Top market analyst Ali Martinez, however, has projected a very intriguing trend for the meme coin. Per his recent exposition, SHIB might be gearing up for a bullish reversal.As noted by Ali Martinez, Shiba Inu is exhibiting a bull flag trend on the daily chart. A bull flag formation is a continuation pattern that is formed amid two major price spikes separated by a brief consolidation period. Shiba Inu outpaced its bearish stalemate earlier this year when its price soared as high as $0.000036 in March. The Shiba Inu trend has, however, buckled under the weight of broader market uncertainty. With the spot Bitcoin ETF losing its inflow traction, the impact has been felt for altcoins, including Shiba Inu.With the bull flag formation, Martinez hinted at a more hyped sentiment. He revealed plans to place a buy order on the token at $0.000018343, as he is "aiming for a bullish breakout that sends $SHIB to $0.000072323."Shiba Inu Bull Flag: Source: X/ali_chartsShiba Inu's ambitions stumpedShiba Inu is currently changing hands for $0.00002108, down by 8.71% in 24 hours and by more than 22% in the past week. However, it has remained elevated in the year-to-date (YTD) period, soaring by 11%.The current bearish market trend has contributed to shifting the project’s focus from the top 10 in ranking to mere survival. Amid the 500% spike in Shiba Inu transaction fees, the outlook of SHIB has not changed, with investors choosing more safety bets overall.With Shibarium serving as a major utility and demand anchor, Shiba Inu community members are not giving up hope on the possibility of imminent revival. Martinez’s charts are also a sentiment booster that can drive prices overall.

Is Bitcoin price bouncing at 57K? Here's why these levels are key

Source: TradingViewBitcoin volatility cools into FOMCData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed skittish BTC price action hours after new lows of $56,500 on Bitstamp.Traders remained on edge across risk assets ahead of the Federal Reserve’s next interest rates announcement and subsequent press conference from Chair Jerome Powell.After the Quarterly Refunding Announcement, or QRA, dealt a blow to the U.S. liquidity outlook, market participants hoped that Powell’s tone after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting would not lean too hawkish.“The FOMC statement and Powell presser this afternoon are likely to confirm USD money market pricing of a much more tepid policy normalization cycle,” Darius Dale, founder and CEO of risk management firm 42 Macro, wrote in part of a digest on X (formerly Twitter). “As much as Chair Powell would prefer to play up ‘two-sided risks to the economic outlook’, the reality is the preponderance of evidence supports the ‘no landing’ scenario as the highest probability outcome. As such, ‘higher for longer’ is likely to be the dominant message today.”Fed target raThe latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool underscored the lackluster expectations for good news, with the odds of the Fed holding rates at their current levels at 99%.Striking a more optimistic tone, popular trader CrypNuevo suggested that the worst Bitcoin and altcoin losses were likely complete.“BTC really dropped hard and this reinforces the idea that whatever Jerome Powell has to say today, it's likely priced-in,” he told X subscribers. “Will we get a retest of the range lows?”BTC/USD annotated chart.

Secondly, if the QRA (Quarterly Refunding Announcement) sees heavy issuances in US bills (front-end) instead of the 10-year (back-end) it would reduce fears of longer-term rates spiking and might put some brakes on the USD rally.”BTC price in "typical" bull market retraceBitcoin traders thus eyed important BTC price levels to watch after multiple lines in the sand fell through.Related: Why is Bitcoin price down today?“This current Bitcoin retrace is slowly turning into an almost 50-day retrace,” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital revealed on the day.An accompanying chart compared BTC price pullbacks throughout the bull market which began in early 2023.Rekt Capital described the latest downside move, coming in at over 20%, as “typical” within this context.“Typical retraces have been 2-3 weeks, longer ones up to 2 months,” he noted.BTC/USD pullback comparison.

As CZ Gets His Sentence, Michael Lewis Should Rewatch 'Star Wars'

BlackRock doubles down on tokenization via investment in Securitize - Blockworks


The world’s largest asset manager appears poised to move deeper into the tokenization space after injecting capital into a tokenization firm it has worked with before.
BlackRock led a $47 million funding round for Securitize, a company focused on bringing physical and traditional financial assets onto the blockchain, the firms said Wednesday. 
Fintech companies and traditional finance giants have increasingly been testing out tokenization, noting that blockchain rails can help reduce costs and improve transparency. BlackRock Larry Fink has called tokenized securities “the next generation for markets.” 
To that end, BlackRock and Securitize are not strangers. 
BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund — the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund — in March, offering a different way to earn US dollar yields. Qualified investors can subscribe to that fund through Securitize Markets.

“We believe that tokenization has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure,” Joseph Chalom, BlackRock’s global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships, said in a statement. “Our investment in Securitize is another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy.”  
Chalom is now a member of Securitize’s board of directors.
Other investors in the $47 million funding round include Hamilton Lane, ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets. 
Private markets investment firm Hamilton Lane in January 2023 made available one of its equity funds through a Securitize feeder fund tokenized on Polygon.

Crypto Exchange Coinbase Adds New Canadian Dollar-Pegged Stablecoin to Listing Roadmap - The Daily Hodl


								The top US crypto exchange Coinbase has announced that a stablecoin pegged to the Canadian dollar could soon be trading on its platform.
Announcing via the social media platform X, Coinbase says it’s adding QCAD to its listing roadmap, which alerts customers that the company could soon add support for certain assets.










QCAD was relaunched last year by digital asset company Stablecorp with the promise to maintain reserves at least equal to the amount of QCAD in circulation on public blockchains. QCAD is available for use on Ethereum (ETH), Stellar (XLM) and Algorand (ALGO) blockchains.
Stablecorp CEO Alex McDougall said last year,
“We are extremely excited to bring this asset back to the Canadian market at scale. With the stability of the Canadian banking system and foreign exchange rates with the US Dollar at multi-year highs, we’ve seen demand for QCAD climb and on-chain foreign exchange volumes with USDC rise. Now, with increased regulatory clarity from the Canadian Securities Administrators, the timing is perfect to bring Canadians a transparent, efficient stablecoin.”
Coinbase also announced support for Solana (SOL)-based Neon EVM (NEON). Neon EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that aims to enable developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (DApps) from EVM chains to Solana. NEON serves as the project’s utility token for gas fees and governance.
NEON is trading at $1.14 at time of writing, down 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

This Analyst Says You Should Sell Your BTC in May and Go Away


																Nic Puckrin, the co-founder and CEO of crypto information portal Coin Bureau, thinks selling one’s bitcoins (BTC) in May would be more profitable than offloading the assets in September.
According to his tweet, the cumulative returns of disposing of one’s cryptocurrencies in May have surpassed selling in September or any other time of the year by over 1000%.
Sell in May and Go Away
Puckrin explained that the phrase “Sell in May, Go Away” is from the traditional finance space and refers to the effect of seasonality. The adage dates back centuries and postulates that the best six months of the year for stocks are recorded from November through April, suggesting that investors should sell in May and wait until October to buy again.
The saying may apply to the crypto sector because in the past five years, buying BTC in October and selling in April has accrued cumulative returns of 1,449% compared to buying in May and selling in September, which had a negative return of -29%.
Puckrin cited a report by cryptocurrency research firm K33 to substantiate his claims, insisting that other studies have shown similar results for the same strategy. Hence, the Coin Bureau CEO believes crypto investors would have realized more profits if they sold their assets last month, especially after BTC rallied to $73,700 for the first time in mid-March and traded around $70,000 for the remainder of the month.




Market Sentiment is Cooling
On-chain indicators and macroeconomic conditions suggest it may be too late for investors to sell their assets now, seeing that May has gotten off to a bad start and market sentiment has started cooling.
The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index shows retail sentiment is waning as it is in neutral territory. Puckrin said Bitcoin search trends have declined, and X is full of doom posts.
Institutions also appear to be less bullish on crypto investment products, as seen in the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market witnessing steady outflows for the past five consecutive trading days. Even the newly-launched ETFs in Hong Kong are seeing much lower inflows than analysts predicted.
In addition, Puckrin disclosed that perpetual funding rates have declined substantially, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures open interest held by non-ETF funds have fallen to their lowest since October 2023.
Meanwhile, BTC has fallen more than 22% from its all-time high and was changing hands at $57,100 at the time of writing.

Gold vs. Bitcoin: Expert predicts May prices for top assets


Though some experts, analysts, and marketers have been rhetorically placing gold and Bitcoin (BTC) in the same category for years, they have seemingly diverged in significant ways in 2024. 
Indeed, while gold has been rising at an incredible pace as economic and geopolitical concerns mount, BTC’s trading is more risk-off, with the most striking example coming at the height of the Israel-Iran war scare when fears seemingly outweighed the optimism stemming from the halving event.
Despite the world’s premier cryptocurrency seeing its highest month-end prices on record in March, Bloomberg’s Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone opined in a recent X post that gold has a substantial upper hand compared to Bitcoin – and, indeed, compared to the S&P 500.


BTC in particular, stands in contrast with gold as, after hitting a new all-time high in March, it saw a massive decline in April which, by May, saw it drop to approximatelly $57,000 – a level some experts identified as a crucial support zone – while the world’s top commodity ended the fourth month at its own record price.
Gains for gold and pain for Bitcoin
McGlone’s most recent analysis follows his previous assessments closely as he sees substantial volatility and arguably the anomalous performance of stocks in a high interest rate environment as some of the crucial headwinds for BTC and S&P 500 and important tailwinds for gold and other commodities.
Additionally, stocks and cryptocurrencies may face trouble ahead in similar ways to commodities when they had to swallow a price cure resulting from a COVID-era price surge back in 2022 before reentering the more recent rally.
“A primary headwind for the S&P 500 may be the high-price cure example that’s afflicted most commodities since 2022. It’s likely not a coincidence that #inflation has remained sticky and FederalReserve rate-cut risks have leaned toward hikes, on the back of the rapidly rising stock index closing at the 5,254 high in 1Q.”

The expert also assessed that the increasingly hawkish rhetoric coming out of the FED is likely only to further emphasize the dynamic, which leans well into his previous forecast that gold is set to surge toward $3,000 per ounce this year.
Finally, McGlone also linked the likely upcoming fortunes of the wider cryptocurrency market to the apparent slowdown that is affecting the stock market and its major indices and explained it might struggle to maintain momentum should the S&P 500 truly end its “almost straight up rally’ – a scenario he judged likely with recent recessionary forecasts – that started after they hit October 2023 lows.
Still, it is noteworthy that the macro strategist’s forecasts – when it comes to cryptocurrencies at least – haven’t historically been the most accurate given that he forecast trouble ahead for the crypto markets less than a month before they entered into a major rally.

FanSociety creator explains how NFTs can bring musicians and fans together

Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, took the world by storm in 2019 — and then eroded to near rubble as the entire crypto market contracted and the industry fell into a nearly two-year-long bear market. An objective assessment of the NFT phenomena might conclude that the technology did deliver on a good deal of its promises, and instead of writing off the failed projects as scams, it might be more insightful to take a closer look at what features were needed to make projects successful. On Episode 35 of The Agenda podcast, hosts Ray Salmond and Jonathan DeYoung spoke with Miles, a Web3 developer who is the creative mind behind FanSociety — a funding mechanism for musicians that borrows and blends ideas from traditional fan clubs of the 1950s with modern crowdfunding ideas and immutable storage on blockchain networks.Tech should be adaptable and give users room to grow Any aspiring musician knows that securing funding for an album is difficult, and of course, once the album is out, locking in fans for life becomes the next hurdle. Miles explained that he envisions FanSociety being used as a tool for creators to connect with their audience, reward loyalty and grow in a way that is more organic than the typical NFT collections that currently exist. He also explained that FanSociety has the dual purpose of allowing musicians to raise money from fans while also rewarding and retaining them by giving them digital artifacts as part of their expanding discography.According to Miles, a recurring issue with NFT collections is that projects often have fixed sizes and creators need to issue a new contract to “extend” the collection:“It doesn’t make sense to have a limit, you know, and kind of just have one smart contract. And, like I said, it’s like a boolean. You either have the token, you either have the NFT or you don’t. And a lot of what was going on as well was very successful musicians were launching NFT projects, and it was kind of that same situation where, you know, they’ve only got 10,000 NFTs available, and you either have one or you don’t. And to me, that’s very elitist and kind of antithetical to kind of the whole Web3 ethos, to me. And so I wanted to do something different.”Related: NFT utility continues to captivate fashion and luxury brands — NFT ParisFan engagement should also have valueRevenue sharing is another issue FanSociety aims to tackle. Miles lamented that popular streaming platforms and record labels only give creators a sliver of the revenue generated by their music and that platforms tend to absorb the bulk of tips that creators receive from fans:“You look at Twitch, for example. You tip somebody, you give them money, you subscribe to them. First of all, the platform takes 50% rev[enue] split, which is atrocious to me. And we don’t know if that’s going to go up in the future, right? The content creators on there don’t know if that’s going to go up to 60%, 70%, if they’re going to throw more fees on top of that. So there’s that kind of problem.”For artists who will use the platform to expand their catalog and engage with fans, Miles said the NFTs can be a more meaningful show of appreciation than “a sticker pack to put in their chat” or something else that is kind of gimmicky and “not very valuable.”Miles said:“I’d like to see more value being able to be given back to the supporters, and so that’s what I’m trying to support. And it’s up to the artist to decide what sorts of things, what sorts of ways they want to show their appreciation to people who support them.”To hear more from Mile’s conversation with The Agenda — including his future plans for FanSociety — listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Witness Chain Soars Past $5B In Delegated ETH Amid Polygon DePIN Push - The Defiant

Witness Chain is the third-largest AVS on EigenLayer with 1.82 million staked Ether delegated.Witness Chain, a proof system for decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) networks, has attracted more than $5 billion worth of delegated stake from EigenLayer restakers.Witness Chain announced the milestone via tweet on April 29. With the project now secured by 1.82 million ETH worth $5.24 billion, Witness Chain ranks as the third largest Actively Validated Service (AVS) on EigenLayer behind Eigen DA with $7.79 billion and Eoracle with $5.36 billion, according to Staking Rewards.“Thanks to our wonderful community, we've surpassed $5B+ in restaked ETH,“ Witness Chain tweeted. “Big hug to all 16,677 stakers, 53 operators, and LRTs for embarking on this journey to unify DePIN economies.”Witness Chain is one of nine AVSs that are currently live on EigenLayer. EigenLayer, the pioneering Ethereum restaking protocol, allows Ethereum stakers to secure third-party AVSs to earn additional yield on top of staking rewards.DePIN EcosystemAccording to Ankr, a blockchain infrastructure provider and Witness Chain node operator, Witness Chain serves to unify the siloed DePIN economy.“Through Witness Chain, a shared economy of integrated physical assets is unlocked, facilitating the exchange of resources like computing power, communication, energy, [and] storage,” Ankr said. “Witness Chain enables DePIN projects to share info about their physical locations, network capabilities, and more. This will allow dePINs to connect with each other, establishing an end-to-end supply chain of decentralized infrastructure.”Witness Chain provides “Watchtower” nodes that function as independent auditors for DePIN networks.The project offers several key services including Proof of Diligence — which verifies that Layer 2 transactions are executed correctly, Proof of Location — which verifies the physical location of DePIN infrastructure, Proof of Bandwidth — which verifies the network bandwidth available to DePIN projects, and a DePIN “Coordination Layer.”Ankr said Witness Chain’s architecture enables the development of new applications on top of the shared DePIN ecosystem.“By enabling DePIN projects to share information like location and capacity, watchtowers help create an interconnected ecosystem,” Ankr said. “Once two physically separated pieces of infrastructure recognize each other’s locations and can ensure enough connectivity, they can communicate with each other to exchange value, drive demand, enhance reliability, and reduce redundancy.”Polygon’s DePIN pushWitness Chain was built using Polygon’s Chain Development Kit (CDK) and is among a growing list of Polygon-based DePIN projects enjoying significant growth.On April 25, Dimo, a Polygon-based DePIN project allowing vehicle owners to collect and monetize data from their vehicles, celebrated that it had onboarded 80,000 vehicles within its network.On April 30 and May 1, PowerPod, a Polygon-based DePIN network connecting electric vehicles, charging stations, and energy storage, attended the Mobility Live ME event in Abu Dhabi.

How Did Shiba Inu Become The 'Dogecoin Killer?' Crypto Whale Thinks 'Its Mission' And This One Factor Were Key - Benzinga

Pseudonymous crypto trader "apatheticwhale" shared his thoughts on the success of Shiba Inu SHIB/USD and the importance of intellectual property (IP) in the meme coin space.What Happened: The trader highlighted how Shiba Inu’s unique approach to creating its character, lore and mission differentiated it from other meme coins that simply repurposed existing memes.Apatheticwhale praised Shiba Inu’s creator, Ryoshi, for not simply stealing an internet meme, and branding a token around it. “What drew me into Shib after it launched was that Ryoshi created a new character with its own lore and mission,” the trader explained.The original blog posts by Ryoshi were particularly compelling, according to the trader, as they established Shiba Inu as the "Doge Killer" with a mission to conquer Dogecoin DOGE/USD. This unique narrative and purpose resonated with the trader, who tends to be "more interested in projects that create their own world, give people a mission to believe in, and create their own unique content."The trader also commented on the recent success of other meme coins, such as Dogwifhat WIF/USD and Pepe PEPE/USD, which have adopted the strategy of repurposing older memes and branding them as the official token of the meme to attract mainstream attention.Also Read: Only Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Have Crossed The $10B Meme Coin Mark: ‘Who Will Be The Third?,’ Muses Crypto WhaleWhy It Matters: Apatheticwhale emphasized the importance of IP in the rapidly evolving meme coin space. He adds that with the “memecoin supercycle” approaching, the market is likely to face challenges related to IP owners reacting to crypto projects that have used their IP without permission.This raises important questions about the sustainability and legal implications of building projects around existing memes.Price Action: At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00002115, down 27% over the past 30 days. DOGE was trading at $0.1239, down 40.7% over the past 30 days.What’s Next: The influence of meme coins and Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next:  ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Shiba Inu Burn Rate Spikes 2,092%, Robinhood Adds SHIB Trading For New York ResidentsThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

What's next for Binance founder CZ after his 4-month sentence? - AMBCrypto



CZ is ready to do his time and move on to the next phase of life.
 Market watchers view Binance founder’s sentence as a “great deal.”

Binance [BNB] founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as “CZ,” commented on his four-month sentence by the Seattle court on the 30th of April. 
Reacting to the sentence on X (formerly Twitter), CZ extended gratitude for the overwhelming support received during the trial and said, 
“I will do my time, conclude this phase, and focus on the next chapter of my life (education).”
Last November, CZ pleaded guilty to violating U.S. money laundering regulations. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, paid $4.3 billion as part of the plea deal. 
Additionally, CZ paid $50 million in fines in the plea deal. However, market watchers viewed the fine as pale compared to his net worth of over $40 billion. 
Market reaction, what’s next for Binance founder?
Some claimed that the four-month sentence is a great deal considering prosecutors proposed a three-year sentence. 
Compared to the 25-year sentence given to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, CZ’s look like a tiny blip. 
One of the market watchers, Autism Capital, claimed, 
“CZ really is the best to ever do it. Unlike Sam, he didn’t lose anyone’s money. He is still a hero to all. He literally memed his  prison sentence into existence. He does 4 months in the easiest camp prison playing pickleball and meditating. Walks away with $47 billion dollars”
Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also acknowledged that CZ got a great deal and quipped, 
“4 months for $40B in gains? $10B per month doesn’t sound too bad. I’d take that trade.
I’d take that trade, too.”
The four-month sentence means CZ will be out by Q4 2024. In March, CZ revealed his new education project, Giggle Academy. 
The project aims to grant free education access to children and will be his main focus when he finishes the sentence. 
However, the former Binance chief reiterated that he will continue being a passive investor in crypto. 
“I will remain a passive investor (and holder) in crypto. Our industry has entered a new phase. Compliance is super important. A silver lining of this whole process is that Binance has been under the microscope. And funds are SAFU.”
In the meantime, the BNB token was down 9% in the past 24 hours. But its price remained above $500, which has been a key psychological support since March.

Bitcoin Milestone Ahead? Analyst Forecasts New Peak This Month


                            In the face of a general market decline and pessimism, Captain Faibik, a cryptocurrency expert and enthusiast, has emerged with an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) foreseeable future trajectory, predicting that the crypto asset could rise to a new all-time high before this current month closes. 
Bitcoin To Reach New All-Time High In May
Faibik’s analysis, which is based on his in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrency dynamics and a sharp eye for market trends, explores the possibility of a large short-term rise in Bitcoin. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is at a key junction currently testing the daily Moving Average 100 (MA100) level once more after recovering from it in the past.
Potential for a new peak in May | Source: Captain Faibik on X
Historically, the crypto asset has found considerable support at the 100MA level. Should BTC recover from this point on, Captain Faibik anticipates a significant rise on the upside in the upcoming days. Thus, he expects the digital asset to reach a new all-time high within the month.
The post read:
Last time, BTC bounced back from the daily MA100, and now it is testing it again. If it bounces back from here, we can expect a Bullish Rally in the coming days. New All the High could be incoming this month
The crypto analyst noted Bitcoin’s price action in the daily timeframe also suggests that a bullish rise is on the horizon. Faibik stated that on the daily timeframe chart, BTC is still moving above the major trendline and inside the green box indicated in his chart. As a result, the analyst expects BTC to undergo a quick comeback.
Related Reading: If History Repeats, This Is How Bitcoin Price Will Perform In The Next 6 Months
Another notable finding from Captain Faibik is that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been drifting below a trendline that has been in place for some months. Although this might indicate a brief waning of positive momentum, Faibik interprets it as a sign of an impending price recovery for Bitcoin. Given that BTC is still moving inside the bullish flag pattern, the expert anticipates a bounce back towards $68,000 in the upcoming days.
$100,000 Price Target For BTC
Captain Faibik’s most bullish target for BTC recently is the $100,000 price mark. Last week, Faibik pointed out key narratives that could catalyze Bitcoin’s price to $100,000 in the coming months.

Furthermore, Faibik highlighted that BTC Bulls have solidly secured the weekly Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 10 following the October 2017 Descending Channel breakout. Due to this, the crypto analyst is setting $100,000 as the digital asset’s next price target.
Following a decrease of more than 13% over the previous 7 days, the price of Bitcoin is currently trading at $57,701. In the last day, its market cap has plummeted by over 6%, while its trading volume has increased by about 61%.

Dogecoin’s Co-creator Billy Markus’ Remarks on Cryptocurrency Market Decline - Coin Edition


							

Billy Markus, co-creator of Dogecoin, expressed doubt about crypto trading during the market crash.



Markus’s remarks highlighted the crypto market’s decline.



Market experts have attributed several factors to this downturn.




Billy Markus, co-creator of Dogecoin, has commented on the current downtrend witnessed by the crypto market. Markus is a crypto influencer with a large following of 2.1 million on X. He uses the pseudonym Shibetoshi Nakamoto and often shares memes and views on various topics, including politics, finance, and cryptocurrency. 



Following the dip of digital assets due to the current crypto market crash, the co-creator expressed doubt over crypto trading, saying, “Man, crypto sure does suck.” 



Markus’s remarks highlighted the crypto market’s decline, led by the plummeting prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Over the past intraday session, Bitcoin slipped by 5.69%, trading at $57,762 during press time. 



Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, lost 3.87% of its value during the same period, reaching $2,894. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, created as a light-hearted parody of Bitcoin, dipped 8%, slipping from $0.1458 to $0.1252. 



Market experts have attributed several factors to this downturn, including Binance founder CZ’s four-month prison sentence for violating the Bank Secrecy Act and money laundering charges. 



In addition, disappointing job reports and the underwhelming performance of Bitcoin-Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong are said to have fueled this current market outlook, as investors expected it to surpass the performance of U.S. ETFs.



Hong Kong-based ETFs have demonstrated a healthy trend, amassing $12.4 million through trading activities. Meanwhile, these funds have seen substantial inflows, totaling $141 million, directed towards Bitcoin and partially into Ethereum.



In comparison, the figure observed upon the launch of U.S. spot ETFs totaled $740 million in assets, with trading volume reaching $4.6 billion. This stark contrast reflects the robust uptake and enthusiasm surrounding U.S. ETF offerings compared to their Hong Kong counterparts.



Moreover, Markus’s tweet mirrors a broader sentiment within the community, where concerns about market volatility and regulatory scrutiny persist. As such, investors remain vigilant for possible changes in market trajectory amidst ongoing developments.

Billionaire Mike Novogratz Reacts to Roger Ver's Arrest


The recent arrest of Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin investor, has shaken the cryptocurrency community. The U.S. Department of Justice accused Ver of mail fraud, tax evasion and filing fake returns to avoid paying at least $48 million in taxes.Ver, who earned the moniker "Bitcoin Jesus" after spreading the word about Bitcoin in its early days, was arrested in Spain this weekend and might be extradited.The allegations are the latest brought by U.S. authorities against prominent crypto entrepreneurs. Changpeng Zhao, cofounder of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, was sentenced to four months in jail on Tuesday. Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the FTX crypto exchange, received 25 years in prison.The news of Ver's arrest has sent waves through the crypto community, provoking reactions from many, including Galaxy CEO and billionaire investor Mike Novogratz.Novogratz called Roger Ver's arrest a "sad one." U.S. authorities accuse Ver of failing to record capital gains and pay taxes on his Bitcoin holdings, which he began acquiring in 2011. Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014 and became a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, although he was still obligated to file U.S. tax returns that included earnings from certain assets, such as Bitcoin. Novogratz highlights the possibilities in the case, stating that "the feds" often go after cases with more than a 95% chance of winning.  Expressing hopes that a settlement is reached quickly, Novogratz acknowledges Ver as a pioneer in the space, funding projects that helped create the crypto industry. He further added that while he disagreed with the Bitcoin evangelist's preoccupation with Bitcoin Cash, he always found him to be nice and helpful.   "Hoping Roger reaches a settlement quickly and moves on with this. He was a pioneer in the space and funded lots of projects that helped create our industry. I really didn’t agree with him on his Bitcoin Cash obsession but always found him kind and helpful," Novogratz wrote.

Founder of MicroStrategy, Bitcoin holding giant, and its chairman, Michael Saylor, continues to endorse the world’s pioneer cryptocurrency in his tweets. This time, in his tweet, he emphasized Bitcoin’s strong qualities as a store of value, comparing it to other assets.Saylor took to his X/Twitter account to say “Bitcoin is for the money you can't afford to lose.” On the animated chart that came with the tweet, Saylor showed that since the halving that took place in 2016 (the second halving event in Bitcoin’s history) the percentage of original Bitcoin value relative to Bitcoin has been 100%. Therefore, it has been perfect as a store of value, Michael Saylor hinted, compared to its rivals – gold, the S&P 500, U.S. real estate, the U.S. dollar and three other fiat currencies (albeit used in countries with troublesome economies), the Nigerian naira, the Turkish lira and the Argentine peso.MicroStrategy adds more Bitcoin in AprilMicroStrategy, led by Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, announced that during the month of April, it had acquired an additional BTC lump of 122 coins. That cost the business intelligence giant approximately $7.8 million as it bought those Bitcoins at the price of $63,934.The company’s Bitcoin stash currently constitutes 214,400 BTC evaluated at a staggering $5.68 billion.Over the past month, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has seen a massive price reduction as it dropped from above the $72,450 level to the current $58,150 price tag.Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin lost roughly 10% after Binance's CZ was sentenced to four months in prison, “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver was arrested for tax evasion in Spain, Hong Kong Bitcoin-Ethereum ETFs failed to meet traders’ expectations on the first trading day and a few other important factors.

How Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Keeps His Crypto Safe - Decrypt

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is advising people to "decentralize your own security," after weighing in on a Twitter discussion about using cold wallets.To prove his point, Buterin said that he keeps 90% of his crypto funds in a mutisig Safe wallet."M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust," he wrote. "Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other."The "m-of-n" Buterin referred to describes one of the ways multisig, or multi-signature, wallets can be set up. The first variable refers to minimum number of signatures required to sign a contract, therefore spending or transferring funds from the wallet. The second variable refers to the total number of possible signatories that exist for the wallet.The conversation started after a developer and research, who goes by the pseudonym 0xkofi on Twitter, urged crypto traders to think about how devastating it would be to lose all their funds and avoid it by investing in cold storage."Your hardware wallet will be your fortress of solitude," Kofi wrote. "It will allow you to sleep peacefully at night. It will protect you so that you can survive this game long enough to win."But not everyone is sold on that being the right way to protect their personal crypto stash. Peter Watts, Uneven Labs CEO and the founder of Reservoir, a developer platform for launching NFT collections, highlighted the risks involved in relying on hardware wallets."When using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself," he wrote, adding that someone might find a stashed private seed phrase, or a user could secure it so well that they can't retrieve it themselves.That's when Buterin chimed in to describe how he makes sure that he isn't the single point of failure for the security of his cold storage wallet.Although Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) multisig wallets have often been treated as a product to help DAOs and other groups manage shared treasuries, there's a lot of individuals who use them in a similar way to Buterin."Today, individuals make up more than 99% of Safe users, including notable ones like Vitalik Buterin and Punk6529," wrote a SafeDAO contributor and delegate known as Daniel on Twitter.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Who Holds The Most Ethereum (ETH)? How Coinbase, Grayscale, Robinhood And Binance Stack Up - Benzinga

One of the most interesting aspects of blockchain is that everything is public. All transactions, wallets and portfolios are entirely accessible to anyone, allowing for an unprecedented amount of insight into a financial asset class. The uses of the data can range from monitoring overall trading activity and flows to seeing what the largest wallets and firms are doing with their positions. Arkham Intelligence is a blockchain analytics platform particularly interested in the second application. It cross-references financial disclosures by firms and individuals with on-chain activity to match up entities with specific wallet addresses. Don't Miss:With Arkham's insights, anyone can see how the largest entities in crypto are trading. One interesting application is looking at the largest firms in the space.Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the world, operates a centralized exchange, wallet service and a layer-2 called Base. Coinbase's portfolio is worth nearly $80 billion. The wallet is composed almost entirely of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). The firm holds over 900,000 BTC, currently worth over $55 billion. It also holds over 6.6 million ETH worth roughly $20 billion. While Coinbase operates as a crypto custodian, Grayscale is a crypto asset manager. It creates a handful of funds and ETFs that allow investors to access crypto products. In January, it was one of the first companies to offer a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) converted from a previously released futures ETF. Grayscale's portfolio has more than 99% of its value in ETH and BTC. It owns 303,050 BTC worth $18.6 billion and 2.98 million ETH worth $9 billion. Grayscale holds $27.6 billion in crypto assets. Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?While it is mostly known for its equity platform, Robinhood began offering crypto several years ago. The crypto platform offers a handful of the most popular tokens, but the portfolio is mostly invested in ETH, BTC and Shiba Inu (SHIB). The wallet has 140,000 BTC worth $8.6 billion, 1.5 million ETH worth $4.7 billion and 42.5 trillion SHIB worth $1 billion. As the largest crypto exchange in the world, it is no surprise that Binance (BNB) has the largest portfolio, worth over $200 billion. It holds 165 million BNB worth $94 billion, 640,000 BTC worth $40 billion, $27.2 billion worth of Tether (USDT) and 4.4 million ETH worth $13.2 billion. Coinbase has the largest ETH holding on the list. Its $20 billion of ETH is more than 5% of the total supply. The four firms hold a combined 15.5 million ETH, which is roughly 12.7% of the supply. While this may make it seem like the supply of ETH is heavily concentrated among a few entities, Coinbase, Robinhood and Binance hold assets for their customers. The portion of the supply held by these firms is under the discretion of the millions of people who hold ETH on these brokerages. Read Next:

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Could Drop to as Low as $50K, Standard Chartered Says

There have now been five consecutive days of outflows from U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the bank noted, and BTC is currently trading below the average ETF purchase price of about $58K.

“This means that more than half of the spot ETF positions are under water and so the risk of liquidation of some of them must be considered as well,” analyst Geoff Kendrick wrote.

Dutch exchange Bitvavo taps Figment to expand staking services

Update (May 1 at 3:00 pm UTC): This article has been updated to include additional information about Figment’s partnership with Bitvavo.Netherlands-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitvavo will tap into staking platform Figment’s institutional-grade infrastructure to stake a variety of tokens on behalf of its users.Figment, which attracted significant investments from the likes of Galaxy Digital in 2021, announced that it would provide staking infrastructure for the Dutch exchange. Bitvavo will stake user assets across multiple proof-of-stake protocols, including Ethereum, Solana and Near.A statement from Bitvavo CEO and co-founder Mark Nuvelstijn highlighted the exchange’s efforts to review and enhance its products and services. The company also confirmed that Figment is an expansion and diversification of its pool staking service providers, which include Coinbase, Copper and Kiln.Nuvelstijn added that staking has become an integral part of the cryptocurrency industry and that the provision is an essential service for its customer base of more than 1.5 million users across the Benelux region.The Bitvavo CEO said that working with Figment would allow the exchange to provide additional security and safety around staking and expand the offering:“Figment is one of the staking infrastructure leaders in the market, and we continue to be impressed by their staking- and up-to-date market knowledge.”Figment's head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Eva Lawrence, said the two teams have been working together for six months with the view of spearheading the exchange’s staking services across Europe. The partnership is set to provide access to staking rewards on Bitvavo on newly launched networks. Figment is also establishing dedicated validator nodes for Bitvavo to provide high-quality network performance and security.The Dutch exchange has continued a steady approach to expanding its footprint into Europe. In November 2023, it announced the launch of services to French users after successfully registering as a digital asset service provider with France’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers.The expansion into France followed Bitvavo’s regulatory approval to offer its services in Austria. The exchange expanded its offering to Italy in 2022 and has filed registration applications for other major European markets. Nuvelstijn previously spoke exclusively to Cointelegraph during the European Blockchain Convention held in Barcelona in October 2023, highlighting his belief that Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets framework will allow cryptocurrency companies to offer financial services and vice versa.Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bled Another $162 Million On Tuesday - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Common Units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:GBTC) - Benzinga

Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) experienced a substantial outflow of funds, totaling $162 million on Tuesday, according to financial analytics firm SoSoValue. What Happened: The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC alone saw a withdrawal of $93.2277 million, contributing significantly to its historical net outflow of $17.303 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC FBTC bled $35.28 million, while Bitwise’s BITB BITB saw an outflow of $34.31 million. Ark’s ETF ARKB ARKB was the only ETF recording a net inflow, albeit a modest $3.6 million.Following these developments, the total net asset value of Bitcoin BTC/USD spot ETFs fell below the $50 billion mark, landing at $49.413 billion.Also Read: Patrick McHenry Questions SEC’s Transparency On Ethereum As A SecurityWhy It Matters: This trend of outflows contrasts sharply with the optimism surrounding the launch of new cryptocurrency spot ETFs in Hong Kong. Harvest Global Investments and other firms received approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which started trading on April 30, according to Wu Blockchain. Notably, the initial offering of these ETFs saw significant interest from regions including Singapore and the Middle East, though Chinese mainland investors remain excluded from participating due to regulatory restrictions.ChinaAMC led the launch with its Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, boasting an initial offering size that surpassed $125 million—optimistically compared to U.S. launches by industry insiders. However, the actual first-day trading volume in Hong Kong reached only $12 million, dwarfed by the $4.6 billion volume observed in the U.S. market on similar opening days. This discrepancy underscores the varying investor appetite and market dynamics between the regions.Despite the tepid trading volume, Hong Kong’s market showed signs of growth, with the listing of these ETFs heralded as a significant development in the region's financial landscape. The SFC has outlined a comprehensive regulatory framework for these products, emphasizing the potential risks associated with high volatility and speculation in cryptocurrencies.What’s Next: Looking ahead, the Future of Digital Assets event, scheduled by Benzinga on Nov. 19, is set to delve deeper into these developments.Read Next: Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Sees Crypto Industry Entering ‘New Phase’Image: Shutterstock

Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024, 2025, 2026-2030

Following the fourth Bitcoin halving event, Bitcoin price initially gained a buying demand; however, it failed to hold its bullish momentum due to rising bearish threats. As a result, BTC price dropped below the psychological $60K mark. However, there’s still hope among holders as they expect Bitcoin to reach $100K by 2024.Even though Bitcoin has declined 12 percent in April as revealed by CoinGlass data, it is still quite likely to be considered the worst month since the November 2022 day. Looking into next May, Bitcoin might still be struggling as it has done lower for the last three years to end May.However, despite bearish spot Bitcoin ETF flow the US Bitcoin sentiment develops a bullish trend as BTC HODLers are anticipating a continuous uptrend beyond $75,000. This has led analysts to think: Will this lead Bitcoin price past $100,000?The current BTC trading sentiment is bullish as Bitcoin traded at its highest point in pre-halving rally. Since 2024 is bullish for the crypto market, anticipation is that the BTC price could hit $100K during this season.As Bitcoin on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential of hitting the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin ever go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.OverviewCryptocurrencyBitcoinTokenBTCPrice$56,969 Market Cap$1,121,914,422,643Trading Volume$45,318,495,561Circulating Supply19,692,534All-time High$73,750, March 14, 2024All-time Low$0.04865, Jul 15, 201024 High$62,12124 Low$56,555Bitcoin Price Prediction: Technical AnalysisMetricValuePrice Prediction$80,986 (34.39% increase)Volatility4.06%50-Day SMA$66,65114-Day RSI38.30SentimentBearishFear & Greed Index54 (Neutral)Green Days15/30 (50%)200-Day SMA$48,164Bitcoin Technical Indicators: Levels And ActionDaily Simple Moving Average (SMA)PeriodValueActionSMA 3$63,371SELLSMA 5$63,929SELLSMA 10$65,676SELLSMA 21$65,349SELLSMA 50$66,651SELLSMA 100$59,102BUYSMA 200$48,164BUYDaily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) PeriodValueActionEMA 3$63,744SELLEMA 5$64,261SELLEMA 10$65,504SELLEMA 21$66,559SELLEMA 50$64,603SELLEMA 100$58,756BUYEMA 200$50,274BUYBitcoin price analysis: BTC price declined heavily as it dropped toward $57KTL; DR BreakdownBTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a bearish pattern as the price dropped below $57KResistance for BTC is present at $61,021Support for BTC/USD is present at $56,695The BTC price analysis for 1 May confirms that bears sparked a solid selling pressure as BTC price plunged buying confidence by heading below the $57K mark.BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price faces intense bearish pressureAnalyzing the daily price chart of Bitcoin, BTC’s price faced a robust selling pressure as the price continued to decline below immediate Fib channels and headed toward the $57K level. The BTC price is facing a surge in selling demand as it reaches a crucial support line. The 24-hour volume has surged to $30 million, showing an increased interest in trading activity today. BTC price is currently trading at $56,733, decreasing by over 6.5% in the last 24 hours.The RSI-14 trend line has declined from its previous level and currently trades around the oversold region at 30, hinting that a bearish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.   BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction above moving averagesThe 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position as they are aiming to send the price below the Fib lines. However, bulls are maintaining buying confidence and are aiming to hold the price above the EMA20 trend line.The BoP indicator is trading in a negative region at 0.38, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend.Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed bearish candles below the signal line and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.What to expect from BTC price analysis next?The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing for further recovery rally in the upcoming hours. If BTC’s price successfully holds its momentum above $61,021, it will fuel a bullish rally to $64,525.If bulls fail to initiate a surge, BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $56,695, which may begin a bearish trend to $52,768.Recent NewsOn 30 April, Hong Kong launched Asia’s first bitcoin and ether spot ETFs, shortly after the U.S. approved similar investments.BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin ETF, has seen no new inflows since April 24, maintaining 274,462 BTC, raising concerns in the Bitcoin community.Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2024It is highly likely that the effect of this Bitcoin halving proceeds until the end of the month. This is due to the fact the price remains above its STH Realized price of $59K. In view of that, it can be assumed that a continued upward trend in prices should be expected with positive technical indicators and positive market sentiment. However, Bitcoin’s price movements might tumble following bearish pressure on the current Bitcoin price level. Bitcoin price might attempt to surge toward $67,000 from its recent low, and this number be pushed further, at least $74,000, if the strong downwards pressures are not seen. However, on the bearish side, we might see a rejection, leading to a consolidation within $51K-$60K.Bitcoin Price PredictionPotential LowPotential AveragePotential HighBitcoin Price Prediction May 2024$51,000$61,000$74,000Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024In the cryptocurrency market, the newly launched spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong, with the giant inflows in the US ETF market indicates that the Bitcoin prices will head upwards in the near future. Historically, Bitcoin usually carries as the significant crypto coin in the year following a halving and it is expected that this will push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin. An outcome of which the 2024 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $110,000 in the highest and the low could be around $48,000.Bitcoin Price PredictionPotential LowPotential AveragePotential HighBitcoin Price Prediction 2024$48,000$67,000$110,000Bitcoin Price Predictions 2025-2030YearMinimum PriceAverage PriceMaximum Price2025$95,000$120,000$160,0002026$115,000$130,000$185,0002027$140,491$170,100$216,7382028$164,063$185,068$244,1422029$195,629$200,312$255,3212030$225,903$248,568$270,593Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025The Bitcoin Halving event’s impact is expected to last into 2025, potentially holding the Bitcoin price above the $100,000 mark. If the global economy strengthens and inflation stabilizes at 2%, interest rates could be reduced by 2025.Clearer crypto regulations could boost BTC investor confidence, leading to more buying demand amid scarcity due to halving.Following the halving event over the next 12-18 months, BTC price is expected to surge toward $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000.Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026Bitcoin might witness a slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC price within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027Based on detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100.Bitcoin Price Prediction 2028By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to possibly reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, with the price averaging about $185,068 for the year.Bitcoin Price Forecast 2029Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312.Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2030For the year 2030, the forecast suggests that the price of Bitcoin could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

Meme Coin Bloodbath: Base, Solana Meme Cryptos Decimated


Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) competitors on Solana (SOL) and Base (BASE) blockchains are under pressure as Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $60,000. In the last seven days, the Base meme crypto scene lost over one-third of its value.Base meme coins segment loses 24% in 24 hoursThe segments of Base (BASE) and Solana (SOL) meme cryptocurrencies are yet again among the most affected categories of altcoins hit by a massive crypto price flush. In the last 24 hours, meme coins on Base (BASE) saw almost 24% of their capitalization erased.Image by CoinGeckoAmong all Base (BASE) meme coins, the biggest losses are registered by low-cap assets. However, flagship coins of the Base (BASE) meme crypto ecosystem - BRETT, DEGEN, HIGHER - also witnessed 10%-15% drops. Cat-themed meme coins represent the fifth worst affected category on CoinGecko, with 17% lost overnight. However, its leaders - Cat In The Dog World (MEW) and Mog Coin (MOG) - printed tiny 3-4% losses and, therefore, even outperformed the crypto market as a whole.The Solana (SOL) meme coin ecosystem lost 15% in 24 hours with leaders WIF, BONK and BOME only erasing 1-6% of their prices.As covered by U.Today previously, meme coins on Solana (SOL) and Base (BASE) were also hit by last weekend's price plunge.Crypto liquidations near $400 millionIn the last 24 hours, total capitalization of cryptocurrency markets plummeted by 3.9%. Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, lost 5.7% of its value.This flush can be attributed to the end of Binance's CZ trial and the paltry start of Hong Kong crypto-based spot ETFs.As a result, numerous Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin futures traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Over $390 million in positions, mostly longs, were erased, CoinGlass's data shows.Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are responsible for $250 million of this sum.

Elliptic Uncovers ‘Novel’ Bitcoin Money Laundering Pattern - DailyCoin


        
Elliptic has published new research on Bitcoin money laundering.



The latest study continues previous research published by the firm in 2019.



The firm uncovered an emerging trend in BTC money laundering.
Blockchain forensics firm Elliptic said Wednesday it has made significant progress in using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify Bitcoin transactions made by illicit actors.Elliptic published its first research in 2019 after training a machine learning model using over 200,00 transactions. In the second research, published on May 1, the firm trained the model using a vast dataset containing nearly 200 million transactions.New Bitcoin Money Laundering PatternIn a blogpost spotlighting the new research, Elliptic said it had detected potential money laundering instances on the Bitcoin network after training the machine learning model to identify “subgraphs,” chain of transactions representing BTC being laundered.
“By identifying these subgraphs rather than illicit wallets, this approach allows us to focus on the “multi-hop laundering process more generally rather than the on-chain behavior of specific illicit actors,” Elliptic said.Of 52 “money laundering” subgraphs predicted by the model and which ended up with deposits to an exchange involved in the research, 14 were confirmed to have been received by users who had already been flagged as being linked to possible money laundering.The research further uncovered new types of emerging money laundering patterns on the Bitcoin network, such as the use of “intermediary nested” in certain ways.Intermediary nested services include businesses that move funds through accounts at larger exchanges, often without the exchange’s awareness in the case of illicit activity.
“Nested services are known to frequently have less stringent customer due diligence checks than the cryptocurrency exchanges they utilize, or sometimes have no such anti-money laundering checks at all, resulting in their misuse for cryptocurrency laundering.” Elliptic described.The latest research was co-authored by Elliptic and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers.Read how the Lazarus group evaded authorities after sealing $200M in crypto:Lazarus Evading Authorities: Blockchain and Laundering $200MStay updated on a recent exploit on Circle-backed Pike Finance:Pike Finance Loses $1.6M to ‘USDC Vulnerability’ Exploit

Capitulation incoming? Bitcoin miners' revenue drops to a 6-month low


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price shambled post-halving, with consecutive losses and the first “red month” in April, after a 7-month green streak. In this context, the Bitcoin miners’ revenue in USD dropped to a 6-month low, slightly above $30 million.
Finbold retrieved data from Blockchain.com on May 1, showing $30.17 million of miners’ revenue collected on April 30. Moreover, the 1-year chart illustrates this as the lowest revenue for Bitcoin miners in the past six months.
Notably, the most significant drop occurred after Bitcoin’s fourth halving, when the block subsidy reward changed from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per mined block, drastically affecting the activity’s profitability.


However, the situation worsened as the Bitcoin price in USD moved from around $70,000 to $57,000 month-over-month.

Bitcoin miners underwater, mining with losses as revenue drops
As reported by Finbold on April 23, Bitcoin miners are “underwater” with increased production costs, mining BTC with losses. At that time, data from different sources estimated losses from $36,000 to $52,000 per Bitcoin mined, with BTC trading at $66,000.
Again, this situation worsened amid the most recent cryptocurrency market crash, which liquidated long-position traders by $400 million. According to the previous sources, Bitcoin miners could be losing between $43,000 and $72,000 per BTC in this revenue drop.
In particular, Capriole Investments has the most pessimistic production cost estimation of $128,989 per mined Bitcoin. The investment firm estimates that $77,400 is spent on electrical costs for each produced coin, considering hashrate averages.

Meanwhile, data from MacroMicro shows a less-worse cost/price ratio of 1.66, according to estimates from Cambridge University. As per this data, Bitcoin’s average mining cost was above $100,500 on April 30, close to historical highs in production costs, with miners theoretically losing around $43,000 for each BTC they issue.

Therefore, current data suggests potential industry turmoil that could cause some Bitcoin mining companies to capitulate. To prevent that, the Bitcoin price would need to rally above the estimated production costs, now at all-time highs.
If the production costs remain higher than the mining rewards, measured in U.S. dollars, the Bitcoin network could centralize in a few big miners. Experts have warned about that for years, mentioning the Economy of Scale dynamics inherent to Bitcoin, which threatens the system’s security.

CZ Vows to Focus on 'Next Chapter' After Sentencing - DailyCoin


        
After six months of waiting, a judge sentenced CZ to imprisonment on April 30.



CZ expressed regret over his failures in running Binance. 



The former Binance CEO intends to serve the sentence but looks forward to future projects. 
After a multi-year investigation, US authorities charged Binance and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) with violating money laundering rules in November 2023. As part of the settlement, the company agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine and exit the US market. The deal also involved CZ stepping down as company CEO, paying a $50 million fine, and pleading guilty to money laundering.After months of legal limbo, Judge Richard Jones finally gave sentencing on April 30, ordering that CZ serve a four-month prison sentence. CZ responded by saying, “I will do my time,” and move forward after the ordeal is over. Looking to the FutureResponding to the sentencing, CZ put on a brave face, stating that he intends to serve his sentence and put the matter behind him once it is done. Looking to the future, CZ stated that he will remain a passive crypto investor and plans to “focus on the next chapter of my life (education).”While awaiting sentencing in the US, CZ had already set in motion Giggle Academy, a free basic education platform for young students. Notably, it will not feature any cryptocurrency-related content.
The former Binance CEO thanked those who supported him during this ordeal. He stated that the messages of support and backing kept him strong through this uncertain period of his life.Despite the prison sentence, many in the crypto industry consider CZ a victim of the “war on crypto” by US authorities. His guilty plea to money laundering violations enabled Binance to avoid further enforcement actions.
However, in delivering the sentence, Judge Jones clarified that CZ is responsible for Binance’s compliance failings.CZ Expresses Regret In handing down sentencing, Judge Jones stated that CZ had the “wherewithal, finance capabilities, and people power” to ensure Binance complied with money laundering regulations. However, the judge determined that CZ “failed at that opportunity.”While prosecutors had pushed for a three-year prison term, Judge Jones opted to show a degree of leniency by handing down a four-month sentence instead. The relatively light punishment suggested the court recognized CZ’s conduct in trying to resolve the case as quickly as possible.Addressing the court, CZ stated that the sentence represents “the first step of taking responsibility.” He admitted his failure to “implement an adequate anti-money laundering program” at Binance, stating, “I realize now the seriousness of that mistake.”On the Flipside
The average prison sentence for money laundering is 70 months, according to the US Sentencing Commission.



Since the enforcement action, Binance‘s global market share has dropped to 55%.

Super Micro Folly, Stock Market Direction Depends On Which Powell Shows Up - Objective Or Political - Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) - Benzinga

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.Making A Fortune In Artificial IntelligencePlease click here for an enlarged chart of Super Micro Computer Inc SMCI.Note the following:
	This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of SMCI stock is being used to illustrate the point.
	Super Micro has been the most favorite artificial intelligence stock of the momo crowd. The chart shows the big drop in the stock on earnings released after the market closed.
	The chart shows a 40.5% drop since the high in March.
	RSI shown on the chart foretold what was to come.
	The momo crowd, including momo gurus, that ran up the stock did not really understand the server business.
	SMCI presents an important learning moment for prudent investors. These are four important points here:
	
		What you do not buy is as important as what you buy.  
		A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  
		The momo crowd’s history is that they make money because they run up stocks with their own buying. Subsequently, the momo crowd loses money when smart money sells into the strength. Often, the momo crowd loses more money than they make, resulting in a net loss.   
		Follow smart money for investments. Selectively follow the momo crowd for very short term trades when there is a Signal or Signal Limited.  
	
	
	Members and readers of The Arora Report, already knew in advance what was to come. On March 4, right near the top of SMCI stock, we wrote:

	
	
	SMCI has become a favorite of the momo crowd. The momo crowd incorrectly thinks SMCI has the same potential as Nvidia (NVDA). Investors need to keep in mind the following:
	

	
		
		
		SMCI moves a lot more than NVDA. SMCI is so volatile because of the small float.
		
		
		
		
		SMCI is an assembler of servers for artificial intelligence. It uses components from NVDA, Micron (MU), and Marvell (MRVL).
		
		
		
		
		NVDA has a large moat to protect it that includes IP for its GPUs. SMCI has no moat and the barrier to entry for competitors is low.
		
		
		
		
		SMCI sales are to hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG). The reason SMCI sales are booming is that they have availability of NVDA chips. As chips become more available to competitors, SMCI will not be able to sustain its sales growth rate.
		
		
		
		
		The momo crowd is buying SMCI due to lack of knowledge.  However, there are many investors who understand and have the knowledge of SMCI's business. Many such investors are short selling SMCI.  For the time being, short sellers are being overwhelmed by the YOLO crowd.
		
		
		
		
		Taking all of the above into consideration with the quantitative analysis screen of the ZYX Change Method, in an optimistic case, the fair value of SMCI stock is $442 - $486.
		
		
	
	

	You may recall that The Arora Report was the first one to identify that artificial intelligence was real in 2022. At that time, momo gurus were selling AI stock.
	A fortune is to be made in AI between now and 2030.  SMCI shows that at times it will be treacherous. You need expert guidance.  Equally important is building your knowledge of investments in AI. 
	FOMC will release its decision at 2pm ET today. FOMC is expected to keep interest rates unchanged. The key event is Powell’s conference. The data shows that professional traders are expecting higher volatility during Powell’s conference than at any other point over the last year. 
	In The Arora Report analysis, the near term direction of the stock market will come down to if objective Powell shows up or if political Powell shows up.  
	
		If objective Powell shows up, expect the stock market to go down.  The reason is that the stock market is still levitating on hopium and not paying attention to the data.  
		If political Powell shows up, expect a rip roaring rally. 
	
	
	We previously shared that prudent investors should pay attention to the Treasury refunding plan.
	
		The Treasury plans to borrow $243B in the April to June quarter vs. $202B estimate.
		The Treasury has just released the composition of the borrowing.
		In The Arora Report analysis, the composition is more important than the increased amount of borrowing. Last time, the Treasury manipulated the borrowing to make stock and bond markets run higher. We will be carefully analyzing the just released new data.
	
	
	Automatic Data Processing Inc ADP is the largest private payroll processor in the country.  It uses its data to give a glimpse of the jobs picture in advance of the official jobs report that will be released on Friday at 8:30am ET.  ADP employment change came at 192K vs. 175K consensus.  This indicates that the jobs picture is staying very strong.  In The Arora Report analysis, the strength is at the low end while the job picture remains weak in IT and finance.
Magnificent Seven Money FlowsIn the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc Class C GOOG, and Microsoft Corp MSFT.In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Meta Platforms Inc META.In the early trade, money flows are negative in Apple Inc AAPL, NVIDIA Corp NVDA, and Tesla Inc TSLA.In the early trade, money flows are negative in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ.Momo Crowd And Smart Money In StocksThe momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade.GoldThe momo crowd is buying gold in the early trade.  Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings.The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust GLD. The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust SLV. OilThe momo crowd is selling oil in the early trade.  Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see oil ratings.The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF USO.BitcoinBitcoin BTC/USD has fallen below $60,000 on momo crowd selling.  Recent momo crowd bitcoin buyers who fell prey to whales’ propaganda of buying on bitcoin halving and bought bitcoin above $70,000 are panicking and selling. Of course, if you listened to the podcast on bitcoin halving, you knew in advance that this was a high probability outcome.Protection Band And What To Do NowIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.  When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

Tether just obliterated its former net profit record for a single quarter - Blockworks


Stablecoin issuer Tether has notched a record quarterly net profit at a time during which the company is broadening its scope. 
Tether tallied an all-time high net profit of $4.52 billion in the first quarter, according to a Wednesday attestation report by auditing firm BDO. 
Tether’s first quarter net operating profits of $1 billion were driven by its US Treasury holdings, the company added. Other profits stemmed from mark-to-market gains in its bitcoin and gold positions.
Bitcoin’s price hit a new peak of about $73,000 in mid-March before trending downward in April.
The $4.52 billion total obliterates the former record of $2.85 billion in net profit gathered during the last three months of 2023.
Read more: Tether made nearly $1B in monthly profit during Q4
Tether’s token, USDT, is intended to maintain a value of $1 and can be redeemed for US dollars at any time.  
As of March 31, Tether’s reserves were nearly $6.3 billion higher than the liabilities of the companies issuing USDT.  
USDT’s market capitalization was roughly $110 billion at 10 am ET, behind only bitcoin and ether among crypto assets. That figure is more than triple the $33 billion market cap of competing stablecoin USDC. 
The latest disclosure comes as Tether seeks to build out its business beyond just stablecoins.
Read more: Tether looks to ‘build the next generation of open AI models’ with new data division
It recently launched a data initiative focused on developing and investing in new technology, for example. Other new divisions include a unit focused on blockchain-based financial infrastructure and one involved in the mining and energy sectors. 
“With this evolution beyond our traditional stablecoin offerings, we are ready to build and support the invention and implementation of cutting-edge technology that removes the limitations of what’s possible in this world,” CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement last month.

Bitcoin down 20%+ from all-time highs - Is BTC price headed to $50K?

Bitcoin’s price is down around 21% from its all-time high.

Elliptic's AI-driven research helps fight Bitcoin money laundering - Crypto Briefing




Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has made significant progress in using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify potential money laundering patterns on the Bitcoin blockchain.In a research paper co-authored with the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Elliptic described its use of a deep learning model trained on a dataset of nearly 200 million transactions to detect illicit activity involving groups of bitcoin nodes and transaction chains.The research builds upon a previous study conducted in 2019, which utilized a much smaller dataset of 200,000 transactions. The new “Elliptic2” dataset contains 122,000 labeled “subgraphs,” representing groups of connected nodes and transaction chains known to have links to illicit activity. By training the AI model on this extensive dataset, Elliptic aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of detecting money laundering and other financial crimes on the blockchain.The inherent transparency of blockchain data makes it well-suited for machine learning techniques, as transaction information and entity types can be readily analyzed. This stands in contrast to traditional finance, where transaction data is often siloed, making the application of AI more challenging.The trained model successfully identified proceeds of crime deposited at a crypto exchange, as well as novel money laundering transaction patterns and previously-unknown illicit wallets. These findings are already being incorporated into Elliptic’s products to enhance their capabilities.“The money laundering techniques identified by the model have been identified because they are prevalent in bitcoin,” Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson explained in an email. “Crypto laundering practices will evolve over time as they cease being effective, but an advantage of an AI/deep learning approach is that new money laundering patterns are identified automatically as they emerge.”The research revealed common money laundering techniques, such as “peeling chains,” where a user sends cryptocurrency to a destination address while sending the remainder to another address under their control, forming a chain of transactions. Another prevalent method involved the use of “nested services,” businesses that move funds through accounts at larger crypto exchanges, sometimes even without the exchange’s knowledge or approval.To encourage further collaboration and advancement in this field, Elliptic has made the “Elliptic2” dataset publicly available. As the largest public dataset of its kind, it will enable the wider community to develop new AI techniques for detecting illicit cryptocurrency transactions and contribute to the ongoing fight against financial crime in the crypto space.

Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024, 2025, 2026-2030

Following the fourth Bitcoin halving event, Bitcoin price initially gained a buying demand; however, it failed to hold its bullish momentum due to rising bearish threats. As a result, BTC price dropped below the psychological $60K mark. However, there’s still hope among holders as they expect Bitcoin to reach $100K by 2024.Even though Bitcoin has declined 12 percent in April as revealed by CoinGlass data, it is still quite likely to be considered the worst month since the November 2022 day. Looking into next May, Bitcoin might still be struggling as it has done lower for the last three years to end May.However, despite bearish spot Bitcoin ETF flow the US Bitcoin sentiment develops a bullish trend as BTC HODLers are anticipating a continuous uptrend beyond $75,000. This has led analysts to think: Will this lead Bitcoin price past $100,000?The current BTC trading sentiment is bullish as Bitcoin traded at its highest point in pre-halving rally. Since 2024 is bullish for the crypto market, anticipation is that the BTC price could hit $100K during this season.As Bitcoin on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential of hitting the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin ever go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.OverviewCryptocurrencyBitcoinTokenBTCPrice$56,969 Market Cap$1,121,914,422,643Trading Volume$45,318,495,561Circulating Supply19,692,534All-time High$73,750, March 14, 2024All-time Low$0.04865, Jul 15, 201024 High$62,12124 Low$56,555Bitcoin Price Prediction: Technical AnalysisMetricValuePrice Prediction$80,986 (34.39% increase)Volatility4.06%50-Day SMA$66,65114-Day RSI38.30SentimentBearishFear & Greed Index54 (Neutral)Green Days15/30 (50%)200-Day SMA$48,164Bitcoin Technical Indicators: Levels And ActionDaily Simple Moving Average (SMA)PeriodValueActionSMA 3$63,371SELLSMA 5$63,929SELLSMA 10$65,676SELLSMA 21$65,349SELLSMA 50$66,651SELLSMA 100$59,102BUYSMA 200$48,164BUYDaily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) PeriodValueActionEMA 3$63,744SELLEMA 5$64,261SELLEMA 10$65,504SELLEMA 21$66,559SELLEMA 50$64,603SELLEMA 100$58,756BUYEMA 200$50,274BUYBitcoin price analysis: BTC price declined heavily as it dropped toward $57KTL; DR BreakdownBTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a bearish pattern as the price dropped below $57KResistance for BTC is present at $61,021Support for BTC/USD is present at $56,695The BTC price analysis for 1 May confirms that bears sparked a solid selling pressure as BTC price plunged buying confidence by heading below the $57K mark.BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price faces intense bearish pressureAnalyzing the daily price chart of Bitcoin, BTC’s price faced a robust selling pressure as the price continued to decline below immediate Fib channels and headed toward the $57K level. The BTC price is facing a surge in selling demand as it reaches a crucial support line. The 24-hour volume has surged to $30 million, showing an increased interest in trading activity today. BTC price is currently trading at $56,733, decreasing by over 6.5% in the last 24 hours.The RSI-14 trend line has declined from its previous level and currently trades around the oversold region at 30, hinting that a bearish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.   BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction above moving averagesThe 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position as they are aiming to send the price below the Fib lines. However, bulls are maintaining buying confidence and are aiming to hold the price above the EMA20 trend line.The BoP indicator is trading in a negative region at 0.38, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend.Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed bearish candles below the signal line and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.What to expect from BTC price analysis next?The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing for further recovery rally in the upcoming hours. If BTC’s price successfully holds its momentum above $61,021, it will fuel a bullish rally to $64,525.If bulls fail to initiate a surge, BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $56,695, which may begin a bearish trend to $52,768.Recent NewsOn 30 April, Hong Kong launched Asia’s first bitcoin and ether spot ETFs, shortly after the U.S. approved similar investments.BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin ETF, has seen no new inflows since April 24, maintaining 274,462 BTC, raising concerns in the Bitcoin community.Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2024It is highly likely that the effect of this Bitcoin halving proceeds until the end of the month. This is due to the fact the price remains above its STH Realized price of $59K. In view of that, it can be assumed that a continued upward trend in prices should be expected with positive technical indicators and positive market sentiment. However, Bitcoin’s price movements might tumble following bearish pressure on the current Bitcoin price level. Bitcoin price might attempt to surge toward $67,000 from its recent low, and this number be pushed further, at least $74,000, if the strong downwards pressures are not seen. However, on the bearish side, we might see a rejection, leading to a consolidation within $51K-$60K.Bitcoin Price PredictionPotential LowPotential AveragePotential HighBitcoin Price Prediction May 2024$51,000$61,000$74,000Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024In the cryptocurrency market, the newly launched spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong, with the giant inflows in the US ETF market indicates that the Bitcoin prices will head upwards in the near future. Historically, Bitcoin usually carries as the significant crypto coin in the year following a halving and it is expected that this will push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin. An outcome of which the 2024 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $110,000 in the highest and the low could be around $48,000.Bitcoin Price PredictionPotential LowPotential AveragePotential HighBitcoin Price Prediction 2024$48,000$67,000$110,000Bitcoin Price Predictions 2025-2030YearMinimum PriceAverage PriceMaximum Price2025$95,000$120,000$160,0002026$115,000$130,000$185,0002027$140,491$170,100$216,7382028$164,063$185,068$244,1422029$195,629$200,312$255,3212030$225,903$248,568$270,593Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025The Bitcoin Halving event’s impact is expected to last into 2025, potentially holding the Bitcoin price above the $100,000 mark. If the global economy strengthens and inflation stabilizes at 2%, interest rates could be reduced by 2025.Clearer crypto regulations could boost BTC investor confidence, leading to more buying demand amid scarcity due to halving.Following the halving event over the next 12-18 months, BTC price is expected to surge toward $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000.Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026Bitcoin might witness a slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC price within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027Based on detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100.Bitcoin Price Prediction 2028By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to possibly reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, with the price averaging about $185,068 for the year.Bitcoin Price Forecast 2029Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312.Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2030For the year 2030, the forecast suggests that the price of Bitcoin could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

SEC Repels Ripple's Challenge in Contested Witness Dispute - DailyCoin


        
The SEC and Ripple Labs have clashed over the validity of an accountant’s testimony in their ongoing lawsuit.



The SEC has defended her role of summarizing financial data, which is a permissible practice within legal boundaries.



The dispute has hinged on whether the accountant stuck to basic calculations or delved into expert analysis.
The ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs took a new turn as the SEC responded to Ripple’s challenge regarding the testimony of SEC accountant Andrea Fox. Ripple had sought to dismiss Fox’s declaration, arguing it constituted undisclosed expert testimony. Ripple and SEC Clash Over Expert Witness StatusThe SEC strongly disagrees, defending her work as a permissible form of summary evidence under established legal rules. The crux of the dispute lies in the nature of Fox’s contribution. Ripple contends that her role went beyond mere summarization, involving financial analysis and critical decisions about categorizing Ripple’s financial data. This, according to Ripple, necessitates disclosure as expert testimony. The SEC counters this claim, maintaining that Fox’s calculations are straightforward and lack the elements of expert analysis. They argue that her work involved no specialized skills or subjective opinions, simply basic calculations derived from Ripple’s financial records.
In their defense, the SEC emphasizes that Fox’s role was to simplify large volumes of financial data for the court’s benefit. They assert that using assumptions while handling such data is standard practice for summary witnesses and doesn’t elevate the evidence to the level of expert analysis.The SEC further bolsters its argument by citing legal precedents that establish summary witnesses’ acceptable use of assumptions in court proceedings. They maintain that Fox’s work falls squarely within the established parameters of a summary witness as outlined by relevant legal procedures, which clearly define expert witnesses as those providing specialized knowledge.Narrow Focus Raises Concerns About Industry RegulationWhile the SEC aims to uphold the legitimacy of Fox’s contribution, the case has drawn criticism for its seemingly narrow focus. Some argue that the SEC prioritizes investor protection against missed profit opportunities over addressing broader systemic issues within the cryptocurrency landscape, as highlighted by the recent FTX collapse. 
This incident has reignited concerns about the SEC’s effectiveness in regulating the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. The outcome of this legal battle will likely have significant implications for the future of cryptocurrency regulation and the SEC’s approach to navigating the complexities of this dynamic industry.On the Flipside
The SEC argues that Andrea Fox’s work simply summarized financial data and lacked the complexity of expert analysis.



They maintain Fox’s role falls within the legal definition of a summary witness, distinct from experts providing specialized knowledge.
Why This MattersThis legal battle between the SEC and Ripple hinges on the definition of “expert testimony” within cryptocurrency regulation. The outcome will set a precedent for how the SEC evaluates evidence in future crypto-related cases, potentially impacting the regulatory landscape for the entire industry.Ripple is trying to exclude new evidence from the SEC’s case. A decision in Ripple’s favor could weaken the SEC’s case.

Bitcoin's Price Swings: Here is Why BTC Market is Highly Volatile - Coin Edition


							

Bitcoin’s volatility stems from its young existence, scarcity factor, and influence of large-scale investors.



Liquidity issues in the cryptocurrency market exacerbate Bitcoin’s price swings.



Regulatory developments and the introduction of financial products may mitigate Bitcoin’s volatility in the future.




Bitcoin still astounds the financial area with its thrilling price alterations. From its early ages of few cents even per coin to today’s highs reaching more than $74,000, Bitcoin’s journey has been nothing short of remarkable. 



However, this journey has been marked by extreme volatility, with fluctuations of over 80% in value at times. Uncovering the origin of Bitcoin’s volatile nature is crucial for the success of investors and analysts as well, because that can give an indication of the future of cryptocurrencies.



The Bitcoin volatility is rooted in a diverse range of factors which take beginnings in the characteristic of the digital currency that is very young. Unlike the aged traditional assets that have a centuries-long historical data, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market are unable to maintain stability that comes from decades of influence of established market dynamics. 



This first stage of the cryptocurrency development model leads to the permanent process of price discovery, when the value of Bitcoin is regularly reassessed by the market, which results in great price fluctuations in reaction on new information and happenings.









One of the fundamental contributors to Bitcoin’s volatility is its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. This inherent scarcity factor can magnify price fluctuations as demand fluctuates against the unyielding supply limit. Additionally, the influence of large-scale investors, commonly referred to as “whales,” further exacerbates price volatility. Their substantial holdings allow them to sway market dynamics with significant buy or sell orders, leading to abrupt price changes.



Furthermore, the immaturity of the cryptocurrency market infrastructure introduces liquidity issues, wherein the capacity to execute large trades without impacting market prices is limited compared to more established markets. This lack of liquidity can intensify price swings as investors maneuver in and out of positions.



With the development of the cryptocurrency environment and regulatory frameworks taking shape, things might be changing for Bitcoin, which may moderate its volatility overtime. The emergence of Bitcoin-related derivatives shown in spot ETFs and the evolution of market infrastructure could make the trading process more stable.

Tron (TRX) Founder Justin Sun Announces His Three Favorite Mem Tokens! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun, who has been talked about recently with large amounts of Ethereum (ETH) purchases, this time came to the fore with the mem token announcement.
Justin Sun, who shared the part of his speech about mem tokens at the Token 2049 conference from his account X, spoke highly of mem tokens.


At this point, mentioning Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI), Sun said that he believes that meme tokens are the “first thing” that distinguishes the cryptocurrency industry from traditional finance.
Pointing out that Mem tokens will never disappear, Sun underlined that launching a successful Mem Token is “as difficult as creating a good crypto project.”





Additionally, the Tron founder argued that there is significant community support behind the success of meme tokens, and he also pointed to popular personalities who support them.
Citing Elon Musk, known for his support of Dogecoin, as an example, Sun said that DOGE and similar mem tokens with significant support will be very successful in the future.


Finally, Justin Sun described DOGE as one of the best cryptocurrency brands and reminded them of their potential in bull rallies.

Redstone Network Launches to Power Fully On-Chain Ethereum Games - Decrypt

Redstone, a new Ethereum scaling network designed for fully on-chain games and “autonomous worlds,” launched its mainnet today—with a number of early games already available for play.Developed by Ethereum startup Lattice, Redstone was built via Optimism’s OP Stack scaling tech. But it’s much more than a rebranded riff on the layer-2 tech that also powers networks like Base and Zora—Redstone has been significantly retooled for the needs and demands of video games, particularly those that use blockchain for much more than asset ownership.“We've had core developers come along and make really cool contributions to the OP Stack,” Optimism co-founder Ben Jones told Decrypt’s GG. “This is the first [network] that’s not just tweaking dials a little bit.”Many crypto or “Web3” games utilize technologies like NFTs for unique user-owned items or cryptocurrencies for decentralized economies. But fully on-chain or autonomous games also put their game logic or rules on-chain, working within the capabilities but also limitations of the decentralized technology to power playable games.“Most of the time, when you fully embrace the medium or the system you're building to, you tend to get more interesting results—and sometimes better harmonization—just purely from a product development perspective,” Lattice co-founder and CEO Justin Glibert told Decrypt’s GG.Glibert says his team has embraced this model of building entirely on Ethereum, a “computer that had to be multiplayer out of necessity, and not out of choice.” Following early experimental games like Dark Forest, zkDungeon, and OPCraft that his team created or helped build on other chains, they’ve designed Redstone to better suit such games—and it’s open to the public.Certainly, crypto games can be built on layer-1 networks, as well as general-purpose layer-2 scaling networks. But fully on-chain games can be held back by the way those networks are typically designed. Games need low latency speeds, for example—and with such a constant flow of player inputs, they need to cut down on the friction of interacting with a blockchain.Redstone is built for just that, and it also features the first implementation of Plasma Mode, an alternative data availability protocol co-developed by Lattice and OP Labs. Plasma Mode allows for increased transaction throughput via an off-chain data availability provider, but also includes a permissionless Ethereum layer-1 feature that lets any user challenge suspicious inputs.In short, Plasma Mode picks different kinds of design trade-offs to power games and other high-throughput decentralized apps, but also includes an on-chain capability to challenge potential threats. It’s inspired by the Plasma concept that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin co-authored back in 2017 (and recently shined a fresh light on), and will be available throughout the OP Stack going forward.That’s paired with MUD, Lattice’s engine for on-chain Ethereum games. It’s being used by the studio’s own Sky Strife, a tactical strategy game in the vein of Nintendo’s classic Advance Wars that’s available to play today. Other Redstone launch games also use MUD, plus EVE Online developer CCP Games is using the engine for its Project Awakening game—though Glibert said that CCP has yet to choose a network for that project.Along with Sky Strife, the initial lineup of Redstone games includes titles like Biomes, a Minecraft-like sandbox game; DF Ares, a community-driven revival of Dark Forest; and Downstream, which has been described both as an “infinitely moddable MMO” and the “world's first post-singularity civilization simulator.”A screenshot from Sky Strife. Image: LatticeOne of the more distinctive games on the launch list is DEAR, a game by ARPA that sounds like a cross between an abstract art project, a virtual pet simulator, and a crypto-fied social experiment. Or as an ARPA representative described it, “DEAR is a digital creature that transforms under the collective behavior of all players—a tug of war between two factions, whether you feed or abuse the creature.”“Experimental” is a fair term to describe most of what’s happening around Redstone and fully on-chain games. Some of the early games look far from mass-market in aesthetic and are built around new and unfamiliar concepts.There are various benefits to being fully on-chain, Glibert said, such as the ability to easily deploy modifications to games and create new business models around existing games. Fully on-chain games (FOCGs) can’t be shut down or erased from existence like some Web2 games, while autonomous worlds (AWs) could yield new kinds of play mechanics and experiences.Whether there’s a business here, however, remains to be seen.“Most of the studios out there that have raised capital to build on-chain games—nobody knows if it's actually going to be a valuable market,” said Glibert. “I would say most of the people that are doing this seriously, they also don't know if there's actually a mature-enough business model today to do it.”But they’re still building, attempting to push the edges of what’s possible on-chain.“There is a lot of noise of ‘how to monetize’ before a FOCG actually takes shape,” ARPA co-founder and CTO Majorknight told Decrypt’s GG. “Rushed monetization is the killer of innovation. At best, it creates one-hit-wonders like the play-to-earn games we have seen and doesn't have anything to do with making FOCGs, or improving the infrastructure.”Majorknight described the Lattice team as a team of “young, talented, and driven people who focus on building the infrastructure” for such games, further praising them for attempting to empower new types of on-chain games.“The original vision of FOCGs is to utilize risk-free and creative scenarios to test the possibility of new blockchain applications and push the boundary of the infrastructure, similar to the relationship between games and simulations in science/engineering and between games and GPUs,” they added. “Who else to collaborate with if not the team who coined the term FOCG/AWs and established this vision beyond the short-sighted monetization?”Edited by Stephen GravesStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin Greed No More: Sentiment Back At Neutral After $57,000 Plunge


                            Data shows that Bitcoin sentiment has cooled off to neutral from greed following the asset’s latest plunge to the $57,000 level.
Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Returned To Neutral Levels
The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that shows the average sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market.
This index estimates sentiment by considering five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media data, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.

The metric uses a scale that runs from zero to 100 to represent this average sentiment. All values under 46 suggest that investors are fearful, while those above 54 imply a greedy market. The zone between these two cutoffs naturally corresponds to the territory of neutral mentality.
Now, here is what the Bitcoin sentiment looks like right now, according to the Fear & Greed Index:

The value of the metric appears to be 54 at the moment | Source: Alternative
As displayed above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is at a value of 54, implying that investors share a neutral sentiment currently. However, the neutrality is only just, as the metric is right at the boundary of the greed region.
This is a significant departure from yesterday’s sentiment: 67. The chart below shows how the indicator’s value has changed recently.

The trend in the Fear & Greed Index over the past year | Source: Alternative
As the graph shows, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has been declining recently. For most of February and March, as well as the first half of April, the indicator was in or near a special zone called extreme greed.
The market assumes this sentiment at values above 75. As the asset price struggled recently, the mentality cooled off from this extreme zone and entered the normal greed region. With the latest crash in BTC, the index has seen a sharp plunge, now exiting out of greed altogether.
Historically, cryptocurrency has tended to move against the majority’s expectations. The stronger this expectation, the higher the probability of such a contrary move.
This expectation is considered the strongest in extreme sentiment zones, as well as extreme fear and greed. As such, major bottoms and tops have often occurred in these territories.

The all-time high (ATH) price last month, which continues to be the top of the rally so far, also occurred alongside extreme values of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index.
With the sentiment now cooled to neutral, some investors may be watching for a fall into fear. This is natural because a rebound would become more probable the worse the sentiment gets now.
BTC Price
During Bitcoin’s latest plunge, its price briefly slipped below $57,000 before surging back to $57,300.

Cardano Founder And Ripple CTO Go Head To Head Over XRP Regulations And ETHGate Allegations | Bitcoinist.com


								The crypto community is witnessing a virtual showdown between Cardano Founder, Charles Hoskinson and Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz. The two crypto giants are clashing over Ripple’s present regulatory challenges and the allegations surrounding the ETH Gate.  
Hoskinson And Schwartz Embark On Heated Debate
Tensions have flared up within the crypto community as Hoskinson and Schwartz engaged in a fiery debate over allegations of conspiracy within the Ethereum community and Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

The controversy had begun when Hoskinson had publicly addressed rumors which claimed that the Ethereum community had influenced the regulatory decisions of the Ripple case by allegedly bribing the SEC to go after XRP. The Cardano founder had vehemently dismissed these allegations as unfounded conspiracy theories lacking credible evidence. 
In a swift rebuttal, Schwartz raised questions about a potential conflict of interest involving William Hinman, the former director of the US SEC. The Ripple CTO had implied that Hinman, having financial interests in Ethereum and recusing himself, may have swayed regulatory decisions in favor of Ethereum, potentially impacting the litigation against Ripple. 
“Aren’t the conventional ETH Gate arguments precisely about how it came to be that the SEC drew and interpreted the line in such a way that ETH was on the good side of it and XRP was on the bad side?” Schwartz inquired. 
Cardano Founder Faces Backlash From XRP Community
In a subsequent post, Hoskinson criticized Schwartz for purportedly spreading false information regarding allegations about an Ethereum community’s influence on Ripple’s legal battle with the US SEC. He clarified that he had never taken a stance on the rumors and arguments related to the ETH Gate, rather his statements have consistently revolved around the belief that someone within the Ethereum community had bribed the SEC to target XRP. 
Responding to Hoskinson’s comment, an XRP supporter and crypto member accused the Cardano founder of constantly using a preface in his posts to elicit sympathy rather than directly addressing the main problem. The member had also suggested that Hoskinson often portrays himself as a victim within the crypto community while refusing to change his opinions.

Following this, Hoskinson challenged the XRP supporter, using explicit language to demand proof that supports the claims that a member of the Ethereum community had directly influenced the legal proceedings of the Ripple and SEC case. 
Another community member also accused Hoskinson of misspeaking and misrepresenting the allegations made by the XRP community. The XRP supporter criticized the Cardano founder for aggravating the issues by insulting the XRP community and Schwartz, while simultaneously adopting a “narcissistic victim” stance. 
Hoskinson defended his position, asserting that he did not misspeak, and solidified his belief that allegations involving the Ethereum community bribing the SEC were and “has always been a conspiracy theory.”

Apple Pursues AI Advancements Through OpenAI Collaboration



                    

Apple is reportedly seeking a significant tech collaborator to enhance its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, particularly focusing on elevating the iPhone’s performance. 



According to Bloomberg, Apple is engaged in advanced discussions with OpenAI to further integrate generative AI technologies into iOS.




Nevertheless, other reports suggest that Apple is exploring partnerships with Google as another potential cloud ally. 



Despite its previous emphasis on internal AI development, Apple’s ambitions in the AI realm seem to have diminished over recent years. 



By 2024, the iPhone, Apple’s flagship product, is displaying indications of falling behind competitors who prioritize AI.




The transition from internal development to external collaborations became apparent in May 2022 when Ian Goodfellow, renowned for his contributions to AI and often dubbed the “GANfather,” departed from his role as director of machine learning at Apple due to the company’s return-to-office policy.

Since Goodfellow’s departure, Apple has remained active in the AI domain, releasing eight open-source large language models alongside their code and training logs. 



While this demonstrates a sustained commitment to AI and machine learning, none of these models are likely to rival closed models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.




Given this context, Apple may be striving to finalize its generative AI partnerships ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. 



The WWDC serves as a platform to unveil the company’s most significant products, and 2024 has been comparatively subdued for Apple thus far.



Meanwhile, Microsoft, Apple’s primary competitor, has experienced substantial growth since partnering with AI industry leader OpenAI. 



Currently, Microsoft holds the title of the world’s most valuable company by market capitalization, boasting a total value of $3.019 trillion, while Apple follows closely behind with $2.614 trillion.

DeFi lender Pike Finance loses $1.9M to two hacks in less than a week


Pike Finance has been hacked for the second time in four days, with losses across the two incidents totaling approximately $1.9 million.
In response to the first hack, on April 26, the team immediately paused the protocol. However, this opened up a new vulnerability that was exploited between 21:45 and 22:20 (UTC) on April 30.
Crypto security firm Ancilia quickly identified three malicious transactions on the Optimism, Arbitrum, and Ethereum networks. Ancilia states the attacker was able to ‘upgrade’ and take control of the Pike Finance contracts, which allowed them to withdraw the funds held within.
The stolen assets were swapped to ETH and consolidated in the attacker’s Ethereum address before being deposited into privacy protocol Railgun.

The hack was acknowledged by the Pike team on X (formerly Twitter). The post put the losses at approximately 64k OP ($150,000), 100k ARB ($105,000), and 480 ETH ($1.4 million) and admitted that the hack was related to the previous incident.
The last time Pike Finance was hacked (three days ago), it suffered losses of around $300,000 worth of the USDC stablecoin. The resulting funds were swapped for ETH and transferred to the crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash.
According to the earlier incident’s post-mortem report, the protocol was paused to prevent any further losses while the incident was investigated. The report also admits that the vulnerability had been reported by auditors OtterSec, but that the Pike team “was unable to address the identified vulnerability in a timely manner.”
However, as described in today’s response to the second hack, pausing the contracts inadvertently introduced “an additional dependency within the smart contract code.” This led to a “misalignment in storage mapping” which the attacker could take advantage of, reinitializing the contract and assuming full control.
Pike Finance has offered a 20% bounty for the return of the funds and has promised to provide a “plan to make users whole.”
The community’s opinions on this response can be seen in the Pike Finance Discord.

After being hit twice in a row, users are understandably upset, and some have suggested that Pike Finance refund pre-sale investments.
This in itself has, predictably, opened up another potential attack vector as scam replies (impersonating the Pike Finance account) promise a refund to victims as part of a common phishing technique.

'Dogecoin Millionaire' Says 'Fair Launches' For Meme Coins Don't Exist: 'Stop Being Delusional' - Benzinga

Las Vegas resident Glauber Contessoto, famously known as the "Dogecoin Millionaire,” took to his social media account to throw light on the concept of fair launches in the crypto markets.What Happened: The heavily followed trader argues that the presence of snipers and bots has created an uneven playing field, making it nearly impossible for average investors to compete."These days, there is no such thing as a fair launch," Contessoto asserts. "Snipers, people who use bots and are fucking professional at it, are who you’re going against when a coin launches." He emphasizes that, this cannot be considered a fair launch, as these players are not adhering to the same rules as regular investors.He further warns that attempting to participate in these launches is a surefire way to lose money, stating, "They’re not playing by the same rules as you, and you will lose money 100% of the time. Stop being completely delusional." He paints a picture of snipers waiting on the sidelines, ready to "crush and destroy a project the second it goes live."Also Read: Meme Coins Are ‘A Pure Ponzi’ And ‘Destroying Crypto,’ Says Trader Who Thinks Dogecoin Was DifferentWhy It Matters: For the betterment of the situation, Contessoto suggests that the best outcome investors can hope for is to support projects with solid teams that understand the challenges posed by snipers and bots.He advises teams to take proactive measures to protect their projects and communities. They could buy up most of the supply and distribute it over time, allowing the project to grow naturally with a thriving community as the market cap rises.His suggestion to investors is to focus on these types of projects rather than chasing the so-called "fair launches" that are vulnerable to snipers and bots. He also warns that as soon as the snipers dump their bags within hours of launch, they move on to the next coin that they can demolish and make endless money.Contessoto famously watched his fortune take a drastic plunge from $3 million to as low as $50,000 when he did not sell his Dogecoin DOGE/USD holdings after a massive run-up.What’s Next: The influence of meme coins and Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Crypto Trader Michael Van De Poppe Highlights Runs In Solana, Meme Coins, Predicts ‘There Is Always An Altcoin Season’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

BNB Chain's $1M Meme Innovation Contest Is 'Unleashing Meme Coin Creativity' - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBNB Chain is aiming to foster the creativity of meme coins through a $1 million Meme Innovation competition.With a prize pool of $1 million divided between two competition streams, the “BNB Chain Meme Innovation Battle” aims to enable meme coin developers and the community to “unleash their creativity and compete for amazing rewards.”“This competition plays on the open and whimsical nature of meme coins to call upon developers to create and launch their coins on BNB Chain,” a BNB Chain spokesperson told Decrypt.A dynamic prize pool of up to $500,000 will be allocated to BNB Smart Chain meme projects ranked across three categories: trading volume, market cap and meme community holders. Running through to May 9, the competition is open to projects that meet a set of criteria including security audits, total locked liquidity and community size, with public pre-sale projects ineligible to participate. A further $500,000 was allocated to a ‘Trade for Airdrop Rewards’ competition, for which snapshots were taken between April 20th and 22nd.“Nothing in crypto exemplifies the power of community more than meme coins,” said a BNB Chain spokesperson, adding that as “vessels of collective expression, camaraderie, and sometimes, social commentary,” their allure lies in the “shared experience and identity they offer to their holders.”As well as its Meme Innovation competition, BNB Chain is offering rewards to its community through a builder support program. This includes the DAU Incentive Program, offering up to $200,000, the TVL Incentive Program, offering up to $160,000, and the Q2 Hackathon with a $470,000 prize pool. “With a focus on ecosystem growth and accelerating the success of projects built on BNB Chain, these incentives complement the BNB Chain ecosystem growth initiatives including the MVB program,” a BNB Chain spokesperson told Decrypt.BNB Chain encompasses multiple chains, including BNB Smart Chain (BSC), opBNB, and Greenfield. These interconnected chains provide a “unified ‘One BNB’ solution,” according to BNB Chain, which caters to decentralized computing and storage needs for Web3 dapps including DeFi, gaming and AI, among others.Meme coins and communityRequiring minimal technical knowledge to create, meme coins are typically spun up in short order to reflect current events and internet memes. While they’ve been dismissed as novelties and rarely have technical utility, meme coins have grown to become a significant part of the crypto economy, with a current market cap of over $50 billion according to CoinGecko.Meme coins represent “a fascinating study in market psychology and community-driven value,” a BNB Chain spokesperson told Decrypt, while cautioning that “their volatility can lead to dramatic financial outcomes, making them a risky venture for the uninitiated.” With projects of “dubious quality” littering the meme coin landscape, their role as a gateway to the crypto space for newcomers can be something of a double-edged sword, with many meme coins burning out fast.Still, there are meme coins that have endured, notably the original Shiba Inu inspired Dogecoin, which recently saw the development of the DRC-20 standard, enabling the creation of non-fungible “Doginals” atop its blockchain.Aiming to tap into the evolution of meme coins from “simple jokes to cultural phenomena with potential real-world applications,” BNB Chain’s Meme Innovation contest “underlines the serious potential of what many still dismiss as mere jokes,” the spokesperson said.DisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $10 billion market cap in May


As May 2024 unfolds, the cryptocurrency market continues to feel the ripple effects of the  Bitcoin (BTC) halving event from April, traditionally a bullish catalyst for both Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.
This ongoing bullish sentiment is particularly beneficial for several cryptocurrencies approaching significant market cap milestones, including the notable $10 billion mark.
Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies that are likely to surpass this threshold. These predictions hinge not only on the continuation of the bull run but also on the potential benefits of high supply inflation, which could lead to an increased market cap even if price movements remain minimal.


Against this backdrop, Polkadot (DOT) and Polygon (MATIC) are the two cryptocurrencies projected to achieve the $10 billion market cap milestone. 
Polkadot (DOT)
DOT, known for its interoperability features and an expanding ecosystem of parachains—individual blockchains connected to and operating within the Polkadot network, is well-positioned for significant growth. The network’s sustained development and increased adoption of cross-chain applications could notably enhance its market cap.
Gavin Wood, Polkadot’s founder, recently introduced the Gray Paper outlining the upcoming Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) upgrade for the network. This protocol is a decentralized hybrid system designed to deliver secure and scalable smart contract functionalities, integrating select features from Ethereum into Polkadot’s architectural framework, thereby enhancing its utility.
In recent news, DOT initially bucked its downward trend, rising by around 3% to a high of $7. However, it has since retraced to $6.56 as of press time.

According to a price prediction by Coincodex, DOT is expected to reach $8.07 by May 5, 2024, which would represent a 29.38% increase within the next five days.

To achieve a $10 billion market cap, Polkadot would need to see an approximate increase of 6% from its current market capitalization of $9.44 billion, indicating a realistic possibility that could significantly impact its overall price trajectory.
Polygon (MATIC)
MATIC currently holds a market capitalization of $6.62 billion, with its price hovering around $0.6702.It  has experienced significant fluctuations recently but remains a focal point in the crypto market due to its core technology that enhances Ethereum’s (ETH) scalability and reduces transaction fees.
Despite recent declines, Polygon’s strategic position within the Ethereum ecosystem offers substantial upside potential. As Ethereum continues to dominate the blockchain space, the adoption of Polygon’s solutions could drive its market cap closer to the $10 billion milestone, signaling a promising horizon for MATIC.

It’s worth noting that despite being supported by several fundamentals, the possibility of the highlighted cryptocurrencies reaching the $10 billion mark will largely depend on whether the market maintains a bullish momentum.

CBN's KYC audit sends shockwaves through Nigerian Fintech

Four well-known fintech companies have received orders from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to stop onboarding new clients. This mandate is part of a larger audit of OPay, Kuda Bank, Moniepoint, and PalmPay’s KYC procedures.KYC concerns prompt temporary onboarding pauseThe CBN directive influenced the operation of these fintech platforms, “they have been put on hold for the time being, meaning those who would have had new accounts cannot continue. Each website features a notice of apology, indicating no disgrace on their account for the momentary interruption that affected them. Because no new customers are to be acquired, the continuing operation and the existing customers’ deposits remain safe and sound.”The move entails the Central Bank devising measures reflecting a series of events in which the legitimacy of the fintech platform was called into question due to loose KYC regulations. The story goes back to Fidelity Bank in October 2023, which had similar concerns about fraudulent activities restricting OPay, PalmPay, Kuda, and MonieP transactions. In turn, the banking authority implemented new KYC rules for any related financial institutions, and they focused on fintech startups as the most prominent threat.Government crackdown on FintechGovernment involvement in the fintech industry is practically the CBN directive. The alignment of the National Security Agency (NSA) and economic-related fraud agencies like the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in the battle against financial misdoings exposes their undeniable effort to eradicate such acts. The EFCC’s recent blocking of over a thousand accounts involved in unauthorized foreign exchange market transactions clearly shows the extra regulatory attention the financial sector is now subject to. The industry has mixed reactions, from cautious optimism to concerns about intensifying trade tensions. While some industries welcome the assistance afforded by higher domestic production requirements to strengthen their competitive edge, others fear that worldwide trade relations may become increasingly complicated.Although stopping the enrollment of a new customer base may disrupt business operations, the independent decision by the regulators is the right move in that it guards against regulatory infringements as it safeguards the financial risks. The recently conducted audit of KYC procedures is undoubtedly evidence of the industry’s determination and commitment to ensuring regulatory oversight.Regulatory evolutionHowever, amid these interventions, several positive policies and programs are currently being implemented within Nigeria’s financial regulatory structure.The appointment of Emomotimi Agama as the new Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the crypto community and investors not only for the recent economy but also for the future’s crypto economy is considered by cryptocurrency enthusiasts as an optimistic move. The appointment fosters devotion among investors, controls the capital market, and accelerates economic growth. The regulatory authority and fintech start-ups are expected to collaborate to expedite the process of acquiring licenses to operate crypto exchanges in Nigeria. Some stakeholders view the selection of Emomotimi Agama as a positive outcome that vows to open a new chapter of consensus between regulators and the crypto industry, which should result in an appropriate framework for innovation and growth.The CBN’s resoluteness against the currently ongoing activities of e-currency firms, which has led to the central bank’s ban on their customer onboarding operations, further explains the necessity of the KYC process for the financial system. Although they might be less desirable in the short run, such regulatory measures were intended to control standards of compliance and financial risks.

Chip Stocks Plunge After AMD's 2024 Guidance Falls Short of Expectations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) recently reported its projection for AI chip sales in 2024, estimating a revenue of $4 billion. While the figure fell short of Wall Street’s expectations, it’s important to note the significant potential of AMD’s AI chip sales, especially when compared to the higher forecasts provided by competitor Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).



Consequently, AMD’s shares experienced a notable drop, declining by almost 9% and trading at $144.27 at the time of writing. Analysts have expressed mixed views on the company’s prospects, with some reducing their price targets while others maintain a positive outlook given the broader potential of the AI chip market.



Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Reports Mixed Q3 Results, Shares Plunge



Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) released its third-quarter earnings after market close yesterday, reporting a revenue of $3.85 billion. This represents a substantial increase from $1.28 billion in the same period last year, although it fell slightly short of the expected $3.95 billion. However, the company exceeded expectations on earnings per share, reporting $6.56 compared to the anticipated $5.78. Looking ahead, SMCI raised its revenue guidance for 2024 to $15.1 billion, up from the previous estimate of $14.7 billion.



This revised guidance surpasses analysts’ predictions of $14.60 billion, indicating strong growth potential for the company. Despite the positive outlook, SMCI’s share price fell sharply by 17.98% following the earnings miss, reflecting the market’s high expectations and reaction to the slight revenue shortfall.





Chip Stocks Decline Amid Market Pressures



Several prominent chip stocks experienced declines following the earnings reports from AMD and SMCI. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) saw its shares fall by 2.00%, dropping the stock price to $1,274.31 at the time of writing. Notably, Nvidia also saw a decline in its share price by over 4% to $825.78 at the time of writing. 



Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) experienced a minor decrease as well, with its stock slightly falling by 0.11% at $165.66. Despite this slight dip, Qualcomm’s overall year-to-date performance remains strong, with the company having posted significant gains. The minor decrease is a temporary adjustment rather than a substantial shift in the company’s market position.

Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?


            
When Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin (BTC), the anonymous cryptographer envisioned a world where people would free themselves from the iron shackles of banks and tyrannical governments. 



What he probably didn’t expect, though, was a crypto industry teeming with badly drawn frog, cat and dog tokens, along with a sprinkling of racist memes.



With coverage of the fourth Bitcoin halving overshadowed by a speculative mania in meme coins — including on the Bitcoin network itself — it’s not surprising to see a very vocal debate over the value of meme coins to the crypto industry. 



Which we can answer — they now have a combined value of $51 billion in market capitalization.







What is a meme coin? The “dumpster of crypto”



Many vocal critics, including popular anonymous crypto commentator Polynya, are disillusioned and angry about the recent meme coin surge, arguing they have no place in the crypto ecosystem.



In his final blog post on Medium, where he essentially rage quit crypto, Polynya decried meme coins as “merely a vehicle to transfer wealth from the many to the most obnoxious people on the planet.”







The analyst highlighted reports of a wave of racist meme coins (dubbed “SlurFi” by some) as representing the token form’s nadir. 




“Things have hit an all-new bottom with 2024: racist, sexist, and other shitheaded memecoins.”




“At this point, this evil in crypto is banal and normalized. This has become the identity of crypto — sure, some useful stuff, but mostly just infested with scams and absolute degeneracy,” Polynya added.

Meme coins are also infested with rug pulls, scams and malicious taxes and are often run by inept founders who don’t know what they’re doing.



A recent investigation from Magazine found that 1 in 6 new Base meme coins are outright scams, while almost 91% of them had at least one security vulnerability. 



According to BlockAid, more than 50% of presale tokens launched on Solana between November and February were malicious.

Is the recent meme coin degeneracy contributing to genuine builders giving up on the industry? There’s a fair degree of “financial nihilism” in the argument that nothing means anything; everything in crypto is a meme anyway, and it’s “mid curve” to support projects that actually have a purpose.



“Seeing meme coins leading to disillusionment/churn of crypto builders to a degree more extreme than even the bear market the past few years,” says Michael Dempsey, managing partner at Compound, a New York-based venture capital firm. 



“Building something of durable value is a long emotional journey, and it can be tough after a two-year bear market […] to then have a reversion of curiosity from crypto, and the main vacuum of energy is gambling.”



Another venture capital executive, Eddy Lazzarin, chief technical officer at Andreessen Horowitz, says meme coins are “undermining the long-term vision of crypto” that has kept so many in the space.






Are meme coins worth it for attention and users?



But ignoring the racist tokens, rug pulls, and scams, meme coins aren’t all bad. Some argue the attention that meme coins bring is still a net benefit for crypto. It’s certainly a net benefit for blockchain networks as traders race to buy and sell coins. Solana, Base and BNB Chain in particular, are benefiting from a big influx of meme coin stans looking for a cheap way to trade coins.



In the last few months, layer-1 blockchains BNB Chain and Avalanche have launched million-dollar funds to try to bring meme coin magic to their networks to drive network growth. 



A community proposal on the Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum is also seeking a massive $3.3 billion fund to open the proverbial meme coin floodgates. As befits a meme coin proposal asking for billions, it was knocked up in an hour.

“Everyday, we see headlines of how Solana meme coins go from 0-100M+ FDVs in a matter of days,” says 0xkawz, who created the meme coin fund proposal. 



“There is no reason Arbitrum DAO shouldn’t at least try to spur a meme coin initiative […] it’s hard to argue that Solana and, more recently, BASE, have taken all the attention,” they added.







Solana meme coins frenzy drives usage



In mid-March, Solana’s network activity briefly surpassed Ethereum’s as traders hoped to catch the next runaway meme coin success. Trading volume on March 15 reached $3.5 billion, outpacing its older and slower rival by more than $1.1 billion, per DefiLlama. 







The frantic activity tested the scaling limits of the network and found them wanting, with up to three-quarters of all transactions failing at one point. This was addressed in a patch a month later.

The speculative degen blockchain of choice from the last cycle, BNB Chain, is eying that same market. The chain announced it would allocate up to $1 million throughout April to reward developers who hit a 30-day volume above $2 billion on the network as part of its “Meme Innovation Campaign.”



“When the community sends a clear signal that something matters to them, we seek to deliver on it,” a spokesperson from BNB Chain says, adding that meme coins have the potential to bring more users into crypto whether or not they end up being just “noise in the crypto market.”



Solana’s head of strategy, Austin Federa, says meme coins have been getting traction on Solana largely due to the tokens having become “rather strictly proxies for online culture and community.”



“For example, certain meme coins, like BONK, have rallied communities together and built vibrant ecosystems that resonate in the broader crypto space.”

“We’re seeing this momentum because Solana’s cost structure makes it possible for projects to launch tokens and send transactions inexpensively.”



Meme coins make millions addicted to Base



Coinbase’s Base network has also been a huge winner in the recent meme coin rush, with its layer-2 network’s total value locked recently surpassing $5 billion per L2Beat data.



“There’s been a ton of energy on base,” Base creator Jesse Pollak said in a presentation for an April 20 hackathon in New York, which was re-recorded and posted on X. 



The Base founder said that while speculation is driving the activity, one of the aspects of memes he was most optimistic about was the creative ways that meme communities have tried to onboard new followers.



“What that’s creating is this kind of Cambrian explosion of onboarding experiments where people are taking tons and tons of shots on goal to say ‘how do we get our culture into the hands of more people,’” said Pollak. 







“The thing we’ve built more conviction on is that in the years ahead, we’re actually going to see these memes bring in millions more people [to Base] — they’re going to be one of the biggest drivers because they’re doing that work constantly to onboard more and more folks through that in a really creative way.”



“Base’s mission is to bring the next billion users on-chain, and we are encouraged by the recent influx of activity on Base,” a Coinbase spokesperson tells Magazine.



Vitalik Buterin thinks meme coins can be used for good



In a recent blog post on his website, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote that while he has “zero enthusiasm” for coins named after “totalitarian political movements, scams, rug pulls,” he sees potential in tokens that could fund important public projects or even allow people from lower-income countries to earn a living. 



“If people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version of this whole concept?” he said. 



This meme coin is themed after a certain gold-loving Bitcoin-hating commentator.



Famously, one of the most successful investments Buterin ever made was turning $25K into $4.3 million with Dogecoin, which he bought in 2016 and sold in 2020. 



Meme coins with real-world utility



Thomas Tang, the vice president of investments at crypto venture capital firm Ryze Labs, tells Magazine he believes meme coins can be a “go-to-market strategy” for an entity or a business — turning a token into a rallying point for a community.



Tang cites DEGEN on Base as a recent example. It started as a tipping token for users on Farcaster’s Degen channel to reward others for good posts but later morphed into a layer-3 chain of its own. 



“You have accumulated a whole community of people that have been tipped in this token […] it’s gained massive mass popularity because everyone’s tipping each other, and everyone holds it,” said Tang. 



“So they built a layer 3, based on that.” 







DEGEN chain launched as a layer-3 network built on top of Base in late March, and uses DEGEN as its native gas token. 



The developers say the new chain will enable experiments with tipping, community rewards, payments and gaming. It’s mostly been used for meme coin speculation so far, but the activity saw Degen hit 37.12 transactions per second on April 18, making it the fastest protocol in the Ethereum ecosystem. Demand is a big driver of the TPS of scaling solutions rather than pure technical capacity.



Dogecoin and meme coin communities



CK Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer of ZX Squared Capital, sees meme coins as a product of the attention economy and argues Dogecoin (DOGE) is a “good example” of a meme coin story gone right.




“At the beginning, nobody knew how Dogecoin would be used.”




“But if you get a large network of people with the same interest and get a community built […] things can happen. A coin is purely a platform,” said Zheng. 



Some even argue that all of crypto is driven by memes, including the projects that claim to actually do something.



Dogecoin was launched in December 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who created it to poke fun at rampant cryptocurrency speculation at the time. 



The cryptocurrency now has a $26.7 billion market cap, making it the eighth most valuable cryptocurrency, just behind USD Coin (USDC) with roughly 4.6 million non-zero addresses, according to BitInfoCharts.

Elon Musk’s Tesla accepts it as a form of payment for its merchandise, and there are hints that users will one day be able to buy an entire car with it.



Zheng said a similar thing happened when merchants from ancient Rome and China met to trade on the ancient Silk Road thousands of years ago.



“There was no dollar then; there was no Chinese yen,” said Zheng, adding that through “generations and generations of exchange, gold became ingrained as a means of exchange.



“It’s the same thing with Dogecoin. If there are 7 or 10 million people that use Dogecoin, that becomes a community […] It’s a snowball effect, and when you have more and more people, the value of the underlying (asset) will increase.”



There’s also a sizeable camp of people who don’t really like meme coins, but are prepared to put up with them because one of crypto’s core ideals is being open and permissionless.  






What are meme coins if not the freedom to transact?



“On the whole, I believe meme coins are good because they reflect society’s commitment to upholding digital property rights through a free and open market,” says Yuga Cohler, the engineering lead at Coinbase, wrote in a March thread on X, adding:



The (likely) fake listing of this decrepit house has an associated meme coin “For sale by owner” or $FSBO.



“Meme coins are one of the purest expressions for citizens to exercise their freedom to transact without contingency.”



Solana co-founder Raj Gokal is also among them, calling out VCs that suggest memecoins are scaring away “serious builders.”



“If you’re fragile enough to get spooked by how young people choose to use permissionless systems to have fun, you will quite simply not make it here,” he said. 



“I value people’s desire to have fun, and I would rather the crypto space somehow swim with this current rather than against it,” Buterin added in his blog post. 



However, Zheng says he ultimately sees meme coins as just a “sideshow.”



“Every cycle, there’s a certain amount of hype, and people use that cycle as a way to test out new things,” said Zheng, noting NFTs grew extremely popular in the last bull run. 



“Personally I see Bitcoin as the fundamental driver in terms of the crypto ecosystem.”

An ETH ETF Wouldn’t Deliver Full-Returns to Investors

With the recent approval, launch and success of spot bitcoin ETFs, all eyes have turned to the possibility of spot ETH ETF regulatory approval, an outcome we believe to be unlikely under the current administration. Additionally, an ETH ETF will, at least initially, lack a staking reward component, a key aspect of ETH total return.

Eminem's new crypto ad fails to capture the moment, lets it slip - Blockworks



This isn’t going to be another op-ed about how silly it is for celebrities to do cryptocurrency ads. We all know that they don’t age well.
Instead, what I’d like to opine on is why a cryptocurrency ad with Marshall Mathers, aka Eminem, falls flat in particular. If you’re going to put a celebrity in your crypto ad, you need to go all out with creativity, humor or just overall entertainment value. Eminem’s new crypto ad does none of that — it has almost nothing to do with the rapper, or crypto at all.
The rapper’s voiceover on an advertisement for Crypto.com aired during the Lakers NBA play-off game last week. The ad itself, just a minute long, shows a nameless, faceless boxer getting ready to face-off in a match at the Crypto.com Arena. You can hear Eminem’s voice saying empty platitudes of encouragement in the background, telling the audience to enjoy the moment, before the screen shows the somewhat infamous slogan, “Fortune favors the brave.”
I say infamous, because Matt Damon’s 2022 Crypto.com SuperBowl commercial — where the Oscar-nominated actor was actually pictured on screen saying that catchphrase out loud — just looked so silly in the wake of the FTX crash. Damon later gave an awkward, pause-filled red carpet interview, noting that he only did the commercial to support his water non-profit in a down year.
Some are already speculating that Eminem’s main motivation to lend his voice to Crypto.com’s latest ad is part of a marketing push for his upcoming album. But his motivations for being crypto’s latest celebrity spokesperson aren’t important. What’s important is how soulless that advertisement is. Watching the commercial for the first time as a longtime Eminem stan, I lamented all of the missed opportunities staring me in the face.
Read more from our opinion section: Crypto’s best use case? Buying goats on Twitter
For one, this is far from Eminem’s first foray into crypto — he had his own, pretty cringey Bored Ape phase at the peak of the NFT boom, culminating in a half-animated BAYT music video with none other than Snoop Dogg. That was terrible, and also funny: and Crypto.com’s pretty basic ad could have benefitted from any sort of creative reference to Eminem’s actual crypto interests. 
Granted, Crypto.com is not an NFT platform. That doesn’t mean that you aren’t allowed to have a sense of humor — especially when creating a likely very expensive advertisement with a very famous, previously NFT-obsessed rapper.
Which brings me to my second point — there’s no rap. Paying Eminem to remain faceless and read a short, only slightly rhyming text over a black-and-white boxing video feels like paying Bob Dylan to promote Victoria’s Secret.
Eminem’s crypto ad isn’t the first since the unfortunate crypto Super Bowl. Both Coinbase and Greyscale also put out slightly more entertaining ads in the lead up to the Bitcoin halving, albeit celebrity-less ones. 
As I said at the top, my point here isn’t to convince the world that celebrities in crypto ads are setting themselves up for future embarrassment, loss of money and even potentially SEC fines. We already know that. And I also know that no one will stop crypto companies, especially during a bull market, from paying celebrities tons of money to promote their brands anyway. Sam Bankman-Fried set that precedent, and even with him in jail, it really shows no signs of abating.
Instead, I’d like to propose that if we are going to keep having celeb-studded crypto ads — make them really sparkle. Pay Eminem to write an entire song about trading on Crypto.com and release it alongside his new album, with a specially crypto-themed music video (he already has the experience). Get JoJo Siwa to wrap another car with whatever memecoin logo, or Brooklyn Beckham to tattoo Dogecoin eyes next to his tattoo of his wife’s eyes.
Celebrity crypto ads, in my opinion, should only exist if they do something really creative or really silly: In other words, make them match the whimsy and creativity of this burgeoning financial tech industry. I’m not sure that any SEC lawyers would agree with me. Good thing I don’t work for the SEC.
Otherwise, make celebrity crypto endorsements illegal for all of the obvious reasons (high potential for securities fraud and misleading investors to start). In a nutshell — go silly or go home.

I don’t care much about tech, I don’t care a whole lot about finance, either. I care about writing stories and watching weird things unfold. And that’s why I’ve ended up in crypto. But because I’m missing that passion for what crypto and blockchain are all about — finance, tech, privacy, yadda yadda — I’m going to write instead about what I am actually interested in. Everything about crypto that has very little to do with crypto.That’s what this column will be about. All the tangential stories that come out of the blockchain and crypto space, what I think about them, and how I navigate it all as a skeptical former Russian literature major.It’s precisely my perch as an outsider that lets me do what I do: Opine on all sides of any crypto issue, no strings attached, no skin in the game.If you want to talk crypto with me, let’s go off topic.

Solana and Bitcoin NFT trading hits record numbers - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin and Solana non-fungible token (NFT) market registered records in daily active traders (DAT) last week, according to the research blog OurNetwork. While Solana reached its all-time high of 59,300 DAT, Bitcoin registered a peak of 25,600 DAT.Solana’s rising DAT number represents a fourfold increase from the approximately 15,000 daily traders earlier last week. The publication attributes this growth to the influx of wallets engaging in sub-$10 transactions on platforms like Magic Eden and Tensor. Over the past week, Magic Eden has captured a significant 74% of Solana’s trading volume market share and 38% of its trader market share, while Tensor has secured 18% of the volume and a dominant 61% of traders.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s NFT trading historical peak was attributed to the anticipation of the Runes protocol launch. However, the trader count experienced a sharp decline to around 7,000 the day following the launch. Magic Eden has been the primary hub for Bitcoin’s NFT activity, commanding 82% of both active traders and trading volume over the last seven days, with OKX trailing at 16% for the same metrics.Image: OurNetwork/NFTpulseEthereum still reigns, but numbers declineDespite dominating in trading volume and daily active traders, Ethereum’s weekly NFT trader numbers have been in decline over the past two years, with less than 36,000 wallets engaging in trades last week. OurNetwork points out that this is a significant drawdown compared to the 218,000 seen in April 2022.Similarly, the weekly volume has plummeted from the $1.4 billion peak last April to approximately $100 million per day currently.Moreover, the Ethereum NFT landscape also shows changes when it comes to marketplace dominance. OpenSea and Blur rivalry was met by the rise of Magic Eden as a competitor since its Ethereum marketplace debut in February. Magic Eden has quickly garnered over 20% of Ethereum’s NFT volume in the last week alone.Image: OurNetwork/Dune AnalyticsAlthough Blur maintains a majority share with over 50% volume, OpenSea’s presence has diminished to 13.5% in the recent seven-day period. Yet, OpenSea still leads in trader count on Ethereum, attracting about 4,000 traders daily, compared to Blur’s 2,500 and Magic Eden’s under 600. Over the last two years, OpenSea has seen a dramatic 90% drop in its weekly trader base.On the significant trades side, a transaction on the CryptoPunks NFT marketplace involved a 4,000 ETH purchase, valued at over $12 million, for a highly coveted alien punk. This sale propelled CryptoPunks to the second-highest platform by volume on Ethereum for that day, with only Blur surpassing it with $15.2 million in volume.

Bitcoin investor charged with tax fraud in multi-million dollar scheme

Roger Ver, a supporter and pioneer of Bitcoin, has faced criminal cases related to mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. The indictment accuses Ver of hiding Bitcoin ownership, not reporting important company valuations, and evading nearly $50 million in estimated taxes.Court documents unveilsRoger Ver’s alleged tax evasion schemeThe court documents maintain that Ver, who at the time resided in Santa Clara, California, was the owner of two companies, Memory Dealers Inc. and Agilestar Inc., which resold computer and networking hardware. Verkammen’s bitcoin history goes back to 2011 when he allegedly bought the first bitcoins for himself and his firms. He also called for coins in his articles and blogs, where he got the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus.”He reportedly abandoned her US citizenship in 2014 by becoming a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, just two years after obtaining her citizenship. He moved his Bitcoin assets to the wallet of a family member who had not reported capital gains. Under U.S. law, he was also required to echo that. The indictment claims that Ver intentionally underreported his asset in her appraisal by his law firm and appraiser; thus, the jurors suspected tax violation.False tax returns and undisclosed Bitcoin salesIn February 2014, 73,000 bitcoins were estimated at his firm’s disposal. This fact is still in doubt, as Ver didn’t report any Bitcoin on their tax files. Moreover, Ver allegedly sold off tens of thousands of bitcoins in 2017, which roughly translated to around $240M. He never reported these transactions and missed paying the taxes due to the profits incurred. The indictment charges that Ver had committed acts that caused a minimum loss to the IRS not less than $48 million, according to the law. US DoJ Tax Division Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg and US Attorneys Martin Estrada for the Central District of California published the case today. The IRS Criminal Investigation Cybercrimes Unit is spearheading the cybercrime arena. Matthew J. Kluge, an Assistant Chief in the Tax Division of the Justice Department, James Anthony, a Trial Attorney, and James, an aide US Attorney, have been essential players. Besides C. Hughes, the lawyer for the Central District of California, some well-qualified personnel are involved in the discussion as well. He now faces extradition to the U.S. as a possible option. Roger Ver’s case for tax fraud, evasion, and false filing of tax returns was the second one in a row that emphasized that tax law submission is obligatory and should keep up with the speed of the coin industry development. This allegation sheds some light on the difficulty in regulating digital assets and the authorities’ persistence in confirming responsibility regarding the individuality’s whole sector. While the instance amasses, it may also revive awareness of the unfriendly, anti-investment practices in investors and businesses.

Bitcoin Euphoria Cools Off As BTC Distribution Enters Fear Zone


                            Bitcoin has finally broken below the $60,000 support level for the first time in two months. The world’s largest digital asset has largely been in a euphoria phase since the beginning of the year, particularly after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. However, the current consolidation of the price of Bitcoin indicates the euphoria might be fading. 
According to a new report from Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm, the euphoria surrounding Bitcoin, which has been active for the past 6.5 months, looks to be fading. At the same time, the BTC distribution has entered into the fear zone and investors are now heavily weighted towards selling.
Selling Pressure Rises
After reaching an all-time high of over $73,737 in March 2024, Bitcoin has declined by more than 18% as investors take profits. This drop in price has been accompanied by a rise in the percentage of addresses holding losses, indicating increased selling pressure. The percentage of addresses making a profit has fallen in tandem from over 99% to 86% at the time of writing.

On-chain analytics platform Glassnode noted in its recent report the consolidation action. According to the Net Unrealized Profit & Loss (NUPL) metric, Bitcoin has been in a euphoria mode very early in this cycle when compared to past cycles. Notably, the NUPL crossed over 0.5 approximately 6.5 months before the just concluded halving amidst hype about Spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
This is in comparison to the 2021 market cycle, where the NUPL was triggered into a profit zone 8.5 months after the Bitcoin halving. This metric suggests the market is still in its euphoria phase for the last seven months but has cooled off significantly due to correction in the past two months.
Interestingly, the report noted a “distinct uptick in net outflows” across all wallet sizes throughout April, indicating the current sentiment among traders. This means traders are now in a sell-side pressure across the board. Furthermore, a majority of short-term (one week to one month) holders have been posting losses on the 90-day +1sd level since March.

What Does This Mean For Bitcoin?
While the “fear” rating may worry investors, a pullback after such a steep price rise is considered healthy by most crypto analysts. Many long-term holders are still holding strong and are waiting for the halving effect to kick in. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $59,899 and is down by 5.35% in the past 24 hours.

Considering the current cost-basis for short-term holders (STH) is at $66,700, and their realized price is at $59,800, many more holders in this cohort have possibly entered into the loss zone. 
According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, $59,800 is a key price level to watch, as history has shown Bitcoin tends to bounce over the STH realized price.

ETH Founder Vitalik Reveals 90% of His Crypto Held in Multi-Sig Service - Coin Edition


							

Vitalik Buterin uses a multi-sig wallet for 90% of his crypto to enhance security.



He recommended a multi-sig solution to minimize the personal risks of hardware wallets. 



In a multi-sig solution, users hold some keys but are insufficient to recover the funds independently.




Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has explained why as much as 90% of his personal crypto funds are secured through a multi-signature hardware wallet solution. Buterin revealed this information while commenting on a trend urging crypto users to migrate to hardware wallet solutions.



Crypto data analyst Kofi sparked the conversion by painting a scenario where crypto users woke up one day and discovered their investments had been stolen. Notably, stories of devastating losses are rampant in the crypto scene, particularly as the bull market gains momentum. 



As crypto enthusiasts participate in airdrop activities and other endeavors, they become susceptible to bad actors who create similar but fraudulent activities intended to steal their seed phrase to ultimately drain their wallets.



Renowned crypto investigator ZachXBT recently uncovered that the Lazarus Group orchestrated over 25 crypto hacks to launder $200 million. On the other hand, security firm CertiK disclosed that the crypto community witnessed exploits worth $21 million in April, often involving hacks and wallet drainers.



While utilizing a hardware wallet solution could prevent some of these exploits, the founder of the NFT trading platform Reservoir contends that the primary risk shifts to the users themselves. The risks include forgetting or losing the seed phrase, especially if it is hidden too well or stored in a bank safety deposit box and becomes inaccessible due to sudden relocation.



In response, Vitalik Buterin noted that the cited concerns are precisely why he opted for a multisig service like Safe for over 90% of his personal funds. 







He explained that multi-sig setups, where multiple keys are required for transactions but not all held by the user, provide an added layer of security.  Typically, some keys are held by the user, but not enough to independently recover the funds. The remaining keys are entrusted to other individuals whom one trusts.



“Don’t reveal who those other people are, even to each other. Decentralize your own security.” Buterin concluded.

3 Cannabis Stocks That Can Post Gains as US Shifts to Softer Regulations - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Politicians regale their voting base during election years with new promises and policy shifts. This time, the Biden admin announced intent to loosen up marijuana rules on a federal level. Specifically, to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III substance, following half a century of it being classified as Schedule I (ecstasy, heroin, LSD) substance.



This would place the recreational plant among less controversial drugs, such as anabolic steroids, phendimetrazine for appetite suppression, or codeine for pain relief. According to sources familiar to NBC News, the DEA is expected to approve the opinion delivered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the agency responsible for the reclassification.



Predictably, the announcement sparked a resurgence in weed stocks. Laboring between regulatory walls and black market competition, marijuana companies have had trouble erecting sustainable profitability. But accounting for the recent investment spike, AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (MSOS), tracking 25 marijuana stocks, is now up 47% year-to-date.



The question is, which cannabis stocks have established themselves in the current regulatory regime, making them well-suited to prosper in a more lax environment?



Cronos Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRON)



Based in Toronto, Canada, Cronos Group has been busy building its cannabis-powered portfolio of brands. These are divided into three categories – mainstream (Spinach), medicinal (PeaceNaturals), and premium (Lord Jones). In addition to Canada, Cronos sources its products from Israel, Australia, and Germany.



Cronos Group concluded fiscal year 2023 with a net loss of $70.4 million, a 55% improvement from the net loss of $155.17 million in 2022. Moreover, the company reported $862 million in cash and cash equivalents while having zero debt. Cronos is also the beneficiary of the heavy weight Altria, having invested $1.8 billion in Cronos in 2019.



The group is scheduled to report its Q1 2024 earnings on May 9th. At the present price level of $2.94, the CRON penny stock is 44% above its 52-week low point of $1.64 per share. Per Nasdaq’s aggregated forecast data twelve months ahead, the average CRON price target is $2.42 per share.



Of course, this doesn’t account for the new investor resurgence and the inherent penny stock volatility. The next earnings report will likely set the tone for CRON investor sentiment for the rest of the year.





Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ: CGC)



Having established a global marijuana presence across popular brands Tweed, Tokyo Smoke, Spectrum Therapeutics, and Houseplant, Canopy is the most performant cannabis stock. Year-to-date, CGC has gained 114% value, exiting the penny stock territory at $10.80 per share.



In February, the Canadian company reported a 7% year-over-year revenue decline for Q3 FY24. From a massive net loss of CAD$2.6 billion in 2022, Canopy Growth made the most significant 78% improvement to CAD$583.4 million net loss in 2023. The company’s cash and equivalents depleted from CAD$598.1 million to CAD$142.7 million during the period.



On the upside, Canopy Growth halved its total liabilities from CAD$1.6 billion to CAD$815 million. The CGC stock had its 52-week low of $2.75 per share. Per Nasdaq, the average CGC price target is $3.45, making it highly overbought.



Nonetheless, the investor interest in growth stocks indicates that CGC shares will be the primary beneficiaries of further inflows following inevitable price corrections.







Curaleaf Holdings (NASDAQ: CURLF)



Standing out from the Canadian cannabis crowd, Curaleaf is an American company based in New York. The firm holds a presence in 17 states across 145 local dispensaries. Recently, on April 22nd, Curaleaf acquired Northern Green Canada (NGC), known for its penetration of the EU market via EU-GMP certification. NGC had a foothold in Australia and New Zealand, paving the road for Curaleaf’s international cannabis presence.



Curaleaf is also scheduled to report Q1 2024 earnings on May 9th. Following the conclusion of fiscal year 2023, Curaleaf claims to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with a 1.9x debt load to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which was reported at $83 million in Q4.



Curaleaf International tracked 63% year-over-year revenue growth of $18 million and expects further gains in Czechia, the UK, Germany (via the recently passed Cannabis Act “CanG”), Poland, and Switzerland. Europe’s total addressable market for Curaleaf and other cannabis companies is $248 billion.



Curaleaf concluded 2023 with $588 total debt and $92 million in cash. The company ended 2023 with a $290.3 million net loss vs a $376.9 million net loss in 2022, an improvement of 23%. CURLF stock is up 44.5% year-to-date, leaving behind its yearly low of $2.47 per share. Per Nasdaq, the average CURLF price target is $7.06 vs the present $5.96 per share.

Price analysis 5/1: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, DOGE, TON, ADA, AVAX, SHIB

Bitcoin (BTC) sliced through the $60,000 support on May 1, signaling that the uptrend has weakened. While the fall has muddied the short-term picture for Bitcoin, the analysts remain bullish for the long term. Traders latch on to every bit of negative news when the price action turns bearish. Investor sentiment received a beating on the muted response to the Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that debuted on April 30. Continued outflows from the United States-based spot Bitcoin ETFs for the fifth consecutive day also did little to soothe nerves.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Every bull phase witnesses sharp corrections, which shake out the weak hands. The lower levels give an opportunity to the long-term investors to add to their portfolios. However, it is better to wait for the price to confirm a bottom before initiating large bets.Could Bitcoin and the altcoins start a sharp recovery, trapping the aggressive bears? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin’s consolidation resolved to the downside on May 1, indicating that the bears have overpowered the bulls.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewBuyers will attempt to push the price back above $59,600, but the bears are likely to have other plans. If the price turns down from $59,600, it will suggest that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. That will enhance the prospects of a drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298. This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average ($66,596).Ether price analysisEther broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($3,170) and the $3,056 support on April 30, signaling that the bears are in command. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe selling continued on May 1, and the bears tugged the price below the solid support at $2,852. If bears sustain the price below $2,852, the ETH/USDT pair could move downward to $2,700 and subsequently to $2,400.Time is running out for the bulls. If they want to prevent the decline, they will have to quickly push the price back above the moving averages. If they do that, it will indicate that the fall below $2,850 may have been a fake breakdown. BNB price analysisThe long tail on BNB’s (BNB) April 30 candlestick shows that the bulls purchased at lower levels but they could not sustain the momentum. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bears continued selling and yanked the price below the moving averages on May 1. The BNB/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $495. This is an essential support for the bulls to defend because a break below $495 could sink the pair to $460 and later to $400.Contrary to this assumption, if the price bounces off $495 and rises above the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for some more time. The bulls will have to overcome the obstacle at $635 to start the next leg of the uptrend.Solana price analysisThe failure of the bulls to start a rebound off $126 in Solana (SOL) shows that the bears remain in control.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThere is a minor support at $116, but if this level cracks, the selling could accelerate, and the SOL/USDT pair could plunge to $100. The greater the fall, the longer it will take for the next leg of the uptrend to begin.If bulls want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly push the price above the 20-day EMA ($144). That may trap the aggressive bears, resulting in a short squeeze. The pair may then ascend toward the 50-day SMA ($166).XRP price analysisXRP (XRP) tried to start a relief rally from the psychological level of $0.50 on April 29, but the bulls could not maintain the higher levels.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewSustained selling by the bears pulled the price below $0.50, opening the doors for a retest of the solid support at $0.46. The bulls are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $0.46 and $0.41 because a break below it may start a downtrend.Alternatively, if the price bounces off $0.46 and rises above the 50-day SMA ($0.57), it will suggest that the bears are losing their grip. The XRP/USDT pair may then extend its stay inside the $0.41 to $0.74 range for several more days.Dogecoin price analysisDogecoin’s (DOGE) fall picked up momentum after the price broke below the symmetrical triangle pattern.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bears have pulled the price below the neckline of the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. If the price remains below $0.12, the selling could intensify, and the DOGE/USDT pair may slide to $0.10 and eventually to $0.08.On the contrary, if the price quickly rises back above the neckline, it will indicate solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will gain strength on a break above the 20-day EMA ($0.15), and a potential trend change will be signaled above the downtrend line.Toncoin price analysisToncoin (TON) broke below the 50-day SMA ($5.32) on April 30, indicating that the bears are maintaining their pressure.TON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bulls are likely to defend the zone between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $4.90 and the 61.8% retracement level of $4.25. Buyers will have to kick the price above the 20-day EMA ($5.58) to signal that the correction may be over. If that happens, the TON/USDT pair may attempt a rally to $6.24.Instead, if the price continues lower and breaks below $4.25, it will signal that the uptrend has ended. That increases the risk of a drop to $3.32.Related: Why is Bitcoin price down today?Cardano price analysisCardano (ADA) is trying to start a recovery from $0.42, but the weak rebound suggests a lack of demand from the bulls.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.48) and the RSI near the oversold zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the price skids below $0.42, the ADA/USDT pair could retest $0.40 support. The bulls are likely to defend the level with all their might because a break below it may extend the decline to $0.35.The 20-day EMA remains the key overhead resistance that needs to be crossed to suggest that the bears may be losing their grip. If that happens, the pair may attempt a rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.57).Avalanche price analysisBuyers tried to push Avalanche (AVAX) back above the uptrend line on April 29, but the bears did not relent. This shows that the bears are trying to flip the uptrend line into resistance.AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThere is a minor support at $31.92. But if this level gives way, the AVAX/USDT pair could plummet to $29.24. The zone between $27.24 and $29.24 may witness aggressive buying by the bulls.Buyers will have to clear the downtrend line on the way up if they want to signal a comeback. The pair could then rise to $42 and thereafter to the 50-day SMA ($45.68). This level may attract selling by the bears.Shiba Inu price analysisThe bulls tried to push Shiba Inu (SHIB) above the 20-day EMA ($0.000024) on April 30, but the bears held their ground.SHIB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe SHIB/USDT pair could slide to $0.000020, which is likely to act as a strong support. Any rebound off this level is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a drop to $0.000018 increases.The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the moving averages. Such a move will signal solid buying at lower levels. The pair may then attempt a rally to $0.000033, where the bears may mount a stiff resistance.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance Announces Latest Project It Invested in - Bitcoin Sistemi


Blockchain development firm Movement Labs has received an undisclosed investment from Binance Labs, the venture capital arm of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. This investment comes on the heels of Movement Labs' $38 million Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital.
Movement Labs is on a mission to build an ecosystem of blockchains based on the modular programming language Move, starting with “M2”, a Move Virtual Machine Layer 2 for Ethereum. The company plans to use the funds to expand into the Asia-Pacific region and encourage adoption of the Move programming language across broader blockchain ecosystems.


“Binance Labs' support and expertise will be invaluable as we continue to implement our 'Move Anywhere' strategy, focusing on the vibrant and innovative APAC market,” said Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs.

Movement's Layer 2 blockchain aims to expand the use of the Move programming language beyond the well-known Aptos and Sui Layer 1 blockchains. Move was originally developed by a team within Meta, formerly known as Facebook's now-defunct Diem stablecoin project.





Additionally, Movement Labs is developing Move Stack, an execution layer framework compatible with rollups such as Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The company will launch its public testnet Parthenon in the coming weeks and aims for a mainnet launch by the end of the year.

Four Solana Memecoins That Could Surge 8,000% and Take on Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

Market Cap: $19,000

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Don't Get Left Behind: Web3 Wallets Offer More Than You Think In Today's Market - Benzinga

The Web3 landscape is experiencing a significant shift, with user expectations for their wallets evolving rapidly.Gone are the days when secure asset storage was the sole function; users now seek a more comprehensive and integrated experience within their Web3 wallets. Features like DApp browsing, trading, NFT marketplaces, and even inscriptions tools are becoming increasingly in-demand.In an interview with Benzinga, Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, revealed substantial shifts in user expectations for Web3 wallets over the past two years, reflecting broader trends within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Kan noted that the functionality of these wallets has expanded significantly, transforming from mere storage solutions to comprehensive platforms supporting various Web3 activities.“Previously, Web3 wallets were mainly seen as secure storage for assets. Now, they have evolved into complex gateways offering trading, DApp browsing, and more,” Kan explained. He further emphasized that Bitget Wallet has been at the forefront of this evolution since 2018, continuously enhancing its features to meet the growing demand for integrated services like NFT marketplaces and staking gateways.Kan also highlighted the rise of inscriptions and meme coins as prominent trends driving recent developments in the wallet space. “Inscriptions have gained traction, especially post-BTC halving and with the proliferation of ETFs. We’ve responded by enhancing BTC network support and even launched our own meme coin, MOEW, which has seen surprising interest from our users,” he said.Also Read: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bled Another $162 Million On TuesdayAddressing future expectations, Kan predicted that AI and intent-based management would play significant roles in the evolution of wallet technology. “Moving forward, integrating AI to improve the wallet experience isn't just about adding features—it's about fundamentally enhancing how users interact with Web3 technologies,” he stated.Kan also discussed the importance of security, a top concern for many users, especially following several high-profile breaches. “Security isn't just an add-on; it’s integral to the user experience. At Bitget, we’ve introduced keyless MPC wallets and have established strong partnerships for security audits, ensuring our users’ assets are protected without complicating the user experience,” he asserted.Bitget’s approach to integrating with various blockchain mainnets illustrates their strategic focus on interoperability and user engagement. “Our recent BWB Points campaign, for instance, allowed users to engage with over 40 different projects, earning points that could be converted into our upcoming BWB token,” Kan said, underlining the potential for such strategies to foster a more interconnected and user-friendly Web3 environment.As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will further explore these developments. Insights from leaders like Kan will be central to discussions on how the industry can navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the next generation of digital asset technologies.Read Next: Patrick McHenry Questions SEC’s Transparency On Ethereum As A SecurityImage: Shutterstock

Why Vitalik Buterin Prefers Multi-Signature Wallets


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the security advantages of multi-signature wallets over hardware wallets.
Buterin highlighted crucial considerations for crypto holders worldwide to keep their assets secure.
Multi-Signature Wallets Over Hardware Wallets
Buterin stressed the significance of employing multi-signature wallets to safeguard personal funds. He revealed that he utilizes this method for over 90% of his assets. 
With multi-signature wallets, the control over funds is distributed among multiple parties, known as “keys.” Therefore, Buterin advocates for an M-of-N approach. This entails the user holding some keys while the remainder is entrusted to other individuals, forming a decentralized security network. 
Buterin also advised against disclosing the identities of these trusted parties to each other to ensure an added layer of privacy and security.

Addressing the potential pitfalls of hardware wallets, Peter Watts, founder of Reservoir, highlighted the inherent risks posed by human error. Watts cautioned against scenarios where users inadvertently compromise their security, such as misplacing seed phrases or hastily relocating without access to essential wallet components. 

“When using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself,” Watts said.


This reflects the importance of user vigilance and responsible storage practices, as even the most secure hardware wallets are susceptible to user-related vulnerabilities.
Buterin and Watts’ endorsement of multi-signature wallets aligns with the broader industry consensus on enhancing security protocols. Indeed, prioritizing robust security measures is fundamental to risk mitigation and asset protection.

Crypto Security Exploits Drop 141% in Just a Month


April 2024 witnessed a remarkable 141% reduction in financial damages due to crypto-related security exploits, with losses totaling a historic low of $25.7 million. 
This figure represents the smallest amount recorded since 2021, suggesting a significant improvement in Crypto security measures.
Crypto Security Exploits Drop, Indicating Enhanced Its Safety
Crypto security firm CertiK highlighted that the sharp decrease in damages was primarily due to fewer exploits targeting blockchain protocols. The bulk of the April losses, amounting to $21 million, arose from DeFi platform attacks.
The repeated breach of FixedFloat’s Ethereum-based hot wallet resulted in a $2.8 million loss. The same group was responsible for a February attack, which cost the exchange $26 million, perpetrated this incident.

“Combining all the incidents in April, we’ve confirmed ~$ $25.7 m lost to exploits, hacks, and scams. This is the lowest figure we’ve recorded, dating back to 2021, and it is a 141% decrease from March,” CertiK said. 

Additionally, exit scams accounted for $4.3 million in losses. These frauds, where founders absconded with invested funds, included notable incidents like the suspected rug pull by crypto casino ZKasino. This is under investigation for potentially diverting $32 million in Ethereum.

Only three major incidents in April exceeded the $1 million threshold, reflecting a strengthening in protocol security. Among these, the tokenization platform Grandbase suffered a $2 million theft due to a compromised private key, which led to unauthorized token minting and subsequent robbery.
CertiK’s analysis points to an encouraging trend of resilience within the cryptocurrency industry despite ongoing challenges. The reduction in private key compromises and the lower frequency of high-value breaches suggest that enhanced security practices are becoming more effective.

Experts from CertiK and data from DefiLlama indicate that the DeFi sector, which has been the most affected since 2016 with losses totaling $5.8 billion, is now seeing a reversal in this trend.

Crypto losses caused by exploits fall 141% in April: CertiK - Crypto Briefing




Crypto protocols witnessed $25.7 million in losses across three major incidents in April, reaching a record low since 2021. Blockchain security firm CertiK highlights that this is a 141% decrease from March’s figures.The reduction in losses is due to the fall in private key compromise incidents, which plummeted from eleven in March to just three in April, CertiK underscored.The largest exploit in April involved FixedFloat, with suspicious withdrawals totaling approximately $3 million across multiple chains. FixedFloat acknowledged this as their second exploit by the same attackers since February.Meanwhile, exit scams also saw a downturn, with the most notable being CondomSol’s pre-sale scam on the Solana network, leading to losses of around $933,000. In total, April experienced 13 exit scams, a 40% reduction from the previous month.Flash loan attacks in April resulted in the lowest monthly losses since February 2022, with four incidents totaling $129,086. The largest of these accounted for $55,000. Combining all incidents, April’s losses amounted to approximately $25.7 million, the lowest on record since 2021.However, the brief CertiK report on April losses does not account for the ZKasino controversy. ZKasino’s co-founders allegedly performed an exit scam on April 25, by swapping nearly $33 million worth of Ether (ETH) for their native token ZKAS. The funds were locked on the gambling platform bridge, as users tried to be eligible for ZKAS airdrop.CertiK published that a more in-depth analysis will be provided as more information about this episode emerges.

'Bitcoin Senator' Cynthia Lummis Blasts DOJ Stance on Private Crypto Wallets - Decrypt

United States Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has stated that she is "deeply troubled" by the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) stance on non-custodial software.In a tweet, Lummis expressed concern at the DOJ's "hyper-aggressive argument that non-custodial software can constitute a money transmission service." She added that the DOJ's stance "contradicts existing Treasury guidance," and "violates the rule of law.""Arguments against self-custody software threaten the fundamental property rights that are core to being an American," Lummis said, adding that she will fight "for your rights to hold your own keys and run your own node." She further accused the Biden Administration of "criminalizing core tenants of the Bitcoin network and decentralized finance."Lummis' comments follow two recent cases where DOJ prosecutors have pushed for criminal charges against software developers for unlicensed money transmission: an unsealed indictment against Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet, and a reply brief responding to the defense's motion to dismiss in the case against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm.The DOJ's interpretation of money transmission laws, encompassing wallet developers who have no direct control over user assets, has sparked a backlash among the crypto community.Crypto advocacy group Coin Center has characterized the DOJ's stance as "a massive overreach," arguing that it contradicts existing FinCEN guidance and rulings.In a blog post, Coin Center's director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh claimed the DOJ's position would mean that "every functioning cryptocurrency wallet and smart contract is 'doing' money transmission and every developer is engaged in unlicensed money transmission."The group has filed an amicus brief in defense of Roman Storm, arguing that the publication of Tornado Cash's code is constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin price could crash to $50K, predicts $800 billion bank


As the cryptocurrency landscape undergoes a volatile shift, Standard Chartered, a global banking behemoth, has voiced concerns about  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price trajectory, suggesting it might drop to the $50,000 mark.
Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Forex and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, has voiced concerns after Bitcoin’s recent dip below $60,000, indicating a potential drop toward $50,000-$52,000, according to reports.
Adding to the crypto market’s challenges are the significant outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and tepid interest in Hong Kong’s newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, the factors Kendrick cites as primary reasons for the recent downturn.


Key factors include five consecutive days of outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and prices falling below the ETFs’ average purchase price. Furthermore, the average purchase price of these ETFs falling below $58,000 increases the risk of liquidation, especially since more than half of these ETF positions are incurring losses.
Additionally, the bank pointed out that the launch of the Hong Kong spot ETF did not meet expectations, with the focus on the low turnover volume of $11 million overshadowing the satisfactory net asset position of the new ETFs.
The broader economic environment hasn’t been supportive either, with tightening liquidity measures in the U.S. which have been worsening since mid-April, exerting additional pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin.
Long-term optimism despite current volatility
Despite these immediate challenges, Standard Chartered remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The bank recently revised its end-of-2024 Bitcoin price prediction upward from $100,000 to $150,000.
The bank recommends purchasing Bitcoin if it falls to the $50,000-$52,000 range, or if the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the 15th, which measures inflation, is favorable.
While the market currently faces downward pressure, the underlying momentum and institutional interest suggest that Bitcoin might rebound strongly. This belief is anchored in the crypto’s past performance and its foundational role in the digital asset space, pointing towards recovery as market conditions improve and as strategic investments in the ecosystem continue to unfold.

Prospective Stablecoin Bill Unlikely to be Attached to Upcoming FAA Reauthorization: Democratic Aide - Benzinga

A prospective stablecoin bill will likely not be included in upcoming must-pass Federal Aviation Administration legislation as lawmakers try to get the bill across the finish line. House and Senate leadership have indicated the FAA will be "clean" of bills lawmakers have been looking to attach, so it is unlikely that a stablecoin bill will be included, according to a Democratic aide. Lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., ranking Democrat Maxine Waters, D-Calif. and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had reportedly discussed attaching the bill to upcoming FAA reauthorization, which could accompany cannabis legislation. That must-pass reauthorization is up against a May 10 deadline.Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIf you think the recent dips in the price of Bitcoin is bad, leading financial firm Standard Chartered could further darken your mood, concluding that the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap could fall as far as $50,000.In a Wednesday note, Geoffrey Kendrick—digital assets researcher at the British company and lead author of the report—said that “the broader macro backdrop has deteriorated for assets like crypto that thrive on liquidity.”“The driver seems to be a combination of crypto specific and broader macro,” he added, noting that Bitcoin’s break below $60,000 has now reopened a route to the $50,000-$52,000 range.Just last month, Standard Chartered predicted that Bitcoin could hit $150,000 per coin by the end of the year.Bitcoin had been on a wild run following the January approval of 11 Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. At the start of the year, it was trading for a little over $44,000. Capital flooded the market as investors with typically no exposure to cryptocurrencies were suddenly able to buy shares that track the price of the asset via brokerage accounts. Record amounts of money hit the products in the months following their launch, and in March, the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of $73,737.But the hype has cooled, and the Federal Reserve has meanwhile signaled it will keep interest rates higher for longer—scaring investors away from “risk-on” assets like Bitcoin.As a result, the funds have experienced significant outflows. Despite touching a new record in March, the price of Bitcoin today stands at $56,900, after dropping 13% in seven days. Since April, it has traded well below its 2021 record of $69,044.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

UK Government Publishes New Cryptocurrency Report - Here Are The Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


A new report published by the UK government's financial arm has revealed that cryptocurrency companies, along with retail banking, wholesale banking and asset management, are among the top money laundering risks between 2022 and 2023.
The report's conclusions were drawn from risk assessments carried out on 238 firms by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA, a financial regulator in the United Kingdom, has been trying to get crypto firms to register with it and comply with money laundering rules since 2020.



According to the report, the United Kingdom is making intense efforts to suppress cryptocurrency-related crimes. In October 2022, UK police announced that they were deploying crypto tactical advisors across the country to assist in the seizure of digital assets linked to criminal activity. The National Police Chiefs' Council reported that they managed to seize hundreds of millions worth of crypto from crimes.
Data from the newly published report showed that between 2022 and 2023 the FCA had 52 full-time financial crime specialist staff dedicated to anti-money laundering supervision. Of these, 15 were focused on regulating crypto businesses.

Block whistleblower says firm ignored compliance, allowed terror groups


Jack Dorsey’s fintech firm Block is being probed by federal prosecutors after a former employee claimed that “everything in its compliance section was flawed” and that it’s “led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program.”
As reported by NBC, the whistleblower also claimed that Block and its business units Cash App and Square transacted crypto for terrorists, facilitated payments for sanctioned countries, and flouted compliance protocols.
The whistleblower — a former Block employee — reportedly provided 100 pages of documents to prosecutors from the Southern District of New York that show the alleged malpractice. 
The documents allegedly detail how Block processed numerous crypto transactions for terrorist-designated groups. Meanwhile, Square and Cash App allegedly failed to collect relevant information from customers that would help assess risks.
Square also reportedly facilitated thousands of transactions with countries under economic sanctions.

Despite being alerted to these alleged breaches, the whistleblower says the Block failed to change any company processes. They claim that a mix of the transactions discussed with prosecutors, including bitcoin, credit card, and dollar transfers, were not reported to the government under law.  
They told NBC News, “From the ground up, everything in the compliance section was flawed. It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program.”
These allegations of an inadequate compliance program echo claims from a research report published last year by short-sellers Hindenburg Research. This report alleged that “Cash App suppressed internal concerns and ignored user pleas for help as criminal activity and fraud ran rampant on its platform.”
Block execs allegedly knew compliance pitfalls
The former employee’s lawyer, Edward Siedle, who previously represented the Securities and Exchange Commission, said, “It’s my understanding from the documents that compliance lapses were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years.”
A Block spokesperson told NBC News it voluntarily reported ‘thousands’ of the flagged transactions to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The former employee, however, says this isn’t true.

The spokesperson added, “Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment.
“Continually improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block. We have been and remain committed to building upon this work, as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”

Bitcoin optimism fades amid second-longest run of weekly red candles


Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing a significant downturn, marking its second-longest streak of weekly red candles in its history. This development has led to a notable shift in market sentiment, with investors expressing concern over the potential implications for the cryptocurrency‘s future.
Starting on April 1, Bitcoin began a five-week losing streak, opening at $71,300 and dropping to $57,300 by May 1. This situation is particularly noteworthy as it comes in the midst of a supposed bull market directly following the Bitcoin halving event.
Historically, Bitcoin has only experienced similar losing streaks in bear market cycles, making the current situation unique and raising questions about its implications.


Nevertheless, the trading week is not over, and a rally above $71,300 would revert this 5-week losing streak.
A share of bullish optimism
The Bitcoin Archive account on X highlighted the significance of this downturn in a post, comparing it to past events.

“Bitcoin is 23% off its all-time high. So why does it feel worse than it is? This is the second-longest run of RED weekly candles in Bitcoin history! Both times were deep into a bear market.”

BTC/USD weekly price chart & week streaks. Source: TradingView/Bitcoin Archive
Despite the current situation, the Bitcoin Archive offered some perspective. The analyst pointed out that after the last red candle streak, Bitcoin experienced a six-month run of green monthly candles, followed by another five months of gains.

This historical precedent suggests that while the current situation may be alarming, it does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin is entering a prolonged bear market.
Short-term bearish forecast amid a weekly red streak
Adding to the uncertainty, Standard Chartered has predicted that Bitcoin could drop as low as $50,000. This forecast comes amid a broader context of market speculation and various predictions about Bitcoin’s future price movements.
However, it is essential to note that many factors, including market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements, influence Bitcoin’s price.
In this context, potential Bitcoin miners’ capitulation surges as revenue drops to a six-month low of $30 million. Moreover, long-position traders were liquidated for $400 million in losses since April 30.
Given the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether Bitcoin will continue its downward trend or rebound to new highs. Investors and market observers will undoubtedly be watching closely to see how the situation unfolds in the coming weeks and months.
In conclusion, Bitcoin’s recent performance has led to a notable shift in market sentiment, with concerns over a potential bear market emerging. Yet, historical precedents and the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market suggest that it is too early to draw definitive conclusions about Bitcoin’s future trajectory.
As always, investors and market participants should exercise caution and stay informed about the latest developments in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

Who Is Binance's New CEO Richard Teng And Can He Fill CZ's Shoes? - Benzinga

The crypto world was rocked when Changpeng Zhao, the enigmatic founder and CEO of Binance BNB/USD, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was sentenced to four months in prison for his role in failing to establish an effective anti-money laundering (AML) program at the cryptocurrency exchange.While Zhao’s legal troubles were brewing, his successor, Richard Teng, had already quietly assumed the reins as CEO, tasked with steering the exchange through this turbulent period.Who is Teng and what does his leadership mean for the future of Binance?Richard Teng: A Regulator Steps InPrior to taking the helm at Binance, Teng held a crucial role as the Chief Compliance Officer, leveraging his experience as a former regulator at Singapore’s central bank. This background positions him strategically to navigate the increasingly complex regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrency exchanges.Teng’s leadership has been marked by a clear focus on compliance. He has publicly acknowledged the need for significant changes within Binance, stating that the exchange’s previous approach to regulation was “inadequate.” This shift is evident in several key initiatives, including:
Establishing a Global Headquarters: Previously operating with a decentralized structure, Binance is now actively seeking a physical headquarters, a move that signals a willingness to cooperate with regulatory bodies.



Re-entering Regulated Markets: Binance has made efforts to re-enter markets like India and Thailand, demonstrating a commitment to adhering to local regulations.



Increased Transparency: Teng has emphasized the importance of transparency and user protection, initiatives that could potentially rebuild trust with regulators and users alike.
Before joining Binance, Teng was recognized for his innovative regulatory approaches at Abu Dhabi Global Market and had pivotal roles at the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange​​. His expertise is seen as pivotal in navigating Binance through its complex regulatory challenges, especially after the company agreed to a landmark $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over accusations of violating sanctions and money-transmitting laws​.Under Teng’s leadership, Binance is not just focusing on rectifying past issues but is also pushing forward with new initiatives. Also Read: Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Sees Crypto Industry Entering ‘New Phase’The company has ramped up its compliance measures, strategically hiring key talents from regulatory bodies and major financial institutions. This focus on compliance is part of Teng’s broader strategy to foster trust and ensure Binance’s growth in the highly scrutinized cryptocurrency market​​.Moreover, Teng is setting his sights on broadening Binance's operations, with significant expansions in the Middle East and Europe. The United Arab Emirates and France have been chosen as regional headquarters, reflecting Teng’s familiarity with the MENA region and the strategic importance of the European market under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation​.Challenges And Uncertainties RemainDespite these efforts, Binance still faces significant challenges. The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance.US, Zhao, and Teng himself, alleging unregistered exchange operations and commingling of user funds, looms large. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny in various regions continues to cast a shadow over the exchange’s global operations.The Road Ahead: A New Era For Binance?While Zhao’s return after his sentence is expected, the long-term impact of his imprisonment and the changing regulatory landscape remain to be seen. Richard Teng’s leadership presents an opportunity for Binance to embrace a more compliant and transparent approach, potentially paving the way for a new era of stability and growth.However, navigating the intricate web of global regulations and regaining the trust of both regulators and users will be a monumental task. The success of Teng’s leadership will hinge on his ability to effectively address these challenges and steer Binance towards a more sustainable future.Looking Towards The Future Of Digital AssetsEvents like Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 19 will be crucial platforms for industry leaders and experts to dissect the evolving regulatory landscape and its impact on major players like Binance.

Feds Are Investigating Jack Dorsey's Block Over Bitcoin Biz: Report - Decrypt

Amid an apparently growing crackdown on the crypto industry from American regulators, U.S. prosecutors are reportedly investigating Block, the Jack Dorsey-founded company behind Square and Cash App.Federal prosecutors have been probing the internal processes of the company—including its crypto business—according to a report from NBC News published Wednesday, citing two sources familiar with the investigation.Prosecutors are reportedly investigating "alleged widespread and yearslong compliance lapses," per the report, guided by a former employee who provided information regarding such issues.Block allegedly handled crypto transactions from terrorist groups, the report claims, and otherwise handled "thousands of transactions" from economically sanctioned countries such as Iran, Russia, Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela.Furthermore, the report alleges that the company did not address such compliance lapses when alerted, and that "most" of the transactions in question—including those pertaining to Bitcoin transactions—were not reported to the government.Block did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. The company provided the following statement to NBC News:“Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and processes for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on sanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations. Continually improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block. We have been and remain committed to building upon this work, as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Billionaire Whale Deposits Over $147,980,000 in Crypto to Kraken As Bitcoin (BTC) Kicks Off May With More Red - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin has started the month of May with another downward move, so far touching the $56,480 level after an already red April.
The breakdown coincides with several whales – known and unknown – sending massive amounts of coins to crypto exchanges, presumably to sell on the open market.










Initially spotted by blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, one whale was seen depositing 1,225 BTC worth $70.26 million to crypto exchange Kraken early on Wednesday. Several days before, the same whale was spotted depositing a separate 1,225 coins, also to Kraken.
According to Lookonchain, the whale had accumulated over 24,755 BTC worth about $1.68 billion between March 1 and April 15th – before de-risking and sending their coins back to Kraken as prices dropped.
Earlier this week, crypto “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham reported that digital assets manager Grayscale sent nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) to Coinbase, potentially to sell on the open market.
Arkham’s data shows Grayscale sending BTC to Coinbase Prime or addresses associated with Coinbase mostly in batches of $42.84 million.
With Bitcoin’s price correction testing the conviction of bulls, some analysts like Benjamin Cowen have suggested that the asset class may be in for at least a multi-month bear market, similar to 2019.
Other analysts are more confident that the downward move is more of a short-term dip in a more urgent bull run.
Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who share the Negentropic handle on the social media platform X, say that with BTC’s latest correction, “the asymmetric bet is to the upside.”
According to the analysts, BTC could be ready to find a bottom just as Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) make their statement on interest rates.
“Volatility and Fear in Crypto – but is a Bottom close?
BTC and Altcoins saw a strong sell-off yesterday. And more this morning.
Fear has been spreading and calls for new lows are everywhere.
But – are we in fact close to the bottom? A large Pennant may still be the Correctional Structure. And FOMC is tonight…
Extension level is almost reached. Could 56.5K-ish be the turning point into FOMC?”

XRP Beats Bitcoin in Pullback Thanks to New Partnership News - DailyCoin


        
Ripple has just made a major move into the Japanese market through a partnership with HashKey DX.



This expansion has occurred amidst ongoing regulatory challenges in the US.



XRP has experienced an initial surge, but a pullback caused by Bitcoin has raised questions about its future trajectory.
Ripple, a leading blockchain solutions provider, has partnered with HashKey DX, a Tokyo-based blockchain consulting firm. This collaboration marks Ripple’s expansion into the Japanese market, aiming to revolutionize supply chain finance for Japanese enterprises through the use of XRP Ledger technology.Ripple’s XRP Takes Aim at Japanese MarketThe partnership leverages the efficiency and low transaction costs of the XRP Ledger, a blockchain platform known for its rapid settlement speeds. This technology will be utilized to address the complexities of enterprise-level financial operations in Japan, particularly within supply chain finance.This move builds upon HashKey Group’s success in China, where their blockchain solutions have significantly boosted trade and financing operations. Together with SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Ripple, the partnership will introduce innovative solutions specifically designed for the Japanese market.Ripple’s expansion into Japan is crucial, as the company faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the United States. Despite these challenges, the announcement has generated positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Ripple’s native token, XRP, experienced an initial price surge, reflecting optimism surrounding its Japanese expansion efforts.XRP Price Pulls Back After Recent GainsHowever, XRP’s price has since experienced a pullback, trading around $0.493. This volatility is further underscored by XRP’s declining price over recent months, falling approximately 21% year-to-date.Several hurdles lie ahead for XRP, including trading below key exponential moving averages and a scheduled 1 billion token unlock on May 1, valued at roughly $493.4 million. This monthly sell-off could exert further downward pressure on the XRP price in the coming weeks.The market’s Relative Strength Index hovers near the 35 mark, indicating a balanced state between buyers and sellers. However, as it nears oversold territory, the future trajectory of XRP remains uncertain, especially with Bitcoin’s recent drop adding more pressure. Investors are now waiting for a catalyst to trigger the next significant price movement.On the Flipside
If Bitcoin doesn’t recover from its drop below $60,000, it could exert further downward pressure on the XRP price.



The Relative Strength Index sits near 35, suggesting a balanced market with no clear buying or selling pressure.
Why This MattersThis partnership marks a significant step for Ripple’s international expansion, particularly considering the established success of HashKey’s blockchain solutions in China. By focusing on revolutionizing supply chain finance within the Japanese market, Ripple positions itself to potentially disrupt a crucial sector and gain a strong foothold in a historically receptive crypto market.

BREAKING: FED Interest Rate Decision Released - Here is the Decision and Bitcoin's First Reaction - Bitcoin Sistemi


The Fed decided to leave the interest rate steady. The expectation was that interest rates would be kept constant.
Here is Bitcoin's first reaction after the decision:



Now all eyes are on FED President Jerome Powell. Powell is expected to make a speech at 21:30 GMT after the FED's third meeting of the year. You can follow all the details of this speech live on Bitcoinsistemi.com.






At the close of the two-day meeting that started on Tuesday, the FED was expected to keep the short-term interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest level in 23 years. FED officials are not planned to update their March forecasts for the economy, inflation and interest rates. But Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell may offer clues about where he thinks interest rates are headed.
Interest rates have been trending sideways for months. Forecasters predicted that the first interest rate cut would be made in June and that there would be a total of three interest rate cuts by 2024. Now they are predicting only one discount in September.


Economic forecasters will be scrutinizing Jerome Powell's words very carefully when he talks about where interest rates might go.
Economists at Goldman Sachs and Barclays expect Powell to reiterate his earlier comment today that “it will likely take longer than expected to achieve the greater confidence” needed to cut interest rates.





Barclays economist March Giannoni doesn't expect Powell “to be very specific about the number of reductions.”

Binance: After CZ's arrest, these execs prompt global 'manhunt' - AMBCrypto



Nigerian authorities are pursuing Binance executives for currency devaluation.
Contrasting legal outcomes raised questions about fairness in treatment.

Just as Binance’s [BNB] founder made headlines for a 4-month prison sentence on money laundering charges, Nigeria intensified its pursuit of two Binance officers from Africa. 
On February 2024, Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance’s regional head for Africa, and his colleague, Binance’s Chief Financial Crime Compliance Officer Tigran Gambaryan, faced accusations for allegedly facilitating the devaluation of the Naira (Nigeria’s official currency). 
The reason behind Binance head’s escape 
Despite being invited for discussions to resolve tensions, their visit took an unexpected turn. Detained by security agencies, they were pushed into a legal mess, prompting Anjarwalla’s daring escape. 
This incident ignited a global pursuit, escalating concerns about the intersection of cryptocurrency and international law enforcement. 
Remarking on the same, Mr. Gabra Omar, Vice President of the Interpol Africa Executive Committee on Extradition in a recent conversation with Sunrise Daily noted, 
“As soon as this individual escaped, there was a massive manhunt for this individual.”
He added, 
“We have done that to make sure that he doesn’t escape justice…one day he will be brought to justice. It’s just a matter of time.”
The dichotomy of punishments 
However, in an unexpected twist, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao received a four-month prison sentence, contrary to the Department of Justice’s expectation of at least three years. 
In contrast, Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s founder, faced a severe downfall, resulting in a 25-year prison term for fraud. 
This juxtaposition highlighted potential disparities in the legal treatment of prominent figures in the cryptocurrency world. 
Interpol’s VP confident in extradition efforts
Nigeria’s proactive stance against money laundering and terrorism financing in the crypto sphere isn’t a recent development.
 The recent freeze of more than 1,100 accounts by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) underlines this commitment. 
Furthermore, the potential extension of the crypto crackdown to platforms such as Bybit, KuCoin, and OKX underscores Nigeria’s ongoing efforts in this regard. 
Ergo, Omar is confident in the extradition of Binance’s Anjarwalla, claiming, 
“You hide, we smoke you out!”

The Protocol: EigenLayer's 'Intersubjective Forking' Is Objectively Not Done

INTERSUBJECTIFYING THE FORKIFICATION: The Ethereum restaking project EigenLayer, whose plan to repurpose the Ethereum blockchain's security to hordes of additional protocols has prompted systemic risk warnings from Vitalik Buterin himself, released a 43-page whitepaper on its forthcoming EIGEN token – more than twice as long as the original 19-page whitepaper on EigenLayer. To address the concerns, the project, led by the sesquipedalian computer engineer Sreeram Kannan, came up with a new plan for something called "intersubjective forking." The purpose of this mechanism would be to take care of "instances of misbehavior that cannot be objectively identified on-chain, yet any two reasonable observers would agree that a penalty is deserved." If such an "intersubjective fault" were to occur, the EIGEN token could be forked without having to fork the main Ethereum blockchain. Are you with me so far? Well, there's a catch, according to a blog post: Very little of this will be functional when the EIGEN token launches: "With its design being completely novel, the concept needs to be absorbed and discussed widely by the ecosystem participants. The initial implementation of intersubjective staking at this launch mirrors the full protocol to only a limited extent. However, there are still several parameters that need to be determined for full actuation." Such a not-really-fully-functional system would echo EigenLayer's mainnet launch a few weeks ago, where, as detailed by Coindesk, crucial promised features, including the paramount "slashing" and "attributable security" mechanisms, were held back from the launch, because they weren't ready. It goes without saying that a lot of these details were lost on crypto traders who had poured some $15 billion of deposits into the project, many of them merely hoping to qualify for the EIGEN token airdrop that roughly zero people in crypto doubted would eventually come. The parsimoniousness of the terms, however, apparently left many of these so-called airdrop farmers wanting. "Not all feedback was glowing," as the Bankless newsletter put it, and complaints centered partly on the token's initial period of "non-transferability." Only 15% of the tokens will go to the "stakedrop" – the Eigen Foundation's term – and more than half of the tokens will be allocated to investors and early contributors, with unlocks starting after just one year.

Web3 gaming aligns players and companies interests, says Delabs Games CEO - Crypto Briefing




Blockchain gaming is seen as a hot narrative in crypto for 2024 by different industry players, such as Binance and CoinGecko. According to the latter, the total market cap of blockchain gaming tokens is over $18.6 billion.Delabs Games is one of the players building in this sector, focusing on an ecosystem built on the concept of assets that can be used in different games, called Asset Inventory System.Joonmo Kwon, founder and CEO at Delabs Games, shared with Crypto Briefing his thoughts on how blockchain technology could revolutionize the gaming industry, how gamers perceive this two-sector junction, and why current traditional titles are not tapping into Web3.Crypto Briefing – When it comes to the traditional gaming sector, what are some stark differences you can point out compared to blockchain?Joonmo Kwon – One significant difference between Delabs Games and traditional gaming lies in their approach to accessibility and user experience. Delabs Games prioritizes creating fun games for everyone, including Web2 users who may not be familiar with NFTs, wallets, or crypto. Their simple onboarding process allows players to enjoy the benefits of Web3 gaming without needing extensive knowledge of blockchain technology.In contrast, traditional gaming often lacks the concept of ownership and tangible value for players. While players may invest significant time and money into traditional games, they typically do not retain any tangible assets once the game is no longer supported. Web3 gaming, on the other hand, enables players to own digital assets that are valuable and tradable, providing a sense of ownership and lasting value.Moreover, the psychological impact of ownership plays a crucial role in Web3 gaming. By owning in-game assets, players become more invested in the game, leading to increased engagement, loyalty, and community participation. This stands in contrast to traditional gaming, where players may feel less connected to the games they play due to the lack of ownership.Overall, Delabs Games and Web3 gaming represent a shift towards a more sustainable and aligned relationship between game companies and players. By offering more value to players through ownership and participation, Web3 gaming disrupts the traditional gaming industry and creates a model where the interests of both the company and the player are better aligned.Crypto Briefing – For a gamer not familiar with the concept of digital assets, can you explain how the Asset Inventory System (AIS) positively impacts their gaming experience?A pivotal focus of AIS is its capacity to transition players from solitary game participants to platform users by immersing them in diverse gaming experiences. This is made possible by enabling assets acquired in one game to enhance performance in others. Termed ‘Player Liquidity,’ the objective is to facilitate seamless transitions between games, cultivating a vibrant platform environment.The Asset Inventory System (AIS) lies at the core of the Delabs Games Playable Layer, offering a gamified platform crafted to facilitate the flow of player liquidity across multiple games on the platform.AIS motivates users to explore different games through a blend of external rewards and internal satisfaction. Users are driven to gather “assets,” which can be equipped in inventory slots to enrich both their gaming journey and earnings on the platform. This inventive feature adds to the layer’s appeal, encouraging smooth transitions between games and the platform.The Asset Inventory System (AIS) positively impacts the gaming experience in several ways. The first is enhanced Interoperability and partnership opportunities, as AIS facilitates interoperability between the Delabs Games ecosystem and third-party projects. By suggesting new boosts and set bonuses for assets from third-party projects, the Delabs Games Playable Layer seamlessly introduces new content to platform users. This not only enriches the gaming experience but also opens up opportunities for users to fully explore third-party offerings, ultimately increasing conversion and retention rates.The second is equipping assets for boost effects, as players can equip assets to their inventory for boost effects both in-game and on the platform. For example, assets like speed boosts in Rumble Racing Star or staking APY boosts can significantly enhance gameplay or earnings. Each asset can possess rarity, boost, and set bonuses, further diversifying the strategies players can employ to optimize their gaming experience.A third positive impact is collecting assets, since players have various avenues to acquire assets, whether through gameplay, contributions to the platform, or ownership of digital assets within the ecosystem. These earned assets can be equipped in the inventory slots of the Delabs Games Playable Layer, providing players with a range of boost effects that enhance their in-game performance or earnings.This incentivizes player engagement and participation, enriching the overall gaming experience while fostering a sense of ownership and progression within the ecosystem.Crypto Briefing – The gaming industry already has traditional titles that rely heavily upon users’ interactions and could be favored by the AIS concept, such as Path of Exile, Diablo, and Tibia. Why do you think none of the companies behind these titles started experimenting with that?AIS’s core element lies in providing a gamified platform experience. While games like Path of Exile, Diablo, and Tibia focus primarily on in-game experiences, the Delabs Games Playable Layer extends the gaming experience beyond just gameplay, integrating a platform-native gamified experience. This system allows users to collect and combine various assets for benefits both within individual games and across the platform.The Delabs Games Playable Layer promotes platform composability, enabling systematic integration across games on the platform. Additionally, by starting with a curated selection of high-quality games and gradually expanding with mini-games, Delabs Games strikes a balance between game quality and accessibility, catering to various intrinsic motivations of gamers.In contrast, traditional titles may not have experimented with similar concepts because they focus primarily on in-game experiences and may not prioritize the broader platform experience that Delabs Games aims to provide. Delabs Games emphasizes community participation, incentivizing engagement and growth through reward mechanisms and a collaborative mindset rooted in the essence of Web3.Crypto Briefing – Blockchain gaming is commonly overlooked by traditional gamers since it involves monetary aspects and NFTs, which are not so popular in this group. From a builder’s perspective, do you see more penetration from blockchain gaming among traditional gamers?Yes, there’s a noticeable shift in the perception and adoption of blockchain gaming among traditional gamers. The quality of Web3 games is steadily improving, accompanied by a diversification of genres beyond the casual and puzzle games that previously dominated the space. With expansions into genres like FPS, MMO, and RPGs, blockchain gaming is becoming more appealing to traditional gamers who seek diverse and immersive gaming experiences.Moreover, major players in the gaming industry, including Nexon and Ubisoft, have announced their entry into Web3 game development, indicating a growing acceptance and interest in blockchain gaming among established gaming companies. Additionally, industry heavyweights like CCP Games, Ubisoft, Square Enix, Sony, and Konami are cautiously exploring the Web3 gaming landscape, further validating the potential of blockchain technology in gaming.This trend is not limited to established companies; newer entrants like Delabs Games are also venturing into the market, bringing fresh talent and innovation to the forefront. With this influx of talent and investment, blockchain gaming is poised to continue its penetration into the traditional gaming market, offering new games and narratives that appeal to a broader audience.

Why Bitcoin Might Drop Another 20%: 10x Research - Benzinga

Crypto research firm 10x Research on Wednesday underscored its prediction that the ongoing Bitcoin BTC/USD correction may take prices into the low $50,000s.What Happened: In their latest email newsletter, the team around lead analyst Markus Thielen highlight the differing risk management approaches between institutional investors and retail traders. Their research suggests the average entry price for U.S. Bitcoin ETF holders sits around $57,300, potentially even higher, a level Bitcoin prices are rapidly approaching.Despite the predicted correction, 10x Research maintains a positive long-term outlook. Bitcoin’s recent one-year high validates their early 2023 prediction of a new bull market, further reinforced by its proximity to their forecasted halving price of $63,160. Additionally, their 2023 year-end target of $45,000 was nearly achieved, and their post-ETF approval target of $57,000, later revised to $70,000, underscores their continuous analysis and adaptation.Their ability to accurately predict market movements stems from a deep understanding of historical trends and the driving forces within the crypto industry. As 10x Research points out in their previous reports, analyzing these factors has been instrumental in their successful predictions throughout the current bull market.Also Read: Don’t Get Left Behind: Web3 Wallets Offer More Than You Think In Today’s MarketWhy It Matters: Looking back, the August 2023 correction was attributed to rising 10-year Treasury bond yields and a hawkish Fed stance, mirroring the situation during the August 2015 RMB devaluation. While the initial impact was a sharp decline, Bitcoin ultimately recovered significantly by year-end.Similar foresight was applied in January 2024, where 10x Research anticipated a correction to $36,000/$38,000, citing the historical tendency for corrections following major Bitcoin product approvals. They recommended hedging long exposure but turned bullish again as Bitcoin rebounded, reiterating their $70,000 target.March 2024 saw another crucial turning point. Recognizing the potential for a +/-10% move, 10x Research established a line in the sand at $68,300, indicating a potential significant top if breached. This aligns with their current prediction of a correction towards $52,000/$55,000 within the ongoing bull market.Several factors contribute to this anticipated correction. The research highlights a shift in ETF buying behavior, with six consecutive days of outflows observed. What’s Next: As the average entry price of $57,300 is approached, further ETF unwinding is expected, potentially pushing prices down. Additionally, the estimated all-in mining cost of $53,000/$55,000 for Bitcoin miners could trigger selling to protect operations.While a 25% to 29% correction is anticipated, 10x Research acknowledges the possibility of a consolidation period instead of a sharp snapback rally.As industry leaders gather at events like Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 19th, insights from 10x Research and other experts will be invaluable in navigating the complexities of the current bull market and preparing for potential corrections within the broader landscape.Read Next: Ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Sees Crypto Industry Entering ‘New Phase’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has been sentenced to prison.



The significantly reduced sentence CZ received has raised questions across the industry. 



Analysts have described the recent ruling as unjust. 
Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and the U.S. Department of Justice have been embroiled in a legal tussle over the past months following his November conviction of violating anti-money laundering laws and facilitating illicit transactions for sanctioned individuals. As one of the biggest legal cases to rock the crypto industry, CZ’s conviction resulted in significant sanctions, including a hefty $4.3 billion and his resignation from Binance as CEO. Despite the weight of the penalties, Zhao was not let off the hook, and he promised an additional hefty jail time for his conviction. Following several months of anticipation of his sentencing, US Judge Richard Jones finally brought the legal case to a close, albeit with a surprising twist.CZ’s Shocking Sentence Contrasting the promised hefty sentence, Judge Jones handed CZ a mere four-month prison term for his guilty plea to violating US anti-money laundering laws.
Justifying the ruling, Judge Jones asserted that the sentence, which mocks the 3-year term recommended by prosecutors and falls below the maximum one to two years under federal laws, is appropriate for the former CEO, citing the lack of evidence that he was “informed” of the illegal activities at the exchange.Zhao’s conduct and reputation were also focal points in his sentencing. Despite the prosecutor’s argument that he adopted an intentional ‘apology over permission’ approach to circumventing regulations, Judge Jones emphasized that he acted responsibly and displayed a modest nature.“The court finds the defendant has accepted responsibility,” stated the judge, adding that “There needs to be an effort by this court to impose a sentence that’s appropriate and reasonable” 
The perceived attributes, built on Zhao’s apology and over 160 letters from his family seeking leniency, are believed to have influenced Judge Jones’s ruling, resulting in the ousted CEO receiving minimal time for his conviction.CZ’s reduced jail time has spotlighted its stark contrast from another major legal crypto case in the United States.How CZ’s Sentence Differs From SBF’sThe Justice Department’s conviction of Channgpeng Zhao and Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) in November 2023 marked an eventual history, considering both positions as once-hailed titans of the industry.However, while CZ’s sentence was a mere four months in jail, SBF bagged a 25-year term on March 28, 2024, raising a debate over the stark difference.The severity of their charges justifies the variance in their sentencing. Unlike Zhao, whose allegations were solely focused on regulatory violations, SBF was convicted on several counts of financial fraud, including wire and securities fraud and money laundering conspiracy.  Additionally, SBF was declared guilty of misappropriating user funds and triggering losses of over $8 billion for the users and the broader industry, a crime not present in the CZ cases. Binance has repeatedly reiterated the safety of users’ funds, providing the exchange and CEO an edge in its regulatory case.On the Flipside
Changpeng Zhao’s wealth and influence have been spotlighted as another reason for his reduced term.



One of the allegations against Binance was the facilitation of illicit transactions for terrorist organizations, and analysts have decried his light sentence as a miscarriage of justice.



Although the sentence ended his legal battles, the former CEO could still not return to the exchange, as his November ousting was final.
Why This MattersA mere 120-day sentence for Changpeng Zhao constitutes a win for him by letting him off the hook easily, considering the severity of the charges for which he was convicted and the rather stringent approach the DOJ is renowned for. CZ has issued a post-sentence statement; read this article to find out what he shared:CZ Vows to Focus on ‘Next Chapter’ After Sentencing Regulations are still tightening in the United States; read more about the DOJ’s latest target:Samourai Wallet Founder Pleads Innocence to DOJ’s Charges

Changpeng Zhao gets 4 months, Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years - Why?

Two figures once considered to be titans in the crypto industry are going to prison in the United States for drastically different amounts of time.Since the sentencing hearings for former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried and former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, many in and out of the crypto space have questioned why the two industry leaders have received such different treatment in the U.S. legal system. Bankman-Fried could be in his fifties by the time he leaves prison and will likely have fewer assets than Zhao, who will be out of prison by the end of the year and, according to Forbes, has an estimated net worth of $33 billion.But let’s back up a minute. Bankman-Fried was arrested in 2022, extradited to the United States, pleaded not guilty, given house arrest, remanded to jail after allegations of witness intimidation, prosecuted in a six-week trial, found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Zhao was charged in 2023, pleaded guilty, was allowed to remain free on bail, was sentenced to four months in prison and will surrender himself in a matter of days.The former FTX CEO faced seven felony charges related to defrauding investors and misuse of customer funds. CZ faced one charge related to failure to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance.“CZ was charged with a crime that is more akin to a regulatory violation: the failure to have an adequate system of Anti-Money Laundering controls, while SBF was charged with wire fraud in connection with the secret plundering of billions of dollars in crypto custodied with FTX to prop up Alameda,” Mark Bini, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, told Cointelegraph. “While both [crimes] are serious, SBF’s crime was far more serious.”Source: Tiffany FongFrom the beginning of his legal woes, Bankman-Fried and his defense team have largely maintained that he “did what [he] thought was right.” In the sentencing hearing, Judge Lewis Kaplan accused the former FTX CEO of lying on the stand and described his testimony as “evasive.” His first interview after the judge laid down a 25-year judgment included SBF saying: “I never thought that what I was doing was illegal.”The facts of the case presented at trial also undermined SBF’s defense. Many government witnesses, including his former girlfriend and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, suggested that he orchestrated the misuse of FTX user funds.In contrast, Zhao did not publicly comment on the case between U.S. authorities and Binance since a $4.3 billion settlement and his guilty plea in November 2023. He submitted hundreds of pages worth of letters from industry leaders, family members and others. Judge Richard Jones commented on the outpouring of support for CZ at his sentencing hearing, adding he had “risked [his] entire net worth” for Binance.“Even though I believe he was guilty of much more, the DOJ didn’t have the evidence, and that’s why they could only get CZ to admit to rather light crimes,” Swan Bitcoin managing Director Terrence Yang told Cointelegraph. “Unlike SBF, [...] CZ didn’t fight extradition (was in a non-extradition country) and agreed to only light crimes in his plea deal. CZ is only paying $50 million in his plea deal with the DOJ.”Source: Peter HannRelated: Changpeng Zhao’s 4-month sentence a ‘general deterrence,’ says lawyerDespite speculation from many crypto users, it is doubtful that CZ and SBF will share a cell while incarcerated, let alone be housed in the same facility. Though the judge in SBF’s case suggested that he would serve in a San Francisco Bay Area prison, he may also allow the former FTX CEO to stay in New York during his appeal. Zhao will serve four months at the Camp at the Federal Correctional Institution Sheridan in Oregon or the Federal Detention Center SeaTac in Washington, with a reporting date to be determined.Magazine: ‘Less flashy’ Mashinsky set for less jail time than SBF: Inner City Press, X Hall of FlameUpdate (May 1 at 8:45 pm UTC): This article has been updated to clarify where Changpeng Zhao will be serving his sentence.

Bitcoin Could Rebound As ‘Paper Hands’ Investors Flee, Analysts Say - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsBitcoin has pulled back 22% from its all-time high in March. Now, on-chain intelligence company Glassnode suggests the market could be “hammering out a local bottom formation.” In a new report, the firm suggests that the market is currently still in a “euphoria” phase—a period in a bull market where unrealized profits surpass more than half of the market capitalization of Bitcoin. When investors are in this state, the market should expect a correction.With Bitcoin crashing to $57,000 at the time of writing, many investors believe we’re currently experiencing such a correction. But how much further will this drawback go?Glassnode said that a good way to identify whether we've reached the local bottom is when short-term investors realize losses. Its historical data shows numerous examples from 2020 until now that show when one-week to one-month-old entities realize losses, Bitcoin’s price often begins to climb shortly after.Carlos Mercado, data scientist at analytics company Flipside Crypto, told Decrypt, “I'm inclined to believe Glassnode is correctly identifying the ‘paper hands’ phenomenon within a specific cohort.”“Paper hand” investors leave the market at the highest rate when the market is reaching its bottom. As long as the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio—a measure of an asset's market cap versus the value stored in the asset—remains between 1.0 and 0.9, it has a chance to bounce back.Fortunately, the market is within this band, providing hope that it can rebound.“It could be argued that the market is hammering out a local bottom formation,” the report explained. “That said, a sustained break below that MVRV level could create a cascade of panic and force a new equilibrium to be found and established.”Since the publication of this report, the price of BTC has continued to slide from $66,700 down to $57,000. Is this the beginning of the paper-hands sell-off that the report predicts? Or will it go lower?“Judging by the market dynamics on Wednesday, the closest consolidation to the current price level was in the $50,000 to $52,000 area,” senior market analyst at FxPro Alex Kuptsikevich explained to Decrypt.“A more dramatic scenario suggests a pullback to the $40,000 to $44,000 area, which would shake the weak hands out of the market before we get sustained interest from new buyers,” Kuptsikevich added.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin Price Recovers After Fed Announces No Rate Hike At FOMC


																The Federal Reserve decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate of 5.25%% to 5.5% at the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee Meeting (FOMC) on Wednesday, following a fearsome 6% drawdown in Bitcoin’s price earlier that day.
Within five minutes of the announcement, Bitcoin’s price rose from $57,300 to $57,700

Per a press release, the central bank said it also plans to slow down the rate at which it sells US Treasury securities starting in June, reducing its monthly redemption cap from $60 billion to $25 billion.
Market participants overwhelmingly expected the Fed to maintain its interest rate at 5.25% heading into the meeting, expecting cuts to potentially take off in Q4.
However, words from the central bank confirmed market fears that the central bank may have to keep rates higher for longer to quell nationwide price inflation, which remains stubbornly above 3%.
“The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” the Fed wrote.
The economy also remains surprisingly resilient: data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence suggests that 81% of S&P 500 companies that have filed their Q1 earnings have beaten their first-quarter expectations.
Bitcoin’s price is known to be influenced by central bank policy and macroeconomic liquidity conditions.
Some analysts like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believe BTC will continue to surge past $100,000 as central bank balance sheets continue to expand.

“Bitcoin is Money You Can't Afford to Lose,” Saylor Reassures Amid $56K Retest - Coin Edition


							

Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin represents the kind of money that people simply cannot afford to lose.



This comes as crypto traders lose $400M following Bitcoin’s crash to $56K.



Saylor highlights Bitcoin’s long-term outperformance compared to traditional assets.




While crypto investors shoulder substantial losses over the past day amid the market retracement, renowned Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor took to X to reassure enthusiasts that Bitcoin remains the essential asset they cannot afford to overlook. In his words, “Bitcoin is for the money you can’t afford to lose.”







Saylor’s commentary comes amid Bitcoin’s price correction in the past few days, culminating in the asset revisiting the $56K range. At the press time value of $57,568, BTC is trading at one of its lowest points in the two months.



Following the asset’s substantial crash in the last few hours, at least 141K crypto traders who had placed bets on Bitcoin’s upward trajectory have been liquidated, resulting in losses exceeding $400 million. Nonetheless, Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, remains confident that this downturn should be less concerning for Bitcoin investors.









The short video accompanying Saylor’s tweet illustrated Bitcoin’s performance over the past eight years compared to various traditional investments, including the S&P 500, Gold, U.S. real estate, U.S. dollar, Nigerian Naira, Turkish Lira, and Argentine Peso.



It depicted that while Bitcoin maintained an over 100% gain year-on-year since 2016, these other investments struggled to attain comparable returns.



For instance, in 2019, Gold and U.S. real estate saw significant gains of around 20%. However, these gains gradually diminished over the years to single-digit percentages. At the same time, currencies like the Turkish Lira and Argentine Peso experienced crashes, plummeting to as low as 0.001%.



These outcomes have solidified Saylor’s belief that Bitcoin represents the kind of money that people simply cannot afford to lose. Responding to Saylor’s sentiment, X user AfriBull remarked, “Bitcoin has become the ultimate hedge against fiat volatility globally.”

In addition to the rate news, the FOMC announced it is slowing the reduction of Treasuries held on its balance sheet – the so-called quantitative tightening (QT) – from $60 billion per month to just $25 billion per month. Other things being equal, the move is likely to boost risk appetite and asset prices, wrote economist Joseph Brusuelas.

Bitcoin, Ethereum Trade Sideways as Fed Leaves Interest Rates Untouched - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Federal Reserve Wednesday elected to keep its key interest rate steady as the central bank’s focus on fighting inflation compounded pain in the crypto market.In his typically cautious tone, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% was difficult but added that he thought it was “unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.”“I’d say it’s unlikely,” he said, but warned that it was “likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.”He would not reveal to reporters when there would be a rate cut.“The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” Powell added in a prepared statement.As of this writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen 4.6% and 1.3% over the past day to $57,600 and $2,945, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen slightly throughout the trading day.But while the daily shift is broadly downward, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have marked slight increases over the past hour, including ahead of and since the rate announcement. Bitcoin is up 1% over the past hour, while Ethereum has perked up by 2% during the same span.Signs of stubborn inflation have lent traders pause, as fears boiled over last month that the Fed could be forced to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated. Those jitters were elevated recently by a stronger-than-expected rise in inflation and growth in wages in the first quarter.Shifting rate expectations are driving Bitcoin’s price more as spot Bitcoin ETFs see pittering inflows, CoinShares’ Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt Monday. For Ethereum, the pressure comes as a court battle over its regulatory status in the U.S. continues to come to light.Inflation has fallen steadily from multi-decade highs in 2022, but it remains above the Fed’s target of 2% annually. When inflation clocked in at 3.5% in the 12 months through March, a lack of change compared to the previous month’s release caused crypto markets to shudder immediately.The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at a target range of between 5.25% and 5.5% since July of last year, pushing forward for months with the highest rates in more than 23 years.Higher interest rates, which can slow the economy through increased borrowing costs, are generally bad news for risk assets like stocks and crypto. That’s because the payout on cash reserves and U.S. Treasuries becomes relatively more attractive as rates move and stay higher.Though the Fed in March had penciled in three quarter-percentage point cuts for 2024, traders have grown less hopeful. According to the CME’s FedWatch Tool, financial market participants may see only one rate cute—or zero—by year’s end.As rate cut expectations inched further out in April, Bitcoin notched its worst month since November 2022. Coming off all-time highs in March, Bitcoin fell 14% throughout the month to around $60,000.In April, Powell said that inflation hasn’t come down as quickly as policymakers expected, suggesting rate cuts could still be far out. Yet the Fed chair signaled interest rates, where they currently are, could also be sufficient to get the job done too.“The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate that it’s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,” he said. “That said, we think policy is well positioned to handle the risks that we face.”Edited by Andrew Hayward with additional reporting by Mathew Di Salvo.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Fed holds interest rates, markets hardly react - Blockworks


In a highly anticipated move, the Federal Reserve chose to hold interest rates at their existing level on Wednesday following the Federal Open Market Committee two-day policy meeting. 
The rate hike pause marks the central bank’s sixth since consecutively raising interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023. Persistent inflation and a healthy labor market contributed to central bankers’ decision to hold rates, they said. 
“In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,” Wednesday’s statement read. “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.” 
Central bankers will need to see more evidence that inflation is easing before cutting rates, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday during a press conference.
“The path forward is uncertain,” Powell said. 
“Although some measures of short-term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,” he added.
Stocks and cryptocurrencies were little changed on the news. Bitcoin (BTC) traded sideways in the moments after the Fed released its statement at 2 pm ET, sitting around $57,786 at time of publication, per Coinbase. The largest cryptocurrency is down about 4% over the past 24 hours. 
Ether (ETH) similarly traded flat, hovering around $2,900 at time of publication – about 1% lower over 24 hours. 
The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indexes inched marginally higher on the news, managing to move just barely into the green after an otherwise disappointing trading session. 
Bitcoin has hovered below $60,000 since early Wednesday, a downward trend analysts say is poised to continue. 
“A break to the downside through $59,200 in BTC has led to an accelerated selloff and, barring an unforeseen catalyst, there seems little in the way of this market testing the [$53,000] area before a meaningful turnaround,” Mike Tauckus, head of trading and structuring at BitOoda, said. 
Markets on Wednesday expected about a 9% chance a rate cut will come in June, according to data from CME Group.

Aave noted that CCLL would be powered by Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which completed its permissionless rollout last week.“Aave can soon scale to become a fully cross-chain liquidity protocol,” the proposal said. “This will allow borrowers to access instant liquidity across all supported networks.”Aave v4 will also feature automated adjustments to its interest rate curve, dynamic interest rate premiums for riskier assets, smart accounts and vaults allowing users to segregate their borrowing activities, and an updated liquidation engine. Aave said it hopes to begin prototyping its v4 protocol during Q4 and hopes to implement the code in Q2 2025. However, it does not expect the CCLL to roll out until 2026 or 2027.The proposal also outlines plans to launch an Aave Network, which would function as the primary hub for the Aave protocol and the project’s GHO stablecoin.Aave is also considering utilizing a rollup-like Validium architecture for the network, adopting GHO as its network token for fees, and using AAVE as the main staking asset for decentralized validators and sequencers. Aave noted it will monitor the evolution of both Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks before finalizing the network’s architecture, but said Aave Network will inherit its security from Ethereum.The proposal added that “Ethereum would remain the home of the Aave DAO and the Aave governance” and both Aave and GHO would continue to operate as “multichain and network-agnostic despite Aave’s plans to launch a bespoke network. Aave is also targeting 2026 or 2027 for the launch of Aave Chain.Aave seeks to ensure future dominanceAave is the third-largest DeFi protocol with a total value locked (TVL) of $10 billion, according to DeFiLlama.Recent research from Token Terminal indicated that Aave has consistently enjoyed a roughly 50% share of the DeFi lending market over the past three years. Aave’s Marc Zeller replied that roughly 75% of the value in DeFi lending protocols is locked in projects leveraging versions of Aave’s codebase.Aave said its three-year plan seeks to maintain its position as a leading DeFi for the rest of the decade. “These ideas aim to significantly boost the adoption of the Aave ecosystem and scale DeFi to reach the next billion users,” the proposal said.Aave’s three-year roadmap also includes promoting the development of real-world asset products built around GHO, expanding Aave onto networks that do not support Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, and introducing new visual branding licensed to the Aave DAO.Aave is budgeting 15M GHO and 25,000 stkAAVE ($2.1 million) to complete the first year of the roadmap, with the DAO providing 3M GHO upfront and streaming the remaining assets over the course of the first 12 months.The price of AAVE is down 14% over the past week amid the recent digital asset downturn, according to CoinGecko. Aave noted that more than 450,000 wallets currently hold AAVE.[CORRECTS ON 05/1 @ 5:10PM EST TO SAY AAVE IS CONSIDERING VALIDIUM, NOT PROPOSING IT]

Former SEC Lawyer Explains: No Plan to Kill Crypto


Ladan Stewart, a former key figure at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has publicly refuted claims suggesting a governmental agenda against crypto. 
She emphasizes that the regulatory body’s actions never aimed to stifle innovation in the nascent industry. 
Cryptos Will Not Be Eliminated in the US
Stewart, now a partner at White & Case LLP, explained that during her tenure at the SEC, her primary focus was on litigating high-profile cases such as those against Ripple and Coinbase. She pointed out that the agency’s approach has always been technologically neutral.
Therefore, she clarified the widespread speculation about a deliberate crackdown the SEC has imposed on crypto businesses.

“The SEC is not trying to kill crypto. Our main concern has always been about ensuring investor protection and compliance within the industry,” Stewart stated. 

Her comments come at a time when industry leaders have voiced concerns about harsh crypto regulatory measures potentially driving innovation out of the US. 

According to Stewart, the industry’s compliance with regulations designed to protect investors is critical. The SEC’s efforts constantly ensure that investors have all the detailed information. While the SEC will continue to enforce compliance, there is no conspiracy to dismantle the crypto industry. 
Instead, the focus is on fostering a safe and compliant environment for investors. Which, in turn, supports the healthy growth of the sector.

In her view, open dialogue and cooperation between regulators and the crypto community are essential for resolving ongoing tensions. Stewart’s insights underline a significant shift in regulatory strategies, focusing on education and compliance rather than restriction.
As someone who has transitioned from a governmental role to a private legal practice, Stewart aims to bridge the gap between the crypto industry and regulatory frameworks. Her new role involves guiding crypto businesses through the complex landscape of US regulations, striving for a balance that respects innovation and legal compliance.

Here's How AI Can Help Find Money Laundering on Bitcoin - Decrypt

Artificial intelligence can rapidly scan the massive Bitcoin blockchain for signs of illegal activity, a capability that could dramatically strengthen the work of law enforcement in combatting money laundering, a new report explains.Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic on Wednesday published a study with the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab that analyzed Bitcoin transactions using a deep learning AI model to detect money laundering patterns and identify wallets used in crimes.Bitcoin is renowned for using a decentralized public ledger—a core facet of the technology that also made the study possible, Elliptic said. Elliptic and MIT-IBM used AI to separate legal and illicit transactions into groups and follow links among the latter to uncover potential money laundering.“Blockchains provide fertile ground for machine learning techniques, thanks to the availability of both transaction data and information on the types of entities that are transacting, collected by us and others,” Elliptic wrote. “This is in contrast to traditional finance where transaction data is typically siloed, making it challenging to apply these techniques.”The test was not attempted with so-called “privacy coins.”“Counterparty information is available for all transactions [on Bitcoin],” Elliptic co-founder and Chief Scientist Tom Robinson told Decrypt, adding that the technique could be applied to other open blockchains like Solana and Ethereum. “This isn’t the case for privacy coins such as Monero.”“Rather than identifying transactions made by illicit actors, a machine learning model is trained to identify ‘subgraphs,’ chains of transactions that represent Bitcoin being laundered,” Elliptic explained. “This approach allows us to focus on the ‘multi-hop’ laundering process more generally rather than the on-chain behavior of specific illicit actors.”According to Elliptic, the report published today continues work that the company began with MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab in 2019. Elliptic initially worked with an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange to test their theory.“Of 52 ‘money laundering’ subgraphs predicted by the model [that] ended with deposits to this exchange, the exchange confirmed that 14 had been received by users who had already been flagged as being linked to money laundering,” the report said. “On average, less than one in 10,000 of these accounts are flagged as such, suggesting that the model performs very well.”Government regulators, particularly in the United States, have used money laundering laws as one of many cudgels to attack the cryptocurrency industry. On Tuesday, a U.S. federal judge in Seattle sentenced Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao to four months in federal prison for money laundering violations.Last month, the founders of the Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet were arrested on charges of money laundering by the U.S. Department of Justice.In the indictment, FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said “threat actors” use technology like Samourai Wallet to evade law enforcement detection and create environments conducive to criminal activity.“While offering Samourai as a ‘privacy’ service, the defendants knew that it was a haven for criminals to engage in large-scale money laundering and sanctions evasion,” the DOJ said in the indictment. ”Indeed, as the defendants intended and well knew, a substantial portion of the funds that Samourai processed were criminal proceeds passed through Samourai for purposes of concealment.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Crypto Advocacy Group Coin Center Looking To File Amicus Brief To Support Samourai Wallet Co-Founders - The Daily Hodl


								The nonprofit crypto advocacy group Coin Center is mulling whether to file an amicus brief in support of the co-founders of the crypto mixer Samourai Wallet.
Last week, authorities arrested Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill for allegedly operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business that executed more than $2 billion in unlawful transactions.










The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also alleges Samourai laundered more than $100 million worth of criminal proceeds.
Coin Center’s executive director Jerry Brito says the indictment “includes some questionable charges.”
When asked on the social media platform X whether Coin Center planned to file an amicus brief in support of the mixer, Brito notes that they’re considering it.
“Tindictment was unsealed on Friday, so we need a little time to consider everything. Who knows if this even goes to trial, etc. But yes, we filed in the Tornado Cash indictment and may well do so here too.”
An amicus brief is a legal document filed in court by a non-involved party in a case. Written by “friends of the court,” the briefs aim to contain additional information or arguments that can assist the court in making its decision.
Tornado Cash is an Ethereum (ETH)-based coin mixing system that helps users conceal their digital assets. The US sanctioned the controversial project 2022 for national security purposes.
One of its founders, Roman Storm, was arrested last year and slapped with charges related to allegedly laundering $1 billion in criminal proceeds, including hundreds of millions of dollars for the Lazarus Group, the sanctioned North Korean cybercriminal outfit.

BREAKING: FED Chair Jerome Powell Speaks After Interest Rate Decision - LIVE - Bitcoin Sistemi


As expected, the FED left interest rates constant. In the statement published after the decision, it was stated that there have been deficiencies in reaching the 2% inflation target in the recent period.
Now, FED President Jerome Powell's press conference, which started at 21:30 Turkey time (UTC+3), is being followed closely.


As Bitcoinsistemi.com, we are bringing you this conversation live. You can access Jerome Powell's latest remarks by refreshing the page. You can also find the official live broadcast link right below.

Inflation fell significantly last year but remains very high.
Further progress on inflation is not guaranteed; The path is unclear.
We are extremely careful about inflation risks.
The restrictive policy stance put downward pressure on inflation and the economy.
Risks to achieving bilateral goals have become better balanced in the past year.
The labor market remains relatively tight.
Nominal wage growth has decreased over the past year, but labor demand still exceeds supply.
This year's inflation data was higher than expected.
Our policy actions are guided by our goals.
FED officials are 'very aware' of the challenges posed by high inflation.
But long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
We do not think it would be appropriate to cut interest rates until we have greater confidence that inflation will return to 2%.
Gaining greater confidence is likely to take longer than previously expected.
Lowering policy too soon or too much, or too late or too little, both have risks.
Inflation data so far this year have not given us any more confidence.
Politics is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties we face.
We will make our decisions separately for each meeting.
The policy rate is at a restrictive level.
We believe it will be restrictive enough over time.
We believe that over time the policy is restrictive enough to reduce inflation to 2%.
The next policy move is unlikely to be a rate hike.
We are focused on how long to keep the policy restrictive.
To raise rates, we need to see evidence that the policy is not enough to bring inflation back to our target.
We think policy is well placed to consider the different paths the economy can take.
If inflation is more persistent and the labor market remains strong, it may be appropriate to postpone interest rate cuts.
But there are other avenues that point to a rate cut, but these would only come if we gain more confidence and there is an unexpected weakening in the labor market.
There is no obvious link between easing financial conditions and inflation.
I'm not ruling out that we could still have strong growth or that the labor market and inflation could continue to fall.
It is unlikely that the next move will be a rate hike.
To meet the inflation target, we will likely need to see wage growth slow to more sustainable levels.
I don't know how long it will take us to lower interest rates.
Powell: (when asked about 3 interest rate cuts this year) said only that the FED needs more confidence on inflation and does not see progress in Q1.
We need to take a cue from three worse-than-expected inflation data.
Once we gain confidence about inflation, interest rate cuts will be within scope.
The indication we are getting is that it will take longer to get on a sustainable path towards 2% inflation.
My expectation is that inflation will decline again this year.
My confidence that inflation will decline again is lower than before.
Question: Has the possibility of a rate cut decreased this year? Powell: I don't have a probability estimate. We need to be more confident, our confidence did not increase in the first quarter, on the contrary it will last longer than expected.
I don't know if inflation will drop enough to merit interest rate cuts.
I'm not sure whether there will be a rate cut this year or not.
In light of the data we have, I really don't understand where the talk of a stagflation scenario comes from.
I don't see stagflation related to growth or inflation.
3% inflation does not satisfy us.
Restrictive monetary policy needs more time to fulfill its duty.
We have peace of mind that we will do what we think is right, when we think it is right.
We've seen pretty consistent progress in slowing wage growth, but it's been bumpy.
It will take some time, but we will reduce inflation to 2%.


Bitcoin (BTC) price rebounded modestly in the minutes since the news broke, but remains under pressure, falling more than 4% to $58,000 in 24 hours.





Markets entered 2024 expecting a long series of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, but those hopes have faded sharply over the past few weeks as the economy continues to strengthen and inflation rose slightly in the first four months of the year. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets (prior to today's Fed decision) were pricing the probability of a zero rate cut this year at around 25%. A month ago, the probability that the FED would not cut interest rates in 2024 was only 1%.
However, following the decision, many investors predict that the FED will make the only interest rate cut this year in November.

‘Bitcoin Jesus’ is charged in $50 million tax fraud

Photo: Dado Ruvic (Reuters)Early crypto investor Roger Ver, a.k.a. ‘Bitcoin Jesus,’ has been charged with a tax fraud, with the Department of Justice saying he evaded nearly $50 million in taxes. Wegovy and Ozempic: Are we ready for weight loss drugs?In an indictment filed in federal court in Los Angeles, 45-year-old Ver is charged with mail fraud and tax evasion. The DOJ stated that the indictment was unsealed after his arrest in Spain over the weekend, and the U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition.Ver earned the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus” due to his early investments in cryptocurrency and his tendency to preach about it. Born in California, Ver renounced his US citizenship in February 2014 to become a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, a dual-island nation located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.According to the indictment, Ver failed to report the 131,000 Bitcoins he owned in 2014 when he renounced his citizenship. Using this method, Ver is alleged to have avoided taxes, underrepresented his Bitcoin holdings, and evaded taxes. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at around $57,000, which means Ver’s 131,000 Bitcoins are worth about $7.5 billion.Ver’s indictment comes a day after cryptocurrency exchange Binance founder Changpeng Zhao who pleaded guilty last year to money laundering, received a four-month jail sentence. Previously, Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of the FTX crypto exchange, was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Polygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support? - DailyCoin


        
Polygon (MATIC) has dived to near-yearly lows.



MATIC’s price action follows a broader market dip led by Bitcoin.



A critical U.S. macroeconomic data release expected today could be essential to MATIC’s short-term fate.
Polygon (MATIC) sees red.After a parabolic run in Q1 2024, crypto assets, including Polygon’s native token MATIC, are now experiencing a rout. A recent Bitcoin-led market flush has sent MATIC near yearly lows amid this decline.Polygon (MATIC) Dives Below $0.65Over the past 24 hours, MATIC has tanked about 7%, from around $0.6759 to lows of around $0.6322, near 2024 lows of $0.5885.
MATIC’s price rout is part of a broader market dump that has seen Bitcoin’s price drop by about $2,500 in the two hours from about $60,000 to just below $57,500. The jitters come as the market awaits the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision slated for 6:00 pm UTC, Wednesday, May 1. With the Fed expected to keep rates unchanged at 5.5%, investors are reducing their exposure to risk assets like crypto.  Can MATIC Hold the Line?MATIC boasts support within the $0.6467 and $0.6314 price range. At the time of writing, the asset is already showing resilience, bouncing from $0.6322 to trade at $0.6653. Bulls would want this momentum to continue, as a break below the current support could see the asset tank as low as $0.5.MATIC/USDT 4-hour candle chart. Source: TradingViewThe Fed’s rate hike decision is critical to MATIC’s continued run in the short term. While leaving rates unchanged or raising rates could lead to mild or significant price corrections, a shock decision to engage in rate cuts could fuel a parabolic run to the upside. On the Flipside 
MATIC is not the only asset that experienced a price drop in the Bitcoin-led correction. Leading assets like Ethereum, BNB, and Solana are also experiencing price corrections of about 3.2%, 2.8%, and 4%, respectively, per CoinGecko data at the time of writing.
Why This Matters The price action of the past 24 hours puts MATIC in a precautionary position.

How Bitcoin ETFs And Crypto Market's 'PTSD' Caused 'Scammy Memecoin Launches': Alex Krüger - Benzinga

Economist and trader Alex Krüger shared thoughts on the current state of the cryptocurrency market, pointing out what, according to his interpretation, is driving the current price action and why the bull market is not over yet.What Happened: Krüger highlights Bitcoin BTC/USD ETF as the primary force behind the cycle, while Ethereum ETH/USD has been a “major disappointment” despite performing well for stakers and airdrop farmers.He adds that Solana SOL/USD has established itself as the preferred chain for retail traders, demonstrating "perfect product-market fit" and even overtaking Ethereum. However, the network’s congestion and subsequent crashes have opened the door for competitors like Base to position themselves as viable alternatives for retail traders.Noting the marginal new retail interest in crypto, Krüger states that most of the participants are ETF buyers and those from previous cycles redeploying their funds and taking on more risk. Those who missed the Bitcoin ETF run, crypto market participants with “PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder),” went all-in on altcoins. But those disappointed with significant losses, as numerous altcoins erased their 2024 gains in the past month.Also Read: How Did Shiba Inu Become The ‘Dogecoin Killer?’ Crypto Whale Thinks ‘Its Mission’ And This One Factor Were KeyWhy It Matters: While many meme coins have gone to zero, Krüger writes they have dominated the narrative alongside Bitcoin as large-cap meme coins are among the strongest performers of the year. They have also established themselves as "a viable asset class in their own right."He attributed the market's volatility to the increasing presence of scammy meme coin launches and cash-grabbing founders mainly since February. These founders prioritize short-term hype and quick profits over long-term sustainability.Krüger maintains that the current crypto cycle “is not over” and there are still numerous opportunities for investors who navigate the market carefully and stay attuned to the evolving trends and narratives.This analysis comes amid Bitcoin's huge price plunge of 5% in a single day pushing prices below the $58,000 mark.What’s Next: The influence of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Bitcoin Plummets Below $58K, ETH, SOL, DOGE Follow: Over $400M Liquidated In ‘Deepest Retrace In The Cycle’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock

This is Why Jack Dorsey is Under Crypto Investigation


Federal prosecutors are scrutinizing financial transactions linked to Block, a firm founded by Jack Dorsey, focusing on potential violations at its divisions, Cash App and Square. 
According to sources, this investigation stems from documents indicating that Block processed crypto transactions for terrorist organizations and Square handled transactions involving countries under US sanctions.
Jack Dorsey’s Block Under Scrutiny
The Southern District of New York’s inquiry began after an ex-employee provided documents revealing that Square and Cash App failed to collect adequate information for risk assessment. The employee claimed that despite being aware, Block did not report numerous transactions involving sanctioned countries to the government as required.

“From the ground up, everything in the compliance section was awed. It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program,” the former employee said.

These allegations come at a time when Cash App boasts 56 million active accounts and processed transactions worth $248 billion last year alone. The platform is popular for its instant money transfer service and ability to purchase Bitcoin and stocks.

Read more: Cash App Review 2023: Everything You Need To Know 
Despite its success, Cash App’s design might contribute to compliance risks. Balances are typically depleted before any review can occur, limiting sanctions enforcement’s effectiveness. For this reason, the former employee argued that the compliance lapses were well-known within Block’s leadership circles, including Jack Dorsey.


“Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and processes for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on sanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations,” a Block spokesperson stated.

The potential fallout of this investigation could be significant for Jack Dorsey’s Block as it navigates regulatory challenges and seeks to maintain its reputation. This scrutiny coincides with the resignation of two key board members, intensifying the spotlight on Block’s governance and compliance practices.

Roger Ver Faces IRS Wrath: US Govt Sending a Message? - DailyCoin


        
Roger Ver is arrested on allegations of tax evasion.



Some observers believe US authorities’ actions are unjustified. 



The incident has triggered debate on the morality of taxation.
Roger Ver was an early adopter and evangelist of Bitcoin, amassing a vast fortune by believing in the digital currency at a time when most dismissed it as worthless “magical internet money.” Ver acquired St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship in 2014 and renounced his US citizenship shortly after. Although Ver thought he was free of US control, authorities arrested the Bitcoin Cash proponent over the weekend on mail fraud and tax evasion charges, stoking government overreach concerns.DoJ Coming For Roger VerRoger Ver was arrested in Spain over the weekend on charges of mail fraud and tax evasion. The Department of Justice (DoJ) is seeking Ver’s extradition to the US to stand trial over the charges, particularly unpaid taxes totaling $48 million. Ver’s lawyer, Bryan Skarlatos, stated that his client had relied on tax professionals to report his Bitcoin holdings properly and always intended to comply with regulations.
The outstanding tax liabilities stem from Ver’s 2014 renunciation of his US citizenship. Under citizen renunciation, individuals are required to pay an exit tax, with assets held treated as being sold at fair market value and any subsequent gains subject to an “expatriation tax.” The DoJ alleged that Ver and two of his companies, MemoryDealers.com and Agilestar.com, held around 131,000 BTC at that time.In this case, prosecutors claimed Ver provided misleading information to undervalue his companies’ Bitcoin holdings when preparing the expatriation filings. The indictment claimed that in November 2017, Ver took possession of 70,000 BTC from his companies and sold them for around $240 million but failed to pay taxes owed on those distributions.The DoJ stated that although Ver was not a US citizen when cashing out the 70,000 BTC, he was still legally required to report distributions from his companies and pay taxes on the sale of the BTC.  
Given the spate of perceived attacks on the crypto industry by US authorities lately, some have labeled Ver’s arrest as an unjustified overreach on the part of the US government. Crypto Clampdown?Several observers labeled Ver’s arrest a massive overreach by the US government. Simply, Bitcoin host Nico tied this incident to the recent arrest of Samourai Wallet devs, stating that the two events equate to the government “sending a message” to the cryptocurrency community.Kurt Wuckert Jr., the founder of BSV miner Gorilla Pool, dived into a philosophical point on the morality of taxation itself, commenting that “Failure to bribe the government so they don’t put you in a cage is not a crime. Demanding the bribe is evil.” Likewise, podcaster “Walker” stated that “The United States of America holds its citizens prisoner.”Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson took a different view by addressing the charges against Ver. Hoskinson noted that Ver’s two companies were US-based, meaning Ver still had a tax obligation to the US even though he had renounced his US citizenship. Nonetheless, Hoskinson hoped that the allegations against Ver would be proven false.On the Flipside
The MemoryDealers.com URL diverts to a tweet from Ver expressing distrust of the US government. 



Servicing the US national debt is expected to cost $531 billion in 2024, making it the fifth largest government spending program.
Why This MattersSome maintain that taxation is theft, but the reality is that tax is the price to pay for living in a civilized society. However, the timing of Ver’s arrest is somewhat puzzling, given that the allegations occurred nearly seven years ago.US taxpayers cry foul on Biden’s tax plans:Biden’s 44% Crypto Tax Sparks Outcry: Is Backlash Justified?CZ responds to sentencing for money laundering violations:CZ Vows to Focus on ‘Next Chapter’ After Sentencing

Spot Bitcoin ETF Discount Explained -- What Investors Need to Know | Cryptoglobe


                                
Recent market volatility has put a spotlight on spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As reported by Bloomberg, several major US-listed Bitcoin ETFs experienced record-high discounts to their net asset value (NAV) after Bitcoin itself saw a significant price drop. This raises questions about the unique challenges of these investment vehicles in a volatile market.



Bloomberg data shows that funds like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) traded well below their NAV. ETF analyst James Seyffart notes that while these discounts aren’t unprecedented, they do stand out given the historical range of premiums and discounts for these funds.



Experts offer explanations for this phenomenon. Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, attributes the dislocations to factors like end-of-month rebalancing and Bitcoin’s price-calculation mechanisms used by ETFs. These factors can lead to temporary discrepancies between market prices and NAV.



However, Bloomberg underscores that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility poses unique complexities for ETF investors compared to traditional asset classes. This same volatility also creates lucrative opportunities for authorized participants, the specialized traders responsible for maintaining price alignment between ETFs and their NAV.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Virtu Financial Inc. CEO Douglas A. Cifu, as reported by Bloomberg, highlights these volatility-driven opportunities as a reason for continued optimism in crypto ETFs, despite the recent discounts.



The current macroeconomic climate, with the potential for delayed Federal Reserve rate cuts, adds further pressure to the crypto market. As Bloomberg notes, speculative assets like Bitcoin often struggle in such environments.



WallachBeth Capital’s ETF director Mohit Bajaj suggests that the observed discounts could persist depending on Bitcoin’s price trajectory.

Read the Runes: Bitcoin's Market Cap to Transaction Fee Ratio Briefly Falls Below Ethereum's - Benzinga

Runes have been taking over the Bitcoin BTC/USD network. This new token standard that launched with the latest Bitcoin halving has been mentioned before in this newsletter, in the context of pushing the average transaction fee on Bitcoin upwards even before their debut as hype stirred and helping miners combat a lower block subsidy reward as transaction fee revenue reached new highs. And both of those trends largely still hold. The 7-day moving average of the average transaction fee on Bitcoin reached over $40 last week, 10 times as high as the $4.10 average on Ethereum ETH/USD.Read the full story at The Block.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Federal Prosecutors in the U.S. Investigate Another Cryptocurrency Company: This Time Targeting a Surprising Name - Bitcoin Sistemi

Federal prosecutors are currently investigating financial transactions at Block, the cryptocurrency company founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. The investigation focuses on alleged compliance deficiencies at the company's two main units, Square and Cash App.
A former employee provided documents to prosecutors for the Southern District of New York that purported to show that insufficient information was collected from Square and Cash App customers to assess their risk. The documents also allege that Square processed thousands of transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions, and that Block processed numerous cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.


Many of the transactions discussed with prosecutors, including credit card transactions, dollar transfers and Bitcoin, were not properly reported to the government. The former employee alleges that Block failed to correct company processes when alerted to these violations.
The nearly 100-page document provided to NBC News identified transactions, mostly in low-dollar amounts, involving entities in countries subject to U.S. sanctions restrictions, such as Cuba, Iran, Russia and Venezuela, until last year.





“Everything in the compliance department was flawed from top to bottom. It's run by people who shouldn't be responsible for a regulated compliance program,” the former employee told NBC News. This assessment was echoed by a second person with direct knowledge of Block's monitoring programs and practices.

“My understanding from the documents is that the deficiencies in compliance were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years,” said Edward Siedle, a former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who represented the former employee.


In response to the inquiry, a Block spokesperson said:

“Block has a responsible and comprehensive compliance program, and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and the evolving sanctions regulatory landscape. Our compliance program includes systems, tools and processes for sanctions screening, as well as the investigation and reporting of sanctions matters in accordance with our legal obligations.” “Continuously improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block, and we are committed to improving this work as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”

Bitcoin slides, Fed keeps interest rates steady


Bitcoin price dropped to as low as US$56,600 on Wednesday leading to the FOMC meeting, where the central bank left its interest rates unchanged at 5.25% and 5.5%.



“Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective,” the Fed said in a press release on Wednesday.



In March, inflation accelerated in the U.S. with the consumer price index rising from 3.2% in February to 3.5% on an annual basis, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.



Standard Chartered projects a further decline to US$50,000, according to The Block.

	
	
	
	


Bitcoin started dropping from over US$60,000 and has slightly recovered to US$57,708 after the Federal Reserve’s announcement, CoinGecko data shows.



The price drop comes despite positive developments for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry, including the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong on Tuesday.



The Bitcoin network underwent the quadrennial halving on April 20, cutting miner rewards by 50% from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoins.



The halving impacts the scarcity of the asset by slowing down the inflow of new Bitcoins.

	
	
	

	


Standard Chartered’s year-end price prediction for Bitcoin is US$150,000.

Analysts Evaluate Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs' Disappointing Debut - DailyCoin


        
Hong Bitcoin ETFs have recently gone live for sale. 



The investment vehicle’s debut failed to meet market expectations.



Bitcoin ETF analysts have weighed in on the asset’s first-day performance.
The record-breaking success of Bitcoin ETFs upon launch in the United States has sparked a global interest in the asset class. Recently launched in Hong Kong, the promise of even broader adoption has driven excitement for the launched asset, heightening hopes for impressive inflows.However, contrary to expectations, the debut of the exchange-traded funds has not gone off to a good start.Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF: A Flop?The newly launched asset class raked in a total of $141 million on its first day of trade, Tuesday, April 20, raising questions of performance among experts. Led by issuer ChinaAMC with $123 million, the cumulative volume contrasts sharply with the forecasted $300 million before launch, falling significantly behind the U.S. record of $4.6 billion.
Weighing in on the performance, analyst James Seyffart opined that the six Hong Kong spot ETFs did not “live up to expectations,” significantly underperforming below the record standards set by their U.S. counterparts.ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also reiterated a previous warning against the overhype of the newly launched asset. Factoring the market size, Balchunas emphasized that the Hong Kong market is relatively smaller compared to the US and should not be equated similarly.However, both Seyffart and Balchunas added that the performance was significant within the local market context. They stated that ChinaAMC’s performance positions it as the 6th most successful out of 82 ETFs launched in Hong Kong over the past three years and in the top 20% overall in terms of launches.
The underperformance of the Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF launch has rippled through the crypto market with a downward wave.Crypto Market Hit as Bitcoin Retraces to $50K MarkLeading the major market negative shift on April 30, Bitcoin (BTC) suffered a sharp fall below the $60,000 mark for the first time this week, dropping to the $56,000 point.This marked a sharp 12.5% decline in the token’s price, worsening ITS week-long downward trend. Currently trading at $56,980, BTC is down 29.4% from its all-time high of $73,738, squashing the once-heightened optimism for an imminent bull run. Bitcoin was not the only asset hit. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also took major hits, falling 29.7% and 17%, respectively. Similarly, Binance Coin (BNB) and Avalanche (AVAX) experienced losses within the 6% range before rebounding later with modest gains.Read more about how investors are approaching the market decline:Retail Bitcoin Investors Buy the Dip, Whales Step Back Ex-Binance CEO has been sentenced to prison; find out how much time:Here’s Why Changpeng Zhao Got A Lighter Prison Sentence

Crypto Trader Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says BTC Flashed Potential Bull Market Top - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) may have already printed a bull market top.
Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 60,700 followers on the social media platform X that realized profits, or gains converted to cash, have historically coincided with Bitcoin market tops.










The analyst highlights that when Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high of more than $73,000, realized profits soared to a new high and eclipsed levels witnessed during the 2018, 2021 and 2022 bull market tops.
“Last month, when BTC hit $73,880, realized profits skyrocketed to $3.52 billion. This could signal a potential BTC market top!” 
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Martinez says that he needs another signal to confirm his bearish stance.
“Still, I’m waiting for another confirmation before calling a Bitcoin market top.
For instance, a sustained close below the BTC short-term holder realized price, which currently hovers around $59,800, can confirm a potential BTC market top.” 
Source: Ali Martinez/X
But the analyst says his call will be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to reclaim a key price level.
“If Bitcoin can surge above $66,250 and reclaim this area as support, the bearish outlook will be invalidated…
By rising above $66,250, Bitcoin will gain the strength to push towards $69,150. 
And if this resistance barrier is breached, then BTC can advance toward a new all-time high of $92,190.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $60,543, down more than 5% in the past day.

Bitcoin Investors Remain Unmoved Despite BTC Drop Below $60,000, The Worst Is Almost Over


                            On Wednesday, Bitcoin sharply declined, dropping below the crucial $60,000 support level. Despite this recent market downtrend, Bitcoin investors remain confident as they believe the flagship crypto can still reach new heights in this market cycle. Some say this might be what Bitcoin needs before making another parabolic run to the upside. 
Bitcoin’s Decline Is Nothing To Be Scared Of
Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision, reassured in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin’s recent price decline was not unusual, stating it was “pretty ordinary stuff.” He also pointed out that this was Bitcoin’s fourth 20% correction in the past 12 months, underscoring how normal these price movements are.

Source: X
Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, had previously warned that price declines of such magnitude were to be expected, stating that “bull markets are not straight lines up.” He noted that the same thing happened in the 2021 and 2017 bull runs when Bitcoin experienced about 13 price drawdowns of over 10% or more. 
Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital claimed in an X post that “this is exactly what the cycle needs to resynchronize with historical price norms and the traditional Halving Cycle.” He added, “The longer this goes on, the better.” In another X post, he reassured his followers that Bitcoin is getting closer to its final bottom with each passing day. 
Like Rekt Capital, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also sounded confident that Bitcoin’s recent decline was just a part of the bigger picture for its move to the upside. They claimed this would be the “final shakeout before up, only rally to a cycle top.”
Thomas Fahrer, the CEO of Apollo, also shared his bullish sentiment towards Bitcoin, as he suggested that the crypto token’s volatility is what makes it a great investment. “Price might fall to $40K, but it might rise to $400K. That’s just how it is, and it’s a great bet. Bitcoin is still the best asymmetric opportunity in the market,” he wrote on X. 
Bitcoin Bull Run Is Far From Over
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that Bitcoin’s bull run was far from over while comparing Bitcoin’s current price action to the last two halving events. According to him, Bitcoin consolidated for 189 and 87 days around the halving in 2016 and 2020, respectively, before the bull run resumed. 

Source: X
He further noted that Bitcoin has only consolidated for 60 days this time around, meaning that the flagship crypto will continue its run eventually. In a subsequent X post, the analyst stated that Bitcoin might be 538 days away from hitting its next market top if it follows its trend from the previous two bull runs.

Before now, Martinez mentioned that Bitcoin could rise to a new all-time high (ATH) of $92,190 if it breaches the resistance level of $69,150. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $59,600, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Boost For Polkadot As Kusama Sells All 3 Coretime in First Sale: DOT Rejects Bears


								In a momentous event that heralds a new era for Polkadot, Kusama, its test network, sold all three cores in its first Agile Coretime sale, as reported on April 30. This achievement, shared by Parity Technologies, the developer of the interoperable blockchain, is a crucial step in their roadmap towards bringing Agile Coretime to the mainnet.
Kusama Sells All Three Cores: Beggining Of A New Era?
In an update on X, all three cores were sold on April 30, generating 70 KSM, worth approximately $1,980. Each core was sold for 23.4 KSM, or roughly $660. Buyers of each core can now produce blocks on Kusama for the next four weeks. 
Agile Coretime sales on Kusama | Source: Analyst on X
The Agile Coretime concept, a replacement for the parachain auction system, is a welcomed change, especially for participants eager to produce blocks or deploy protocols. In this model, participants can bid for core time, a system that promises more efficiency, as envisioned by Gavin Wood, the developer of Polkadot and Kusama. 

The goal is to accelerate the pace at which new decentralized applications (dapps) can join the network. This will also help amplify enterprise adoption of Polkadot solutions.
The Agile Coretime concept eventually replaces the previous parachain auction system, bringing a host of benefits. For instance, it eliminates the need for upfront, long-term slot commitments, as with Parachains. 
This will, in turn, help foster more flexible resource utilization, particularly for new projects. Most importantly, this model creates opportunities for early-stage ventures and individual developers to participate.
It remains to be seen when this model will go live on Polkadot. However, early success in Kusama sets the pace for the eventual integration in the coming months.  
Polkadot Prepares For Asynchronous Backing, DOT Rejects Bears
Beyond this, Polkadot plans to activate Asynchronous Backing on the mainnet in the coming weeks, an update that enables the network to process more transactions, pushing up the overall throughput. Additionally, it allows for increased block capacity and shorter block times, changes that are a net positive for the network.

With this announcement, DOT prices are stable, cementing its position in the top-20. At press time, the coin changes hands at around $6.5, rejecting bears. Notably, DOT is finding support at April 2024 lows. 

Still, for bulls to take over, prices must ease past $7.5, reversing losses of April 13. This development might anchor bulls who are currently targeting March 2024 highs.

Proposed US bill wouldn’t allow taxing block rewards at acquisition

Two United States lawmakers have introduced a bill to clarify how Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto miners are taxed over block rewards.In an April 30 announcement, Representatives Drew Ferguson and Wiley Nickel said they had introduced the Providing Tax Clarity for Digital Assets Act to the U.S. House of Representatives. The proposed legislation would specify that staking rewards would be considered created property under U.S. tax code, and taxes on block rewards would be collected at acquisition.“The United States has long been the leader in innovation and technology yet is falling behind our foreign counterparts in providing tax clarity for the emerging digital asset industry,” said Representative Ferguson. “The United States’ treatment of digital asset rewards is overly complex – leading to confusion by investors, double taxation, and American businesses relocating overseas.”Source: Representative Wiley NickelCrypto advocacy group Coin Center described the bill as having “sensible policies” by taxing block rewards from proof-of-work and proof-of-stake networks when sold or spent rather than when they were acquired. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, called the legislation “right on point” for providing needed guidance.“[B]lock rewards are more appropriately classified as value creation due to a user’s actions and efforts, rather than income from an employer,” said Coin Center. “This simple policy would resolve major issues with how cryptocurrencies are taxed today and put the technology on a level playing field.”Related: Solo Bitcoin miner wins the 3.125 BTC lottery, solving valid blockThe legislation came roughly 10 days after Bitcoin miner rewards dropped from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block after the blockchain’s fourth halving event. Halvings have historically decreased the new supply of the cryptocurrency and eventually caused the price to surge. At the time of publication, the BTC price was $58,030, having fallen roughly 11% since the halving on April 19.Magazine: Bitcoin Halving will pump games, Shrapnel’s ‘simple’ secret revealed: Web3 Gamer

Cathie Wood Raises Bitcoin Price Target, Says Institutions May Push BTC To This Astronomical Level: Report - The Daily Hodl


								ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is reportedly raising her price target for Bitcoin (BTC) based upon an assumption of greater institutional investment in the top digital asset by market cap.
According to a new report from Benzinga, Wood’s latest prediction is that Bitcoin will soar to $3.8 million by 2030 if institutions decide to allocate slightly more than 5% of their portfolios to BTC.










The new Wood prediction, made at a New York Investor Day in March, increases her previous prediction by $2.3 million.
Says Wood,
“Last year we put out our bull case for Bitcoin. It was $1.5 million. With this institutional green light that the SEC [US Securities and Exchange Commission] has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we’ve done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you.”
Wood is referring to the SEC approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which includes one operated by ARK. The ETFs, which launched in January, have attracted tens of billions of dollars in investment and are seen as the most successful launches of an ETF. The ETFs allow institutions to access Bitcoin.
If Wood’s prediction turns out to be accurate, it would mean that Bitcoin would increase from its current value by more than 6,572% in about six years.
Bitcoin is trading for $56,946 at time of writing, down more than 6% in the last 24 hours.

Delegating Your Restaked ETH on EigenLayer | Bankless


EigenLayer is on everyone's minds this week due to announcements around the much-hyped token launch. But amid all of the EIGEN talk, let's take a look at how to get started putting your restaked ETH to work! In the EigenLayer ecosystem, an Actively Validated Service (AVS) is a project that uses the security of Ethereum via EigenLayer to underpin its native functionalities.  AVSs can be anything from data availability solutions to L2s, like optimistic or zk-rollups, and plenty more in between. “Operators” are the entities responsible for running these services. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and performance of the AVSs by managing the underlying nodes and operations.Notably, AVSs expand the capabilities of Ethereum by providing scalable and efficient solutions for various blockchain applications. Operators ensure these services are reliable and secure, making them integral to the trust and functionality of the AVSs they support.The First AVSs on EigenLayerIn April 2024, EigenLayer started its phased rollout of the first AVSs, beginning with its own EigenDA solution. After that, eight more services have come online atop the restaking protocol. Five of the most active AVSs so far have been:EigenDA — A new data availability network, EigenDA boasts high throughput and low costs, ideal for scaling Ethereum's data handling capacities. Current TVL: 2.71M ETHeoracle — A decentralized oracle network that securely integrates real-world data into Ethereum, powering various decentralized apps. Current TVL: 1.87M ETHWitness Chain — Coordinates decentralized physical infrastructure networks, offering a new layer of economic activities for blockchain projects. Current TVL: 1.82M ETHBrevis coChain AVS — This service uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable smart contracts to access and compute vast historical blockchain data efficiently. Current TVL: 1.30M ETHAltLayer MACH — Focused on providing fast finality for transactions within rollups, enhancing the speed and reliability of Ethereum-based transactions. Current TVL: 1.29M ETHChoosing an AVS and OperatorWhen selecting an AVS and an operator, make sure you first understand the specific services and benefits each offers. For example, EigenYields is one of the operators of EigenDA, and it promises to share airdrops with its delegators. While direct incentives around AVSs are scant for now, look for operators to offer more explicit rewards like this going forward. While EigenLayer vetted its first wave of AVSs, the ecosystem is moving towards a permissionless model where operators will self-register. This means assessing the risk and potential of each operator will become increasingly important over time. Additionally, EigenLayer does not guarantee the fitness of any operators, and bad operators can cause slashing events for their delegators once this functionality is activated later, so performing due diligence before delegating is crucial. It also takes seven days to redelegate to another operator, so make sure you’re confident before diving in. How to Delegate Restaked ETH to AVS OperatorsAccess the EigenLayer AVS Dashboard — Navigate to the AVS dashboard and connect your wallet.Select an AVS — Review the available AVSs and select one that aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.Choose an Operator — Each AVS has a list of operators you can click into. Select an operator based on their performance and any additional incentives they might offer.Delegate Your Stake — Click the "Delegate" button next to your chosen operator. You'll be prompted to confirm the delegation with your wallet. That’s it, that’s all it takes to get started here! Now just sit back while your restaked ETH is put to work. Again, remember that you can redelegate to a different operator as you please, but the process will take seven days. Also, be sure to stay tuned to EigenLayer’s social accounts about new AVSs coming online, as they may offer new opportunities or require adjustments in your delegation strategy!Getting Started with EIGEN on BanklessEigenLayer just announced EIGEN, here’s how to get ready for this highly anticipated stakedrop!

Vitalik Buterin talks ways to make zk proofs more efficient - Blockworks


Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has released a new blog post discussing a new cryptographic proving system that can make zero-knowledge proofs more efficient.
The proving system, called Binius, is designed to operate directly over binary code on computers. Binary code is a language understood by computers, and it is used to store information and represents data using the symbols zero and one, otherwise known as bits. 
Although there are some similarities between STARKs and Binius, Buterin explains that the mathematical tricks that enable these different proving systems are very different. 
Generally speaking, STARKs is a technology that has enabled complicated statements to be easily cryptographically verified. It is designed in a way that can easily compute numbers when they are of small value, when there are large values, STARKs generate extra values, which can lead to inefficiency. 
Unlike STARKs that “arithmetize” a statement into a polynomial equation — a mathematical expression which model a relationship between variables in a block — Binius treats data as a hypercube and grid, and uses multilinear polynomials to perform cryptographic proofs.

Binius converts individual values into bits and places them in a hypercube and a square. This hypercube is then converted into a grid and computations are performed in order to receive an output matrix. 

A verifier will then perform its own computational calculations to ensure that the information itself matches and ensure that the compute columns returns a value claimed by the prover.
“I highly encourage people to understand and explore! Lots of innovations have been happening in ZK-proving recently. And I expect lots more to come soon,” Buterin wrote in an X post.

Changpeng Zhao's Four-Month Sentence Sends A Clear Warning To The Cryptoverse - No More Wild West ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
After months of legal back-and-forth, Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, received a four-month sentence for anti-money laundering violations. Pundits claimed that the sentence was a “clear warning” to the rest of the industry to comply with anti-money laundering rules.



Aaron Lane, a law professor at Melbourne’s RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, disclosed that the case’s conclusion serves as a “general deterrence” to virtual asset service providers in the ecosystem. Lane added that in the future, cryptocurrencies will not be seen as the Wild West by executives and all classes of investors.



“General deterrence appears to be the main rationale behind the term of imprisonment,” said Lane. “The judge has sent a message, not to CZ individually but to the entire industry, that Anti-Money Laundering compliance must be taken seriously.”



Despite the four-month sentence, a cross-section of the industry says the embattled founder received a slap on the wrist for charges bordering on money laundering. Sentencing guidelines after pleading guilty prescribe 18 months, with prosecutors pushing for a hard three-year sentence for Zhao.



The judge justified the four-month sentence as within his discretion, noting that Zhao had accepted a guilty plea, stepped down from his role as Binance CEO, and paid a $50 million fine.

&nbsp



US authorities have previously taken down another industry behemoth in April, securing a 25-year prison sentence for FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried for fraud, a move that sent ripples through the industry.



Apart from Zhao and SBF, several crypto executives have their heads on the chopping block as regulators continue to seek tighter controls for the space. Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon continues to face fraud charges by US authorities after months as a fugitive. At the same time, Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky has a score to settle with prosecutors in the US.



As we advance, service providers in the industry are expected to comply with existing anti-money laundering rules and Know Your Customers (KYC) processes or face enforcement actions from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice.



Accepting the sentence



The embattled founder announced his intention to serve his time in jail, announcing on X that he would maintain a passive stance toward the industry. Zhao noted that he would focus on his blockchain-based education project while assuring Binance users that all funds were safe.



“Our industry has entered a new phase. Compliance is super important,” wrote Zhao. “A silver lining of this whole process is that Binance has been under the microscope. And funds are SAFU.”



However, the SEC continues to hover in the shadows, probing for evidence of misappropriation of customers’ funds by Binance.US, but executives continue to deny any wrongdoing.

U.S. Dollar's Global Dominance: Impact on World Economies | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to a recent article by Joe Rennison and Karl Russell for The New York Times (NYT), the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength against nearly every major currency in the world this year. The Times reports that two-thirds of the roughly 150 currencies tracked by Bloomberg have weakened against the dollar, largely due to expectations about the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.







The article explains that high Fed rates, a response to persistent inflation, have made American assets more attractive to investors worldwide. As a result, money has been flowing into the United States, creating ripple effects felt by policymakers, politicians, and people from Brussels to Beijing, Toronto to Tokyo.







The Times highlights the far-reaching consequences of a strong dollar, including intensified inflation abroad, higher interest bills for countries that have borrowed in dollars, and potential benefits for foreign businesses exporting to the U.S. However, the article also notes that American companies selling abroad may be put at a disadvantage, potentially widening the U.S. trade deficit.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The impact of the dollar’s strength, as reported by The New York Times, depends on the underlying reasons for high U.S. interest rates. If rates remain elevated due to stubborn inflation despite slowing economic growth, policymakers worldwide may face a difficult choice between supporting their domestic economies or bolstering their currencies.



The article emphasizes that Asia has been particularly affected by the strong dollar, with the Japanese yen and Korean won reaching multi-year lows. The Times also points out that China has allowed the yuan to weaken, raising questions about the strength of its economy.



Per the NYT article, European policymakers are considering cutting rates but must be mindful of the potential impact on the euro’s value relative to the dollar. The article also notes that central banks in South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia are grappling with similar challenges.

3 signs hint that Bitcoin price is nearing a bottom

Bitcoin price crashed between April 30 and May 1, with its price decreasing by 11.5% to $56,522. This downturn triggered $172 million in leveraged long position liquidations, which is notably low given that Bitcoin (BTC) futures open interest was at $28.9 billion before the price crash. Consequently, it would be simplistic to assume that bulls were taken by surprise.Uncertainty should drop after the Fed minutes publishSome analysts believe that investors are in a holding pattern until Jerome Powell, chair of the United States Federal Reserve, concludes his speech following the two-day monetary council meeting on May 1. Although it is widely expected that the Fed will maintain interest rates at 5.25%, there is considerable skepticism regarding the U.S. Treasury Department’s ability to finance the government’s budget.On April 30, the yield on the U.S. Treasury two-year note climbed to its highest level in five months, reaching 5.06%, as investors sought higher returns to offset increased risk following the announcement of a $1.07 trillion deficit for the first half of 2024. Since the Fed’s rate hikes throughout 2023, interest expenses on the deficit have risen by 23% in the first half of 2024 and are projected to continue to rise as long as rates remain elevated.Bitcoin is not alone in facing declines: Worsening macroeconomic conditions have made investors more risk-averse. The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks mid- and small-cap U.S.-listed companies, fell by 8.2% over the last 30 days, wiping out gains from the previous two months. Similarly, WTI oil prices have dropped 8.3% since April 5, when they reached a five-month peak of $87.91.A key indication that Bitcoin’s price correction may be reaching a bottom stems from the traditional markets, following a series of robust first-quarter corporate earnings reports from major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, TSMC, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, HSBC and Barclays. A temporary recovery in the stock market shifts investor focus away from Bitcoin and other risk-on assets, although traders may seek alternatives if the Fed decides to maintain higher rates for an extended period.Bitcoin miner capitulation FUD and strong crypto influx in ChinaBitcoin miners are under significant strain after the April 20 halving, which reduced their rewards by 50% to 3.125 BTC per block. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, mentioned that estimates of miners’ outflows to exchanges show no signs of capitulation “for now.” Young Ju added that if the Bitcoin price downtrend “stretches into a weeks-long spell, big miners are at risk of having to liquidate a bunch of Bitcoin.”Thus, another sign that Bitcoin’s downturn may be nearing its end is the steadfastness of miners, which remain reluctant to sell despite a 57% drop in the Hashrate Index, as reported by Luxor Technology. This metric assesses the daily expected return of one terahash of hashing power, factoring in network difficulty, Bitcoin’s price and transaction fees.To understand the broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, examining the demand for stablecoins in China, particularly for USD Coin (USDC), can be enlightening. The premium on USDC transactions over the official U.S. dollar rate offers insight into retail investors’ activities, indicating whether they are moving into or out of cryptocurrency markets.Related: The reasons Bitcoin price is down 11% since the halvingUSC Coin (USDC) peer-to-peer trades vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKXOn May 1, the premium for USDC in China increased to 2.7%, signifying a robust demand for converting the Chinese yuan into USDC. This sustained interest points to a positive sentiment toward cryptocurrencies in China, bolstering an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin, which recently saw a 20% decline in price over three weeks.However, despite potential improvements in market sentiment following the Federal Reserve’s notes and the realization that fears of miner capitulation are, thus far, unfounded, the situation in U.S. markets shows a different trend. Specifically, net outflows from U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds amounted to $635 million in the past five trading days. Such findings suggest that investment flows are crucial in determining Bitcoin’s price movements, with no certainty that the $56,500 support level will hold.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Developer awarded $250 for finding reentrancy vulnerability by Curve Finance | Cryptopolitan

Cryptocurrency and DeFi protocols have faced increasing problems due to vulnerabilities and resultant loss of funds. As the problems have continued, those identifying it have contributed to the benefit of the cause of decentralized finance. In a big discovery, a cybersecurity expert identified a vulnerability in Curve Finance protocol which could be used for withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pool.Cryptocurrency protocols and vulnerability There has been an estimate of losses amounting to $758 million due to vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols in Q3 of 2023. There have been a staggering 116 cases which show that there is an urgent need for enhancement of security. A workforce needs to be deployed for this purpose to identify vulnerabilities and address problems. In a recent discovery, Curve Finance protocol has identified a vulnerability in the DeFi system. The vulnerability is of historical importance as it has resulted in the loss of millions of dollars for years. The vulnerability has resulted in hackers’ access to the protocol’s liquidity pool and drawing out funds. There have been a range of security attacks in 2023 and major areas of focus for hackers included smart contract vulnerabilities, reentry attacks, and Oracle manipulation attacks. The first one is of critical importance because if a hacker is able to identify a vulnerability, they can use it for negative purposes, affecting the funds and security of the protocol.  Claim of a key vulnerability in Curve Finance and other protocols came from a cybersecurity expert Marc Croc. Belonging to Kupia security, Marc Croc said that the vulnerability resulted in the loss of funds from the liquidity pool. The mentioned cybersecurity expert also added that it has led to the loss of millions from various protocols. Reentrancy Vulnerability in Curve FinanceReenetracy vulnerability was verified by the developers’ team from Curve Finance. In a detailed overview, they were able to identify and confirm it. According to official sources, the bug could manipulate the balances of a DeFi protocol. The manipulation of balances could also result in the withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pool.According to Curve Protocol sources, the bug didn’t pose an existential threat but it could create panic if any such incident took place. Furthermore, the company believed that they could recover funds in case such an incident took place. In July Curve Finance was able to recover funds amounting to $62 million which had been stolen after a vulnerability was exposed to hackers. Furthermore, the protocol members agreed to return assets valuing $49.2 million to liquidity providers. It announced the recovery of ETH assets, CRV, and other assets that were recovered by whitehat hackers. Curve protocol has brought forward a proposal the community fund will supply CRV tokens. The attackers identified a vulnerability in the Vyper language where problems were found in versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0.Developer rewarded $250KIt was a critical problem that would have created problems for the development team because of the increased panic amongst the users and investors. To face the problem promptly, a cybersecurity expert identified the problem, not revealing their identity. Once the problem was confirmed, the protocol awarded the whitehat maximum bug bounty of $250K. The whitehat shared the details in the X thread, thanking Curve Finance. Furthermore, the account shared the details of how the vulnerability would affect the protocol. ConclusionIn a recent tweet from a whitehat cybersecurity expert, Marc Croc announced the discovery of a vulnerability in Curve Finance. The development team confirmed and addressed the problem, announcing a bounty amount of $250K for the mentioned whitehat. Though the problem wasn’t an existential threat, it would have created a panic.

&nbsp
Blockchain payments startup Ripple has sent ripples across the crypto market after withdrawing a substantial sum from its escrow accounts.



Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP from escrow, triggering debates over its potential impact on the coin’s price. 



The latest escrow unlock comes amid a market-wide crypto downturn.



500 Million XRP Released From Escrow



According to data from crypto tracking platform Whale Alert on May 1, Ripple released $248,531,377 XRP, worth approximately $248,531,377 earlier today.







This XRP release today is not a whimsical act, but rather part of Ripple’s long-standing strategy aimed at boosting market liquidity and ensuring seamless cross-border transactions. Ripple scheduled the unlocks to occur on the first day of each month for 55 months.

&nbsp



Typically, Ripple releases a billion XRP every month. Speculation abounds, however, as to why the company released half of that amount this month. Could it symbolize an unforeseen event, or is Ripple strategically pacing its unlocks? Nevertheless, based on Ripple’s previous moves, it’s reasonable to expect the release of the second tranche of XRP from the firm’s inventory later this month. Moreover, Ripple always ensures that all unused XRP tokens are returned to the escrow system.



XRP Price Today



The timing of Ripple’s latest customary unlock coincides with a turbulent period in the crypto market. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed to as low as $56,637 in the hours leading up to the Federal Reserve meeting. The BTC price is hovering around $58,249 at press time, having dropped by 3% over the past 24 hours. 



XRP has shown remarkable resilience in its pricing today, despite ongoing legal hurdles. The seventh-largest crypto is trading for $0.5164 at press time with a 3.9% daily gain. Data from CoinGecko shows that XRP has lost 3.4% over the past 7 days, while Bitcoin has shed 9.2% of its value during the same timeframe. If the bulls can fiercely defend the $0.50 support level, more gains could be expected soon. But the bulls will regain full control on a break and close above $0.58.

Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for Bitcoin

Just a few months ago, most economists expected the Federal Reserve to kick start rate cuts by May. All signs pointed to this: the fight against inflation appeared to be coming to an end, jobs data promised a cooling labor market on the horizon, and consumer confidence began to falter. Fast forward to May’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, however, and the hopes of a rate cut in the first half of 2024 are quickly diminishing. Indeed, it appears likely the Fed will hold rates where they are for much longer than anyone could have imagined back in January. Some market commentators even think we're stuck with “higher for longer” until 2025, despite the pressure of an imminent presidential election. Whether rates stay put until September or next January, the May FOMC meeting was certainly a far cry from December 2023, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell first mentioned rate cuts, sending markets into a frenzy. Now, we're seeing a much more hawkish committee, resolute in its restrictive monetary policy stance in the face of stubborn inflation and a labor market that refuses to stumble.Related: The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halvingBut while disappointing for risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, the Fed's stance shouldn't be a surprise for anyone who follows economic data. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge — the PCE index — rose to 2.7% in April from 2.5% in February. The CPI index has remained similarly sticky, rising again from 3.2% in February to 3.5% in March. This has been fuelled by rampant spending, with consumers preferring to take on more debt rather than tighten their belts. In fact, the savings rate in the U.S. has continuously declined from 4.1% in January to just 3.2% in March, while household debt levels keep beating previous records. On top of this, unemployment has failed to edge higher. The jobless rate fell from 3.9% in February to 3.8% in March, hovering around historic lows. Jerome Powell is refusing to say when the Fed might start cutting rates. Source: XSo, even though the economy is beginning to slow — first-quarter GDP growth surprised on the downside, coming in at 1.6% against expectations of 2.4% - we're still a long way from the economic slowdown that would warrant stimulus in the form of rate cuts. Indeed, Powell has always been clear that the Fed's monetary policy decisions will be driven by data, and data alone. And the data simply doesn't support a looser stance, yet. As expected, the markets have been taking this disappointment badly. Bitcoin (BTC) was hovered between $60,000 and $65,000 in the week leading up to the FOMC meeting, and global stock markets were subdued as expectations of a hawkish pivot mounted. Conversely, the dollar strengthened, battering other global currencies like the yen, which fell to the lowest level against the dollar since 1990. Other emerging market currencies can be expected to follow. Jerome Powell said it was "unlikely" the Fed's next move would be a rate hike. Source: XAnd the bad news is that we're likely stuck with this picture for a good few months. This will be a real anticlimax for those who expected the Bitcoin halving to drive a bullish breakout to a new all-time high. After some rampant price action over recent months, no one is ready for another extended period of sideways trading. It’s akin to the lights going on at the nightclub when the party is just getting started.Related: Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchainsAs long as the Fed holds rates steady, though, Bitcoin is likely to trade within a tight range — below $70,000 — barring any major global disasters causing a flight to safety. So far this year, Bitcoin hasn’t really cared about macroeconomics — it shrugged off the last few inflation announcements. But the Fed’s stance will have a more profound effect. The reality is that BTC is now deeply embedded in traditional financial markets thanks to spot ETFs, so it will most likely mimic the behavior of other risk assets until rates begin coming down. So, thanks to Jerome Powell, we’re in for a boring summer that will truly test investors’ patience. That's not to say there won't be another Bitcoin party — it's coming, and it will likely rival or perhaps even surpass what we've already seen this year. Over the longer term, the Bitcoin investment thesis remains intact. Indeed, while Powell's renewed hawkishness is buoying the U.S. dollar for now, it's only a matter of time until the Fed finally pulls the plug, causing renewed dollar weakness. Once the greenback begins its slide, Bitcoin will provide refuge from currency devaluation. Then, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs will truly come into their own, and those who can hold on to their assets and wait out the drought will be rewarded. Until then, perhaps it's not such a bad idea to leave investment portfolios alone and go enjoy the summer.

But support in this area is holding up the price for now.Crypto has been selling off recently as Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows and a weak ETF debut in Hong Kong further deflated the market.Macro headwinds have also been hitting the market, with the Fed just reiterating its reluctance to begin cutting interest rates soon.That’s due to recent data showing that US inflation remains uncomfortably hot, including wage growth data released yesterday.Should macro headwinds worsen later in the week, a distinct possibility with US PMI and jobs data due, Dogecoin could easily soon break $0.12 support.That would open the door to a quick drop back to $0.1050 support.With Dogecoin likely to quickly drop back to $0.1050 support, it’s no wonder investors are checking this exciting new VR ICO.

Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of USDT, the biggest stablecoin in the world, had often found itself in controversy. These largely stemmed from the transparency of its reserves, which often came under question. Since then, Tether has started to take transparency more seriously. Its latest report breaks down the company’s assets, including its significant profits. Where do Tether’s Profits Come From? On Wednesday, May 1, Tether Holdings Limited released its financial report for the first quarter of 2024, showing a record net profit of $4.52 billion. According to the attestation by the accounting firm BDO, the largest share, $1 billion, came from US Treasuries. 
The remainder came from the increase in the value of Bitcoin and gold, which Tether owns in large quantities. At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin’s price was $42,280 and has since shot up significantly. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $57,329. Moreover, gold has significantly increased over the same period, going from $2070 per ounce to $2300. Source: TetherTether’s considerable Bitcoin and gold holdings contributed substantially to its profits. According to the attestation, Tether’s total reserves are $115.41 billion, with the largest portion, $90.87 billion, in U.S. Treasuries. Why Tether Holds So Much BondsTether’s bonds offer a liquid asset that is easily convertible to cash, enabling the company to meet eventual withdrawal demands. However, unlike cash reserves, US Treasury bonds provide a return on investment. This means Tether can profitably from them while exposing itself to relatively little risk.  
In addition to bonds, Tether holds $1.83 billion in cash and cash equivalents. These are highly liquid assets that fulfill immediate redemption requirements. In addition to treasury bonds and cash, Tether also holds $5.37 billion in Bitcoin and $3.65 billion in Gold. Notably, Tether issues a gold-backed stablecoin, which explains its substantial gold holdings. On the Flipside
Despite Tether’s reports, questions about its reserve transparency still persist among the crypto community. 



Tether has recently been expanding beyond stablecoins, including into venture capital, big data, and AI. 
Why This MattersTether’s recent financial outcomes and the management of its reserves have broad implications for the cryptocurrency market, particularly affecting perceptions of USDT’s stability and reliability.Read more about Tether’s controversies: Tether (USDT): A Giant With Feet of Clay?Read more about Solana’s latest performance: Solana Sees Momentum Dwindle as Updates Fail to Fix Congestion

Colbert, Kimmel, and Fallon Take Turns to Poke Fun at Trump's Gag Order | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to a report by Reuters, Judge Juan Merchan has fined former U.S. President Donald Trump $9,000 for contempt of court during his ongoing criminal hush money trial, warning that incarceration could follow if Trump continues to breach the gag order. The fine, issued on Tuesday, was for Trump’s violation of the gag order, which restricts him from making public comments about trial witnesses and participants. Trump was penalized $1,000 for each of nine comments he made online that the judge found in violation of this order.



Justice Merchan, overseeing the trial, expressed concerns that the fine might not sufficiently deter Trump, given his substantial wealth, and noted his own limitations in imposing a higher penalty. The judge emphasized the necessity of upholding the integrity of the court’s orders and indicated a willingness to consider jail as a further measure if Trump persists in his violations.



The cited comments included an article shared by Trump labeling his former lawyer Michael Cohen, a key witness in the trial, as a “serial liar.” Another contentious post cited a claim about “undercover liberal activists” attempting to infiltrate the jury. Merchan dismissed Trump’s defense that he should not be held accountable for content he reposted but did not originally write.



A follow-up hearing is scheduled for Thursday, where additional penalties for other statements may be discussed. Merchan also demanded the removal of the offending posts from Trump’s Truth Social platform and his campaign website.



In a response on Truth Social, Trump decried the actions as an infringement on his free speech and denounced the trial as “rigged.” His attorney, Todd Blanche, argued the posts were legitimate responses to political attacks, yet failed to provide evidence of any provocation by the witnesses involved.



The developments occur amid Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting his charges of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment meant to silence porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter. Trump has denied the encounter and pleaded not guilty.



According to a report by The New York Times (NYT), the $9,000 gag order violation fine prompted late-night comedians to seize the opportunity for some lighthearted jabs at Trump’s expense.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Stephen Colbert, host of “The Late Show,” playfully questioned the significance of the $9,000 fine for a successful businessman like Trump:



“I know $9,000 might not seem like a lot to a successful businessman, but what about to Trump?”



 However, he quickly followed up with a more serious note, mentioning that the judge lamented the legal limit on the fine and warned that if Trump continues to violate the gag order, jail time may become a necessary punishment. Colbert quipped, “I don’t know if it’s necessary for Trump, but I need it.”



On “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the host took a different approach, arguing that the situation seemed unfair to Trump. Kimmel pointed out the irony of the trial being about Trump paying a woman to be quiet, only to now face fines for not being quiet himself. He jokingly compared the situation to Jesus, a carpenter, being nailed to a cross, and urged his audience to “think about it” and “read about it in your Trump-brand Bibles.”



Kimmel also poked fun at the judge’s warning that continued gag order violations could result in Trump being locked up. He imagined Trump’s wife, Melania, encouraging her husband not to let the judge dictate his actions.



The comedians didn’t stop there. Kimmel took a jab at Trump’s spending habits, suggesting that the former president could easily spend $9,000 at a Wendy’s drive-through. Jimmy Fallon, host of “The Tonight Show,” joined in, imagining Trump’s response to the fine: “But I get the 10th one free, right?”

Ankr expands Bitcoin liquid staking tokens to AI blockchain Talus

Decentralized blockchain infrastructure provider Ankr will introduce Bitcoin (BTC) liquid staking tokens to AI-focused blockchain Talus starting May 1. “Bitcoin is not only the oldest blockchain but also continues to have the highest liquidity,” Ankr wrote. “Unfortunately, this liquidity has traditionally been trapped within the Bitcoin L1. With the aid of Ankr’s liquid staking service, Bitcoin can be staked through various Bitcoin restaking protocols. This enables users on the Bitcoin network to earn additional staking rewards while providing other ecosystems access to Bitcoin liquidity.”To engage in Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), users first delegate their BTC to an operator in a restaking protocol, which is then used as collateral for Ankr to create BTC liquid staking tokens (LSTs). In the case of Talus, the Bitcoin LSTs can be used to power the blockchain’s smart agents or AI assistants and their applications, such as “booking travel, making purchases online, and managing portfolios.”Smart agents on Talus are also capable of bundling multilayer atomic swaps and executing them in one single transaction to provide security exploits such as flash loan attacks. “Ankr’s BTC liquid staking unlocks a massive amount of liquidity to ensure that smart agents on Talus can execute simultaneous DeFi transactions like atomic swaps seamlessly,” Talus commented. The move comes after Ankr revealed its first Bitcoin liquid staking product in early March in conjunction with the Babylon protocol. The project allows users to “earn yields from their idle bitcoins in a secure way” by pledging their Bitcoin as collateral to mint LSTs that can be used to validate transactions on proof-of-stake blockchains. Yields earned from the staked LSTs are then funneled back to users’ locked Bitcoin. Currently, the Babylon protocol is in its testnet phase, with a mainnet launch scheduled for later this year. Despite an ongoing market correction, the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem has been thriving over the past year with the invention of new protocols such as Ordinals, Inscriptions, Atomicals and Runes. One such project, omnichain yield-generating protocol SolvBTC, has accumulated a total value locked of $700 million from its yield-bearing Bitcoin minted on Arbitrum, Merlin and BNB Smart Chain. In a statement to Cointelegraph, SolvBTC claimed that the protocol recently surpassed 10,000 BTC staked and attracted “over 92,000 participants” shortly after its launch earlier this month. Related: Bitcoin ecosystem reinvigorated by memecoins, new protocols

Trillions Of SHIB On The Move By Mysterious Whales as Shiba Inu Ecosystem Looks 'Ripe to Explode' ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Shiba Inu (SHIB), known for its dog-themed branding, has recently experienced a remarkable surge in whale activity, indicating significant movements of large SHIB tokens. This surge comes after SHIB’s price decline of over 10% over the last seven days.



Whale activity, often a key indicator of market sentiment and potential price movements, saw a staggering 268% increase in the case of Shiba Inu. Large transaction volume, typically involving transactions worth more than $100,000, surged to $98.12 million within 24 hours.



This surge highlights a significant uptick in whale activity, suggesting that large holders of SHIB tokens are actively buying or selling.



Dramatic Increase in SHIB Large Transactions



According to data from IntoTheBlock, the volume of large transactions in Shiba Inu saw a dramatic increase from 1.07 trillion SHIB on April 28 to 4.17 trillion SHIB on April 29. This substantial spike in large transactions indicates that whales in the SHIB market have been particularly active, possibly taking advantage of the price dip.



SHIB has still been down by 12.05% over the past seven days. This divergence between whale activity and price performance suggests a complex interplay of factors driving SHIB’s market dynamics.

Shiba Inu Ecosystem Key Developments



In other developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, the Shiba Eternity collectible card game (CCG) has undergone significant upgrades. The latest version, 1.2.7, introduces enhancements to improve player interaction and strategic depth.



Notable changes include improvements to the social menu, making players connect easier, and adjustments to fighter mechanics, providing a more balanced gameplay experience. Specifically, these fighters have been tweaked to no longer inflict debuff damage on adjacent friendly fighters upon being destroyed.



ShibaSwap, the project’s decentralized exchange (DEX), is expanding to support Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. This move enhances security and interoperability, offering users a seamless trading experience.







Adding to Shiba Inu’s excitement, the SHIB/JPY trading pair has been listed on Binance Japan. This listing opens up new trading opportunities for SHIB holders, further expanding the coin’s reach and accessibility in the Japanese market.



In conclusion, Shiba Inu’s recent surge in whale activity and ecosystem developments paint a dynamic picture of the coin’s evolving market landscape.

Investors Heave a Sigh of Relief After the Fed Avoids Hiking Rates | Cryptoglobe


                                
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve concluded its latest FOMC meeting by keeping interest rates unchanged, maintaining the target range at 5.25% to 5.5%. This decision was widely anticipated by market participants and came as a relief to investors, who had been closely monitoring the central bank’s stance on monetary policy.



According to a report by CNBC, during the post-meeting press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell provided insights into the Fed’s decision-making process and its outlook for the future. Powell emphasized that the central bank’s rate decisions are not influenced by political factors, particularly the upcoming U.S. presidential election. He stressed the importance of focusing on getting the economics right and stated that considering political factors would reduce the likelihood of achieving that goal.



Powell also addressed concerns about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet reduction process, known as quantitative tightening (QT). He clarified that the decision to slow the pace of reducing the balance sheet is not intended to provide accommodation to the economy or be less restrictive. Instead, the move aims to ensure a smooth process and avoid financial market turmoil, drawing lessons from the previous instance of balance sheet reduction.



When asked about the possibility of the U.S. entering a period of “stagflation,” characterized by slowing economic growth and persistent inflation, Powell downplayed these concerns. He pointed out that, by some measures, economic growth is at 3%, and inflation is below 3%, suggesting that the current economic environment does not fit the definition of stagflation.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Perhaps the most significant takeaway from Powell’s remarks was his indication that it is unlikely the next policy move will be a rate hike. This statement prompted a rally in the stock market, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all initially experiencing sharp gains. Powell’s comments provided reassurance to investors who had been anticipating a potential pause in the Fed’s tightening cycle.



Powell also acknowledged that the Federal Reserve has not yet gained “greater confidence” in the trajectory of inflation this year. He stated that the central bank is prepared to maintain the current target federal funds rate for as long as necessary until there is persuasive evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards the 2% target.



While the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady was largely expected, the central bank’s cautious tone and willingness to remain patient in the face of uncertain economic conditions have provided some comfort to market participants. As investors digest the implications of the Fed’s latest meeting, attention will now turn to upcoming economic data releases, particularly those related to the labor market and inflation, which will help shape expectations for future monetary policy decisions.




VIDEO




At the time of writing (8:48 p.m. UTC on May 1), Bitcoin is trading at $57,313, down 4.6% in the past 24-hour period.







Macroeconomist Alex Krüger had this to say about the crypto market’s reaction to Fed Chair Powell’s comments:

Here's Why Shiba Inu (SHIB), XRP and Cardano (ADA) Just Recorded Major Price Jumps


Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), XRP as well as several other altcoins turned green during a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell dismissed market concerns about "stagflation," a scenario in which slow economic growth is coupled with high inflation. He said that he did not see "the stag or the flation."Earlier, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon amplified stagflation concerns, warning that the US economy might be heading back to the 1970s. In response to Powell's speech, American businessman and investor Jeffrey Gundlach said that he expects only a single rate cut this year. He doesn't see a rate cut coming this June. The Fed chair himself has stated that it would be hard to predict how the rates are going to change, but he has predicted that the next policy move is unlikely to be a cut. cardAccording to Powell, rate cuts could come sooner due to an unexpected weakening in the labor market. However, the decision will still hinge on the incoming inflation data. Powell has stressed that the Fed is now satisfied with inflation staying at 3%. The Fed's goal is to bring inflation back to 2% before it would be able to start cutting rates. Interest rate futures are betting on a single rate cut in 2024. The first rate cut is expected to occur in September. The cryptocurrency market has been hit hard by the Fed's U-turn, with Bitcoin logging its worst monthly candle since August 2023. The Fed was previously predicted to implement at least three rate cuts this year.

Bitcoin swiftly rallied above $59,000 after Fed held rates steady - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin’s price briefly soared to $59,300 following a selloff that dipped it below $56,700 earlier today, according to CoinGecko’s data. The resurgence came after the Federal Reserve (Fed) had decided to maintain interest rates between 525 and 550 basis points.In a statement announcing the hold, Powell said the decision to hold rates steady was due to high inflation. As he noted, the Fed plans to continue reducing public bond sales, yet the remaining bonds continue to be sold at the same pace.“Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace,” stated Powell, “…in recent months inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.”Powell noted the solid pace of economic expansion, strong job gains, and low unemployment, despite inflation remaining above the desired 2 percent target.“Economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” he said. “Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.”According to him, inflation has exceeded expectations in the short term, yet aligns with long-term forecasts. Due to these higher-than-anticipated inflation indicators, the central bank remains hesitant to lower interest rates.The Fed has indicated that it will maintain elevated interest rates for an extended period. However, it also noted that it would consider adjusting its policy should there be an increase in unemployment.Fed Chair: “I don’t see the stag or the flation”In contrast to the previous belief that Powell could have a hawkish stance, he maintained a neutral stance during his speech today.Addressing a series of questions from the media about the state of the world’s economic powerhouse, Powell said there is a low likelihood of raising interest rates further, as current data does not support such a move. According to him, the Fed believes that the current high-interest rates are sufficient to guide inflation back toward the 2% target.Speaking of stagflation risks, he expressed skepticism about the claim that the US has entered a period of stagflation, which is characterized by high inflation coupled with economic decline.According to Powell, the defining conditions of stagflation won’t last or fully develop because inflation will eventually decrease.“I don’t see the ‘stag’ or the ‘-flation’,” Powell said. “I don’t really understand where that’s coming from,” he added.Despite Powell’s neutral stance, Bitcoin’s regained momentum faltered. After briefly surpassing $59,000, it couldn’t hold above this key level. CoinGecko data shows Bitcoin is currently trading at around $57,300, a 3.4% drop in one hour.Similarly, top ten altcoins experienced a modest post-Fed decision rally, with gains between 0.5% and 2.5%. However, this short-lived bounce quickly fizzled out.

Much Anticipated Altcoin Update Disappoints Again: 8 Weeks Postponed - Token Price Crashed in the Last Month - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin layer-2 project Stacks (STX) has announced a significant delay in the activation of the much-anticipated Nakamoto update. The delay was due to the need for an additional eight weeks of development time.
Mitchell Cuevas, who heads the Stacks Open Internet Foundation, detailed the reasons behind the delay in a recent blog post. Cuevas explained that, armed with more knowledge and practical experience with the features of the new network, the core developers determined that they needed a more advanced Signer resiliency/recovery system. This was something originally planned for a later release.



As a result, they anticipate an additional eight weeks of development and testing time before the second hard fork, which will bring Nakamoto features to us in 'Activation'. The new Signer flexibility features are expected to be completed by July 15, with Activation to begin on August 28.
Cuevas acknowledged his disappointment that the dates were changed so late. He wrote: “Fast blocks can't get here fast enough. However, this change is being made to ensure the security and liveness of the network upgrade.”





STX has lost approximately 40 percent of its value in the last month.

BONK surges 50%, flips FLOKI in market cap, but key hurdles remain - AMBCrypto



BONK Inu’s market cap rises to $1.40 billion, surpassing Floki Inu.
Despite overall memecoin market downturn, BONK gains nearly 50% in two weeks. 

As the broader crypto market continues to navigate turbulent waters with an overall downturn, the memecoin sector is not immune to the volatility, experiencing a significant drop of 13.3% in 24 hours. 
This decline has reduced the total market cap of meme coins to approximately $45.2 billion. Amid this general market retreat, a notable exception emerges—Bonk [BONK].
BONK becomes the fifth-largest memecoin
While the majority of meme coins have faced downward pressure, Bonk has charted a different course.
 Over the past two weeks, BONK has surged nearly 50%, contrasting sharply with the modest 3% gain of its peer, Floki Inu [FLOKI], according to recent data from CoinGecko. 
This growth has propelled BONK’s market valuation to $1.40 billion, enabling it to leapfrog over Floki Inu and secure its position as the fifth-largest memecoin in the market. 
As a result, BONK now stands as the 58th largest cryptocurrency globally, surpassing well-known names such as Aave [AAVE] and Algorand [ALGO].
Emerging on the cryptocurrency scene in December 2022, Bonk initially flew under the radar until it caught the market’s attention a year later with a dramatic price increase. 
This surge was fueled by robust investor interest, endorsements from influential figures within the crypto community, and its inclusion on several major cryptocurrency exchange platforms. 
Notably, BONK also ranks as the second-largest memecoin on the Solana [SOL] blockchain, trailing only Dogwifhat [WIF]. 
The latter experienced a significant market cap increase to nearly $5 billion at the end of March as well, before retracting to around $2.2 billion.
BONK: Market outlook
Despite the recent success of Bonk in overtaking its competition, technical analysis of both BONK and Floki Inu revealed potential challenges ahead.

Realistic or not, here’s BONK market cap in BTC’s terms

The daily chart for BONK indicated a bearish pattern, with the memecoin’s price recently triggering a liquidity pull on the buy side, suggesting a possible downturn as it targets the next swing low.

Floki Inu’s 8-hour chart mirrored this sentiment, indicating potential declines for both meme coins in the near future.

Stablecoin Giant Tether Strikes Gold: Achieves Record Net Profit Of $4.5 Billion In Q1


                            Stablecoin issuer Tether, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market behind the widely used USDT stablecoin, has released its audit statement for the first quarter of 2024, accompanied by a report conducted by independent accounting firm BDO. 
The report, which provides additional financial information beyond the reserves backing Tether’s fiat-denominated stablecoins, shows the company’s profit for the first quarter of the year, which saw an increased influx of capital into the market. 
Tether Q1 2024 Financials Soar
Digging into the numbers, the first quarter of 2024 proved highly profitable for Tether, with a net profit of $4.52 billion. 
The main contributors, the entities responsible for issuing stablecoins and managing reserves, reportedly generated approximately $1 billion of this profit from net operating gains, primarily from US Treasury holdings. The remaining profits were attributable to mark-to-market gains on Bitcoin (BTC) and gold positions.

The report also highlighted Tether’s success in increasing its direct and indirect holdings of US Treasuries to over $90 billion. This includes indirect exposure through overnight reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by US Treasuries and investments in US Treasuries through money market funds.

In a sign of significant growth, Tether also disclosed its net equity for the first time, revealing a figure of $11.37 billion as of March 31, 2024. This is an increase from the $7.01 billion equity reported as of December 31, 2023. 
The report also highlighted a $1 billion increase in excess reserves, which support the company’s stablecoin offerings, bringing the total to nearly $6.3 billion.
CEO Emphasizes Transparency And Stability
The BDO confirmation reiterated that Tether-issued tokens are 90% backed by cash and cash equivalents, underscoring the company’s stance on maintaining liquidity within the stablecoin ecosystem. Furthermore, the report revealed that over $12.5 billion worth of USDT was issued in the first quarter alone.
Tether Group’s strategic investments, which exceed $5 billion as of the report date, span various sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI) and data, renewable energy, person-to-person (P2P) communication, and Bitcoin Mining. 

In response to the latest report, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, expressed the company’s commitment to transparency, stability, liquidity, and responsible risk management. 
Ardoino highlighted Tether’s record-breaking profit benchmark of $4.52 billion and the company’s efforts to increase transparency and trust within the cryptocurrency industry. Ardoino further claimed:

In reporting not just the composition of our reserves, but now the Group’s net equity of $11.37 billion, Tether is again raising the bar in the cryptocurrency industry in the realms of transparency and trust.

If the SEC Thinks Ethereum Is a Security, Are ETH ETFs Doomed? - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWill the SEC approve an Ethereum ETF this year?Optimism among market participants is fading—and now that the SEC’s stance on Ethereum as a security has been made public, those hopes may have been shot down for good.“If this SEC approves a spot Ethereum ETF before the election, I will eat my HODL hat,” Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at Van Eck, an Ethereum ETF applicant, told Decrypt. That’s because of a lawsuit filed last week by Ethereum software company Consensys against the SEC, which revealed that the Commission believes Ethereum (ETH) to be an unregistered security—and that the SEC has, for the last year, pursued investigations on that basis. Consensys wants a court to declare Ethereum as a non-security, preempting any forthcoming charges from the SEC. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)To be clear, the SEC has yet to bring charges against Consensys, or anyone else, that formally allege Ethereum is a security. But the revelations in the Ethereum giant’s lawsuit have already had far-reaching implications, with top Washington lawmakers accusing SEC Chair Gary Gensler of lying to Congress last year about the agency’s position on ETH.While the long-term impact of SEC’s investigations into Ethereum plays out, in the more immediate term this means spot Ethereum ETFs likely aren’t happening—at least, not without another legal fight.Spot market Ethereum ETFs would allow Wall Street firms and investors to gain indirect exposure to ETH without having to deal with crypto exchanges or wallets. After a decade of denials from the SEC, spot Bitcoin ETFs finally gained approval for trading in the U.S. market in January—but only after Grayscale, one of the biggest digital asset managers in crypto, successfully sued the SEC to make it happen.Still, after Bitcoin ETFs got the green light, analysts assumed spot ETH ETFs were right behind, with approval likely by summer. Now analysts and ETF issuers on Wall Street aren’t so sure.Ethereum ETF applicants are expected to hear back from the SEC regarding approval by May 23. By last month, analysts were already cooling on the prospect that these initial filings would gain approval; this week’s news has only further convinced experts that ETH ETF applications have a ways to go. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, opined on Twitter this week that the SEC’s now-evident position on ETH’s security status likely means spot ETH ETFs aren’t coming to Wall Street any time soon. And that’s because ETFs based on commodities and securities operate on different rules, he said. It doesn’t appear, though, that the SEC’s apparent hostility towards Ethereum has spooked would-be ETH ETF issuers—at least not yet. A spokesperson for crypto fund manager 21Shares, the first-ever Ethereum ETF applicant in the U.S., told Decrypt that the firm remains committed to seeing its petition approved. Van Eck, a more traditional Wall Street investment firm, remains all-in as well. The company’s digital assets research chief Matthew Sigel believes the product will be approved “in time.” But he emphasized that Van Eck’s experience bringing crypto to Wall Street has never been without conflict. This week’s news constituted just one additional bump in a road the firm always expected to be long and winding.“This has been war since January of 2022, it's been a war for the entire Biden tenure,” he said. “Part of our investment thesis for this asset class is that it will continue to win the bigger battles in the courts over time.”Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Solana-to-Bitcoin cross-chain bridge aims for Q3 2024 launch

Solana-to-Bitcoin cross-chain bridge Zeus Network will launch its Zeus Program Library (ZPL) that connects the two ecosystems by Q3 2024. “These ZPL-Assets unlock a world of opportunities on Solana,” Zues Network wrote on May 1. “Facilitating activities like DeFi, GameFi, SocialFi, DePIN, and more, which were previously challenging on the Bitcoin blockchain.”ZPL is a set of Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) programs that enables developers to integrate native Solana support into decentralized applications and power transactions across multiple blockchains. “ZPL-Assets can be either fungible (cryptocurrencies) or non-fungible (NFTs), representing a wide range of digital assets,” commented Zeus Network, continuing: “With a market cap of approximately 1.2 trillion dollars, and over 11,000 Runes generating over $135 million in fees within the first week on the Bitcoin blockchain, the potential for value transfer is immense.”Through ZPL and bridging protocol Apollo, users deposit their Bitcoin (BTC) and, in return, receive ZPL-wrapped zBTC tokens, which can then be used to engage with decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, borrowing, lending, gaming and SocialFi within the Solana ecosystem. Developers plan to further expand ZPL-supported assets on Solana to Bitcoin Runes and Ordinals, dubbed “zRuneX” and “zOrdX,” respectively. Other tasks in its Q3 roadmap include enabling Bitcoin staking on its Apollo mainnet. Zeus Network is backed by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali. On April 8, the protocol secured a $8 million funding round at a valuation of $100 million. Released in April, Bitcoin Runes is a new token standard that expands the functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain by enabling users to tokenize various real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, commodities or even other cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin, enabling tracking transfer, and minting of unique assets on the namesake blockchain. The Bitcoin decentralized application ecosystem has been experiencing a revival with the invention of such novel protocols. Last month, Orders Exchange completed integration with the Bitcoin Runes protocol to allow the issuance of fungible tokens on the native network and constructed a Bitcoin asset bridge with MicroVisionChain that enables BRC-20 token swaps. Related: BONK, POPCAT and Solana memecoins stay green even as Bitcoin price drops

Ronin's Path From Curated Ethereum Gaming to 'Pervasively Permissionless' - Decrypt

Ronin goes against the grain when it comes to the Web3 philosophy. For many in the crypto space, the beauty of the blockchain is that it’s permissionless and that anyone can build without a centralized authority. Instead, the Ethereum sidechain gaming network instead opts for a closed, curated approach at present.There’s a reason for this kind of early approach, the team says—and it's hard to argue with success, given the vast rise in Ronin players in recent months, plus its surge to an all-time high price in March ahead of the recent markets cooldown.And there's a path to a “pervasively permissionless” Ronin network ahead.“There are too many developers, too many applications, and too many games,” Sky Mavis and Ronin co-founder Jeff “Jihoz” Zirlin told Decrypt. “There are more applications, games, and developers than there are actual real people using these applications.”Many open blockchains have an “overabundance” of games, Zirlin believes, while the relatively small number of gamers that are playing in this space struggle to sift through the good and the bad. To battle this dilemma, Ronin curates the games that are allowed on its network.In his personal time—and aside from crypto games—Zirlin only plays games by Nintendo, Blizzard, and Supercell. They’re giants of the industry known for releasing few games, and often really beloved and massively popular games at that.Sky Mavis co-founder Jeff Zirlin. Image: Jeff ZirlinBy curating Ronin’s game library, he believes that the network is aligning itself with these game publishers. In fact, he suggests that the Web3 element “adds another layer on top” by incentivizing gamers to support the network through its token.“This strategy emphasizes quality over quantity, allowing us to work closely with fewer teams and ensure their long-term success in the evolving landscape of Web3 gaming,” Zirlin explained. “[A Twitter poll] showed us that 40% of all [Axie] gamers were onboarded by a friend or family member. So these are insane levels of evangelism.”In turn, Ronin accounts for 30% of all active Web3 gamers, the largest share by some margin with Polygon in second at 17%, according to Footprint Analytics. Despite the model working for Ronin, most of Web3 opts against such an approach.“In order to win, you need to do non-consensus things. That’s where most of the strategic leverage is,” Zirlin explained. “People want chaos, I guess, in Web3. But for the adoption of a new technology, you need to be more zen. You don't want to confuse people, because the technology is already confusing enough.”Thus far, a curated approach appears to have served Ronin well. The doors will only be closed for so long, however, as Zirlin admits that open models do have advantages in the long run—and Ronin is indeed eyeing up a more open future.Looking down the path, one major hurdle in Ronin’s way is scalability. Currently, Ronin claims, the network can handle 7.5 million daily transactions without congestion. This may not be enough once the network is opened to all builders, so Sky Mavis is actively exploring scaling solutions to increase what Ronin can handle. But scaling isn’t just a technical leap, said Zirlin—it’s also a cultural challenge.“Ultimately, the key factor in scalability is not just technical superiority, but also user adoption and loyalty,” Zirlin explained. “Similar to the console wars of the past, where players chose platforms based on where their friends were, our focus is on curating games that draw players to Ronin.”Once Ronin turns “pervasively permissionless,” Zirlin said, he expects the number of games deploying on Ronin to accelerate. He hopes one of these games will help drive growth for the network, as current game Pixels is doing at present and Axie Infinity did back during the play-to-earn boom in 2021—but this time without such a heavy-handed approach from Ronin.When Ronin plans open up the network is still undecided. Once this path ends and Ronin opens its doors, the network will begin to eye up its next big transformation—expanding beyond gaming.“The endgame is to create an ecosystem that seamlessly blends gaming with ecommerce and payment apps,” Zirlin told Decrypt.  "We believe the path to getting there is by bootstrapping adoption and attention through gaming, and then expanding into payments and ecommerce, thereby disrupting the predatory banking system and credit card industry.”Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Starbucks’ Shocking Q2 Miss: CEO Spills the Beans on What’s Brewing for 2024 | Cryptoglobe


                                
Earlier today, in an interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: SBUX) CEO Laxman Narasimhan provided a candid look at the company’s disappointing fiscal Q2 2024 results. Yesterday, Starbucks issued a detailed press release shedding light on the complexities and strategic adjustments the company is navigating through these challenging times.



Starbucks reported a 2% decline in consolidated net revenues, amounting to $8.6 billion, which the company attributes to a complex operating environment. Both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share were recorded at $0.68, marking a significant decrease from the previous year, with GAAP earnings per share down by 14% and Non-GAAP earnings per share down by 8%.



Key performance highlights from the fiscal second quarter include:



Global Comparable Store Sales: There was a 4% decline overall, driven by a sharp 6% decrease in transactions but partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket prices.North American Performance: Comparable store sales in North America fell by 3%, with transactions down 7%, though mitigated slightly by a 4% rise in average ticket prices.International Markets: International comparable store sales saw a 6% decrease, with an 11% decline in China due to significant drops in both ticket prices and transaction volumes.



The company also continued its expansion, opening 364 net new stores globally, bringing the total count to 38,951 stores, split between company-operated and licensed outlets.



The operating margin showed a contraction, with GAAP operating margins decreasing by 240 basis points to 12.8%. This was primarily due to increased investments in store partner wages, benefits, and promotional activities. Despite these challenges, Starbucks is committed to its long-term strategy and is actively implementing the “Triple Shot Reinvention with Two Pumps” strategy, aimed at revitalizing the brand and ensuring future growth.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The Starbucks Rewards loyalty program reported an increase in 90-day active members in the U.S. to 32.8 million, up by 6% from the previous year. This highlights a resilient aspect of Starbucks’ customer engagement strategy despite broader market challenges.



The Starbucks CEO remarked on the quarter’s performance, “In a highly challenged environment, this quarter’s results do not reflect the power of our brand, our capabilities, or the opportunities ahead.” He emphasized the comprehensive roadmap and action plans the company has laid out to navigate through the current complexities.



CFO Rachel Ruggeri also commented on the financial discipline and strategic focus, highlighting the company’s continued commitment to capital allocation and operational efficiencies as they steer through dynamic market conditions.



The Starbucks share price closed at $74.44, down 15.88% on the day.

Chinese Police Reveals Airdrop Scam! Which Project's Airdrops Were Targeted? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Chinese police have captured a suspect involved in a major cryptocurrency fraud case. The individual is accused of creating multiple fake identities to illegally claim STRK airdrops.
Chinese Police Capture Suspect in Major Cryptocurrency Scam Case
It is alleged that the suspect, whose identity is kept secret due to ongoing investigations, exploited the STRK airdrop system by assuming the identities of other participants.


The suspect is believed to have submitted more than 40 ECMP forms, thus demanding an estimated 40,000 STRK coins belonging to the victims of this fraud scheme.
The suspect reportedly sought out relevant work submitted by others in the STRK community, assumed the identities of those individuals, and used that information to submit ECMP forms.





This sophisticated method of identity theft has raised concerns about security measures put in place to protect participants in cryptocurrency airdrops.

Chinese police took swift action after receiving reports of fraudulent activities. Their quick action enabled the suspect to be caught and the stolen STRK coins to be recovered.


The case is currently under further investigation as authorities work to ensure the stolen coins are returned to their rightful owners.
This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions. It underlines the need for robust security measures and careful monitoring to prevent such fraudulent activities.





Chinese police have assured the public that they are committed to protecting the integrity of the cryptocurrency market and will continue to crack down on such fraudulent activities.
They also urged the public to be careful and report any suspicious activity related to cryptocurrency transactions.

Economic Wobbles Hit Bitcoin Hard | Bankless


Macro Mania. Crypto assets are getting volatile as macro is once again dominating the narrative. Is the bottom in, or is the downside just getting started?Bitcoin fell below the key $60k level that had supported price for the past two months this morning, making its way all the way down to $56.6k prior to the Federal Open Market Commission’s (FOMC’s) interest rate decision announcement.Despite acknowledging that BTC may have further downside to come in the near future, some traders have gotten bullish on the possibility that much of the selling has subsided, believing that alts front-ran the dump and that their relative strength today will mark a bottom against BTC.Near term price projections are always murky, but crypto bulls remain confident on the future trajectory of asset valuations, with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood raising her price target to $2.3M BTC and noting that the coin could trade as high as $3.8M should it receive increased institutional interest.
BTC has emerged as the best performing asset of the past decade; nonetheless, it has not existed during a true recessionary period. With signs that the global economy is rolling over, the crypto industry may soon undergo its most significant test to date…Private sector employment numbers released last week indicates that the US economy lost 192k jobs during the third quarter of 2023. This figure represents a substantial 686k discrepancy compared to the monthly U.S. non-farm payroll data, spawning concern about the reliability of the data that market participants have used to reinforce their beliefs in a strong labor market.The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that job openings in March fell to their lowest since February 2021, with the construction sector posting the largest job opening drop on record!Simultaneously, the ratio of job openings per unemployed person, along with quit rates, has dropped to near pre-COVID levels as the number of hires plunged to the lowest level since January 2018, suggesting that while there is demand to find and retain jobs, employers have little demand for labor. Similar data patterns have preceded a fall off in employment.
In commodities markets, oil prices dropped nearly 3% this morning after inventory levels exceeded analysts' expectations, signaling potential uncertainty in future economic growth and the commensurate demand for this key commodity input.Moreover, troubling US manufacturing data compounds on economic concerns, revealing an increase in input costs alongside a decrease in new orders, a lethal combination of data that indicates stagflation and complicates the business outlook for producers.While the FOMC decided to hold its rate target at 5.5%, the Committee included a bullish surprise for markets that allowed risk assets to bounce off the initial announcement, decreasing the amount of Treasury securities it will roll off the balance sheet per month from $60B to $25B beginning in June, providing a supportive bid for yields given the increased need to repurchase expiring securities.The Federal Reserve maintains that it will hold rates at high levels until there are clear signs of progress towards their long term 2% inflation target, yet the economy is beginning to demonstrate weakness.Once the cuts commence should deteriorating demand continue to weigh on prices, it is unclear if they will be able to incite a rally out of recession, considering their arrival has historically coincided with worsening economic conditions.

Top 10 Altcoins Developers Focused on in April Revealed - Etheruem Not in First Place - Bitcoin Sistemi


April has come to an end and Bitcoin price closed the month in the red zone after a long period of time. Today, the cryptocurrency market has lost blood in general and daily losses have reached double digits in most altcoins.
Despite this, cryptocurrency developers continue to develop altcoins, most of which are open source. Here are the altcoins that developers focused on the most during April and the ranking of their developer scores:



Optimism (OP) – 541
Hedera (HBAR) – 459
Cardano (ADA) – 432
Chainlink (LINK) – 397
Polkadot (DOT) – 390
Ethereum (ETH) – 323
Cosmos (ATOM) – 301
Internet Computer (ICP) – 295
MultiversX (EGLD) – 247
Aptos (APT) – 228


It is noteworthy that there are altcoins with much lower market values than ETH, ahead of the world's largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH). Optimism, which ranks first, stands out as a layer-2 blockchain that aims to help scale Ethereum.
This data was obtained through cryptocurrency data provider Santiment and was created based on the Github profiles of altcoin projects. However, it is important to remember that developer activity will not have a direct impact on the price of a cryptocurrency.

EigenLayer Withdrawals Accelerate After Airdrop Backlash - The Defiant

Nearly 14,000 wallets have triggered withdrawals from the Ethereum restaking protocol since April 29.DeFi traders are leaving EigenLayer in droves since the much-hyped Ethereum restaking protocol released its airdrop allocations two days ago.Since April 29, almost 14,000 wallets have initiated withdrawals from the protocol, accounting for roughly 13% of its user base.EigenLayer WithdrawalsEigenLayer is DeFi’s third-largest protocol, with $14.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. It enables users to re-stake their Ether or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to earn additional yield by securing third-party applications called Actively Validated Services (AVS).Despite the large number of wallets, the pending withdrawals amount to less than 12,000 ETH ($35 million), according to a Dune dashboard. That’s barely 0.25% of EigenLayer’s TVL and indicates that smaller depositors are leaving the protocol.Daily LST WithdrawalsThe project is facing severe backlash from the DeFi community after it geo-blocked many countries, including the United States, and aggressively blocked VPN users from its EIGEN airdrop despite accepting deposits from these ‘prohibited jurisdictions’ during its growth phase.Airdrop recipients are also unhappy that the EIGEN token will not be transferable at launch, meaning that holders will be unable to trade their tokens. Many community members also criticized the linear distribution of EIGEN, which favours larger depositors.

Analyzing Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Future: Bullish or Bearish?


Shiba Inu (SHIB) stands at a critical point. As traders watch closely, SHIB faces potential turning points that could propel it to new highs or see it plummet to new lows. 
With key technical levels coming into play and market sentiment swinging, the meme coin’s immediate future is fraught with promising opportunities and significant risks.
The Dual Outlook on Shiba Inu (SHIB)
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently teetering on a precarious edge. A crucial technical level supports the meme coin hovering around $0.000021, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). 
This indicator is vital for SHIB’s short-term trajectory, serving as a psychological comfort for traders. Indeed, A breach below this level could send the price tumbling to the next significant support at the 200-day EMA, potentially dropping below $0.000010.
Shiba Inu Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
Conversely, SHIB has some potential bullish signals on the horizon. A bull flag formation on SHIB’s daily chart suggests that SHIB could be setting up for a significant upward move. 

Despite recent declines and broader market uncertainties impacting altcoins, there is anticipation of a bullish breakout targeting a rise to $0.000051. Resistance levels are currently seen at $0.000023 and $0.000025. 
Overcoming these barriers could propel SHIB into a bullish zone, reigniting investor interest and possibly signaling a broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market.

However, a sustained dip below $0.000021 could trigger extensive selling, eroding recent gains and dampening market sentiment.
As the crypto market navigates through turbulent waters, Shiba Inu stands at a crossroads. Its ability to maintain above pivotal support levels or break through resistance will likely dictate its path.

New Competitors Eating Away At Tether’s USDT Stablecoin Dominance: Kaiko Analytics - The Daily Hodl


								Market intelligence platform Kaiko Analytics reports that new competitors are chipping away at Tether’s (USDT) stablecoin dominance.
In a new report titled “Tether Loses Market Share,” Kaiko Analytics says that the stablecoin issuer’s market share over centralized exchange platforms (CEXs) has dipped 13% year-to-date (YTD) due to the growth of rival dollar-pegged digital assets, such as FDUSD and USDC.










“Despite its dominant market position, USDT’s market share on CEXs has been trending downwards, declining from 82% to 69% YTD. This decrease can be partly attributed to growing competition from stablecoins like FDUSD which benefit from Binance’s zero-fee promotions.
 USDC has also experienced a rise in its market share, signaling a growing preference for regulated alternatives. At present, stablecoins issued in the US make up 10% of the overall stablecoin trade volume.
 Only one of the top five stablecoins by market cap, Circle’s USDC, is regulated under state US money transmitter frameworks. Nevertheless, its share has increased from less than 1% in 2020 to 11% today.” According to Kaiko, other rivals such as Ethena (USDe), which uniquely offers yield, could also be cutting into Tether’s market dominance.
“Another reason for Tether’s declining market share could be linked to the emergence of innovative yield-bearing alternatives such as Ethena’s USDe. Since its launch in February, USDe’s volume has grown significantly, although it has retreated from April’s all-time high of more than $800 million following Ethena’s ENA airdrop.”
According to Tether’s 2024 Attestation Report, the firm posted a record-breaking $4.52 billion in profits during the first quarter of the year.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? Analysts Forecast Bounce Back


                            As May 1st started, Bitcoin (BTC) faced a new correction that made the price stumble under the $60,000 support level. The flagship cryptocurrency has seen several retraces during this bull cycle, with BTC swiftly recovering the crucial support zones each time.
However, in the past 24 hours, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to regain its momentum. Some analysts believe Bitcoin’s bottom this cycle might be in as this correction officially became its deepest retrace.

Is The Bitcoin Bottom Here?
In the early hours of Tuesday, Bitcoin started to plunge from the $64,000 price range. As the day continued, BTC prolonged its fall to briefly trading around $59,958 – $59,191 before recovering.
This time, the recovery didn’t last long as Bitcoin’s price resumed its downward trajectory to $57,000. In an X thread, crypto trader Milkybull examined some data suggesting the bottom might finally be in.
According to the analyst, BTC is “following the 2017 PA.” This would suggest that “either the bottom is in or close.” Moreover, he urged investors to remember that while good news “usually signals the top,” bad news signals a bull market’s bottom.
In the thread, the trader pointed out that the Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band indicator historically serves strong support during BTC’s bull cycles. As a result, he considers that the flagship cryptocurrency might “wick through the support and bounce back.”

According to the analyst, Bitcoin and global liquidity are also strongly correlated, with BTC currently at a level it has previously bounced back from. These bouncebacks initiated “huge rallies across the crypto market” in October 2022 and October 2023.
Lastly, the thread highlighted that Bitcoin “is at a critical decision point for the local bottom.” The trader considers that while some call for a $48,000 bottom, the $51,000 support level might be where BTC bounces back to resume its cycle to this cycle’s top.
Bitcoin’s Deepest Retrace This Cycle
According to crypto analyst and trader Rekt Capital, this correction has officially been the deepest BTC retrace this cycle. Per the post, today’s -23.64% retrace surpasses the -22.91% retrace seen in February 2023.
The analyst also compared this cycle’s “Post-Halving” pullback to 2016’s. Moreover, the trader considers that this bullish cycle might be more similar to the 2016 one than investors think.


Previously, Rekt Capital listed three reasons these two cycles might be similar. Per the trader, the resemblances include the “Pre-Halving Re-Accumulation Range Breakout,” the “Pre-Halving Retrace Beginning,” and the “Similar Initial Reaction after the beginning of the Pre-Halving Retrace.”
After today’s retrace, the analyst added the “Continued downside in the three weeks after the Halving” as a fourth similarity between the 2016 and 2024 cycles. Like eight years ago, Bitcoin faces an “additional downside below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range” in the three-week window after Bitcoin’s “Halving.”
Moreover, the analyst suggests that the current price development comes “as no surprise,” as it mirrors 2016’s “post-Halving Danger Zone.”
As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading at $57,794.89. This correction represents a 6.2% drop in the past 24 hours. Similarly, BTC is registering 13.4% and 17.7% price decreases in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

Is Binance founder CZ's sentence the boost BNB needed all along? - AMBCrypto



BNB tumbled over 6% in the 24-hour period owing to broader market bloodbath.
The positive commentary around the coin increased dramatically in the last 24–48 hours.

Binance Coin [BNB] suffered substantial losses in the last 24 hours, as the broader market downturn took its toll on the native token of the Binance ecosystem.
The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap tumbled over 6% in the 24-hour period, data from CoinMarketCap showed.
However, on a monthly time frame, the coin performed comparatively better against other leading coins, nursing losses of just 6%.
That being said, BNB could be in for healthy gains in the short to medium term, as a major chapter, which fueled considerable FUD for the coin in the recent past, reached a conclusion.
A short-term bullish catalyst?
Binance’s ex-boss, Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as CZ, was sentenced to four months in prison, for the charges brought against him by the U.S. government.
The charges were severe, including violation of anti-money-laundering rules that allowed illicit transactions on the exchange.
The news of the announcement set the social circles buzzing. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, the mention of BNB on top crypto-focused social channels surged dramatically.
Interestingly, positive commentary around the coin exceeded bearish takes, as weighted sentiment entered the positive territory. This suggested a more favorable view of BNB’s next moves by the market.

Futures traders not hopeful of quick rebound
BNB’s sentiment in the derivatives market continued to be bearish.
The number of traders shorting the crypto increased considerably in the last 24 hours, AMBCrypto spotted using Coinglass’ Long/Shorts Ratio indicator.

Read Binance Coin’s [BNB]Price Prediction 2024-25

The Open Interest (OI), or the money invested in active futures contracts of BNB, dropped 1.27% in the last 24 hours to $564 million.
While this might be due to the broader market downturn, BNB could see investments trickling in once the sentiment improves.

Legendary Investor Cathie Wood Increases Her $1.5 Million Bitcoin Price Prediction - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood is known for her bold predictions regarding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Despite the skepticism surrounding these predictions, they continue to attract the attention of investors and analysts alike.
At an investor day in New York, Wood made a surprising prediction. According to Wood, Bitcoin price could rise to a staggering $3.8 million by 2030.


In his own words, Wood expressed his prediction as follows:

“Last year, we put forward our bullish scenario for Bitcoin. This figure was $1.5 million. With the institutional green light provided by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), albeit difficult, according to our analysis, institutional investors invested a little more than 5% of their portfolios in Bitcoin. “If they do, and we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the estimate I gave you.”


Wood's prediction is based on the assumption that institutional investors will start investing heavily in Bitcoin. If Wood's prediction proves correct and Bitcoin reaches $3.8 million by 2030, a modest investment of $1,000 today could potentially rise to over $60,000. However, there are also many analysts who are skeptical of Wood's prediction, considering it only has 5.5 years to come true.

How These Solana Meme Coin Traders Turned $6,400 Into $8 Million In 24 Hours | Bitcoinist.com


								Despite the current market downtrend, crypto traders are still finding ways to make life-changing gains. This is the case of some Solana meme coin traders who recently turned $6,400 into $8 million in 24 hours. 
How These Solana Meme Coin Traders Turned $6,400 Into $8 Million
On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) that these traders turned $6,400 into $8 million by investing in $TIM, a meme coin on Solana. 2 newly created wallets were said to have used 44.78 to buy 526.6 million $TIM (52.665 of the token’s total supply) within three minutes of launch.

These wallets then transferred their $TIM holdings (now worth around $8.28 million) to multiple addresses to avoid drawing attention. On-chain data shows that they are already looking to secure their profits, as they have been selling their $TIM tokens, although in small bits, to avoid a market crash. 

Source: Etherscan
Meme coins (especially ones on Solana) have continued to provide traders with significant gains, especially with Bitcoin and other major cap cryptocurrencies maintaining a downward trend. Bitcoinist previously reported of a trader who turned $1,800 into $11 million with Dogwifhat (WIF) by getting in early on the meme coin while it was still a micro-cap token. 
Meanwhile, more recently, pseudonymous crypto trader Larp von Trier was reported to have turned $353 into $8.3 million by investing in $KEYCAT, a meme coin on Base. The layer-2 network (like Solana) has witnessed an influx of meme coin traders thanks to the barrage of meme coins that continue to launch on the network daily.  
More Recent Success Stories
Lookonchain also recently revealed a trader who turned $9,770 into $10 million in just a day. The trader spent 64.5 SOL to buy 97.36 million $GUMMY (another Solana-based meme coin) in the “same block where the $GUMMY deployer added liquidity.” Another trader turned $110,000 into 48.72 million in just 3 hours by buying $MANEKI.

Although this trader wasn’t the first to buy the meme coin, he used $716 SOL to acquire 1.02 billion $MANEKI (11.51% of the token’s supply) less than one minute after the token launched. Like the $TIM traders, he distributed these $MANEKI tokens across different wallets to avoid drawing attention. 
Meanwhile, it is worth noting that there is an ugly side to meme coin trading, as some traders have also recorded significant losses. One is a trader who recently spent 1,600 SOL to buy $COOL and ended up selling the meme coin for 532.58 SOL, losing 1,067.42 ($152,000) in the process.

States’ backlash against Binance.US continues with 6th license pulled

Oregon has become the sixth state to revoke, suspend or decline to renew Binance.US’ license to operate there, following a spate of refusals earlier this year. The Oregon Division of Financial Regulation announced on April 30 that it had revoked Binance.US’s license, as a result of which it is prohibited from accepting money for transmission or holding or selling fiat or crypto for Oregon consumers. The division explained in a statement:“Due to the nature of the felonies committed by [former Binance CEO Changpeng] Zhao, the Division has revoked Binance.US's money transmission license.”Oregon was following the example of five states that moved against the exchange after Zhao pleaded guilty to violating Anti-Money Laundering laws. Florida was the first state to act, suspending Binance.US’ license in November, shortly after Zhao’s guilty plea. Alaska followed suit at the beginning of January when it declined to renew its license.Related: Former NY Fed chief joins Binance.US boardNorth Carolina suspended Binance.US’ license on January 23, and Maine declined to renew its license on January 29. According to a local press report, Connecticut suspended Binance.US’ license on April 24. Binance.US never received licenses in New York, Texas, Vermont and Hawaii.According to one page on the Binance.US website, its services are unavailable in Georgia and Ohio as well, although another page indicates that the exchange has licenses there. Binance opened a regional hub in Georgia with a staff of 25 in March 2023. Its license in Minnesota does not cover the exchange or transmission of virtual currency. Source: Binance.US Customer SupportThat is not the full extent of Binance.US’ troubles. Binance.US chief operating officer Christopher Blodgett said in a court deposition in December that the exchange had taken a “near-mortal blow,” forcing it to lay off over 200 staff members, due to U.S. banks’ unwillingness to work with it.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance in June. In that suit, the SEC claimed that Binance.US had failed to register as an exchange, broker and clearing agency. It further alleged that Binance.US lacked controls over “manipulative trading,” engaged in wash trading and had commingled funds with Binance, which created Binance.US in 2019 under regulatory pressure.Magazine: US and China try to crush Binance, SBF’s $40M bribe claim: Asia Express

Bitcoin traders set $50K price target after BTC falls below key support level

Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped 5.42% over the last 24 hours to hit a new multi-week low at $57,151 on May 1. On-chain data shows that a slowdown in Bitcoin demand growth and increased open short positions may be responsible for the latest drawdown, and it’s possible that new lows will be in store for BTC.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewReporting from CryptoQuant attributes BTC’s latest decline to a slowdown in demand characterized by decreased growth in Bitcoin balances among permanent holders, slowing spot Bitcoin ETF demand and an increase in short positions in the futures market.CryptoQuant data shows that demand from permanent holders (investors who only purchase Bitcoin and never sell) fell by 50% in April, from over 200,000 BTC in late March to about 90,000 BTC. “Accelerating demand growth is needed for prices to bottom and eventually rally significantly.”Bitcoin demand from accumulated addresses. Source: CryptoQuantThe chart above reveals that this metric has “reached levels similar to early March when Bitcoin also experienced a meaningful correction,” dropping 7% immediately after breaching its all-time highs. Demand from whales has been declining since late March,, and according to CryptoQuant analysts, BTC price corrections are usually driven by slower growth in demand from large investors.“Bitcoin whale demand growth (purple area) peaked at a monthly growth rate of 12% in late March and has now slowed down to 6%.”Monthly change in total Bitcoin whale holdings. Source: CryptoQuantThe analysts also said that the slowdown in Bitcoin demand was evinced by declining purchases from spot ETFs in the U.S., which also added to the sell-side pressure.“The daily purchase of Bitcoin from ETFs has plummeted to basically zero currently, after peaking in mid-March at more than $1 billion,” noted the report, adding that "a new wave of Bitcoin purchases from ETFs is needed to refresh demand growth.”Another metric that the on-chain data analytics firm used to explain the slowdown in Bitcoin demand was the “traders’ unwillingness to pay more to open long positions” as sell orders outpace buy orders. Bitcoin funding rates. Source: CryptoQuantBitcoin’s funding rate has dropped to a year-to-date low, indicating traders’ unwillingness to “pay as much as before to open long positions.”Instead, “the recent price decline has been caused by traders opening short positions, expecting prices to decline further,” the report noted.Analysts agree that downside is the likely direction for Bitcoin priceThe ongoing market correction has left market participants wondering how low Bitcoin price can go before a trend reversal occurs. CryptoQuant analysts set the lower target within the $55,000 to $57,000 demand zone, which is “10% below the current cost basis of traders of $63,000.” Traders’ cost basis has been known to offer support for prices during bull markets.“The current Bitcoin price is already below traders’ cost basis.”Bitcoin STH realized profit/loss. Source: CryptoQuantFor popular analyst Scott Melker, $52,000 is as low as the BTC price can go in the short term. Melker said the correction is still mild for a bull market since the daily RSI is not yet oversold.“This is still only a 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pull back during this bull market, like those of the past.”Continuing, Tuur Demeester, a Bitcoin analyst, spotted BTC trading at $60,409, saying $50,000 could be the next stop for Bitcoin now that the $60,000 support was lost. Source: Tuur DemeesterTrader and analyst Mags said that if Bitcoin closes below $60,000 on the weekly timeframe, traders should “expect a much deeper retracement, till $40,000 and even lower.”“In this cycle so far, we have seen 4 pullbacks between 20-22%. If we witness something similar, a -22% correction from the local high would put us at $58,000 - $57,500.”This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Cryptocurrency company Coinbase Global COIN will report first-quarter (Q1) financial results after market close on Thursday, May 2, 2024.Read on for earnings estimates, analyst ratings, price targets and the key items to watch:Ratings & Targets:
HC Wainwright: Buy rating, raised price target from $250 to $300



JPMorgan: Neutral rating, $150 price target 



Bernstein: Market Perform rating, raised price target from $80 to $200



Compass Point: Buy rating, raised price target from $235 to $325

Earnings Estimates: Analysts expect Coinbase to report first-quarter revenue of $1.34 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.The company reported revenue of $772.53 million in last year's first quarter. Coinbase has beaten revenue estimates from analysts in five straight quarters.Analysts expect the company to report earnings per share of $1.00 for the first quarter, compared to a loss of 34 cents in last year's first quarter. Coinbase has beaten earnings per share estimates in four of the last five quarter, including four consecutive quarters.The company has not guided for revenue estimates but said previously it expects first-quarter subscription and services revenue to be in a range of $410 million to $480 million.Related Link: EXCLUSIVE – Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High – Here’s When Benzinga Readers Think $100K Milestone Could Be ReachedWhat Analysts Say: The first quarter was an "eventful quarter for the cryptoecosystem," JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington said.The analyst said Coinbase could be a key beneficiary of the increased trading activity.Worthington expects Coinbase to post subscription and services revenue of $450 million. The analyst also sees Base, which is Coinbase's Layer 2 platform, contributing more meaningful in the quarter at around $20 million in net revenue."We see Coinbase as both a leading driver and beneficiary of the cryptocurrency economy, and we previously underestimated the strength of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in its early days – launched January 2024 – as a key catalyst for the crypto industry," Worthington said.The analyst said Coinbase's revenue generation could benefit in the short term with a crypto rally."We see the longer term success of Coinbase being driven by development, with our focus on tokenization and payments."Key Items to Watch: When Coinbase reported fourth-quarter financial results, the company said its three main priorities for 2024 would be driving revenue through improving core trading, driving utility in crypto with experiments in payments and driving regulatory clarity for the industry.Investors and analysts will watch for all of these items in the upcoming quarterly report.The biggest item likely watched by those looking at Coinbase will be the impact the approval and launch of Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs had on the company in the first quarter.Investors will also be looking to see how big of an impact on trading volume and transaction revenues Bitcoin had compared to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin represented 31% of trading volume and 29% of transaction revenues in the fourth quarter.The balance of transaction revenue with the company's subscription and services revenue could also be something to monitor. The transaction revenue is larger but can also be more volatile from quarter to quarter, while the subscription and services revenue is growing and also important for the company increasing efforts for profitability.COIN Price Action: Coinbase shares were up 3% to $210.09 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $46.43 to $283.48.Read Next: Coinbase Up 300% In A Year, But Faces Bearish Technicals Ahead Of Q1 EarningsImage: Shutterstock

                        Wednesday, May 01, 2024 – An ongoing presale for Solana’s greatest multichain good boy Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) has taken in $13 million so far, with at least $2 million flooding into the ICO in the five days since it deployed on Solana.Crypto’s latest Shiba Inu-inspired funny token has pricked the ears of meme fans, degens and crypto evangelists alike, who see Dogeverse’s hyper-jumping cross-chain capabilities as a hint of tomorrow’s meme coin capabilities.Now SOL fans are in on the action too. As of Friday, April 26, Dogeverse has rolled out on its sixth native chain, Solana, joining a digital economy that is home to $3.465 billion in total value locked (TVL), with 1.13 million active users transacting daily and over 2,500 monthly active developers.Since Dogeverse exists on multiple chains, it can be purchased by anyone on Ethereum ($ETH), BNB Smart Chain ($BNB), Polygon ($MATIC), Avalanche ($AVAX), Base ($BASE) and now Solana ($SOL) to spare.To purchase with SOL, simply head to the website and select “Buy With SOL” from the drop-down menu of the buy widget. Doing so will transport users to a Solana-based version of the site hosted on solana.thedogeverse.com.The option to pay with Solana is hosted on a subdomain, due to wallet connect functions not being able to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solana-integrated wallets in tandem.The SOL-specific version of the Dogeverse website also adds the ability to buy tokens using Circle’s hugely popular USDC, which is the stablecoin of choice on the Solana network,The Dogeverse ICO and Beyond
Currently priced at $0.000304 and due to rise in a few days, Dogeverse sold out its initial soft cap allocation of 200 billion tokens after trending virally on launching at the beginning of April.A heady $1 million flooded the project barely 48 hours into its ICO, selling out of tokens allocated to the first two presale rounds and far exceeding the team’s initial expectation of a 6-day first round.This enabled Dogeverse to move onto the second half of its ICO a day ahead of schedule. A further 200 billion tokens are being sold to the public across the remaining rounds before the presale closes. Initially, this was planned for June 11, however, due to the immense success of the presale, it’s likely to conclude substantially earlier.The funds from these additional tokens, which would otherwise be sold on decentralized (DEX) or centralized (CEX) exchanges after the claim, will now be used to bolster liquidity to ensure high-volume trading and for buy-back funds.Token holders can stake on Ethereum to earn passive rewards.The team is currently working towards CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listing applications, while later DEX and CEX listings form part of the project roadmap.Cosmo: Crypto’s New Hyper-Jumping Multi-Chain Good Boy
The market’s appetite for canine-themed coins began with Dogecoin (DOGE) back at the end of 2013. Dogecoin didn’t need much of a sales pitch, because it was based on a viral meme that virtually anyone with a social media account had seen before. (Wow! Such meme! Very crypto!)Since then, many celebrities have professed their love for the novelty canine cryptocurrency, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, American entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and musicians Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg.But fun as it may be, Dogecoin is not without its problems.Since Dogecoin is its own proprietary network based on Bitcoin, it utilizes a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW) to validate transactions. This means that the miners with the most computation and power mine the most Dogecoin. Like Bitcoin, mining DOGE consumes a lot of energy.Doge was followed by Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and DogWifHat (WIF). All of them reference original viral doge memes in some way, but all of them have either come from the most commercially important blockchain, Ethereum, or its nearest rival, Solana, both of which use less energy than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.To date, none of the alternative Dogecoins have seriously challenged the original’s dominance.Dogeverse hopes to change that. It is built on a multichain network spanning six chains, none of which deploy the PoW consensus mechanism.At the center of the Dogeverse is our four-legged friend Cosmo. Born from a supernova, Cosmo discovered he had a unique ability: the power to hyper-jump across universes.Now, Cosmo wants to share the chain-leaping fun with his owners.Dogeverse and the Ethereum ETF Saga
Analysts are anticipating potentially price-driving news this month, on May 23. That’s the SEC’s first deadline to respond to the latest round of applications for US spot Ethereum ETFs.The date could mark the start of a potential Ethereum gold rush, and with Ethereum being crypto’s most commercially important blockchain, the whole ecosystem will benefit.So will Layer 1 competitors like Solana and Avalanche and Layer 2s like Polygon, all of which are native to the Dogeverse.Given the fact that a federal court overturned the SEC’s earlier refusal of Bitcoin ETFs as “arbitrary and capricious” it’s possible that spot Ethereum ETFs will pass through unopposed, smashing the doors down for the approval of similar products for Solana and Avalanche.VIDEOThe ETF effect is a very real catalyst, too. Earlier this year, the US launch of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs rallied the original cryptocurrency to set a new high watermark of $73,737.94 on March 14.So Cosmo is a clean and green representative of not one, not two, but six different blockchain networks. And with staking capabilities, seamless multi-chain fun and a potentially catalytic news cycle in the coming months, what’s not to love about crypto’s new hyper-jumping pupper?Join the presale over on the Dogeverse website before the price rises.Social Channels: Twitter | Telegram

WienerAI’s cybernetic capabilities get him in front of every frontrunner.WienerAI recalls another successful recent token launch, canine meme coin and AI security token Scotty the AI ($SCOTTY), which netted close to $10 million in a recent presale.Combining two hot niches, both $WAI and $SCOTTY have inspired investors with the promise of a new generation of coins that offer more laughs than run-of-the-mill AI coins and more utility than bog standard meme coins.Other strong narratives driving the project are its eye-watering staking rewards, currently offering yields of 1241% per annum, its verified audit, and the fun, community-building storyline.WienerAI: The Only Sausage/Dog/AI Hybrid
To begin with, investors have probably never heard an origin story like this before. Like his predecessor, Scotty the AI, WienerAI arrives on the scene with a fully-formed backstory.Wiener was born in a lab in New Silicon Valley, AD 2132. His progenitor is a mad puppy-loving scientist known as The Architect, whose life’s work was to create an advanced AI/canine hybrid.Indeed, he succeeded, albeit with one caveat. The Architect was eating a sausage as he was performing the splicing procedure. The accidental result was WienerAI, a hybrid of pup, AI and sausage.Now, the whitepaper mentions “companionship” and “friendship” as key parts of Wiener’s premise. It also mentions “The Sausage Army”, the endearing term for the legions of followers Wiener hopes to attract, so there are subtle hints at a strong social component.He’s not the first crypto doge with an army, but he may be the best.WienerAI Wants To Take Over Crypto’s Doge Scene
The world’s first and favorite meme coin, Dogecoin ($DOGE), also has an army: the self-styled “Doge Army”, but Wiener is aiming for a wider community and he has a decent battle cry to help him rally his sausage forces.See, Dogecoin is one tired pupper. Launched in 2013, Dogecoin is housed on its own blockchain, which is a spin on Bitcoin’s. Dogecoin employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which means that it’s the miners with access to the most power and/or computation that bag the most DOGE.In a world of rising atmospheric temperatures and international climate targets, PoW is a growing concern among more conscientious investors.WienerAI’s native chain, Ethereum, employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where the miners that stake the most ETH get the most rewards. This is well over 99% more energy efficient than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.Secondly, in an industry that was rocked by near-constant scandals and liquidity crises in the last two years, WienerAI offers the security of proper auditing. The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms. This gives investors added confidence in WienerAI.Lastly, there’s the daily staking rewards. Some 20% of $WAI’s supply is earmarked for staking. Buyers can stake during the presale, and are in fact encouraged to do so on the website, in order to take advantage of the lucrative 1241% APY on offer at present.Mysterious he may be, but it’s no mystery why investors are piling into WienerAI’s new presale. Everybody wants to get their hands on a tokenized piece of crypto’s most advanced beginner-friendly AI trading companion yet.Keep on top of WienerAI’s latest developments on X/Twitter and Telegram.Join the presale now over on the website.

Bitcoin Traders Target Test of $53,000 Support as BTC Price Predictions Remains Bearish Following Fed Meeting
                        The Bitcoin (BTC) price is consolidating in the mid-$57,000s, down roughly 5% on the day, though up around 1.5% or $1,000 from earlier session lows as traders weigh the outlook for Fed rate cuts this year in wake of the latest policy announcement from the US central bank.As anticipated, the Fed left interest rates at multi-decade high levels of 5.25-5.5% and slowed its balance sheet run-off.The central bank will now allow its portfolio of assets to shrink by only $25 billion per month. Before, the central bank had been allowing its balance sheet to shrink by $60 billion per month.That reduction was a little larger than some investors appeared to anticipate and could explain the dovish market reaction to the initial policy announcement.Bitcoin briefly pushed all the way to the mid-$59,000s, and US stocks pumped, though these moves quickly reversed.Currently, Bitcoin is trading hands roughly in line with where it was before the Fed’s announcement.As expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted recent higher-than-expected inflation data readings so far this year.He commented that gaining confidence to cut interest rates will take longer than expected.According to CME data, the money market-implied odds that the Fed will have cut interest rates by 25 bps by September rose to 54% from 46% one day ago.Meanwhile, the probability of no rate cuts this year dropped to 16% from 27% one day ago.Ultimately, the market interpreted the Fed meeting as slightly more dovish than expected, explaining the Bitcoin price bounce from lows.Where Next for the Bitcoin Price?
While Bitcoin may have recovered from earlier session lows, recent technical developments suggest more downside is coming.Prior to Wednesday’s Fed meeting, Bitcoin had dropped nearly 5% from just below $61,000.That drop came after it fell 5% from near $65,000 on Tuesday.The decrease from earlier weekly highs comes as US economic data points to sticky inflation pressures and accelerated ETF outflows.According to data presented by The Block, US Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows for five days straight.The drop in Bitcoin prices from earlier weekly highs comes as US economic data points to sticky inflation pressures and as ETF outflows accelerate. Source: The BlockImportantly, Wednesday’s dip saw Bitcoin break to the south of its two-month $60,000-$74,000ish range.The next major level of support for Bitcoin isn’t until the mid-February highs at $53,000.The next major level of support for the Bitcoin price isn’t until the mid-February highs at $53,000. Source: TradingViewMany analysts are now predicting that BTC will hit the low $50,000s.A few analysts mentioned that the average entry price of US Bitcoin ETF buyers at $57,300 is important to watch.“There might have been lots of ‘TradFi’ tourists in crypto pushing longs into the halving,” 10x CEO Markus Thielen wrote.  “This time is now over. We expect more unwinding as… Bitcoin trades below $57,300. This will likely lower prices to… a -25% to -29% correction from the $73,000 top. That explains our price target of $52,000/$55,000 during the last three weeks.”

SEC to OK Leveraged ETH ETFs... While Probing Security Status? - DailyCoin


        
The SEC may be set to approve leveraged ETH futures ETFs.



The likely approval comes despite an ongoing investigation into whether Ethereum is an unregistered security.



At the same time, the SEC continues to delay a decision on spot Ethereum ETFs.
The debacle over the SEC’s classification of Ethereum is getting more complicated.Over the past few weeks, it has become clear that the regulator has the second largest crypto asset in terms of market cap in its cross-hairs, suspecting that the asset may be an unregistered security. For the observers, the situation recently got more complicated as a recent ConsenSys complaint revealed that the SEC’s Ethereum probe has been on for at least a year, months before the agency implicitly signed off on the CFTC’s classification of ETH as a commodity by approving ETH futures ETFs.Adding to the growing confusion over the SEC’s stance, the agency now looks set to approve leveraged ETH ETF products.Leveraged ETH Futures ETF Applicants Feeling “Optimistic”On Wednesday, May 1, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that leveraged ETH futures ETF applicants felt “optimistic” about their chances of getting approval, citing persons familiar with the matter. The journalist disclosed that these institutions expressed this view based on “positive dialogue” from the SEC. If the SEC gives the green light as they expect, Volatility Shares’ 2x Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU) will be the first to go live on June 4.  As Terrett highlighted, approving these products will add another layer of intrigue to the Ethereum security status debacle.By approving leveraged ETH futures ETFs, the SEC will be stirring further confusion by again implicitly accepting the CFTC’s classification of the crypto asset while having a pending investigation into whether it is a security.
Stressing the potential implications of the move, Van Buren Capital General Partner Scott Johnsson asserted that the SEC’s decision on the matter would be “key to watch.”Beyond the apparent inconsistencies in the regulator’s actions, from a risk perspective, most could not wrap their head around the logic of approving leveraged ETH futures ETFs while delaying spot ETFs.“Make It Make Sense”For months, the SEC has delayed its decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications, offering no reason for the delay except that it required more time to review applications. With the May 23 deadline for the agency to decide on VanEck’s application looming, the growing consensus among observers and even some applicants is that this application will be denied.The possibility of the SEC first approving leveraged futures ETFs, which arguably pose greater investment risks over spot offerings, has rubbed many off as odd, to say the least.Angel Investor Eric Conner sarcastically quipped, “Make so much sense… Much protection!”Chiming in, The ETF Store, Inc. President Nate Geraci added, “Somebody make it make sense.”On the Flipside 
The SEC has yet to approve the leveraged ETH futures ETFs officially.



It will not be the first time the SEC approved leveraged futures ETFs before the spot. The agency had approved leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs about six months before finally approving the spot product.
Why This MattersThe likely approval of leveraged ETH futures ETFs adds further confusion to the uncertainty surrounding the agency’s classification of Ethereum.Read this for more on the Ethereum security classification debacle:How Year-Long ETH Security Probe Paints SEC into a CornerLearn about Polygon’s (MATIC) recent price action:Polygon (MATIC) Plunges in BTC-Led Flush: Can It Hold Support?

Altcoins In Trouble As Seasoned Analyst Predicts 40% Drop In Prices


                            Altcoins have suffered more in the crypto market following the Bitcoin price crash, leaving a lot of investors in losses. This is not out of the ordinary as these altcoins are known to have a higher volatility compared to Bitcoin, hence, their price swings can be more pronounced. Given the recent decline, the expectation is that the altcoins will recover. However, one analyst does not agree with that assessment.
Altcoins Headed For 40% Crash
In an analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), seasoned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen shocked the crypto community with his expectations for altcoins. According to the analysis, the worst is far from over for the altcoin market, as there are still more crashes to come.

Cowen explained that this was analyzed using altcoins versus Bitcoin pairs, and it seems each one looks weak against the apex cryptocurrency. This is due to the expected rate cuts, and historical performance suggests that a decline will follow.
The crypto analyst pointed to the 2019 rate cuts and how altcoins had reacted to that development back then. Following the rate cuts, altcoins plunged against Bitcoin, with major players recording up to 40% losses during this time. “Perhaps this time is not different? This would mean ALT/BTC pairs drop another 40% from here over the next few months,” Cowen said.
Cowen expects this to place out regardless of what happens in the market in the meantime. He explains that even if the market does recover in the short term, it does not invalidate the thesis. “Short-term countertrends do not invalidate this view,” he stated.
If this repeats, then it could turn an already harsh market trend even bloodier. The altcoin market cap has already fallen below $1 trillion as of the time of writing, but a 40% decline from here could send it as low as $600 billion.
Bitcoin Crash Drags Down Crypto Market
While the Bitcoin crash has been brutal, the impact on altcoins has been much more pronounced. Ethereum has held up nicely with less than a 4% decline during this time, but others such as Stacks (STX), Arweave (AR), Neo (NEO), and Sei (SEI) are down an average of 9% in the last 24 hours.

Meme coins were also not left out of the bloodbath, with market leader Dogecoin dropping 6% to $0.126 and Pepe (PEPE) plunging 7.74% to $0.0000063. Bonk (BONK) recorded a 5% decline to eliminate some of its gains from last week, and Shiba Inu fell 4.18%.
Amid all of this, though, there have been some market winners, with Optimism (OP) recording 12% gains. Cosmos (ATOM) followed with a 9.8% increase, and Starknet (STRK) rose 9%, making them the top gainers of the day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Four Solana Memecoins That Could Rally Over 8,000% and Take on Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

Market Cap: $19,000

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Is Chainlink (LINK) Set for a Another Price Dip?


Chainlink (LINK) is currently facing bearish woes and could react to them by noting a price drop. This is essential for the altcoin to initiate a recovery that could help gain the losses noted recently.
Investors are exhibiting short-term pessimism, which aligns with the predicted outcome for the LINK price.
Chainlink Investors Could Make a Move Soon
LINK price is anticipating a decline, and the network is not keen on changing the outcome. The recent correction eliminated any incentive for new investors to jump aboard the Chainlink train. This is evident in the network growth, which has dipped to a yearly low. 
Network growth is calculated based on the rate at which new addresses are formed on the network. This data determines whether or not a project is losing traction in the market.

Given Chainlink’s network growth is so low, it seems probable that LINK is not attracting any new users at the moment. This could negatively impact the price of the token.

Secondly, LINK is highly undervalued at the moment, based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This, however, is a bullish development. 
The MVRV ratio measures investor profit/loss. Chainlink’s 30-day MVRV at -16% signals losses, potentially prompting accumulation. 
Historically, LINK price recovery occurs at -7% and -17% MVRV, labeling it an opportunity zone. Nevertheless, there is still some room before LINK investors purchase the token right now to initiate a recovery.

LINK Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch
LINK price, trading at $12.7 at the time of writing, is below the support of $13.2. This is a crucial level because it coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement.
Further decline is likely should LINK fall below the support at $12.7. Considering the market conditions, LINK will potentially drop to $11.7 before bouncing back up.

However, if the support at $12.7 remains intact and Chainlink reclaims 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement as support, it could initiate a recovery. This would invalidate the bearish thesis and enable a rise to $14.8 and beyond.

Dogecoin Enters Major Accumulation Zone, Is It Time To Get Back In? | Bitcoinist.com


								The foremost meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), has entered a major accumulation zone, suggesting that this may be the right time to invest in the crypto token. This is also supported by the fact that the meme coin could soon experience a trend reversal from the current downtrend that it is experiencing. 
Dogecoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio Is A Buy Signal
Data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that Dogecoin’s 30-day MVRV ratio is around -15%, meaning many Dogecoin holders are currently at a loss. This negative MVRV ratio also signals a bottom for the meme coin, which usually ushers in a period of accumulation since the crypto token is currently undervalued. 
Related Reading: Cardano Roars Back To Life As ADA Whales Move $13.84 Billion
Besides new investors, Dogecoin’s current holders are also expected to use this opportunity to accumulate more of the meme coin in a bid to break even in their positions. This already looks to be happening, as data from IntoTheBlock shows a notable increase in the token supply held by long-term holders (more than a year).
Crypto investors buying up the Dogecoin dip can add significant buying pressure to the crypto token, which could spark a price recovery amidst this market downtrend. Moreover, on-chain data shows that Dogecoin whales are also accumulating during this period. Specifically, 150,000,000 DOGE were transferred from the crypto trading platform Robinhood to an unknown wallet, while another 76,316,694 DOGE were transferred from Robinhood to that wallet. 
These whales have a massive influence on the market, and their buys could positively impact DOGE’s price. Meanwhile, it is also worth noting that this price recovery looks imminent for DOGE, considering that recovery has historically always occurred around this MVRV range. 
What DOGE Chart Is Saying
Crypto analyst Kevin (formerly OG Yomi) recently stated that Dogecoin is currently at a “major support zone, one which he believes that the meme coin shouldn’t lose if the crypto market is indeed in a “real bull market.” The analyst mentioned in an earlier X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin needs to hold above this level to remain bullish.  

Source: X
However, Dogecoin risks dropping below that level, especially with the current market-wide downtrend with Bitcoin leading the charge. Moreover, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to announce the rate decision on May 1, which could cause DOGE and other crypto tokens to decline further if they decide to take a hawkish stance and increase interest rates.

At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.123, down over 10% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

MicroStrategy Is Building ‘Decentralized ID’ on Bitcoin Using Ordinals-Like Inscriptions - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsDuring a presentation at the annual MicroStrategy World conference in Las Vegas, MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor unveiled the open-source MicroStrategy Orange Decentralized Identity protocol.“Michael presented a very compelling case for why we need decentralized identity and did decentralized identifiers,” MicroStrategy executive vice president of engineering Cezary Raczko told the audience. “He made an even more compelling case why it makes sense to anchor digital identity into the Bitcoin blockchain, protected by the strength and the security of the Bitcoin network.”Alongside the announcement, MicroStrategy published an unofficial draft of the MicroStrategy Orange specification to Github.While the timing of the news was unexpected, Saylor previously hinted that his company was working in the identity and authentication space. He told Decrypt last year that MicroStrategy was more than aware of Ordinals after the protocol launched in January, and interested in exploring how it could inspire software innovations.“The whole idea of burning a piece of data on the blockchain opens the door to the possibility that I might burn a digital signature, or I might burn a registration, or I might burn a hash of a document,” Saylor said. “Right now, enterprises have weak security compared to Bitcoin.”The Bitcoin advocate said that innovations using the world's largest cryptocurrency could introduce an entirely new level of security.“The platform consists of three fundamental pieces, Raczko said late Wednesday.“At the heart of it is a service cloud, hosted, that allows you to issue those identifiers to your users in your organization,” he explained. “It also allows you to deploy prepackaged out-of-the-box applications that run on the MicroStrategy Orange platform.”Raczko said the Orange software development kit will make it easy for coders to take these capabilities and integrate them into their own applications and systems.Using email as an example, Raczko said Bitcoin-based public and private keys generated using MicroStrategy Orange would be inscribed using the Ordinals protocol.According to the MicroStrategy Orange documentation, the decentralized identity protocol uses a modified approach to inscriptions as Ordinals, but stores only data related to decentralized identity (DID), meaning documents can be created and updated with few restrictions on size and content while taking advantage of the segregated witness (SegWit) feature of Bitcoin.“Once you've established that that email is genuine, you accept the invitation, and at that point, we're going to generate your unique decentralized identifier, and the public and private key pair,” Raczko explained. “We're going to send a decentralized identifier and the public key to the Orange server to be inscribed on the Bitcoin Blockchain, [and] from that point onward, you are ready to start sending Orange-signed or emails.”“[The] opportunity we see and want to pursue is integrating the digital identity based on Bitcoin with this bigger, verifiable credential ecosystem which opens up another large number of very interesting use cases where I can now credential my identity anchored to Bitcoin,” Raczko said.He added that the MicroStrategy Orange decentralized identifier could also be used to verify users on social media applications or authenticate a text message, college degree or medical record.“Present those and then have those verified all in a decentralized way, but with the ultimate identity living and being anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain,” Raczko added—suggesting that Orange could make it possible to display an “orange check” for verified users across platforms.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Riot Platforms reported a $211.8 million net income for Q1 2024 — a company record and a 1,000% increase from the same time last year — but missed analyst revenue estimates.Riot’s first quarter results released May 1 show minin revenue spiked 55.4% year-on-year to $74.6 million, primarily driven by a 131% increase in Bitcoin’s price.The firm's total revenue was $79.3 million, fallin 14% short of estimates by research firm Zacks.The miner said a rise in net income and mining revenue was partially slowed by lower Bitcoin production and higher mining costs due to an increase in Bitcoin’s network difficulty and hash rate.Riot’s unaudited financial statement for Q1 2024.

CZ’s Trial Proves it Pays to Cooperate

This is the plain and simple understanding drawn from comparing CZ to Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and fraudster behind rival exchange FTX, who, in March, was sentenced to 25 years in prison, and never really admitted to his multi-billion dollar theft of client funds. CZ, of course, wasn’t accused of stealing from customers, but instead of failing to implement the necessary compliance infrastructure expected of a money transmitter.

Solana Co-Founder Says Cosmos and One SOL Rival Are Clear Winners in Building Sovereign Blockchains - The Daily Hodl


								Solana (SOL) co-founder Raj Gokal is naming two blockchains that have a head start in the sovereign blockchains crypto sub-sector.
At a TOKEN2049 panel discussion, Gokal says that Avalanche (AVAX) and Cosmos Hub (ATOM) are “the clear winners” with regard to sovereign blockchains.










A sovereign blockchain is typically under the control of a single entity, unlike public blockchains such as Bitcoin (BTC) which are decentralized.
According to Gokal, Cosmos Hub and Avalanche have some differences that set them apart.
“Cosmos is an old-school project and it’s not that coordinated. I think Avalanche brings the coordination and the ability for developers to configure their own chains how they want. So I like that about their design. And obviously, it’s a function of Emi’s [Gün Sirer] DNA and his great vision as a founder.”
On the Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer, Gokal further says,
“I think Solana loves competition. We love fierce competition, we love honest competition from people who have ferocity about the ideas they’re bringing to the table. 
And I think Emin is probably the most ferocious layer-1 [blockchain] founder that I know. And he never backs down from a fight. But he will shake your hand behind the stage and he’s friends with everyone. And he’s been very supportive of a lot of founders. 
So I think as an individual I have a lot of respect for Emin and what he’s brought to the space.”

'Bitcoin Jesus' arrest raises concerns: 'The U.S. is coming after crypto!' - AMBCrypto



After Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao, Roger Ver is under the radar of the U.S. government. 
Diverse reactions within the crypto community highlight industry complexities amid legal actions.

The year 2024 is proving to be a golden age for cryptocurrencies, with the exponential growth of this asset class coinciding with a surge in crypto voters. 
Notably, a significant portion of this surge in crypto adoption occurred after the 2020 presidential election. Following Biden’s election, there was an unprecedented wave of retail adoption within the cryptocurrency industry.
However, as the U.S. elections 2024 approaches, an unexpected development has emerged. 
The United States Department of Justice has announced charges against Roger Ver, also known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” on allegations of tax evasion.
Diverging perspective 
Various execs have weighed in on the matter, speculating that it is an anti-crypto stance within the Biden administration.
Highlighting consecutive arrests by the U.S. government, including Sam Bankman-Fried, Changpeng Zhao, and now Roger Ver, David Shares, a crypto expert noted, 
“The U.S. is aggressively coming after crypto. Just look at the recent targets. If you think you’re not a target, think again. They will come after all of us at some point. We have to fight!” 
Echoing similar sentiments, Jane Adams, a 2024 candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives and a supporter of Bitcoin, said,

However, some execs believed in the steps taken by the U.S. Voicing his apprehensions against Ver, Bitcoin educator, Dan Held said, 
“Good. He’s been a net negative for Bitcoin.” 
Adding to the fray, an X user, @koinosthegoat, claimed, 
Source: @koinosthegoat/Twitter
These contrasting perspectives underscore the complexities and divisions within the crypto space, suggesting potential implications for the upcoming U.S. elections.
What’s more to it? 
As a matter of fact, Ver was arrested in Spain on the 30th of April, following criminal charges in the U.S. for offenses including mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. 
The DoJ alleges that Ver avoided taxes totaling $48 million on his Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sales in 2017. According to a press release by the DoJ,
Source: U.S. Department of Justice
However, despite renouncing his US citizenship in 2014, Ver faces extradition to the United States, prompting criticism from crypto veterans and social media users. 
Amidst this criticism, Kim Dotcom, a crypto veteran who himself was in the same shoes a few years ago, remarked,
“This indictment has nothing to do with tax evasion. This is a malicious attempt to vilify Roger and to punish him for exposing and opposing the crimes of the US empire.” 
As things unfold, it will be interesting to watch how the upcoming U.S. elections will shape the future of cryptocurrency in the States.

Is Celestia (TIA) Vulnerable to a 25% Price Drop?


Celestia (TIA) is prone to further correction after consistently forming red candlesticks over the past few days. The saving grace is that investors are not too keen on saving the altcoin either.
The most likely outcome for TIA is a five-month low since it follows the cues set by Bitcoin, which dropped below $60,000.
Celestia Investors Save Their Money
Celestia’s price decline resulted from the crypto market noting a bearish couple of days in the previous month. However, the broader impact has been on the traders who have opted to withdraw from the asset for now.
This is noted in the decline in the Open Interest (OI), which in the past month has been reduced by 50%. At the start of March, a total of $233 million worth of shorts and long contracts were opened in the market. This has since come down to $113 million, less than half of the original OI.
This shows that the investors only focus on profitable actions, which could take a while.
Celesita Open Interest. Source: Coinglass
The reason behind this delay is the correlation that TIA shares with Bitcoin. A high correlation of 0.96 exhibits a tethered price action of both assets, with TIA following BTC’s cues. Currently, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is witnessing a bearish outlook, with Bitcoin’s price trading below $60,000.

Further decline in BTC is anticipated, and the condition of Celestia’s price is also the same. Thus, the altcoin could observe some drawdown in the coming days.

TIA Price Prediction: Drop to $7 
Celestia’s price is testing the support marked at $9.2, which could fail to hold, resulting in a price correction to the next area of support at $8.3. But if this level breaks, it would validate the bearish thesis, causing the TIA price to correct further and hit $7.

However, if the $8.3 support floor holds strong enough to prevent a decline, TIA could bounce back. Reclaiming the $10 would wipe out half the losses noted and invalidate the bearish thesis.

Build on Bitcoin Launches Mainnet With Over 40 Apps - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Build on Bitcoin (BOB) project announced the launch of its first phase on Wednesday, enabling decentralized apps—dapps—to interact with the world’s top blockchain.The BOB mainnet is coming online with $300 million in total value locked (TVL) and over 40 dapps already available, the team said on Twitter, declaring “a Bitcoin-driven DeFi summer” with more to come in the next three weeks.Build on Bitcoin is intended to be a hybrid layer-2 network, an “Ethereum rollup” that merges Bitcoin’s global adoption, liquidity, and proof-of-work security with the decentralized finance (DeFi) features of Ethereum: smart contracts, wallets, and access to stablecoins.In March, Bitcoin DeFi developer Sovryn used Build on Bitcoin to expand its offerings to the Ethereum ecosystem. BOB is meanwhile collaborating with Threshold’s tBTC and Wrapped BTC (WBTC).“We currently work with the two leading BTC bridge providers while working on our bridge infrastructure in parallel,” BOB co-founder Alexei Zamyatin told Decrypt. “We built a one-click onramp from Bitcoin to BOB that abstracts bridge complexity and makes moving liquidity from BTC to BOB as easy as moving from ETH to an ETH L2 going live next week.”Zamyatin said Build on Bitcoin is also looking to provide a one-stop shop for Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes, working with teams that provide bridges for Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 tokens.Image: Build on BitcoinWhile Bitcoin DeFi is the goal, the BOB team acknowledged that the number one blockchain is not ready, making “bootstrapping” on Ethereum necessary.“Connecting to Ethereum follows a pragmatic rollout approach,” the team said. “Bitcoin rollups do not yet work, but demand is high: Bitcoin users need access to stablecoins and DeFi, Ethereum users want to use their BTC and get access to Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20s.”“It is time to end the cult-like feuds and unite the two largest Web3 ecosystems to spearhead mass adoption together,” BOB declared.According to Zamyatin, the next phase of BOB’s development will achieve Bitcoin proof of work via “merged mining,” enhancing security without disrupting Bitcoin mining. Merged mining refers to the process of mining two or more blockchains at the same time.“Previous merged mining instances suffered from slow block times (30sec-1min) due to the limitations of Proof-of-Work,” he said.Finally, the third planned phase will introduce BitVM, enabling a secure BTC bridge with fraud proofs similar to Ethereum's bridges, BOB explains, ensuring safe BTC deposits enforced by Bitcoin nodes.“This ensures that users bridging in BTC can be certain that their deposits are safe and security is enforced by all Bitcoin full nodes—as long as there is at least one person online to submit a fraud-proof,” he said, noting Arbitrum on Ethereum.To draw more users to its platform, Zamyatin pointed to a BOB fusion program that the company is using to boost adoption through dapps that increase the TVL and number of users.According to the Build on Bob website, the total value locked on the platform is currently over $279 million.“BOB Fusion Season 1 attracted 300 million in TVL from 33,000 users in 4 weeks,” Zamyatin said. “BOB Season 2 that launched today saw $64 million in on-chain TVL inflow in less than 12 hours.”“Our mission is to make BTC deployment into DeFi super easy,” Zamyatin said. “Think Yearn Finance for Bitcoin, and make Bitcoin assets accessible to Ethereum and EVM users—uniting the two largest web3 power-user ecosystems.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

                        In wake of the cryptocurrency market’s latest tumble which saw Bitcoin (BTC) drop convincingly below $60,000 for the first time since late February, traders are turning to the on-chain markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin was last trading in the $57,000s as traders digest the latest Fed policy announcement. Negative ETF flows are also on their radar, with Bitcoin ETFs having seen outflows now for five straight days.As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.Most altcoins are also in the red. That is encouraging traders looking to turn a quick profit to turn to the volatile, unpredictable on-chain markets.On-chain markets refer to the market for assets that were issued and trade directly on the blockchain.Dozens of new tokens are launched every single day. Most are pump-and-dump schemes or scams. But there are some gems to be uncovered, that could hand an early investor quick 10 or even 100x gains.Traders often refer to tools like DEXScreener to locate trending and pumping coins.That being said, here are some of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum, as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayAITaxBot (AITAX)A newly launched crypto called AITaxBot (AITAX) is up 1800% on Wednesday, as per DEXScreener.The shitcoin last had a market cap of $370,000, with $130,000 in locked liquidity, with volumes so far of $520,000.The token has four concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per Go+ Security. Investors need to be cautious.America (AMERICA)A meme coin called America (AMERICA) that was launched three days ago continues to push higher.It was last up 220% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $5.1 million as per DEXScreener. It also has a solid $260,000 in locked liquidity.The meme coin has been on a donating spree to US veterans.Donations to good causes are an interesting and commendable marketing strategy for a meme coin.That could explain why AMERICA keeps pumping. Hopefully, it sets a trend.The token has two smart contract issues, as per Go+ Security.Book of Ethereum (BOOE)A meme coin called Book of Ethereum (BOOE) challenged its record highs on Wednesday following a 50% intra-day gains.That according to DEXScreener, that puts its market cap at $3.3 million and liquidity at $270,000.BOOE has no issues with its smart contract and appears not to be a scam. That being said, investors must always do their due diligence and remember that the vast majority of newly launched coins do not retain long-term value.Alternative Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales
If traders can reliably identify altcoin gems, they can make a lot of money.But the over-looked strategy of investing in presales can potentially net even higher gains if done correctly.Web3 projects/protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to fund development.If investors can reliably identify projects that, thanks to their strong vision, use case and competent team, end up gaining traction in the market, they can make big profits.Knowing where to start is one of the biggest barriers to entry in the daunting presale market.That’s why Cryptonews put together a list of their top picks.20 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In

Argentina Lawmaker Unveils Draft Worldcoin Regulation Bill

                        An Argentinian lawmaker has launched a draft bill that proposes regulating Worldcoin and its operator in the Latin American nation.The move comes just days after Worldcoin announced a planned expansion in Mexico. Some Mexican lawmakers have also called for a probe into operator Tools for Humanity.Argentina Lawmaker: We Must Protect Consumer Rights
Per the official news outlet of the Buenos Aires assembly, the new bill is the brainchild of Buenos Aires parliament member Carlos Puglelli.The MP, and others, have claimed it is “unclear” what Worldcoin does with the biometric data it collects using its iris-scanning drives.Puglelli’s bill proposes “regulating companies that scan people’s irises for the purpose of collecting biometric data.”The bill’s author noted that Buenos Aires authorities should be allowed to “exercise control over activities carried out by companies like Worldcoin.”He also called for more “transparency” about happens to the biometric data that “users deliver to these companies, in this case in exchange for a payment in cryptocurrency.”Worldcoin has proven a hit in Argentina, where it operates over 50 iris-scanning centers.Buenos Aires MPs Want Worldcoin Investigation
The crypto project has piqued the interest of more Argentina lawmakers.In mid-April, Romina Braga, another member of the Buenos Aires assembly, called for an official investigation into Worldcoin.Braga called on Axel Kicillof, the Governor of the Buenos Aires Province, to commission an investigation. She also voiced several privacy and data-related concerns.A Worldcoin retina scanner orb. (Source: Steve Jurvetson [CC By 2.0])This follows a move from the national data protection agency, which announced the launch of an investigation into Worldcoin in January this year.Puglelli’s bill calls for the creation of a “regulatory framework” that regulates biometric data collection and introduces punishments for any “abuse” of this data. He explained:“It is essential to adapt our legislation to meet the challenges posed by the digital era.”Regulator to Get Involved?
The bill, if adopted, would see the Provincial Directorate for the Defense of the Rights of Consumers and Users appointed as the “supervisor” of Worldcoin.The Directorate would be charged with “promoting fair and equitable consumer relations in the digital sphere, as well as trust and IT security.”The media outlet Criptonoticias reported that Worldcoin has been operating in Argentina “for more than a year.”It added that “thousands of citizens have transferred their biometric data to the Cayman Islands-based firm.”Will Lawmakers Get Their Way?
Both Puglelli and Braga have complained that “it is not clear” exactly “what Worldcoin does with iris-scanned data.”The lawmaker warned that Worldcoin “has no legal status in Argentina and is acquiring biometric data in a way that puts privacy at stake.”.It remains to be seen if the lawmakers’ warnings will dampen public enthusiasm.However, they do not appear to be alone. The Buenos Aires Ministry of Production, Science, and Technological Innovation says it has also investigated Worldcoin’s data protection credentials.Mexican lawmakers have also raised concerns. In Chile, another country with multiple data collection centers, government agents have inspected three Worldcoin-related addresses.Agents asked the firm to submit “additional information” to “ensure that Worldcoin is complying with national regulations.”Data-related concerns have disrupted Worldcoin iris-scanning efforts in European nations, including Spain, Germany, and France.Government agencies in East Asian nations such as South Korea and Hong Kong have also launched Worldcoin-related investigations.

If traders can reliably identify altcoin gems, they can make a lot of money.But the over-looked strategy of investing in presales can potentially net even higher gains if done correctly.Web3 projects/protocols often sell their native tokens at a discount to early investors to fund development.If investors can reliably identify projects that, thanks to their strong vision, use case and competent team, end up gaining traction in the market, they can make big profits.Knowing where to start is one of the biggest barriers to entry in the daunting presale market.That’s why Cryptonews put together a list of their top picks.20 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In

                        Crypto exchange Coinbase is planning to offer a Canadian dollar stablecoin on its platform shortly after receiving an official license to operate within Canada.In a Twitter update on Monday, the company said it had added QCAD (QCAD) to its listing roadmap – a CAD-pegged stablecoin that was “re-launched” by Canadian fintech firm Stablecorp last year.Canadian Dollar Stablecoin On Coinbase
Much like other popular stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), QCAD maintains its peg with full backing by reserves of equal or greater value to the number of tokens that have been issued.According to Stablecorp, these tokens are backed by cash and cash equivalents, with monthly attestation reports to verify their reserve status. Its latest attestation report in February 2024 said there were just 169,303.77 QCAD in circulation versus CAD $200,903.17 in Stablecorp’s reserves.That’s a small amount relative to stablecoin giants like USDT and USDC, which have over $140 billion USD worth of tokens combined spread throughout the crypto ecosystem.“Our goal is to list every asset possible that meets our standards for legal, compliance, and technical security,” Coinbase’s blog post on upcoming listings stated. “These standards do not take into account the market cap or popularity of a project.”As such, onboarding Coinbase – the largest crypto exchange in the United States and the only publicly traded firm of its kind – could be a boon for adoption.“With increased regulatory clarity from the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the timing is perfect to bring Canadians a transparent, efficient stablecoin,” said Stablecorp CEO Alex McDougall last year.Compliance With Canadian Regulators
Shortly after the collapse of FTX and Terra in 2022, the CSA issued guidance to crypto trading platforms, establishing a high bar for stablecoins or other pegged assets to receive listing. Stablecoins would require reserves of “highly liquid assets” with “qualified custodians,” and algorithmic stablecoins were completely ruled out.The strict guidance contributed to Kraken and Coinbase delisting USDT and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) from their platforms and to Binance moving out of the country entirely.Coinbase became the first international crypto exchange to gain registration as a “restricted dealer” in Canada last month, however, signaling its sufficient compliance with regulators.The company has often credited Canadian regulators with being cooperative with the crypto industry in ways that U.S. regulators are not. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, is currently suing Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance for securities law violations.“We’ve collaborated with Canadian banks, investment advisors, and pension funds to demonstrate our dedication to facilitating their successful navigation of the evolving digital asset realm,” the company wrote last month.

Stacks Price Prediction as STX Token Slides Under $2 – How Low Will STX Go?
                        As Bitcoin (BTC) corrects to its lowest levels in over two months below $60,000, its largest layer-2 scaling blockchain Stacks (STX) is also in decline, with the Stacks price hitting its lowest levels since mid-February below $2.0.The Stacks price has since bounced back to around $2.14, with STX now flat on the day.But it might not be long until STX breaks more forcefully to the downside of $2.06 and the $2.0 level.That’s because Stacks largely takes it cue from what Bitcoin is doing, as well as how altcoins are performing.And, as of now, pretty much the entire crypto space in a state of bearishness.Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have been negative now for five days, as per data presented by The Block.As per The Block, US ETFs have seen outflows now for five straight days.That’s not surprising given recent macro headwinds. While today’s Fed policy announcement didn’t contain any surprises, it reinforced the message that rate cuts remain some way off.The Fed has turned more hawkish recently due to inflation remaining uncomfortably high since the start of 2024.It’s no surprise then that the Bitcoin price, as well as altcoin markets, have suffered a correction.Here’s Where the Stacks Price Is Headed Next
So, risks seem tilted to the downside for Stacks (STX). The next major support level, assuming the January highs at $2.06 goes, is the 200DMA.The 200DMA currently resides just above $1.80. A break below here would send a significant bearish signal.The next major area of support that traders would target would be around $1.25.If Stacks was to fall 40% to here, its market cap would subside to under $2 billion.This could be a great time to load up on STX, which remains a major leader in Bitcoin layer-2 scaling.The Stacks price could slump all the way as low as $1.25 support.

Bitcoin's Historical Data Suggests A Potential 99% Surge, Says Crypto Analyst: 'Time To Buy The Dip!' - Benzinga

As the cryptocurrency market continues to experience turbulence, Bitcoin BTC/USD might be on the brink of a significant upswing, according to historical data.What Happened: Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto analyst, took to social media platform X to share a promising insight. Martinez highlighted the potential for a substantial Bitcoin surge, based on historical trends.“The last three times the #Bitcoin 30-day MVRV dropped below -9% in the last two years, the price of $BTC surged by 64%, 63%, and 99%, respectively. The #BTC 30-day MVRV is currently at -11.6%, suggesting it may be time to buy the dip!” Martinez wrote.The MVRV ratio, which divides an asset’s market capitalization by its realized capitalization, is a pivotal metric in the crypto space. A higher MVRV ratio typically indicates a greater potential profit, potentially leading to increased selling pressure.See Also: How Did Shiba Inu Become The ‘Dogecoin Killer?’ Crypto Whale Thinks ‘Its Mission’ And This One Factor Were KeyWhy It Matters: This insight comes at a time when the crypto market is facing significant challenges. On the same day, Bitcoin’s value dropped below $58,000, triggering losses for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum ETH/USD, Solana SOL/USD, and Dogecoin DOGE/USD.Moreover, crypto research firm 10x Research has predicted a further 20% drop in Bitcoin’s value, citing the differing risk management approaches between institutional investors and retail traders.However, if Martinez’s analysis holds true, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a remarkable recovery. This is particularly noteworthy in light of concerns raised by analysts about potential selling pressure from retail “degens” who bought Bitcoin ETFs at around $58,000.Price Action: Bitcoin is currently priced at $57,635, marking a 1.08% decrease over the last 24 hours. However, it has seen an impressive 30.48% increase since the beginning of the year, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Are Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Due A Bounce?

Crypto Witch-Hunt: Experts Criticize DOJ's Ver Indictment


								On Tuesday, the crypto industry was shaken after news of the indictment of one of a Bitcoin early investors broke. Per the reports, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) pressed multiple charges against Roger Ver, a controversial figure in the space known as “Bitcoin Jesus.”
Experts and figures within the community have expressed their sentiments about Ver’s arrestment, with some considering the US administration is on a “crypto witch-hunt.”

Was Roger Ver’s Indictment Celebrated?
On April 30, Roger Ver was detained by Spanish authorities on charges of tax evasion, mail fraud, and false tax returns. The indictment came the same day as former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao’s four-month sentence.
The prosecutors allege that Ver, who renounced his US citizenship in 2014, failed to report the gains from Bitcoin sales held by his US companies and consequently failed to pay the required taxes.
As a result, the “Bitcoin Jesus” is now being accused of causing a $48 million loss to the IRS, and the US is seeking his extradition from Spain.
After the news, several crypto experts and community members commented on the charges, some considering it a “good” thing. Bitcoin educator and investor Dan Held was among those who “celebrated” the detention.


In an X post, Held stated that Roger Ver has “been a negative for Bitcoin.” To the investor, Ver “misaligned expectations around Bitcoin so much that it led to a civil war. He deserves everything that he’s about to get.”
Some members of the crypto community partially agreed with Held’s sentiment. One X user considers Ver responsible for attempting to destroy Bitcoin during the “Blocksize War.”
DOJ Faces Backlash For “Overreaching” And Unclear Crypto Landscape
Overall, the sentiment leans against Roger Ver’s prosecution. To many, the DOJ’s actions are part of the US government’s efforts to target the crypto industry. 2024 US House candidate Jane Adams called the indictment “a blatant attack on dissent,” adding that the US administration’s “pursuit is fueled by vindictiveness, not justice.”
Similarly, founder and CEO of Layer Two Labs Paul Sztorc also expressed his concern: “Not exactly government via the consent of the governed…,” he stated in an X post.
According to crypto investor and expert Kim Dotcom, the charges against Ver “has nothing to do with tax evasion.” Instead, the crypto veteran considers that the US government is on a witch-hunt, “a malicious attempt to vilify Roger and to punish him for exposing and opposing the crimes of the US empire.”


The investor argues that at the time of the Bitcoin sales used for the indictment, the crypto industry was “the wild west of investing.” As a result, there were no clear regulations and guidance on the cryptocurrency’s legal status:

How do you assess the value of such an illiquid asset back in 2014? To now claim, a decade later, that Roger owes $50 million in taxes to the US Govt is ludicrous (…) It’s also a hopeless attempt to attach a value to something that was trading in a fragile, volatile and unregulated market in 2014.

The crypto community has widely discussed the US’s unclear and inconsistent regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Consensys’ recent demand against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) highlighted the contradictory guidance from the country’s regulators.
These contradictions have caused US congress members like Patrick McHenry to consider the SEC’s efforts to regulate “by enforcement” to be driven by an “arbitrary and capricious nature.” Ultimately, it urges “a clear regulatory framework and robust consumer protections for digital asset markets.”

MicroStrategy to launch Bitcoin-based decentralized ID solution

MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, has announced it will launch a decentralized identity solution on the Bitcoin network that uses Ordinal-based inscriptions to store and retrieve information.The solution — MicroStrategy Orange — was unveiled by MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor during the company’s Bitcoin For Corporations conference on May 1.MicroStrategy Orange is open-source, not dependent on sidechains and can process up to 10,000 decentralized identifiers in a single Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, Saylor claimed.“[Its aim is to] deliver trustless, tamper-proof, and long-lived decentralized identities using only the public Bitcoin blockchain as a data source,” according to an unofficial draft document of the solution shared by MicroStrategy on GitHub.The decentralized identifiers (DIDs) will allow pseudonymity in the same way that real-world identities are not tied to Bitcoin addresses and transactions.Saylor speaking at the Bitcoin For Corporations conference. Source: YouTubeMicroStrategy Orange comprises Orange Service, Orange SDK and Orange Applications. Orange Service allows users to issue DIDs to their personnel and deploy applications, while Orange SDK and Orange Applications provide customization tools to integrate specific services on mobile and desktop devices.One application already built by MicroStrategy is “Orange For Outlook,” which integrates digital signatures into emails to ensure recipients can verify the true identity of the sender.The onboarding process involves accepting an invitation email signed by MicroStrategy’s DID, which will then generate a unique DID, a public and private key pair for the user. The user’s DID and public key are inscribed on the Bitcoin network, and they can then start sending out invitations to their personnel to create their own digital identity.Flow diagram of how MicroStrategy’s Orange For Outlook application works.

Bitcoin Hits ‘Danger Zone’: Peter Schiff Warns Of 'Do or Die' Scenario


                            Bitcoin is facing a critical juncture as it has entered a ‘danger zone,’ according to prominent gold advocate Peter Schiff. This investor, known for his skepticism toward Bitcoin, suggests that the cryptocurrency is entering a “do or die” phase, potentially marking the end of its bullish run if current trends continue.
Breaking Points And Bearish Signals
Peter Schiff has often voiced his bearish outlook on Bitcoin, and his latest comments come as Bitcoin has just slipped below the crucial $60,000 mark.

This level had previously served as strong support during the short-term bull run, and its breach has intensified the bearish sentiment among investors. Schiff warns that staying below this threshold could spell doom for the bullish fervor, potentially derailing Bitcoin’s momentum.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $57,054, teetering close to its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Schiff points out that remaining below this EMA could confirm a bearish trend, signaling an end to the rally.
Amidst these developments, the market has seen an increase in trading volume, coupled with the price drop, indicating strong selling pressure.
Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s trading volume has dropped from $45 billion to $48 billion, coinciding with a 6.3% price dip during the same period. This heightened activity is a traditional bearish indicator, lending weight to Schiff’s prediction of a downturn.
Moreover, investor sentiment is treading thin ice with significant outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs, hitting a weekly high of $162 million. This departure of funds is particularly poignant as it unfolds just before the FOMC meeting, where potential interest rate hikes are on the agenda.
These outflows reflect a broader market trend, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experiencing a substantial daily outflow of $93.23 million.

The Bitcoin ETF Conundrum And Market Forecasts
It is worth noting that last month was quite challenging for US Bitcoin ETFs. After a promising start with positive inflows in the initial months following their launch, April witnessed collective outflows amounting to $182 million across all active spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.

This pullback is attributed to macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions, which have clouded the investment landscape.

As the market braces for further turbulence, analysts such as Micheal Van de Poppe are forecasting an additional correction, potentially pushing Bitcoin’s price down to $55,000 before any sign of recovery.

Senator Lummis Challenges US Crackdown On Crypto Market, Vows To Protect Investor’s Rights | Bitcoinist.com


								In the face of growing global regulatory pressure on the crypto industry, the Biden administration’s intensified crackdown and the actions of regulatory bodies have prompted Senator Cynthia Lummis to issue a strong statement against the US government’s stance on the industry. 
Senator Lummis, a prominent supporter of Bitcoin and the overall crypto market, has advocated for the companies and players involved in the ongoing regulatory pressure.
Lummis Condemns DOJ’s “Hyper-Aggressive” Stance
Lummis expressed deep concern and opposed the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) “hyper-aggressive” argument that non-custodial software could be classified as a money transmission service. 
The Senator deemed this stance contradictory to existing Treasury guidance, lacking common sense, and violating the rule of law. 

Lummis further emphasized that arguments against self-custody software pose a threat to fundamental property rights that are intrinsic to being an American. 
Lummis asserted her commitment to fighting for individuals’ rights to hold their keys and operate their nodes, expressing her dismay at the Biden administration’s criminalization of the core tenets of the Bitcoin (BTC) network and decentralized finance (DeFi).
Senator Lummis had previously disapproved of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) escalated crackdown on the crypto industry throughout 2023. 
Criticizing the SEC’s actions as “unnecessary” and “overreaching,” she specifically opposed the agency’s controversial new crypto policy, known as “Staff Accounting Bulletin 121,” issued in March 2022. 
Lummis had also filed an amicus brief in support of the Coinbase exchange against the SEC’s lawsuit, arguing that Congress should be responsible for formulating crypto regulations rather than the SEC. 
The pro-crypto Senator contended that the SEC had exceeded its mandate by attempting to classify almost all crypto assets as “securities,” thus infringing on Congress’s legislative authority and extending beyond the agency’s jurisdiction.
Clear Guidelines For Crypto Regulation
In another statement supporting key players in the crypto market, Senator Lummis called for immediate action to establish clear regulatory guidelines in response to Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling that XRP should not be considered a security. 

At the core of the debate is the Howey Test, a legal standard used to determine whether an investment qualifies as a security. Lummis has emphasized the importance of preserving the integrity of this test while acknowledging the need to apply it appropriately to digital assets.
To address these issues, Senator Lummis, in collaboration with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, has introduced the Lummis-Gillibrand bill. The legislation aims to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets like XRP, aligning their treatment with the interpretation of the Howey Test as established by the Southern District of New York.

Bitcoin Tops Returns In All Asset Classes Amid 'Repeatedly Disappointing Inflation Data': Mohamed El-Erian Shares Insights On Market Volatility - Benzinga

Renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian shared a comprehensive table of financial returns for major assets and asset classes, highlighting the volatility of the market in April.What Happened: El-Erian, in his post on X, acknowledged the challenging market conditions in April, despite the solid year-to-date returns. He noted the significant repricing of Fed cuts due to consistently disappointing inflation data.“While April proved to be the toughest month so far in 2024 for some of them, the year-to-date returns remain solid overall — especially given the extent to which markets have repriced their expectations of Fed cuts in response to repeatedly disappointing inflation data,” El-Erian wrote. He shared a table, covering the performance of major indices from 2020 to Apr. 30, which shows diverse results across different asset classes and regions. Notably, Bitcoin BTC/USD has been the top performer in all asset classes.The indices covered include the DJIA, S&P 500, Nasdaq, Stoxx Euro 600, FTSE 100 Index, Shanghai Composite Index, NIKKEI 225 Index, Gold, Oil, and Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s journey has been particularly volatile, with a 303.95% surge in 2020, followed by a 64.21% drop in 2022. However, it made a strong comeback in 2023 with a 153.32% gain. As of Apr. 30, its year-to-date performance stands at a solid 39.09%, demonstrating its resilience amidst market fluctuations.See Also: Is The ‘Memecoin Supercycle’ Over? Mad Crypto Alpha With IvanWhy It Matters: El-Erian’s insights come at a time when the Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates steady, emphasizing the need to allow more time for restrictive monetary policies to bring inflation towards the Fed's 2% goal. This decision has had a significant impact on market dynamics."The inflation data received so far this year have been higher than expected," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said today, adding that it is likely that gaining greater confidence in disinflation will take longer than previously thought.Addressing concerns about potential rate hikes due to recent inflationary pressures, Powell said: "I think it's unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike. We'd need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2% overtime. That's not what we think we're seeing."Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s historical data suggests a potential 99% surge, according to a prominent crypto analyst. This insight, combined with El-Erian’s observations, underscores the complex dynamics at play in the current market.Price Action: Bitcoin is currently priced at $57,635, marking a 1.08% decrease over the last 24 hours. However, it has seen an impressive 30.48% increase since the beginning of the year, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: ‘Spectacular Meme Runs’ Mean These Three Altcoins Could Be ‘Doomed To Irrelevancy,’ Muses Veteran TraderImage Via Wikimedia CommonsThis content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

Four Solana Memecoins That Could Rally Over 8,000% and Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two dog-themed memecoins that went viral and delivered massive gains to early investors.



Solana memecoins have been attracting huge investment from retail crypto investors in recent weeks, as early investors hope to generate similar returns to early Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) buyers.




However, with hundreds of new memecoins being launched every day – and most of them being almost immediately rugpulled – it can be difficult to decide which coins to invest in.



In this article, we list four newly launched Solana memecoins that could potentially deliver astronomical returns to early investors, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did.

How to Buy Solana Memecoins



Solana memecoins, like the coins listed above, usually cannot be purchased on centralized exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.



Instead, they are purchased via decentralized Solana exchanges, like Raydium or Jupiter. 



This is done by connecting your Solflare, Phantom or MetaMask wallet to the exchange, and swapping Solana for the token by entering its contract address in the receiving field.

Shibarium's Transaction Fees Skyrocket 500% Amid Surging Network Activity



                    

Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain tailored for the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, has witnessed a dramatic 500% increase in transaction fees within a 24-hour period, as shown by Shibariumscan data. 



Fees paid in BONE, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, escalated from 12 BONE to 61.47 BONE. 




Shibarium’s core functionality involves processing Shiba Inu token transfers, with BONE tokens utilized to pay for transaction costs. 



Each transaction also aids in reducing the supply of SHIB tokens, as a part of the BONE fees is converted to SHIB and then removed from circulation by being sent to a “dead wallet.”



The sharp rise in Shibarium’s fees is primarily linked to a surge in network activity, driven by increasing popularity and demand for Shiba Inu tokens during recent market fluctuations and growing investor interest. 



Shibariumscan also highlighted a significant 211% increase in active accounts on the platform, rising from 1,724 to 3,650.

Despite this, the number of new accounts actually declined, suggesting that the increased activity primarily came from existing users.



The recent developments pose several questions regarding the future of the Shiba Inu network. 




Observers are keen to understand how this uptick in fees might influence further activity within the ecosystem. 



Questions also arise about Shibarium’s capacity to handle continued demand without compromising on efficiency and scalability. 




Additionally, the impact of these changes on SHIB and BONE tokens is of particular interest, especially given the current instability in the broader cryptocurrency market dominated by bearish sentiment.



This scenario highlights the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets, where user behavior and technological capabilities continuously interact to shape the landscape. 



The developments in Shibarium and Shiba Inu will be closely watched as they provide insights into user engagement, technological adaptability, and market trends in the cryptocurrency space.

Bitcoin 4% dip may ‘panic’ short-term holders as price falls below average cost

Bitcoin is now trading below the average purchase price paid by short-term holders, potentially causing “panic” due to unrealized losses, according to an on-chain analyst.“These recent buyers are statistically the most likely to panic,” analyst James Check, known as “Checkmatey,” said in a May 1 report.“What a nuke we have on our hands to open the month of May,” Check added, referring to Bitcoin (BTC) briefly plummeting 8% below a key support level to $56,814 on May 1, according to CoinMarketCap data.The recent price drop saw Bitcoin hit its lowest level since February, which is significant for short-term Bitcoin holders — those who have held for under 155 days — as they paid an average price of $59,600 per Bitcoin.Even though the price has slightly recovered to $57,631 at the time of publication, short-term holders still hold an average 3% unrealized loss.Bitcoin’s price at the time of writing represents a decline of 4% in the past 24 hours. The sharp downturn led to the liquidation of $100.27 million in long positions over that time, according to CoinGlass data.Its price decline was driven by a crypto sell-off as market participants awaited the United States Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, which kept the current high interest rates unchanged, as analysts expected.Bitcoin’s price briefly plummeted to its lowest price in three months on May 1. Source: CoinMarketCapCheck suggested that while holding an unrealized loss is not ideal, short-term Bitcoin holders have experienced this before.“Most importantly, breaking the [short-term holder] cost basis isn’t the end of the world, nor the end of the bull market. It doesn’t help…but it is and has been recoverable,” he wrote.Related: Bitcoin sub-$60K levels in focus after daily crypto liquidations near $300MThe short-term holder cost basis typically acts as support during bull periods and resistance during bear periods, explained crypto trading resource On-Chain College in a May 1 X post.However, it pointed to a few potential events that will not signal “the bull market is over.”A “quick move” to $59,600, roughly 2.2% above Bitcoin’s current price, would be “bullish,” the On-Chain College claimed.This is based on a similar pattern in June 2023, when the price dropped below cost basis and quickly rebounded before a significant upswing.Bitcoin’s price breaks below the short-term holder cost basis. Source: CheckonchainOn-Chain College also noted that when Bitcoin’s price pulled back a few months later, in August 2023, it stayed volatile below the short-term cost basis for some time. This suggests that a “sustained period” below the cost basis could also signal a bullish trend, according to On-chain College.Magazine: Memecoins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Uniswap, the SEC and Regulatory Riptide - What DeFi Must Do Next - The Daily Hodl


								
 
DeFi (decentralized finance) has been nothing short of a revolution. Its startling promise – to upend traditional financial systems and usher in an era of unprecedented accessibility, transparency and autonomy.
From humble beginnings, this new ecosystem has undergone explosive growth, now boasting a fervent global following and billions in investment.
Naturally, as the DeFi juggernaut has gained momentum, it has also drawn both the watchful eye of regulators and the attention of nefarious actors.
The U.S. SEC’s (Securities and Exchange Commission) recent decision to issue a Wells notice to Uniswap, one of the industry’s pioneering decentralized exchanges – alleging violations of securities laws – has sent shockwaves through the DeFi community.
This regulatory crackdown, coupled with a string of high-profile hacks and exploits that have drained projects of millions in funds, has cast a pall of uncertainty over the future of the sector.
In a maelstrom of innovation, regulation and security risks, the ecosystem stands at a precipice.
The decisions made and actions taken by industry leaders, developers and regulatory bodies in the coming years will shape the trajectory of the movement, determining whether it will fulfill its promise of disrupting traditional finance or succumb to the very forces it seeks to supplant.
SEC crackdown on Uniswap
In a rather zealous attempt to assert regulatory control, the SEC has set its sights on Uniswap, one of DeFi’s trailblazers.
The allegations – that it has facilitated the trading of unregistered securities, specifically tokens issued through ICOs (initial coin offerings) – paint the platform as an unregistered securities broker and exchange.
However, this narrative conveniently ignores the decentralized nature of the protocol.
While Uniswap Labs developed the front-end interface, the underlying protocol operates autonomously, without any centralized control or oversight.
This fundamental distinction seems to have escaped the SEC’s understanding.
By targeting a project like Uniswap, which has been a driving force behind the DeFi revolution, the SEC risks stifling innovation and undermining the very principles that make DeFi so revolutionary.
If the SEC’s overreach is not curtailed, the implications for the broader DeFi ecosystem could be far-reaching.
Projects that have embraced transparency and community governance may find themselves in the crosshairs, deterring further innovation and driving developers and users away from the United States.
Regulatory challenges and security vulnerabilities
As the SEC tightens its grip, DeFi platforms and protocols face a multitude of regulatory hurdles beyond the Uniswap debacle.
However, the regulatory challenges pale in comparison to the existential threat posed by the wave of hacks and exploits plaguing the ecosystem.
The inherent transparency of open-source protocols – once heralded as a strength – has become a double-edged sword, exposing vulnerabilities to nefarious actors who can meticulously dissect the code.
The staggering losses suffered by DeFi projects, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, serve as a sobering reminder of the grave consequences of security lapses.
The Munchables exploit, which saw a rogue developer abscond with over $62 million in funds, underscores the risks associated with the pseudonymous nature of DeFi development teams.
The incident highlights the overall need for more due diligence, especially around hiring personnel.
While the ethos of decentralization and immutability are noble ideals, they can hinder the ability to respond effectively to security breaches.
Calls for interventions and chain rollbacks in the wake of such incidents highlight the tension between user protection and the core principles of DeFi.
Addressing security and navigating compliance
As the DeFi ecosystem grapples with a seemingly unending barrage of hacks and exploits, stringent security measures have become an existential necessity.
The industry’s reliance on cutting-edge yet inherently complex smart contract technology has exposed vulnerabilities that can be exploited by skilled adversaries.
To chart a path toward a more secure future, DeFi projects must embrace a holistic approach to security that permeates every aspect of development and deployment.
Rigorous audits, conducted by seasoned cybersecurity professionals, must become the norm.
Penetration testing should be a continuous process, proactively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.
Moreover, the industry must wholeheartedly embrace bug bounty programs, incentivizing ethical hackers to uncover weaknesses in exchange for substantial rewards.
Ultimately, the path to a secure DeFi future hinges on striking a delicate balance between innovation and risk management.
While the allure of decentralization is undeniable, its principles must be tempered by a pragmatic recognition of real-world threats that imperil user funds and erode trust in the ecosystem.
In the wake of the SEC’s crackdown, it has become increasingly evident that the industry can no longer afford to operate in a regulatory vacuum.
The commission’s actions underscore the pressing need for the DeFi ecosystem to proactively engage with regulators and collaborate on establishing industry-wide standards.
By actively participating in the regulatory discourse, DeFi pioneers have an opportunity to shape the rules of engagement, ensuring that any frameworks or guidelines imposed are tailored to the unique characteristics of DeFi.
This collaborative approach not only mitigates the risk of stifling overregulation but also enhances the legitimacy and credibility of the industry in the eyes of the public and traditional financial institutions.
Essentials for the road ahead
As the DeFi ecosystem navigates the turbulent waters of regulatory scrutiny and security breaches, it finds itself at a pivotal crossroads.
The SEC’s crackdown on Uniswap has crystallized the urgent need for DeFi projects to prioritize not only innovation but also regulatory compliance.
By proactively engaging with regulators and collaborating on the establishment of industry-wide standards, the ecosystem can shape the rules of engagement, ensuring that oversight is tailored to the unique characteristics of decentralized finance.
Yet, amid these challenges, lies a remarkable opportunity for the DeFi ecosystem to redefine the boundaries of financial innovation.
By striking a delicate balance between decentralization and user protection, transparency and oversight, the industry can harness the transformative potential of blockchain technology while safeguarding the interests of participants and fostering trust among the broader public.
The road ahead is arduous, but the rewards of success are immense.
By embracing a spirit of collaboration – both within the industry and with regulatory bodies – DeFi pioneers can catalyze a paradigm shift in finance, ushering in a new era of inclusivity, autonomy and transparency.
Ultimately, the future of DeFi hinges on the industry’s ability to navigate these challenges with resilience, foresight and an unwavering commitment to its core principles.
Only then can the true potential of this revolutionary technology be realized, empowering individuals and communities worldwide to take control of their financial destinies.

SEC and Terraform Will Discuss Proposed Remedies on May 22


							

Terraform Labs challenges the huge $5.3 billion penalty imposed by the SEC in the legal case.



The firm requests the court for a lower penalty of $1 million arguing that Terraform’s most of the stablecoins were sold overseas.



Judge Jed Rakoff orders the lawyers representing Terraform and the SEC to assemble in the court on May 22.




According to a recent Bloomberg report, Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, challenged the huge $5.3 billion penalty proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the lawsuit. Claiming that most of the firm’s stablecoins were sold overseas, the company requested the court to charge a significantly lower penalty of $1 million.



On April 5, a jury found Do Kwon liable for the collapse of the collapse of Terraform, which wiped out $40 billion in investor assets, leading to a severe crypto winter. While Kwon and Terraform were found guilty of defrauding investors regarding the sale of TerraUSD (UST), Luna (LUNA), and wLUNA, the regulators sought approximately $4.7 billion in disgorgement and prejudgment interest from them. In addition, the SEC charged a total of $520 million in civil penalties.









However, Terraform pleaded the court not to grant “any injunctive relief of disgorgement,”  arguing that the regulators failed to prove that it is “entitled to the expansive injunction and monetary sanctions it seeks.” Also, the platform stated that the proposed fines would have to be obtained from the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), an entity not involved in the civil case. The court filing read, “.




“In conclusion, the Court should not grant any injunctive relief or disgorgement, and should impose at most a $1 million civil penalty against TFL.” 




In an April 29 filing, Judge Jed Rakoff of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered that the SEC, Kwon, and Terraform Labs’ lawyers assemble in the court on May 22 to discuss the proposed remedies.

How did Bitcoin's price react to Fed meeting, unchanged interest rates? - AMBCrypto



US Fed left interest rate unchanged again, citing “lack of further progress” on 2% inflation target.
BTC remains under pressure despite a modest flip after the Fed meeting. 

Bitcoin [BTC] eased its two-day bleeding streak after the Fed meeting. As expected, the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on 1st May. 
This marks the sixth Fed meeting at which the agency kept the rate at 5.25% – 5.50%. However, the Fed noted that rate cuts are not appropriate until there is greater confidence that inflation is heading to 2%. 
Part of the Fed’s policy statement read, 
“In recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.”
In a later press conference, Fed chair Jerome Powell was asked whether there would be three rate cuts later in the year. To which Powell responded, 
“We didn’t see progress in the first quarter; it appears then that it’s going to take longer to reach that level of confidence.” 
In a nutshell, “the higher rates for longer” stance seems officially back. 
Bitcoin saw a modest flip as memecoins led a short recovery
Within an hour after the Fed rate decision, memecoins led a slight recovery. Bonk [BONK], Floki Inu [FLOKI], and dogwifhat [WIF] recovered by 6%. 
BTC and Ethereum [ETH] recorded a modest flip within the same period. 
In the past two days, BTC has slumped hard, shedding over 12% from a high of $64.7K to a low of $56.5K. This extended BTC’s April losses into May and underscored a tough Q2.  
After the Fed statement, BTC reclaimed $58K but dropped lower a few minutes later, denoting that it was still under immense sell pressure.  
ETH also saw a modest uptick but faced rejection at the $3000 level at the time of writing. 
With the Fed’s “higher for longer” stance and negative flows from US BTC ETFs, it will be interesting to see if BTC could reclaim the range-low around $60.8K.

DeFi lending giant Aave unveils V4 protocol overhaul

Aave Labs, the firm behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave has outlined a proposal for an upgrade and evolution of its protocol as part of a five-year roadmap.On May 1, the DeFi lending platform introduced a governance proposal to get community feedback on upgrading the protocol to its next-generation version 4.The proposal also includes “major upgrades and expansions,” to the Aave Network, a cross-chain liquidity layer, non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer-1 deployments, and a “fresh new visual identity,” the team stated. Aave V4 would be built on a “completely new architecture” and include a “Unified Liquidity Layer” to enable better integration of features like isolation pools, risk modules, and its native stablecoin GHO.Other proposed features are interest rates that can automatically adjust on the fly based on market conditions and using Chainlink data oracles. Also suggested were Liquidity Premiums to adjust borrowing costs based on collateral risk profiles and vaults and smart accounts for simplified user management of positions. Proposed Unified Liquidity Layer infrastructure for liquidity providing. Source: AavePart of the proposal focused on Aave’s algorithmic stablecoin GHO which was launched in July 2023 but is a minnow compared to its competitors such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) with a market capitalization of $49 million.GHO-related suggestions include improvements to the liquidation engine such as variable liquidation bonuses and “soft” liquidations, along with better integration of GHO such as options to earn interest.An emergency redemption mechanism for GHO depegging scenarios was also proposed as part of the big upgrade. The proposal is currently in the “temperature check” phase which provides a signal on community sentiment prior to moving toward an on-chain vote. It outlines a development timeline stretching from research completion in Q2, 2024 to a full V4 release by mid-2025.Related: Aave launches proposal to counter MakerDAO DAI expansion riskAave Labs is requesting a grant with a budget of 15 million GHO and 25,000 stkAAVE, worth around $17 million combined for the execution of the first year of the three-year plan.

MicroStrategy Introduces Orange: A Bitcoin-Based DID Protocol


MicroStrategy, a US-based business intelligence and software company, has introduced a new decentralized identification protocol named Orange. This innovative protocol was unveiled at the annual MicroStrategy World event in Las Vegas on May 1.
Orange stands out by employing a novel method of using inscriptions as Ordinals on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain to store data related to decentralized identities (DID). The protocol utilizes the Segregated Witness (SegWit) feature of Bitcoin. It also enables documents to be created and updated with minimal restrictions on size and content.
Why is MicroStrategy’s Orange Different from Other DID Solutions?
During a segment called “Bitcoin Security,” Michael Saylor, co-founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, explained the idea behind Orange protocol.

“Our vision is to provide an internet native decentralized digital identity backed by Bitcoin. So, we want to use the open standard of DID, and we want to use the open standard of Bitcoin and put the two together … Why would we use Bitcoin? Well, it is fault tolerance, it is censorship resistance, it does use the most advanced cryptography, it’s a lot better than most people’s taskwork managers and this federated system. It is distributed … It’s open, permisionless, egalitarian, ” Saylor said.

Furthermore, Saylor highlighted that the protocol ensures that the decentralized identities are managed efficiently, reducing transaction fees and block space utilization—which are common concerns in blockchain operations. Yet, it is still unclear when MicroStrategy will officially launch the Orange protocol.
Based on the information on their “unofficial draft” on Github, the technological foundation of Orange is based on Bitcoin’s inscription. Orange embeds DID information directly on the blockchain, unlike other DID methods that rely on external data sources or additional dependencies. This method secures data permanence and integrity while enhancing the digital identities’ overall functionality and forward compatibility.
For instance, the Bitcoin Reference DID method (did:btcr) relies on referencing a URL to fetch DID document data. Such reliance can compromise the blockchain’s immutable nature if the URL content changes. In contrast, Orange stores additional data for the DID document directly on-chain.
Additionally, ION (did:ion) requires indexing all the IPFS data pointed to by Bitcoin transactions, which introduces more external dependencies. Orange’s use of taproot script path reveal transactions allows for storing arbitrary amounts of data in the witness of Bitcoin transactions through inscriptions. Therefore, Orange can avoid these dependencies.
Moreover, Orange enhances the security measures by distinguishing between the “wallet keys” used to sign Bitcoin transactions on-chain and the “subject keys” that authenticate the DID subject. This separation allows a third party to manage a DID on behalf of its subject or require multiple signatures. Hence, it offers an extra layer of security and control.

This move demonstrated MicroStrategy’s continuous support and involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Earlier in February, Saylor said the firm was pivoting to a Bitcoin development strategy.

“We view ourselves as a Bitcoin development company. That means we’re going to do everything we can to grow the Bitcoin network,” he said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings webinar on February 6.

MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition further solidified its long-term vision towards Bitcoin. BeInCrypto reported that MicroStrategy purchased an additional 122 BTC this April, totaling $7.8 million.
The transaction increases MicroStrategy’s holdings to 214,400 BTC, now valued at over $12.35 billion. With its holdings amount, MicroStrategy positions itself as a major player with over 1% of the finite 21 million Bitcoin supply.

However, these positive developments have not yet immediately impacted MicroStrategy’s stock price (MSTR). As of May 1, the closing price of MSTR was $1,065.03. Nevertheless, over a longer time frame, MSTR has been up about 180% this year, rising from $685.15 on January 2 to reaching its peak of $1,919.16 on March 27.

US Lawmakers Introduce New Bill For Clarification on Taxation of Staking Rewards


                        
                            US Lawmakers Introduce New Bill For Clarification on Taxation of Staking Rewards

                        Two bipartisan U.S. lawmakers, Representatives Drew Ferguson and Wiley Nickel, have proposed the Providing Tax Clarity for Digital Assets Act to address taxation issues related to block rewards earned by crypto miners. The bill aims to clarify the tax treatment of staking rewards, proposing that they should only be taxed at the time of their sale rather than upon acquisition. This move seeks to prevent double taxation and provide much-needed clarity for investors and businesses in the digital asset industry.Crypto Taxation Through Staking RewardsRepresentative Ferguson emphasized the complexity of the current tax treatment of digital asset rewards, highlighting the confusion it causes among investors and the potential for American businesses to relocate overseas due to regulatory uncertainty.“The United States has long been the leader in innovation and technology yet is falling behind our foreign counterparts in providing tax clarity for the emerging digital asset industry. The United States’ treatment of digital asset rewards is overly complex – leading to confusion by investors, double taxation, and American businesses relocating overseas,” said Ferguson.The proposed legislation aims to establish clear tax guidelines for block rewards from proof-of-work and proof-of-stake networks, aligning taxation with the sale or spending of these rewards rather than their acquisition.The move comes in response to recent IRS rulings and the landscape of digital assets taxation. The bill seeks to provide much-needed clarity and fairness in tax treatment, ensuring that block rewards are taxed only once, at the time of their sale or exchange. This initiative reflects growing bipartisan efforts to address regulatory challenges in the digital asset space and foster innovation within the United States. Even Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, called the legislation “right on point” for providing adequate guidance.Stablecoin Legislation Bill Still Pending
According to a Democratic aide on Capitol Hill, proposed stablecoin legislation is unlikely to be attached to the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) reauthorization bill. Despite efforts by Representatives Maxine Waters and Patrick McHenry, leaders in both the Senate and the House of Representatives are hesitant to merge stablecoin legislation with the FAA bill, which is considered a must-pass piece of legislation.While combining the two bills would be unprecedented in financial services policy, lawmakers typically add less popular legislation to larger bills to garner bipartisan support.The Digital Chamber’s chief policy officer, Cody Carbone, expressed scepticism about the likelihood of stablecoin legislation passing before the U.S. presidential election, giving it only a 35% chance. Carbone highlighted the ongoing debate surrounding key issues such as regulatory oversight and state-level regulation, which have hindered the progress of stablecoin bills like Representative Patrick McHenry’s Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act.

                        Crypto-related phishing attacks have become “rampant” in South Korea, a report has claimed, with a top financial regulator set to act.Per Namdo Ilbo, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) will team up with the nation’s biggest crypto exchanges to create promotional materials. The regulator wants to boost public awareness of common crypto scams.Crypto Phishing Attacks ‘Rampant’ – FSS Prepares Response
On April 29, the FSS announced plans to publish a “casebook” of case studies and “tips.” The regular said it hopes this will help citizens identify and avoid crypto-related fraud.The FSS said that the casebook contained an analysis of 2,209 reports of crypto-related phishing attacks logged from January to April.The regulator said that the reports had been processed by the nation’s Virtual Asset-related Investment Fraud Reporting Center.The data shows that chat app-based crypto “reading rooms” have become a hotbed of crypto phishing schemes.Almost 27 of all the 2,209 reports originated from these open channels, ostensibly set up as knowledge-sharing resources for South Korean crypto enthusiasts.Police have shut down multiple rings operating “reading rooms”-type scams in recent years.Fake Exchanges Target South Korean Crypto Enthusiasts
Some 19% of the cases, meanwhile, were related to “unregistered” or bogus crypto exchanges.The regulator explained that it had identified seven overarching themes in the most recent phishing report, namely:
Prompting victims to send coins to bogus crypto exchanges
Romance scams, whereby catfished victims are encouraged to “invest in crypto projects together”
Fake token lock-ups
NFT-related fraud
Scams whereby fraudsters impersonate crypto exchange employees
Scams whereby fraudsters pose as vendors of bona fide cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC)
Scams that originate on chat app-based crypto “reading rooms”
Case Studies Show Devastating Effects
The regulator’s case studies include the story of a citizen who received an Instagram direct message from an individual claiming to be a pilot based in the United States.After developing a “romantic relationship,” the “pilot” said that they had earned a considerable amount of money by investing in crypto.The “pilot” would regularly send the victim photos of luxury goods supposedly bought with these crypto trading profits.The victim then agreed to “invest” a small amount of money, which accrued a modest “profit.”Then the victim agreed to take out a bank loan worth around $217,000. They then used this money to buy cryptoassets.The “pilot” instructed the victim to send the coins to a “crypto exchange,” which turned out to be bogus.When the victim tried to “withdraw” the coins from the “exchange,” they realized that they had been duped.The FSS said that it would publish the casebook on its website and would also provide printouts to “the financially vulnerable” at senior welfare centers.The headquarters of the Financial Supervisory Service in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Wikiwater2020 [CC BY-SA 3.0])The regulator said that groups “such as the elderly” were particularly at risk. Government bodies have issued similar warnings in Japan.FSS spokespeople said they would also distribute the casebook at employment support centers and metropolitan local government centers “across the country.” An official said:“If you suspect that you have fallen victim to an investment fraud similar to the case listed in the casebook, please report this to the FSS immediately. Alternatively, please contact the police and request assistance.”The media outlet noted that the FSS was working on the project with the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA).DAXA comprises the exchanges Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, all of which have permits to offer KRW trading in South Korea.And DAXA said it plans to post the casebook and educational videos on phishing protection on its members’ social media channels.Late last year, the body said it would work with financial regulators to hunt down “undeclared crypto operators.”

Solana to Avalanche: Tracking the memecoin frenzy across networks - AMBCrypto



Avalanche’s daily memecoin transaction count hit 10k twice in March.
The memecoin frenzy subsided significantly on Avalanche, aligning with the drop in Solana’s numbers.

As the market remained awestruck by the scale of memecoin activity on networks such as Solana [SOL] and Base, another prominent layer-1 (L1) blockchain was quietly rising through the ranks.
Avalanche very much in the race
According to on-chain analyst Alex, Avalanche [AVAX] witnessed significant speculation around these community coins in the last two months.
The Dune Analytics dashboard prepared by him showed daily transaction count topping 10,000 twice in March, with substantial volumes also seen in early April.
Source: Dune Analytics
Additionally, the number of users actively participating in these transactions also surged, ripping past 4,000 on two occasions in March. Note that this was also the time when Solana was exploding with memecoin frenzy.
The most popular among the meme tokens was Coq Inu [COQ], a chicken-themed coin. It has maintained a 40%-60% share of all meme currency transactions on the network.
In fact, at the peak of the frenzy in March, it had pumped more than 4x in a span of two weeks, AMBCrypto noted using CoinMarketCap data. At press time though, the token was nursing losses.
As seen in the graph above, the frenzy subsided significantly as April progresses, which aligned with the cool-off witnessed in the case of Solana.
The Avalanche foundation, the developer of the Avalanche chain, started making strategic investments in memecoins, seeing their upside potential. Apart from COQ, some of the other coins selected for investments were Kimbo (KIMBO) and Gecko (GEC).

Realistic or not, here’s AVAX market cap in BTC’s terms

How memecoins could help AVAX
Higher meme coin speculation could increase deflationary pressure on the ecosystem’s native token AVAX, as Avalanche burns all the revenue it generates from transaction fees.
Meanwhile, AVAX, was trading 1.5% lower at press time, a situation slightly better than most leading coins in the market.

MicroStrategy Launches Orange Protocol- MicroStrategy Orange


							

MicroStrategy announces the launch of MicroStrategy, a decentralized identity solution using Bitcoin blockchain.



During the MicroStrategy World 2024 event in Las Vegas, Michael Saylor hinted at the platform’s plan to launch the Orange protocol.



The firm envisions ensuring a secure and efficient management of digital identities through UTXOs.




MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC), has recently announced the launch of MicroStrategy Orange, a decentralized identity solution using the Bitcoin blockchain. The platform introduced MicroStrategy Orange during the Bitcoin for Corporations segment at the MicroStrategy World 2024 event in Las Vegas.



At the event, MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor put forward an interesting question, “Wouldn’t it be great if instead of a blue check, green check, etc., there was an orange check that was a global standard?” He added that such an idea of decentralized identity with Bitcoin would be realized through MicroStrategy.







A Bitcoin proponent, Dylan LeClair, took to X to share insights on MicroStrategy’s Orange protocol. Explaining the protocol’s use of Bitcoin DID, he wrote, “The Bitcoin Inscription DID method (did:btc) uses inscriptions in witness data to store and manage DIDs, leveraging UTXOs for DID control.”







Reportedly, MicroStrategy Orange envisions ensuring the secure and efficient management of digital identities through unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). In addition, the protocol aims to reduce transaction fees and block space.









Saylor highlighted their vision of introducing an “internet native decentralized digital identity backed by Bitcoin” in a segment called Bitcoin Security. Further, he elaborated on the preference for Bitcoin over any other blockchains, stating,




“Well, it [Bitcoin] is fault tolerance, it is censorship resistance, it does use the most advanced cryptography, it’s a lot better than most people’s taskwork managers and this federated system. It is distributed … It’s open, permisionless, egalitarian.”




The news comes on the heels of MicroStrategy’s financial report of 2024 Q1, which marked a loss of $53.1 million. However, the report also revealed a gross profit of $85.2 million in the first quarter, representing a 74.0% gross margin.

Bitcoin’s dominance ‘likely peaked’ as altcoins ’start to wake up’ - Analyst

Bitcoin’s market share has dipped slightly, leading crypto analysts to speculate that it may have reached its peak as traders shift their focus to altcoins.“Bitcoin dominance has likely peaked,” founder of trading firm MNTrading Michaël van de Poppe claimed in a May 1 X post while explaining that “the bottom for altcoins is likely in.”“Altcoins start to wake up in their Bitcoin pairs, which means that the rotation is started,” he added.A drop in Bitcoin (BTC) dominance can signal to market participants that a potential altcoin market upswing is on the horizon as investors shift their capital from Bitcoin — considered a more stable store of value in the crypto market — to altcoins, which tend to experience more volatility.“Bitcoin dominance is now losing major support,” added crypto trader Matthew Hyland, indicating that he will wait for the weekly close before confirming or denying “the breakdown.”Bitcoin’s dominance — measuring Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization — is 53.90%, down 1.75% over the past seven days but still up 4.63% since the start of 2024, according to TradingView data.Bitcoin’s dominance hit its year-to-date peak on April 14 at 56.42. Source: TradingView“Bitcoin Dominance dropping. If the price continues to chop for a few months, alts could take advantage. A lot of alts holding up surprisingly well today,” trading team IncomeSharks wrote in a May 1 post on X.Solana’s (SOL), Pepe (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) are slightly up over the past 24 hours at 2.76%, 3.04%, and 3.25%, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap data.The decrease in market share comes as Bitcoin’s price fell by 10.44% over the same seven-day period.Bitcoin’s price is down 4.89% over the past 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCapHowever, the current market sentiment casts doubt on speculations that Bitcoin’s dominance has peaked. Rising fear levels indicate market uncertainty and could drive traders to reallocate funds back into Bitcoin rather than riskier crypto assets.Related: Bitcoin price loses $60K support to hit 2-month lowsAccording to The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, May 1 reflects the highest level of fear among crypto market investors since the beginning of the year.On May 1, the index score — which represents the emotional sentiment of the market — fell to a “fear” level of 43, down from the previous day's “neutral” score of 54.

MicroStrategy unveils Bitcoin-based decentralized identity protocol with Ordinals-inspired technique - Crypto Briefing




MicroStrategy has announced the development of a decentralized identity solution on the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol, dubbed MicroStrategy Orange, adopts a Bitcoin Inscription DID method, similar to the Ordinals technique, to manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) using Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) for control. Michael Saylor, the company’s co-founder and executive chairman, unveiled the innovation at the Bitcoin For Corporations conference on May 1.“The Bitcoin Inscription DID method (did:btc) uses the bitcoin blockchain exclusively to store and retrieve DID information. UTXOs on chain are used to control DIDs. Inscribing data in the witness of transactions allows for greater extensibility and verbosity when creating DID documents, while reducing fees and block space consumed,” as noted in a draft of a potential specification (the document) of the new solution on MicroStrategy GitHub.According to Saylor, MicroStrategy Orange is an open-source initiative that does not rely on sidechains and is capable of processing up to 10,000 DIDs in a single Bitcoin transaction. The system aims to simplify the adoption of DIDs for organizations and individuals, offering a way to manage online identities securely and pseudonymously.“The goal of this method is to deliver trustless, tamper-proof, and long-lived decentralized identities using only the public bitcoin blockchain as a data source, while enabling full compatibility with the [DID-CORE] specification and forward compatibility for future extensions,” stated the document.DIDs offer a pseudonymous way to manage online identities, distinct from real-world identities, enhancing privacy. The MicroStrategy Orange suite includes the Orange Service for organizations to issue DIDs, the Orange SDK for developers, and Orange Applications like “Orange For Outlook” for digitally signing emails.The onboarding process involves an invitation from an organization, DID creation, and inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring the data is permanent and tamper-proof.According to Cezary Raczko, MicroStrategy executive vice president of engineering, MicroStrategy Orange’s vision is to integrate DIDs on Bitcoin with a broader “verifiable credential ecosystem.”In other words, anyone could verify the authenticity of these credentials across various applications without relying on a central authority. The verification would happen by checking the information on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is known for its immutability and security.DIDs could be used to verify user identities on social media platforms, potentially enabling a more secure, user-controlled, and decentralized way to issue and verify credentials, Raczko highlighted a potential use case of the new protocol.

DOGE Price Prediction - Dogecoin Reaches Make-or-Breaks Levels


                            Dogecoin extended losses and traded below the $0.1350 resistance zone against the US Dollar. DOGE is now testing an important support at $0.1200.

DOGE gained bearish momentum below the $0.140 and $0.1350 levels against the US dollar.
The price is trading below the $0.1350 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1350 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The price must settle above $0.1420 to move into a positive zone and start a fresh surge.

Dogecoin Price Extends Losses
After a close below $0.150, Dogecoin price extended losses and moved into a short-term bearish zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $0.1350 support zone.
A low was formed at $0.1201 and DOGE is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the $0.1250 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1640 swing high to the $0.1201 low.
However, the bears protected more gains above the $0.130 resistance. Dogecoin is also below the $0.1420 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.130 level.

Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com
The next major resistance is near the $0.1350 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1350 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The main hurdle is at $0.1420. A close above the $0.1420 resistance and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1640 swing high to the $0.1201 low might send the price toward the $0.1550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1620 level.
More Losses in DOGE?
If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.1350 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1220 level.
The next major support is near the $0.120 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.120 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1040 level.
Technical Indicators
4 Hours MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.
4 Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.
Major Support Levels – $0.1240, $0.1200 and $0.1040.
Major Resistance Levels – $0.1300, $0.1350, and $0.1420.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionDuring the Asian session, Bitcoin (BTC/USD) trades at $57,520, reflecting a 1.25% decrease. This movement is positioned below the pivotal $59,328 mark and suggests a cautious, bearish outlook for the cryptocurrency. This price prediction hinges on key resistance and support levels that could dictate Bitcoin price prediction.Tax Fraud Allegations Against Roger Ver, Formerly Known as “Bitcoin Jesus”
Roger Ver, an early supporter of Bitcoin and advocate for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), faces indictment by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for allegedly evading taxes. The DOJ announced that Ver was arrested in Spain during the weekend, and the U.S. intends to request his extradition.The charges relate to actions in 2017 when Ver, having relinquished his U.S. citizenship to become a resident of St. Kitts and Nevis, is said to have sold tens of thousands of bitcoins, amassing approximately $240 million.Despite his expatriation, Ver was reportedly still required to declare his earnings and pay taxes on profits linked to U.S. entities.
Accusations: Ver is charged with failing to file tax returns and not paying taxes on capital gains from selling assets after giving up his U.S. citizenship.
Legal Requirements: Allegedly, he did not report income or taxes due on distributions from U.S. companies MemoryDealers and Agilestar.
Past Legal Troubles: Ver previously pleaded guilty and was imprisoned for selling explosives on eBay.
According to the DOJ, Ver hid from his accountant the fact that he had received and sold bitcoins from MemoryDealers and Agilestar in 2017.Consequently, his tax returns for that year did not disclose any profits or tax liabilities from these sales. Ver’s recent cryptic post on X, “Don’t expect bad people to do good things,” seems to comment on his current predicament.Simplified Explanation of the Federal Reserve’s Recent Policy Update
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged, continuing the same policy since July 2023. However, a significant change is on the horizon.Starting in June, the Fed plans to scale back its quantitative tightening (QT) program. This program involves selling off assets to reduce the money supply and potentially increase interest rates, aiming to control economic inflation.This adjustment caused U.S. Treasury yields, which affect things like mortgage and loan rates, to drop by 0.05 percentage points for both the 10-year and 2-year bonds.Here’s what’s important:
Background: From 2020 to 2022, the Fed bought a large amount of government bonds to lower interest rates and aid economic recovery post-pandemic.
Change in Strategy: Facing rising inflation in mid-2022, the Fed started selling these bonds. It currently allows $60 billion in Treasuries to mature monthly without renewal, pulling back money from the economy.
VIDEOJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, highlighted in his shareholder letter the unprecedented scale of QT and its potential impacts, expressing concern over draining more than $900 billion annually from the economy.The last major QT in 2019 led to a shortage of bank reserves, causing a “repo crisis” where overnight loan rates between banks surged, requiring Federal intervention to stabilize the situation. This history underscores the complex effects and potential risks of large-scale quantitative tightening.In today’s technical analysis of Bitcoin (BTC/USD), dated May 2, 2024, the cryptocurrency is trading at $57,520, marking a decrease of 1.25%. Bitcoin is currently positioned below its pivot point of $59,328, suggesting a bearish outlook in the short term.The key resistance levels to watch are $61,698, followed by $64,649 and $67,065. Should Bitcoin rebound, crossing these thresholds could signal a shift to a more bullish trend.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewConversely, immediate support is found at $56,624, with further cushions at $55,054 and $52,995. If these levels are breached, it may intensify the selling pressure.Technical indicators reinforce the bearish sentiment; the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 34, and the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $61,856, both suggesting potential downward momentum unless Bitcoin can sustain a move above $59,328.Unlock Cryptocurrency Rewards: Join the 99Bitcoins Presale Now!

Worldcoin Expands to Mexico; Faces Scrutiny in Argentina


Worldcoin, the ambitious crypto project co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, is expanding its footprint into Latin America. The project marked its recent move into Mexico, yet simultaneously facing regulatory challenges in Argentina.
The contrasting dynamics of Worldcoin in Latin America show the intricate balance between innovative tech growth and the need for robust data protection laws. In today’s digital era, achieving such balance is essential.
Worldcoin’s Expansion Sparks Debate on Data Protection in Latin America
In a Monday post on its official X account, Worldcoin announced that it is expanding to Mexico. Local media reported that Worldcoin has launched operations in nine different Mexico locations. This expansion makes Mexico the third-largest Latin American market for Worldcoin, trailing only behind Argentina and Chile regarding user engagement.
Despite the enthusiasm, Worldcoin’s venture in Latin America has sparked concerns among local officials in Mexico. María Eugenia Hernández, a Congressional representative from the Morena party, is one of the lawmakers who expressed her worries. On April 15, Hernández called for a thorough review of Worldcoin’s data protection practices by the National Transparency Institute (INAI).

Meanwhile, in Argentina, the reaction has been more stringent. Carlos Puglelli, a provincial deputy in Buenos Aires, has introduced legislation to regulate companies that collect biometric data through methods like iris scanning. Puglelli’s proposal seeks to establish a clear legal framework that ensures transparency, fairness, and the protection of consumer rights in digital transactions.

“It is essential to adapt our legislation to the challenges posed by the digital age. This law seeks to protect the rights of consumers and users in an increasingly digitalized environment, ensuring the privacy and security of their data,” Puglelli pointed out.


Puglelli’s legislative efforts also include creating a Provincial Registry of Digital Applications of Biometric Data to oversee and control the activities of technology companies operating in this space. This registry is part of a broader attempt to foster a safer digital environment for consumers. Therefore, it will ensure the careful handling of users’ personal information and that it is not subject to unfair contractual terms.
The legal text proposed by Puglelli mandates that any processing of personal data must be based on the users’ free, express, and informed consent. Moreover, digital application providers must adopt adequate security measures like information encryption and access controls to safeguard user data. Violations of these provisions also could lead to hefty fines and even the revocation of business permits.
His initiative followed accusations against Worldcoin for incorporating allegedly abusive clauses in their contracts. BeInCrypto reported that the Buenos Aires government prompted a $1.2 million fine for the project.
On the international front, Latin America’s expansion and regulatory responses echo global concerns about Worldcoin. Jurisdictions in Kenya and Spain have taken even more decisive actions, temporarily suspending the project’s operations amid privacy concerns.

                        The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have witnessed record net outflows, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) experiencing its first-ever day of outflows. On May 1, BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund saw $36.9 million flow out, according to data from Farside Investors. In addition, nine other Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded outflows of $526.8 million, with the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI) being the only one to report zero flows, as per preliminary Farside Investors data.Fidelity Records Largest Daily Outflow
Among the ETFs, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) experienced the largest outflow for the day, with $191.1 million net outflows.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) followed closely behind, with an outflow of $167.4 million. This marks the highest single-day outflow for the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, with the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and Franklin Bitcoin ETF seeing outflows of $98.1 million and $13.4 million, respectively. These outflows coincide with a 10.7% decrease in the price of Bitcoin over the past week.Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, highlighted that the iShares Gold ETF and SPDR Gold ETFs have experienced outflows of $1 billion and $3 billion, respectively, so far this year. Interestingly, despite these outflows, gold has shown a 16% increase year-to-date, as pointed out by Geraci in a recent post.James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, emphasized that the Bitcoin ETFs are still operating smoothly overall, with inflows and outflows being a normal occurrence in the life of an ETF. “Should add — these ETFs are operating smoothly across the board. Inflows and outflows are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” he wrote on X. Bitcoin Posts Worst Month Since FTX Collapse
Bitcoin has experienced its most challenging month since the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire, as the excitement surrounding US spot Bitcoin ETFs continues to wane. The cryptocurrency’s value plummeted by nearly 16% in April, only slightly better than the decline witnessed in November 2022.The surge in demand fueled by the anticipation of ETFs propelled Bitcoin to an all-time high of almost $74,000 in March. However, as optimism for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts waned and risky investments lost their allure, inflows to these products significantly decreased.The stocks of crypto mining companies suffered more significant declines than Bitcoin itself. Companies like Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., Riot Platforms Inc., Cleanspark Inc., and Cipher Mining Inc. experienced drops ranging from 7.9% to 11%. MicroStrategy Inc., known for its corporate Bitcoin strategy, also faced an 18% tumble after reporting a first-quarter loss of $53 million due to an impairment charge against the value of its Bitcoin holdings.

Crypto firms among ‘greatest risks’ for money laundering in 2022-2023: UK govt

Crypto firms were among those with the “greatest risk” of being exploited for money laundering, according to the United Kingdom’s top financial regulator.In a May 1 report, the U.K. Treasury concluded from data provided by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that crypto-asset companies were among the top four kinds of firms that remained “particularly vulnerable” to financial crime, particularly for cases of money laundering between 2022 and 2023. Crypto firms were listed alongside retail banking, wholesale banking, and wealth management companies.Crypto-asset firms remain vulnerable to being exploited for money laundering. Source: FCAThe report showed between 2022 and 2023, there were a total of 52.8 full-time specialist employees overseeing Anti-Money Laundering cases, with nearly one-third focused specifically on supervising crypto firms. During the 2022 to 2023 period, the FCA’s financial crime specialists conducted a total of 231 reviews of financial firms operating in the U.K. as well as an additional 375 cases related to financial crimes and sanctions. Related: UK regulator to tighten measures against crypto market abuseAs part of a broader supervisory effort outside of these full-time reviews, FCA teams launched a total of 95 cases into British crypto companies.Britain has been working to introduce clearer legislation for local crypto firms with the U.K. Treasury announcing on April 16 that it would aim to present a full regulatory framework for crypto assets and stablecoins by July. On April 26, The U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) and police received expanded authority to “seize, freeze, and destroy” cryptocurrency used by criminals. Under the new rules, police in the country will no longer be required to make an arrest before seizing crypto holdings.U.K. law enforcement can now seize items like passwords and memory sticks that could aid investigations. They have also been granted power to remove crypto assets from being returned into circulation — typically by burning the asset — if it were to be deemed detrimental to the public good.Under the new laws, U.K. police can transfer seized illicit cryptocurrency to wallets under their control, and crime victims can apply to reclaim funds from their crypto accounts.Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?

                        Hong Kong’s ZA Bank, a unit of China’s ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance, is reportedly exploring ways to offer virtual asset-related services after new regulations for digital assets launch in June.To establish itself as a crypto hub, Hong Kong implemented a new regulatory framework for crypto exchanges last year. This required all exchanges operating within the city to submit applications for licenses by Feb. 2024. The competition is fierce, with 24 companies vying for these coveted licenses.Approval from Hong Kong’s top financial watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), is highly sought-after, due to its reputation as a prestigious regulatory body.Leveraging this interest, ZA Bank CEO Ronald Iu Man-chung told SCMP in a recent interview that the bank is actively preparing to launch virtual asset trading services for retail investors. However, specific details will be announced only after they finalize preparations, he said.ZA Bank didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.Hong Kong Cracks Down on Unlicensed Virtual Asset Exchanges
The bank’s foray into crypto comes amid a stricter regulatory landscape in Hong Kong. In February, the city’s securities watchdog, the SFC, issued a warning to crypto investors. It urged them to only use licensed platforms and to double-check the registration status of their chosen exchanges.This warning coincides with a critical deadline for Hong Kong-based crypto exchanges. They had until Feb. 29 to submit license applications, or face closure by May 31. The SFC website reinforces this point with a clear message: unlicensed exchanges must cease operations by the end of May.Hong Kong Reboots Crypto Ambitions with ETFs, Regulatory Reform
The SFC has also advised investors to move their digital assets to platforms that are already regulated or in the process of obtaining a license. Currently, only OSL Digital Securities and Hash Blockchain hold licenses for virtual asset trading in Hong Kong. However, there are 24 applicants vying for approval, including names like OKX, HKVAX, Bybit, and DFX Labs.The SFC will also reveal a list of approved and rejected applications for virtual asset trading platforms on a public registry by June 1, 2024.The regulator also recently greenlit Asia’s first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly tied to Bitcoin and Ether. These ETFs began trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday.Hong Kong’s crypto standing took a hit in mid-2022 due to a lack of clear regulations and the rise of competitor hubs like Singapore and Dubai, known for their crypto-friendly stance. However, the city is making a comeback.ZA Bank’s Ronald Iu, highlights the bank’s commitment to supporting the digital asset sector, including Web3 startups, as Hong Kong ramps up digital asset trading through its new licensing program. This program, along with the lifting of the retail crypto trading ban in 2023, signals Hong Kong’s renewed push to become a major crypto hub.

Here’s When Bitcoin Could Halt the ‘Slide’ and Start To Pump, According to On-Chain Analytics Firm Santiment - The Daily Hodl


								The director of marketing at blockchain analytics firm Santiment, Brian Quinlivan, is listing two developments that could ignite a recovery in the price of Bitcoin (BTC).
Quinlivan says in a new video that accumulation by whales and sharks (those holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC) as well as widespread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) among crypto traders and investors could inspire an upward trend for Bitcoin.










“Since the beginning of the month [of April], these last four-ish weeks or so we’re looking at the whales and sharks actually taking some profit and the price is seemingly following them. 
And until they start to turn it around and resume their accumulation, there can be an argument that we will continue to slide very slowly until either the crowd gets really, really fearful. Like November 2022 was with the FTX [crypto exchange] collapse or the whales just decide ‘you know what, prices are low enough. I’m going to start pumping those prices again.’”
According to Quinlivan, the stock and crypto markets are currently enjoying a directly proportional relationship.
“There is a pretty big correlation right now between crypto and the S&P [500 index]…
The way the Federal Reserve is, the way the inflationary policies have been here in the US at least the last few years have had just a massive kind of impact on the rest of the markets. So until that changes, we have to be conscious of the fact that the way the US stock market has been going lately has had an impact on the way crypto goes. 
And it might be emphasizing a greater drop than crypto otherwise would be seeing on its own if the S&P was stable right now. So that could actually be a positive argument indicating that if the S&P starts to recover, then crypto might see a bit of a relief rebound of its own.”

Arkansas bills reining in crypto miners heads for governor approval

Two bills regulating crypto mining in the American state of Arkansas have fully passed the state’s House of Representatives and are heading to the Governor’s office — the last step before they become law.On May 1, the Arkansas House of Representatives passed Senate Bills 78 and 79 to restrict certain activities relating to cryptocurrency mining in the state, according to reports. Senate Bill 78 imposes noise limits on crypto mining farms, regulates the use of water for cooling, prohibits mining operations from being owned by foreign entities and restores local government control over their regulation. Senate Bill 79 creates a state licensing and regulatory system overseen by the Oil and Gas Commission under the Department of Energy and Environment.The two bills are now headed to Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ desk, which her office has said she will sign into law, the Associated Press reported.The two bills will amend the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023, which quickly passed in the Arkansas legislature and provided some protections to mining sites.The Act was heavily debated in April when the two bills were initially submitted as it severely limited the ability of local governments to regulate crypto-mining operations, leading to outrage and complaints from impacted rural communities.Local outlet the Arkansas Advocate reported Republican Jeremiah Moore, the House sponsor of Bill 79, said the state has an emerging mining industry adding: “We’ve never seen anything quite like this in our state before.”Related: Bill protecting Bitcoin mining rights passes in Arkansas Senate and HouseSanders’ spokesperson told the Arkansas Advocate the governor “strongly supports outlawing foreign adversaries from owning crypto mines in Arkansas while protecting rural communities and empowering them to crack down on bad actors.” Crypto mining in the United States has become a major point of contention. In April the Biden Administration took a tougher stance against mining operations, citing China as an example for the U.S. to follow.Magazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with ‘Net Zero’ promises

Synethix founder Kain Warwick targets mid-May launch for Infinex DEX

Synethix founder Kain Warwick has “finally” given a date for when the decentralized exchange front-end Infinex is set to go live after several delays from its expected Q4 2022 launch. Infinex is targeting an official launch on May 13, Warwick said on May 2 at the ETH Global conference in Sydney, Australia.Warwick said May 13 would be the “launch of the account” — when Infinex users can access their self-custodial accounts on the platform.Infinex is a noncustodial derivative DEX front-end bidding itself as bringing a centralized exchange user experience.Warwick explained that Infinex would utilize social passkeys to enable users to log in via Web2 applications — such as a Google account — and reduce the “friction” that typically accompanies a standard Web3 user experience. “The core component is you will have an account that you will own — it’s self-custodial — but you will be able to effectively login to that account via Web2,” Warwick said. “The starting point of [Infinex] you can have an account, and then you can deposit into that account to earn governance points,” said Warwick. He added there would be a points-farming game that would run for the month following the launch. On March 13, Infinex suffered a security breach which saw Warwick quickly take over as head of the project’s working group.Source: InfinexSpeaking to Cointelegraph Warwick said the security vulnerability was “part of the reason” Infinex’s launch — initially targeted for Q4 2023 — was delayed. The security vulnerability was a social engineering attack that saw an external security consultant gain access to a password vault, Warwick said. From there the consultant was then able to get into the protocol’s DNS store and modify Infinex’s DNS. Related: Synthetix DEX launch to join efforts reducing the ‘serious friction’ in DeFi“There were no funds at risk because we weren’t live — but just from learning a lesson sort of thing — even prior to being live, that just shouldn’t be able to happen,” he said. “I came in and I brought a couple of other people in and we burned all of the systems to the ground and rebuilt everything from scratch. It’s now one of the most secure environments I’ve ever worked in.”Warwick shared that the May 13 launch date is the proposed launch date that has been provided to the Synthetix protocol’s governing DAO — the Spartan Council — which still needs to vote on-chain to approve the launch.He said he was confident the council would approve — but the decision starts and ends with the council.Following Infinex’s launch, Warwick hopes to see it crack $50 million in total value locked and attract 10,000 genuine users within the first 30 days.“We have 200,000 people on the waitlist but a lot of those are sybils, airdrop farmers and bots. We do think there’s a solid 10,000 [genuine] users on that list,” he said. “If we have 5,000 to 10,000 people and 50 million of TVL — I feel like we’ve done something right.”Warwick added that if the current market cycle were to remain bullish he expects to see “hundreds of thousands” of users join Infinex within a year of its launch.

This Time Its Different, BTC Slump Not Caused by Leverage Flushout: Analyst


																Bitcoin prices slumped to a nine-week low just below $57,000 on May 1, shedding a further 4% on the day. The asset has now bled a whopping 11% since the same time last week.
Market dips and flush-outs are not uncommon for crypto assets, but Glassnode analyst James Check thinks this time is different.
Large derivatives-led deleveraging events were a big feature in the 2021 bull market and have been seen on several occasions this year, the last one in mid-April.
However, Check observed that they did not cause this week’s crypto crash in a post to X on May 2.
Derivatives Not The Cause
“Funding rates have cooled off gradually, not violently, which is very healthy to see,” he said before adding:
“It suggests we didn’t see a massive futures margin call yesterday.”
Funding rates are fees set by derivatives exchanges to maintain the balance between the contract price and the underlying asset price.






The analyst produced another chart showing that Bitcoin futures Open Interest (OI) has declined over the last year in BTC terms.
“This compares OI to market size and shows a relative leverage reduction,” he added.
Open Interest is the number of outstanding crypto derivatives contracts that have yet to be settled.
Check acknowledged that futures markets also saw two significant deleveraging events prior to this sell-off but added, “Again, it doesn’t feel like derivatives were the dominant factor in this Bitcoin sell-off.”
“Rather than a derivatives-led sell-off, I believe this is primarily spot-driven weakness, a result of both short-term sell-side and weaker demand.”
According to Deribit, there is around $1.3 billion in OI for Friday’s Bitcoin options expiry event showing that demand for derivatives remains healthy.
Crypto Markets Bleed
Total market capitalization has declined by over $240 billion over the past week, falling to $2.26 trillion during Thursday morning trading in Asia.
The wider market has shrunk by 22% since its 2024 peak level of around $2.9 trillion.
Technical analyst ‘Rekt Capital’ was unfazed, stating that markets have entered a historically recurring re-accumulation phase.


BTC was trading at $57,469 at the time of writing, while ETH had slumped 2% to $2,920. The altcoins were a mixed bag today, but Binance Coin (BNB) and Toncoin (TON) were seeing larger losses.

                        The UK’s financial watchdog dedicated nearly a third (30%) of its financial crime specialists to overseeing crypto asset businesses in 2023, according to a report released on May 1.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it conducted risk assessments across various sectors and identified retail banking, wholesale banking, wealth management, and crypto-asset firms as especially susceptible to financial crime in 2023. These sectors were deemed the most at risk of being misused for money laundering activities.In its fight against financial crime, the FCA’s team of specialists conducted a significant number of reviews. This included 231 in-depth analyses (desk-based reviews) and seven on-site visits. Additionally, other supervisory teams within the FCA identified 375 potential cases, with 95 specifically linked to crypto assets.Also, the regulator extended a key survey – called REP CRIM – to crypto businesses in April 2022. This comprehensive survey gathers information on anti-money laundering (AML) controls implemented by these firms.Data obtained through REP-CRIM, along with other intelligence reports, allows the regulator to pinpoint risks more effectively and tailor their supervisory actions accordingly.UK Crypto Firms Face Uphill Battle as FCA Registration Process Weeds Out Many
Since Jan. 2020, the FCA has been the AML watchdog for UK crypto businesses like exchanges and custodians. It implemented a rigorous evaluation process for new registrations, uncovering major shortcomings in firms’ anti-money laundering controls. This resulted in many applications being withdrawn, rejected, or refused by the FCA.The FCA’s March business plan highlights its commitment to consumer protection and ensuring a fair crypto market. This includes a focus on strengthening its ability to identify and address crypto market abuse over the next year. Additionally, the FCA aims to promote a competitive UK financial sector within the global landscape.FCA Cracks Down on Misleading Ads
Since intensifying its oversight of financial promotions, the watchdog removed a higher number of misleading advertisements last year compared to 2022.This increased scrutiny follows stricter advertising rules for high-risk investments, implemented in July 2023. These rules include specific guidelines for companies to disclose critical information about crypto products across various online platforms.Further tightening its grip, the FCA issued new guidelines in March this year, targeting financial promotions on social media. This applies to formats like memes, reels, and even gaming streams. The focus is on ensuring fair and accurate information, with no room for misleading content.

First Outflows Hit BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF: What It Means


BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) experienced its first-ever outflow day, with $36.9 million leaving the fund on May 1. 
This notable outflow broke a 77-day streak of stable or positive net flows, raising eyebrows among investors and analysts alike.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience Record Outflows
This shift comes at a time when the broader US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also witnessed record net outflows. The outflows sum up to $563.7 million across various funds on May 1. 
Among these, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) reported the largest single-day loss with $191.1 million, followed closely by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw $167.4 million exit its coffers.

Despite these significant movements, experts like James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, reassure investors.

“These ETFs are operating smoothly across the board. Inflows and outflows are part of the norm in the life of an ETF,” Seyffart said.

Additionally, cryptocurrency enthusiasts continue to debate the impact of ETF flows on Bitcoin’s price. Coosh Alemzadeh, a noted Bitcoin investor, argues that the influence of Bitcoin ETFs on market trends is overstated. 

“Bitcoin ETFs are more of a narrative IMO and have less impact on trend than people think.Solana has had “zero” ETF flows and yet has outperformed Bitcoin,” Alemzadeh wrote.


The outflows from ETFs coincided with a dip in Bitcoin’s price, which fell below $57,000 for the first time since February. BeInCrypto reported that this downturn is due to a decrease in demand among crypto whales and spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
The current price of Bitcoin is situated below the short-term holders’ realized price, which lies around $63,000. Traders use this metric to gauge the cost basis of short-term holders’ purchases.
On-chain analysis platform CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin’s price might soon find a floor. 

“The $55,000 to $57,000 level is 10% below the current realized price of short-term holders, which has historically acted as the ultimate support during bull markets,” the firm explained.
