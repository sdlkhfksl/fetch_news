Cryptocurrency exchange OKX announced that OKX plans to launch spot trading on its platform for Venom Network's VENOM Token.
OKX to Launch Spot Trading for Venom Network's VENOM Token
Venom Network has had a tumultuous journey. Venom, which initially presented itself as a Layer 1 blockchain platform regulated by the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), later abandoned its operations in Abu Dhabi and declared its foundation dissolved.



In particular, the Venom Foundation had previously announced that it had made a significant investment of $1 billion in Web3 companies with Iceberg Capital.
The announcement of OKX's integration into VENOM spot trading marks a potentially important step for the project as it tries to gain a foothold in the cryptocurrency market despite past difficulties.

Ripple (XRP) Whales Mobilized in South Korean Stock Exchanges! 30 Million XRP Withdrawn from Upbit! Are preparations being made? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Whale Alert, a crypto transaction monitoring platform, has detected a significant movement in the XRP market. As reported by CoinMarketCap, approximately 30 million XRP tokens worth $19 million were withdrawn from Upbit, South Korea's leading cryptocurrency exchange.
Rise in XRP Prices Triggered 30 Million XRP Transfer
The withdrawal was directed to an undisclosed address labeled “r3ow”, known for its history of processing large XRP transactions. Currently, only 978,122 XRP tokens remain at this address, indicating a rapid distribution to various destinations.




Such significant withdrawals from exchanges often indicate strategic asset management and potentially reflect bullish sentiment among investors. Conversely, movements towards the stock markets can typically indicate a selling trend.






Although a significant rise in XRP price has been witnessed in recent days with gains exceeding 10%, the token's current trajectory indicates a minor pullback.
Withdrawals have not changed the situation significantly, but remain stable, especially considering XRP's recent performance amid market volatility.


The increase in trading volume, combined with the withdrawal from Upbit, underscores a growing interest and activity surrounding XRP amid broader market volatility.

Three Heavy Industry Stocks to Buy as US Gov. Prepares $6.3 Billion in Grants - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



The US and China are heavily subsidizing the historic transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The Biden admin has committed to have at least 50% of new car sales be electric by 2030. Through private-public partnerships, like the EV Acceleration Challenge, battery manufacturers alone are poised to invest $100 billion to pursue that goal.



The ultimate goal is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Most recently, Biden administration insiders told Bloomberg that $6.3 billion worth of grants will be awarded to decarbonize American heavy industry. From cement and glass products to metals and paper, these industries make up nearly 25% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).



The Department of Energy (DOE) is purportedly to announce on Monday that the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) will be in charge of allocating the funds. Under the ESG umbrella, which companies could benefit from Biden’s latest decarbonization move?



Century Aluminum (NASDAQ: CENX)



Year-to-date, Century Aluminum is up 7.5%. In addition to aluminum products, the company manufactures carbon anodes that are heavily used in lithium-ion secondary batteries and fluorides. In October 2023, Century signed a 3-year contract with Santee Cooper to use Mt. Holly.



The electricity provider will provide the aluminum smelter with 295 MW of power until December 2026. On the decarbonization front, Century announced its intent to partner with MX Holdings to establish a new joint venture this month. The venture aims to produce advanced alloys from recycled content with the aid of a low-carbon secondary billet.



In the latest Q4 2023 earnings, Century ended the fiscal year with $2.18 billion in net sales, leaving a $43.1 million net loss. That is unsurprising, given that cyclical trends and fluctuating aluminum prices bind the sector. Yet, the company beat the market forecast of negative $0.23 earnings per share at positive $0.3 EPS for the quarter.



Based on three analyst insights pulled by Nasdaq, the average CENX price target is $13 vs the current $12.84 per share. However, this does not fully account for the potential for the decarbonization grant.





Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF)



This flat-rolled steel producer follows the same trend as CENX, having gained 7.7% value year-to-date. In addition to flat-rolled steel and iron ore pellets, the company generates revenue from renting real estate property. The company has made great strides in decarbonization, making it a likely grant candidate.



Cleveland-Cliffs integrated natural gas instead to ditch coal injections in steel production. By 2023, the company had already reduced 32% of emissions, ahead of planned 25% by 2030. The company is also involved in carbon capture via the Burns Harbor project, aiming to capture up to 2.8 million tons of CO2 annually.



In January, Cleveland-Cliffs finalized its cutting-edge hydrogen injection trial at the Indian Harbor facility. For the full year 2023, the company ended with $22 billion in revenue and $2.3 billion cash flow from operations, ending the year with $399 million net income vs. $1.3 billion in 2022.



For Q4 2023, Cleveland-Cliffs also beat the market estimate at negative $0.05 vs. the $0.07 EPS forecasted. Based on 10 analyst inputs pulled by Nasdaq, the average CLF price target is $19.32 vs. the current $21.30 per share. The high estimate is $24 vs. the low forecast of $11.41 per share.







Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE: KMB)



Texas-based Kimberly-Clark manufactures a wide range of paper-based products, from hygiene to workplace. Over one year, the company’s KMB stock broke even at -1.8% returns. To achieve its net zero goals, the company committed to a decade-long Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) last November to power its operations with wind.



In May 2022, the company received the Net-Zero Award at the first-ever UK Paper Industry Gold Awards. This was largely fueled by the PPA with Octopus Energy in 2021 to build onshore wind farms in Scotland. In March 2024, Kimberly-Clark received the World’s Most Ethical Companies recognition by Ethisphere. 



For fiscal year 2023, the company yielded a 7% year-over-year gross profit increase to $1.7 billion while increasing its operating margin by 150 bps. Kimberly-Clark’s net income largely remained the same at $509 million vs $507 million the year prior. Of the last four quarters, only the last Q4 failed to beat the EPS forecast at an estimated $1.53 vs the reported $1.51 earnings per share.



Based on 18 analyst inputs pulled by Nasdaq, the average KMB price target is $125.55 vs. the current $125.05. The high estimate is $145, while the low forecast is $110 per share.



Would highly dense nuclear power be better suited for net-zero goals? Let us know in the comments below.

                        The San Diego federal court has ruled that Silvergate Bank must face a class-action lawsuit filed by FTX users which alleges that the bank aided fraud at the exchange and its associated trading firm, Alameda Research.Despite Silvergate’s attempt to dismiss the case in June, a federal court judge denied the motion on Wednesday in the US District Court for the Southern District of California.Judge Denies Silvergate’s Motion to Dismiss Lawsuit Over FTX Fraud Allegations
In a court order on March 20, Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro denied Silvergate’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The judge ruled that the FTX users allegations were sufficient, asserting that Silvergate was aware of FTX’s fraud but benefited from it and unjustly enriched itself at the expense of FTX users. However, all these allegations were denied by the bank.The court found that Silvergate had a duty of care to FTX customers, mainly because of its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) which was designed to facilitate fund transfers to crypto exchanges. The judge emphasized that a crypto exchange like FTX was virtually impossible before establishing SEN.However, in its motion to dismiss, Silvergate argued that it did not owe FTX customers a duty of care and that its dealings, as alleged in the lawsuit, were not a substantial factor in the exchange customers’ inability to withdraw funds. The bank further stated that any alleged harm was primarily the fault of FTX and its co-founder, Sam Bankman-Fried; the judge found these claims unconvincing.Notably, Silvergate provided banking services to FTX and Alameda, processing transfers and accepting deposits that directed FTX customer funds to Alameda’s account since FTX initially lacked a bank account. The judge noted Silvergate’s strong incentive to continue these operations due to its reliance on the exchange for business growth.Furthermore, the order noted that Silvergate’s income surged from $7.6 million to $75.5 million annually after it began banking FTX, with revenue generated from translation fees and interest deposited into FTX-related accounts. The order stated that it was foreseeable that allowing the exchange customer funds to be deposited into non-FTX accounts would lead to fraud and harm to the owners of those funds.Silvergate argued that if it had denied FTX’s transfers, the exchange would have found another bank, a claim the judge deemed highly speculative, given the limited number of banks willing to service the crypto industry.However, the judge dismissed these arguments as “highly speculative,” noting that Silvergate was one of the few banks willing to service the crypto industry.Three Lawsuits Against Silvergate Consolidated Over Allegations of Aid in FTX Fraud
The judge’s approval came more than a year after the lawsuits were initially filed in February 2023. In April 2023, United States District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the Northern District of California decided to consolidate the three lawsuits against Silvergate. Each lawsuit accuses Silvergate of aiding investor fraud by the collapsed crypto exchange FTX.Four former investors brought these cases and remain separated from other federal cases against FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. However, they will be combined by the litigants’ mutual agreement, according to a report from Law360 on April 19.The order stated, “The Silvergate cases involve common questions of law and fact, as they name common defendants, arise from the same alleged course of conduct, and assert overlapping causes of action, such that the Silvergate cases are appropriate for consolidation.”FTX filed for bankruptcy in November of the previous year, causing liquidity problems for Silvergate. Following a bank run, Silvergate disclosed its plans to “voluntarily liquidate” assets and shut down operations about a month later, in March 2023. Additionally, the bank faced a class-action lawsuit in January for securities law violations.Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven fraud and money laundering charges last November as part of the FTX court case. His sentencing date is March 28.

Ethereum Statement from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse! "Like XRP, ETH Will Also Win!" - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the reaction of the cryptocurrency market grew against the investigation launched against the Ethereum Foundation in the USA and the SEC's efforts to classify ETH as a security, the latest statement came from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.
At this point, Ripple CEO expressed his support for Ethereum in the face of the investigation launched against the Ethereum Foundation and the campaign launched by the SEC to classify ETH as a security.


While referring to the SEC's defeat against Ripple, Garlinghouse emphasized that the SEC constantly loses in the courts.
In addition, stating that the SEC constantly fights with the cryptocurrency industry, Ripple CEO said that the SEC always loses in the end.





Garlinghouse finally pointed out that he was sure that the SEC would lose against Ethereum as well and said:

“The SEC picked a fight with the cryptocurrency industry but ended up losing badly in the courts.
They now struggle with regulators like the CFTC and lag behind their international counterparts.
“When will the SEC realize that it will lose against ETH just like it lost against XRP?”

Bitcoin 2024 Halving Explained by Revolut's Karl Devin | Cryptoglobe


                                
As the world of cryptocurrency gears up for Bitcoin’s much-anticipated halving event in April 2024, investors and enthusiasts alike are speculating about its potential impact on the market. Karl Devin, a key figure in the Strategy & Operations (Crypto) team, sheds light on the significance of this event and what it could mean for the future of Bitcoin.







Bitcoin’s programmed scarcity mechanism, known as halving, is a cornerstone of its design and a key factor in its potential value proposition. Halving events, which occur roughly every four years, directly slash the reward for Bitcoin miners in half. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems. By adding verified transaction blocks to the blockchain, they earn newly created Bitcoin, and the process itself maintains the network’s security.



The first halving in 2012 reduced the reward from 50 BTC to 25 BTC per block. The most recent cut, in May 2020, brought the reward to 6.25 BTC. The next halving will further decrease it to around 3.125 BTC.



This engineered scarcity is at the heart of Bitcoin’s appeal as a potential long-term store of value. With only 21 million Bitcoins ever coded into existence, halving progressively chokes off the supply of new coins entering circulation. This dynamic aims to mirror the finite nature of precious resources like gold, where increased scarcity can potentially drive higher prices as demand grows. Additionally, by gradually reducing mining rewards over the long term, halving helps ensure network security remains incentivized and profitable, attracting the necessary computing power to keep the Bitcoin network robust.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Devin points out that, historically, Bitcoin’s halving events have been followed by significant price surges, as the reduced supply coupled with increasing demand drives up the cryptocurrency’s value. Devin notes that these events underscore Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against inflation, particularly during times of extensive monetary expansion by central banks and governments.







However, Devin cautions that predictions surrounding the 2024 halving event are largely speculative, and the actual outcome remains uncertain. While many experts anticipate a positive impact on Bitcoin’s value due to the reduced mining rewards and consequent scarcity, he reminds us that the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and unpredictability.



Moreover, he goes on to say that the effects of Bitcoin’s halving event may extend beyond the primary cryptocurrency, potentially influencing the valuation and interest in other digital currencies. As Bitcoin often serves as a benchmark for the broader cryptocurrency market, he believes that its performance following the halving could have far-reaching implications.



As investors eagerly await the 2024 halving event, Devin advises a cautious approach, suggesting a retrospective analysis in early 2025 to fully comprehend its effects. He reminds readers that past performance does not guarantee future results, highlighting the inherently speculative nature of cryptocurrency investments.

                        Meme Coin markets have become the fastest-growing opportunity in finance this month, and retail investors are now scrambling to find new meme coins to secure big profits.The frenzied meme coin season was triggered early in 2024, when the now iconic Solana meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) token exploded onto a multi-billion dollar market cap.In the weeks since crypto markets have gone parabolic as millions of investors around the world race to find new meme coins to make it big.Biggest Meme Coin Market Rug Pulls – March 22
However, with the statistics showing that the majority of Solana meme coin launches lose investors money – is this a smart money game for schmucks? Let’s unpack some of today’s biggest rug pulls.Rug Pull #1 – Based Wojak (BOJAK)
In a return to classic ERC-20 meme coin architecture, BOJAK is an intrepid meme coin setting out to make it big in a double-edged play on 2023’s memorable WOJAK token – rebirthed (at least in name) into the BASE blockchain trend.However, despite a massive influx of $1.14m in 24-hour trading volume, and surging up a whopping +53,687% at its peak – BOJAK has almost completely bled out over the afternoon – leaving more than 2,000 holders in despair.Rug Pull #2 – Pnut (PNUT) 
Next up, a new Solana meme coin called PNUT – a ticker play on the word peanut – briefly exploded on Raydium DEX markets with a +145,228% rally to an all-time high suckering in almost 2,000 traders.Yet, a near-complete retracement has seen the majority of PNUT holders left underwater, with prices collapsing -97.5%, leaving PNUT market cap low at $332k.Rug Pull #3 – Shrek (SHREK)
Last but not least, another Solana meme coin that witnessed a seismic rug pull today is the Shrek token – a light-hearted play on everyone’s favorite Ogre.Amid impressive $2.3m trading volumes, SHREK shot up an initial +62,482% – to reach lofty heights around $0.034 – before falling victim to a tumultuous -98.75% drop that has left 1,190 holders short-changed.Looking For A Safe New Meme Coin Play With Big Potential Returns?
Then look no further than the viral Dogecoin20 presale, which has exploded in just three days to hit a jaw-dropping $6M raised.With DOGE20 hitting terminal velocity throughout today, the Dogecoin20 presale looks poised for an explosive weekend ahead as investors rush to position for early-bird advantage in the fastest-growing meme coin presale.A replica play on the biggest meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), the real appeal of Dogecoin20 lies in the opportunity to buy the next DOGE at just 0.0001% of Dogecoin’s market cap.Stop a second to imagine the possibilities – if DOGECOIN20 replicates just 1% of Dogecoin’s success, and hits a $192M market cap – investors could be walking away with life-changing 50x returns – all without the overhead risk of a rug pull as seen in straight to DEX launches.Viral Success Amongst Meme Coins: Dogecoin20, is making waves across crypto as the explosive growth of the presale accelerates towards $7.5m in its first week. In what could be a sell-out play, this innovative token pays respect to the biggest meme coin while onboarding a new generation of moonboys.Skyrocket Tokenomics: Dogecoin20 is an upgrade on your usual token; with tailor-designed tokenomics driven by a powerhouse of innovation. Features such as a capped supply and an ingenious super high yield staking mechanism hint at the skill of the development team.Mission & Roadmap: Dogecoin20 embodies the ethos of “Do Only Good Everyday.” With a supercharged roadmap focused on philanthropy, community building, and tangible real-world impact, this project aims to redefine the crypto landscape and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.Join the Revolution: Be part of something special.

COIN's Ancillary Businesses Will Help Drive Growth: JMP Securities

“Still, relative to the growth opportunity in the exchange and custody offerings, we see a just as exciting of an opportunity in the development of blockchain use cases today and expect Coinbase to participate in much of that continued evolution,” the authors wrote.Those opportunities include participation in the tokenization of real-world assets, such as its recently announced partnership with Blackrock (BLK), activities in payments such as its venture with stablecoin issuer Circle and Web3 development and decentralized apps (dapps), as well as staking, the report said.Coinbase can participate in much of the future growth and innovation in the sector by working with TradFi firms looking to become involved with digital assets rather than competing with them, the report added.The broker continues to see spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) adoption as a significant catalyst for the market, however, “ETF flows will not come on a smooth line, particularly with some transitory selling related to GBTC.”

Polygon (MATIC) Labs has unveiled a new tool for developers.



The tool dubbed DApp Launchpad promises to simplify the dApp development process for EVM chains.



Polygon (MATIC) Labs urged developers to consider launching on Polygon.
Over the past year, the Polygon (MATIC) Labs team has been working hard, releasing new features, tools, and technological feats at a staggering rate. Barely a month after the firm announced the development of a new zero-knowledge proving system in partnership with StarkWare, developers of the Starknet protocol, the firm is back again with a new tool promising to unlock DApp development at scale.Polygon (MATIC) Labs Unveils DApp LaunchpadTo make the development of DApps easier and faster, on Thursday, March 21, Polygon (MATIC) Labs announced the release of the dApp Launchpad, describing it as a command-line interface to abstract the complexities of building DApps on EVM chains.At the core of the dApp Launchpad are three main features. These features include an automated environment setup allowing developers to get started with the actual coding with minimal fuss, seamless front-end and smart contract integration that automatically allows smart contract changes to reflect on the front-end, and DApp deployment through a single command.Beyond the benefits for developers, Polygon (MATIC) Labs also seeks to use the tool to bolster activity in its multichain ecosystem.Polygon (MATIC) Lab Talks up the AggLayerCentral to Polygon’s growing multichain ecosystem is an interoperability protocol dubbed the Aggregation Layer, or AggLayer, promising to unlock unified liquidity for Layer 2 chains either built with Polygon’s proprietary stack, the CDK, or using its newly launched Type 1 prover with “near-instant” and “atomic transactions.”In February 2024, version 1 of the AggLayer went live, offering users a taste of what the protocol can do. Regarding the AggLayer benefits, Polygon (MATIC) Labs urged developers to build on Polygon.“Building a dApp today on Polygon PoS, one of the most adopted chains in the world, or choosing to launch on the performant Polygon zkEVM chain, means developers will tap a future constellation of aggregated blockchains and all the network effects that entails.”The Polygon multichain ecosystem has already seen interest from over 20 projects, most still in development. Popular names include Astar, Manta Pacific, and Flipkart.On the Flipside
Despite Polygon’s technological advancements, the price of the network’s native token, MATIC, continues to concern investors. Over the past few days, the asset’s price has slipped below the keenly watched $1 price level.
Why This MattersThe newly launched dApp Launchpad promises to encourage the development of more novel crypto tools. At the same time, abstracting away the complexities of DApp development could minimize bugs and reduce the chances of hacks.Read these for more on Polygon:Polygon (MATIC) Labs To Guide Web3 Gaming Bets for $100M FundPolygon (MATIC) Back Below $1, Just a Healthy Correction?

Fantom (FTM) Jumps 180% In 4 Weeks: Just The Beginning?


                            Over the past 24 hours, Fantom (FTM) has emerged as the standout performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, registering a remarkable 13.5% gain. This surge is part of a broader rally that has seen the FTM price soar by 180% over the last four weeks, propelling it from $0.42 to $1.20. This upward trajectory has significantly boosted Fantom’s market capitalization to $3.3 billion, positioning it as the 41st largest digital asset worldwide. Here’s why this might be just the beginning:
#1 Sonic Upgrade: The Catalyst for Fantom’s Rally
The anticipated Sonic upgrade is central to Fantom’s recent success. Designed to enhance the Fantom technology stack, Sonic introduces major scalability improvements without necessitating a disruptive hard fork. Key components of the Sonic upgrade include:

Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM): Aims to significantly boost transaction throughput.
Carmen Database: Promises to reduce storage requirements by up to 90%.
Optimized Lachesis Consensus: Improves upon the existing consensus mechanism for enhanced performance.

With these enhancements, Fantom targets a throughput of over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), marking a substantial leap in scalability. Importantly, the upgrade ensures that existing Fantom Opera smart contracts and tools remain fully compatible with the Sonic mainnet, which is scheduled to launch in Spring 2024.

Recent testnets have demonstrated Sonic’s potential. The closed testnet, focused on ERC-20 swaps, achieved an impressive ~4,000 TPS with ~1.3-second finality. Furthermore, a reconfiguration to process only ERC-20 transfers led to a groundbreaking ~10,000 TPS at ~1.6-second finality, showcasing the capabilities of next-generation decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and wallets.


Reflecting on Sonic’s impact, Reflexivity Research highlighted, “Fantom Sonic unlocks new possibilities for the Fantom ecosystem, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, blockchain games, high-frequency applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT).”
The research firm added that another cornerstone for Fantom is its exemplary 99.9% uptime. “Fantom’s novel solutions position it as a frontrunner in the development of decentralized networks,” Reflexivity Research stated.
#2 Andre Cronje: The Innovator’s Promise
Andre Cronje, the founder of Fantom and one of the brightest minds in the crypto industry, has been instrumental in driving innovation within the ecosystem. Cronje recently underscored his commitment to advancing the crypto space, stating, “The number 1 dex on Base, and the number 1 dex on Optimism are both built with code I wrote and pioneered. Stick to where the innovators are, post Sonic I will be adding some new primitives to crypto.”

#3 Coinbase Announcement: A New Milestone
Another factor driving today’s price rally is probably today’s Coinbase International announcement that it will launch Fantom perpetual futures on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced, set to commence on or after 9:30am UTC on March 28, 2024. This move by Coinbase is expected to further enhance Fantom’s liquidity and accessibility, contributing to its growing appeal among investors.


#4 Technical Analysis: FTM/USD
The bullish momentum of Fantom price is apparent in the weekly FTM/USD chart on Binance, signified by the latest candlestick closure above the key exponential moving averages (EMAs) of 20, 50, 100, and 200 periods. This week’s candlestick represents a notable increase of approximately 50% from the intra-week low.
Fantom’s ascent has propelled its value beyond the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, situated at $0.9176. This bullish breakout suggests the market may target subsequent Fibonacci levels, with $1.38 (0.382 Fib) acting as an intermediate psychological and technical resistance, followed by $1.76 (05 Fib), and potentially extending towards the golden ratio at $2.13, which corresponds with the 0.618 Fibonacci level.
On the flip side of this bullish scenario, should a correction occur across the broader crypto market, immediate support for FTM can be anticipated at the $0.92 level. Stability at or above this threshold could reaffirm bullish market control. Conversely, a downward breach could intensify selling pressure, possibly leading to a retest of support around the $0.56 mark.

In an industry founded on technological innovation, the projects with the most staying power are ones that nurture and pioneer the development of blockchain’s utility potential.After all, to drive adoption, which is the endgame for every player in the industry, crypto projects have to interact, integrate and dovetail with other emerging technologies.It’s in the intersection of blockchain, VR and AI that we find the concept of “Web3”, a term describing a future decentralized iteration of the internet driven by these technologies.There in Web3 is 5thScape, the world’s first crypto, VR, and AI ecosystem.While every crypto project is technically a Web3 project, a few, like 5thScape go a step further into the future: into the metaverse.Like Web 3, the metaverse is another term for an envisioned internet shakeup.The metaverse essentially refers to the applications and features of Web 3 that people will interact with in a virtual reality space.And as a tokenized gaming platform, 5thScape promises to be at the forefront of the metaverse.Participation is easy, gamers simply buy and hold tokens to get access to the platform, where they will be able to game and stream for free.Furthermore, the project team took development back to first principles and designed all the software and hardware in-house.5thScape’s 5SCAPE Tokenomics
5SCAPE has a market cap on launch of $15 million and is currently priced at $0.00215, although this is due to rise 15% to $0.00248 when the third round begins in under two days. Eighty percent of the total token supply is up for purchase in the presale. When it concludes, 5SCAPE’s fixed listing price will be $0.01, giving the token a possible prelaunch upside potential of over 365%. 5thScape is also fully audited with KYC and the team behind it are transparent.Those who join the community over on the project’s socials channels can stay informed of tasks to claim even more 5SCAPE rewards before the protocol launches.Interested?

Outflows from Bitcoin ETFs Continue! To what extent do purchases cover sales? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


On March 22, Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed significant net outflows, with money being withdrawn for the fourth consecutive day. Total net outflow reached $93.85 million, reflecting investor sentiment amid ongoing market volatility.
Bitcoin Spot ETFs Experience Significant Outflows Amid Volatility
Leading the outflows was Grayscale ETF GBTC, which recorded a staggering single-day net outflow of $358 million.


This brings GBTC's historical net outflow to $13.63 billion, marking a significant shift in investor position regarding Bitcoin.
In contrast, amid outflows, BlackRock ETF IBIT emerged as the Bitcoin spot ETF with the highest single-day net inflow.






IBIT exhibited the opposite trend in investor behavior, with a significant net inflow of $233 million. With this latest inflow, IBIT's total net inflow reached $13.32 billion. Fidelity, on the other hand, made a net inflow of 2.9 Million dollars.
The contrasting movements between GBTC and IBIT highlight the different sentiments prevailing in the market. While some investors appear to be withdrawing from Bitcoin-related assets, others are taking advantage of the market downturn and increasing their exposure. However, it is necessary to know that most of the outflows in GBTC are also due to high transaction fees.


Bitcoin's recent price fluctuations and uncertainties regarding regulatory developments have contributed to volatility in the cryptocurrency market.
Such dynamics often prompt investors to re-evaluate their positions and adjust their portfolios accordingly.

Internet Computer (ICP) Set to Reach $15 on This Day


The Internet Computer (ICP) price has been consolidated since the beginning of the year, and the recent recovery is set to continue this consolidation.
This ascertains one outcome: the altcoin will more than likely hit $15 before the end of the month.
Internet Computer Price Climbs Back Up
Internet Computer price fell to the low of $10.91 over the past two weeks before beginning a recovery in the last few days. As the cryptocurrency made its way back into consolidation, bullish signals began arising.
Relative Strength Index (RSI) can be seen back up above the neutral line of 50.0 after falling into the bearish zone for the first time since October 2023. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
Internet Computer RSI. Source: TradingView

Readings above 70 indicate overbought conditions, suggesting a potential reversal or correction. Whereas a reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions, suggesting a potential upward reversal.

The indicator’s presence above 50 is a bullish signal, indicating that a further rise is likely.
ICP Price Prediction: Further Upside on the Cards
In addition to the RSI, Internet Computer price is also observing a similar signal from the Ichimoku Cloud. This indicator is a comprehensive indicator in the technical analysis used to gauge momentum, trend direction, support and resistance levels, and potential reversal points.

In the case of ICP, the indicator forms a bearish crossover owing to the recent decline. However, following the recent recovery of 22.56% in the last three days, ICP has made it back up above the cloud.
ICP/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView
When the price is above the cloud, it’s considered bullish, suggesting the altcoin has room for growth. If the support level of $12.91 is maintained, the Internet Computer price will be able to make its way up to $15. Since this would warrant a 14% rally, the chances of this happening are by the end of the month.
Lack of Optimism Might Interfere
Despite the bullish signals, the investors are not indicating much confidence in this rise. This is evident from the lack of bullish bets on Internet Computer prices. The Funding Rate at the moment, despite being positive, is at a multi-month low.
Internet Computer Funding Rate. Source: Coinglass

A positive funding rate shows that investors are still pining for an increase. However, a declining positive funding rate shows this sentiment waning. Thus, if the altcoin witnesses a negative funding rate, it would hint at a potential drawdown. 

This would invalidate the bearish thesis and pull ICP down to $10.97, which would result in a correction to $10.

Akon’s cryptocurrency and city have failed - enter Idris Elba


In 2020, Akon, the bestselling Grammy-nominated musician, made a bold and ultimately absurd claim that he was going to build a Wakanda-style city in Senegal. The mockups were glorious: slim, shiny, curved skyscrapers, new museums, and forested boulevards, all in the heart of a country where 36% of people live below the poverty line.
Part of the scheme relied on ‘Akoin’ – a cryptocurrency created in 2018 and boasting the slogan “One Africa. One Koin.” The crypto, along with the city, was intended to unite Africa behind a greater vision and an accessible, digitized economy.
However, these dreams of a futuristic, Frank Gehry-inspired cityscape in Senegal and a unified African currency soon became nightmares not just for Akon but for everyone.

Unpaid loans, delistings, and lawsuits
Despite Akon going from media outlet to media outlet and podcast to podcast extolling the virtues of Akon City and Akoin in 2019 and 2020, the projects themselves soon began to falter.
First, a lawsuit was brought against Akon by his former business partner, then Akon blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for delays, and finally, Sapco, the entity that purchased the land for the city, failed to pay hundreds of individuals who sold their land nearly a decade before.
Akon is still suggesting that the city will be developed — at least partially — by 2026, yet the reality on the ground is looking less and less like Wakanda and more like any other failed urban project.
Meanwhile, Akoin has been delisted from every exchange where it was once available for purchase. Refunds have been handed out to buyers, the Akon City website has been taken down, and Akon has stated on Cameo (the website where celebrities are paid by people to record personalized videos) that he will do no crypto-related requests.

Idris Elba enters the chat
So, now that it’s clear that a new, ridiculously structured city in a poverty-stricken country requires experts and those with the money and means to get the project across the finish line, actor Idris Elba has decided to start his own new city just off the coast of Sierra Leone. Again, a country where a significant portion of the population lives below the poverty line.
The dream is, once again, a rather large one and the attempt to construct an ‘eco city’ looks to be largely reliant on the goodwill and intentions of artists, venture capitalists, and governments. It’s unclear exactly what lies in store for the small island of Sherbro, as no plans have yet been unveiled, but Elba has told journalists that, “the character of the island hopefully will remain intact.”
The move is slightly troubling, as Elba has previously narrated and starred in what can only be described as a propaganda film for the gold industry — an industry that regularly destroys and annihilates entire ecosystems to mine for the precious metal, often at the expense of locals.
A majority of gold mining takes place in poverty-stricken regions desperate for cash, where regulation and human safety are ignored. The gold ‘documentary’ fails to address these issues and concerns in any meaningful way.
Regardless, Elba has suggested that the city will take decades to plan and construct — a much more realistic vision than the one intended for Akon City — and hasn’t planned any silly tokenized currency to accompany it.

Top Ethereum L2s Ready To Ship Major Upgrades - The Defiant

Starknet, Optimism, and Polygon are all working on major upcoming upgrades.The Layer 2 sector is booming, with many of Ethereum's leading scaling solutions preparing to ship major upgrades.On March 20, Starknet announced a new roadmap for 2024, prioritizing increasing throughput and performance over the coming months.Starknet will introduce transaction parallelization with its 0.13.2 version upgrade in Q2 2024. The network will simultaneously execute transactions, speeding up both finality and throughput.“ERC-20 transfers from different users, for example, will be executed concurrently instead of sequentially,” Starknet said.Starknet will follow up by integrating a Cairo-native sequencer and virtual machine with its 0.13.3 version in Q3 to unlock further scalability gains by reducing transaction latency. Starknet is also planning future upgrades introducing volition — allowing dApp data to be stored on Starknet rather than the Ethereum mainnet, in addition to data and batching compression.“One of Starknet’s main goals for the coming months is to improve network performance — specifically throughput — in order to support the expected rise in the number of users and developers on the network,” Starknet said.Starknet’s updated roadmap follows the project launching support for EIP-4844 — the main fee-saving upgrade included in Ethereum’s recent Dencun fork — as part of its 0.13.1 version. The new version also coincided with the introduction of gas subsidies intended to bring transaction fees down to the levels anticipated following the launch of other fee-saving mechanisms set to go live in the future.Average transaction fees on Starknet have dropped by 97% since the upgrade went live, according to GrowThePie.Polygon prepares to introduce EIP-4844Polygon will introduce support for EIP-4844 with its upcoming Feijoa upgrade, which is scheduled for May.Polygon noted that its zkEVM rollup is expected to enjoy fee savings of up to around 65% following the upgrade, while EIP-4844 is unlikely to have a significant impact on its PoS Chain’s fees.DeFi AlphaPremium ContentLooking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community.DeFi Daily | WeekdaysDeFi Alpha Letter | WeeklyDefiant Podcast Transcript | WeeklyInbox Dump | SaturdayWeekly Recap | SundayStart for freeFeijoa will also introduce support for KZG commitment verification through EIP-2537 as part of Feijoa.Optimism to introduce fault proofsOn March 18, deployed fault proofs on the Sepolia testnet, describing its code as comprising the first “open-source, permissionless, feature-complete fault proof system” in the Ethereum ecosystem.Fault proofs enable permissionless validation across any chain leveraging Optimism’s OP Stack. “This means that withdrawals of ETH and ERC-20 tokens from OP Stack Chains can be initiated without involvement from any trusted third party,” OP Labs said. “It also means that invalid withdrawals can be challenged and removed by any user that wants to participate in the protocol.”Fault proofs will next go live on OP Mainnet, pending governance approval. OP Labs said future upgrades will negate the need for Optimism's Security Council to act as a centralized safety net backstopping fault proofs, furthering the protocol’s decentralization.“Stage 1 still includes a safety net allowing us to block withdrawals and override dispute game results to protect the bridge during the system's nascent stages,” OP Labs tweeted.Espresso closes Series B roundIn other Layer 2 news, Espresso Systems, the development team behind the Espresso marketplace for shared sequencers, announced the completion of a $28 million Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz.“This round of funding will enable us to scale our team and bring a production-ready implementation of Espresso to the ecosystem,” Expresso said.Espresso’s marketplace allows rollups to “sell the right to build their blocks” to the highest bidding block proposer. This bolsters the decentralization of Layer 2s by eliminating reliance on centralized proprietary sequencing systems.Both block builders and L2s generate revenue through the marketplace, with bidders spanning Layer 1 proposers, rollup sequencers, and other block proposers.“Fragmentation and centralization are two of the biggest obstacles in Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap,” Espresso tweeted. “Apps scattered across the plethora of L2s lose the composability they are used to enjoying on the Ethereum Layer 1. Shared sequencers address this problem.”The round also featured participation from leading L2 teams including Offchain Labs, Polygon, and StarkWare, demonstrating a vote of confidence in Espresso’s marketplace from the Layer 2 sector.Express will launch its fifth testnet deployment next month.

ESMA's resource constraints hinder the EU's crypto regulation efforts

The European Union (EU) faces a significant hurdle in establishing a robust regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) grapples with resource constraints. This obstacle potentially puts the EU at risk of lagging behind other global markets in adopting cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.ESMA’s resource challengesESMA, the Union’s premier regulatory authority tasked with overseeing Europe’s complex financial landscape, is confronted with resource constraints that hinder its ability to effectively regulate cryptocurrencies. Verena Ross, the chairperson of ESMA, has acknowledged the issue, citing the agency’s numerous additional responsibilities and mandates in recent years without corresponding increases in resources.Ross stated, “Resources is an issue for ESMA generally because we have had a large number of additional responsibilities and mandates given to us over the last few years, and not always necessarily with a lot of additional resources.”One notable consequence of ESMA’s resource constraints is the delay in meeting the European Commission’s deadline for assessing the potential inclusion of crypto assets within Ucits funds, a popular investment vehicle among European retail investors. This delay, as noted by Ross, could extend the timeline to the end of 2024 or even early 2025.EU falls behind in crypto oversight amid global trendsWhile the EU struggles with regulatory challenges, other global players, notably the United States, have embraced cryptocurrencies with open arms. The regulatory agility in the US has led to the proliferation of Bitcoin ETFs, attracting significant investments since January 2024. This contrast highlights the EU’s comparatively sluggish pace and rigid regulations, potentially leading to capital flight as funds seek more innovation-friendly environments overseas.Moreover, the lack of harmonization in regulations within the EU poses significant challenges for businesses operating across member states. For instance, Jupiter Fund Management’s experience illustrates the disparities in regulations, with their Irish Ucits fund compelled to abandon a planned crypto investment due to stringent Irish regulations, while Spain allows exposure to such assets through exchange-traded products.Addressing these challenges requires swift action from EU policymakers to streamline regulations, foster innovation, and ensure the region remains competitive in the rapidly evolving global crypto landscape. Failure to do so risks further exacerbating the gap between the EU and its counterparts, hampering economic growth and investor confidence in the region.Urgent need for a transparent regulatory frameworkThe convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrencies underscores the urgent need for a transparent and cohesive regulatory framework within the EU. The emergence of US-based ETFs and the UK’s openness to comparable offerings accentuates this necessity. ESMA recognizes the interconnectedness between crypto assets and the traditional financial sector and emphasizes the importance of getting the Ucits review right.Verena Ross emphasized, “What we’re seeing happen is just an increased interconnectedness between crypto assets and the traditional financial sector and various products.”Addressing ESMA’s resource constraints is imperative to ensure effective crypto regulation within the EU. With a limited staff of merely 300 and an unchanged budget from the previous year, ESMA must prioritize tasks rigorously. This may involve strategic staff allocation and potentially retraining existing employees to specialize in crypto regulation. Additionally, a phased rollout of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation could alleviate the implementation burden for both ESMA and member states.EU must address ESMA’s resource challenges to foster innovation, protect investors, and maintain competitiveness in the global digital economy. A well-funded and empowered regulatory watchdog is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

                        Traders use platforms like DEXScreener to find the top crypto gainers today. Source: DEXScreener’s X AccountWith major cryptocurrencies struggling on Friday as focus returns to heavy and largely GBTC-driven spot Bitcoin ETF outflows, traders looking to turn quick exponential profits continue to flock to the on-chain shitcoin markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin (BTC) was last around 2.5% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap, and trading in the mid-$63,000s.Other major cryptos Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) dropped as much as 5% over the same time period.As per Zerohedge, GBTC is now down to 356,000 BTC from 619,000 BTC just two months ago.Traders having been dumping GBTC since it converted into a spot ETF.That’s because of its 1) comparatively high fee (of 1.5%), 2) traders who bought GBTC at a big discount to NAV in 2023 before it converted to an ETF taking profit and 3) bankrupt crypto companies (like FTX, Celsius and BlockFi) liquidating holdings.While GBTC sell pressure could persist in the short-term, this is unlikely to be a long-term headwind to the market.Major cryptos are thus likely to recover and hit new highs later this year, with Bitcoin bulls eyeing $100,000.But in the meantime, impatient traders looking to turn faster profits will continue to enter the on-chain markets.On-chain markets refer to the market for digital assets that have been issued directly on top of an existing blockchain.For example, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.These tokens can then be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEX), and also perhaps on centralized exchanges if they get big enough.They are often referred to as meme coin (or shitcoin) markets and virtually anyone can issue a token at any time.As a result, these on-chain markets are replete with scams and pump-and-dump schemes.But shitcoin markets are the only place to find tokens that can rally in the 50-100x region.Here are a few of the top crypto gainers today on Solana that traders will be monitoring, as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayStop ($STOP)A just-launched anti-racism token called Stop ($STOP), which appears to be campaigning against racist tokens being launched on Solana, is up 130,000% in the past 24 hours, as per DEXScreener.The token’s market cap was last $2.2 million, with $120,000 in locked liquidity.It has also seen an impressive $9.5 million in trading volumes since its launch.But just because the token seems innocent and well-meaning, that doesn’t mean it isn’t a scam.Traders must always do their due diligence in the on-chain shitcoin markets. Most tokens are scams or pump-and-dump schemes.Doege ($DOEGE)A fun alternative version of Dogecoin called Doege ($DOEGE) is pumping on Solana on Friday.It was last up 35,600% in 24 hours as per DEXScreener.But its market cap remains modest at just $800,000, with $100,000 in locked liquidity.It seems to have decent community support though, with 563 “rocket” votes on DEXScreener versus 28 “shitcoin” and “40” red flag votes.Thicc ($THICC)A shitcoin called $THICC has pumped up 130% in 24 hours, reaching a market cap of $2.7 million.That’s according to DEXScreener, which puts the token’s 24-hour volumes at a massive $30 million.Moreover, over 10,000 unique wallets have traded the pair, an impressive feat.But investors should never ape into a coin purely because of impressive numbers. Always do your own research first.Crypto Alternatives to Consider
Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy.An innocent-looking project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower.A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is getting involved in crypto presales.The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price.These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing.While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales—unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision—savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more.With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market.Here are 14 of the presale projects with the highest potential.See the 14 Cryptocurrencies

Montenegro prosecutor objects to Do Kwon extradition

Montenegro’s Supreme State Prosecutor has challenged the High Court’s decision to deport Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs, to South Korea. The objection stems from a jurisdictional dispute, suggesting the court may have exceeded its powers. The Supreme State Prosecutor’s stance underscores a critical review of the extradition process, pointing towards a potential overreach in the High Court’s authority. This development adds a layer of complexity to Kwon’s ongoing legal battle following his arrest in March 2023 for allegedly using counterfeit documents.The controversy arises amidst efforts to hold Kwon accountable for the collapse of Terraform Labs in May 2022. The incident led to a staggering $40 billion loss in the crypto market, triggering a global outcry for justice. Kwon faces charges in both the United States and South Korea, with his extradition from Montenegro being a focal point of international legal proceedings. The Supreme State Prosecutor’s report highlights procedural errors in the extradition process, emphasizing the exclusive right of the Justice Minister to make such decisions.The Supreme State Prosecutor’s intervention questions the procedural integrity of the extradition decision. It suggests that the High Court acted beyond its legal bounds, sparking a debate over the appropriate jurisdiction for such a critical matter.The challenge to the High Court’s ruling highlights the delicate balance between judicial authority and the procedural norms governing extradition cases. This objection by Montenegro’s highest legal authority has put the spotlight on the extradition process’s adherence to legal protocols, especially in high-profile cases involving significant financial implications and international relations.Moreover, the international community closely watches the unfolding legal drama, given its implications for cross-border legal cooperation and the fight against financial crimes in the digital age. The case of Do Kwon and Terraform Labs has become a touchstone for regulatory and legal frameworks dealing with cryptocurrency markets. As Kwon awaits the resolution of his extradition case, the legal principles at stake go beyond individual accountability, touching upon broader issues of jurisdiction, international law, and the challenges of policing the digital frontier.The Supreme State Prosecutor‘s challenge to the High Court’s extradition ruling sets the stage for further legal scrutiny. It brings into question the division of powers within Montenegro’s legal system and the roles of different authorities in extradition cases.This development could potentially delay or complicate Kwon’s extradition to South Korea, adding another chapter to the already intricate legal proceedings. With Han Chang-joon, Kwon’s associate, already deported to South Korea, the contrast in the handling of the two cases underscores the legal complexities surrounding international extradition requests.As the legal community and international observers await further developments, the focus remains on the principles and procedures that govern such extradition cases. The involvement of the Supreme State Prosecutor not only highlights the challenges in executing international legal requests but also signifies the importance of due process and jurisdictional clarity.The case against Do Kwon continues to unravel, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of legal systems and the intricacies of international law. Montenegro’s response to this jurisdictional challenge will be closely monitored, as it could have far-reaching implications for extradition law and the international legal order.

UN adopts AI safety and security resolution sponsored by the US - Crypto Briefing




The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has adopted a global artificial intelligence (AI) resolution on March 21, aiming to promote “safe, secure, and trustworthy” AI development while ensuring it does not threaten human rights.The eight-page document, co-sponsored by over 120 countries, was adopted without a vote, representing unanimous support among all 193 UN member states. The resolution calls for member states and stakeholders to refrain from deploying AI in ways that are inconsistent with international human rights laws.The UNGA acknowledged the varying technological advancements across countries and called for efforts to bridge this development gap. The resolution also encourages governments to develop safeguards, practices, and standards for AI development, and it calls on specialized agencies and UN-related agencies to address issues surround the technology.
“Critically, the resolution makes clear that protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms must be central to the development and use of AI systems,” said U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in a statement.
The United States played a key role in the adoption of the resolution, serving as the primary sponsor after four months of negotiations with other countries. Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the importance of creating and strengthening international rules on AI and other technologies, calling the resolution a “historic step toward establishing clear international norms.”The UN’s global resolution follows other recent efforts to regulate the rapidly growing AI industry. The European Parliament voted in favor of an AI Act on March 13, which aims to set governance standards for the region. The European Commission also launched an inquiry into the use of AI by major online tech companies based on a separate Digital Services Act on March 14.Under the Biden administration, AI and other emerging technologies such as crypto have seen both support and scrutiny. In the US, President Joe Biden signed an executive order in October 2023 that addresses various safety and security issues related to development and use. The administration also went on to approve an inquiry into Bitcoin mining, citing its India also introduced requirements related to AI in March ahead of the country’s national elections.

HECO Chain exploiter anonymizes $145M of Ether on Tornado Cash in 8 days

A crypto wallet address linked to the HECO Chain exploiter transferred and anonymized nearly 40,392 Ether (ETH) on the crypto-mixing protocol Tornado Cash in eight days.According to crypto investigator PeckShield, the HECO Chain exploiter made 19 outbound transfers to Tornado Cash addresses in an attempt to make approximately $145.7 million worth of stolen Ether nearly impossible to trace.Source: PeckShieldThe majority of the funds were sent to a single Tornado Cash address, while one transaction of 0.2 ETH worth $699 was sent separately to a different address in Tornado Cash.In its largest transaction, the HECO Chain exploiter sent 11,300 ETH worth roughly $39.5 million in one transfer. Crypto hackers often resort to routing their loot through Tornado Cash to anonymize the ownership of the funds.

Solana to outpace Ethereum in consumer applications - Former head of growth

The Solana blockchain will overtake Ethereum in terms of consumer applications, Matty Taylor, the co-founder of Colosseum and former head of growth at the Solana Foundation, told Cointelegraph in an interview:“Solana will continue, as shown over the last year, to outpace Ethereum in terms of getting consumer applications and end-user experiences to the level of Web3 in terms of utilizing the chain’s performance to create fast and user-friendly applications.”There are currently 1,668 decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network, over three times more than the 477 in the Solana ecosystem, according to data from Alchemy. Solana has often been touted as a so-called Ethereum-killer for having superior transaction throughput and faster transaction finality than Ethereum.The downfall of FTX and the bear market that followed was a crucible moment for the Solana ecosystem, which acquired more and more developers despite the falling price of the Solana (SOL) token. According to Taylor:“Over the last three to four months as we came out of the bear market, everyone realized that Solana as a network had gone through an important crucible moment that most L1 ecosystems had gone through, [like] Mount Gox with Bitcoin…The 2020 bear market was that crucible moment, but Solana came out much stronger than ever and there's more developers building.”Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $49.7 billion, which is over 10 times bigger than Solana’s $4.01 billion TVL, according to DefiLlama data.Ethereum/Solana TVL Chart.

JPMorgan Analysts Warn: Bitcoin's Sharp Correction May Not Be Over | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a tumultuous week for cryptocurrency markets, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant correction, plummeting by over 15% before staging a rebound following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday. 







However, as an article by Will Canny for CoinDesk pointed out earlierntoday, JPMorgan (JPM) analysts caution that the sell-off may not be over, as market positioning still appears overbought, according to a research report released on Thursday.



The report, authored by a team led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, highlights the considerable optimism prevalent in the market regarding the prospect of prices rising significantly by the end of the year. A significant component of this optimism stems from the belief that Bitcoin demand via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will persist at the same pace, even as the supply of bitcoin diminishes following the upcoming halving event.



The bitcoin halving, a quadrennial occurrence where miners’ rewards are reduced by half, is expected to take place on 20 April 2024. This event has historically been associated with increased market anticipation and price volatility.







However, JPMorgan’s analysts point out that the pace of net inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs has slowed down considerably, with a significant outflow recorded in the past week. This development challenges the notion that the spot bitcoin ETF flow picture will be characterized by a sustained one-way net inflow.







The report suggests that as the halving event approaches, profit-taking is more likely to continue, particularly given the current positioning backdrop that still appears overbought, despite the correction witnessed in the past week.



The recent outflow from spot bitcoin ETFs raises concerns about the sustainability of the market’s optimism and the potential impact on bitcoin’s price trajectory. If the trend of slowing inflows and increased outflows persists, it could indicate a shift in investor sentiment and potentially lead to further price corrections.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Moreover, the overbought positioning mentioned in the report suggests that the market may be due for a more significant pullback, as investors look to lock in profits ahead of the halving event. This profit-taking behavior could exacerbate the downward pressure on bitcoin’s price in the short term.



For a more optimistic outlook, it is worth looking at what Anthony Pompliano is saying.



In a solo podcast episode, Pompliano, Founder of Pomp Investments, explored the intricacies of the potential Bitcoin supercycle. Pompliano emphasizes the significance of understanding Bitcoin’s historical cycles and the impact of halving events, which have historically preceded substantial price increases, showcasing the asset’s resilience and growth potential.



Pompliano acknowledges the unique aspects of the current Bitcoin cycle, such as deviations from past patterns and unprecedented drawdowns. However, he argues that these anomalies highlight Bitcoin’s underlying strength and adaptability, hinting at the possibility of an impending supercycle.



Pompliano challenges the notion of Bitcoin as merely a beneficiary of low-interest rates, asserting that its behavior aligns more with global liquidity trends. He explains how, despite efforts to tighten financial conditions, increased global liquidity has propelled Bitcoin’s price upward.



The transformative impact of spot Bitcoin ETFs on market accessibility and institutional adoption receives significant attention in Pompliano’s discourse. With over $60 billion in ETFs contributing to Bitcoin’s visibility and legitimacy, these financial instruments have played a crucial role in broadening the investor base.



Pompliano remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, acknowledging the market’s cyclic nature while believing in the asset’s potential for significant price appreciation. He encourages investors to educate themselves on Bitcoin’s foundational principles, market dynamics, and expert analyses to foster informed decision-making.

Ripple CEO challenges SEC over Ethereum security status

Ripple‘s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has publicly voiced his opinion on the ongoing legal efforts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to classify Ethereum (ETH) as a security. Taking to the X platform, Garlinghouse remarked on the SEC’s past legal challenges within the cryptocurrency sector, noting the commission’s historical difficulties. He referenced the SEC’s attempts to regulate the crypto industry, including its notable legal dispute with Ripple over XRP. Garlinghouse highlighted the SEC’s failure to win its case against XRP and questioned when the commission would acknowledge its potential defeat in trying to classify ETH similarly.The debate around Ethereum’s classification has intensified following Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal‘s public defense of ETH. Grewal’s comments, supporting the argument that Ethereum does not meet the criteria of security, have added weight to the discussion. This comes in the wake of the SEC’s unsuccessful bid to categorize XRP as a security, a decision finalized by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in July 2023.SEC expands oversight with crypto lawsuits surgeThe legal journey of XRP sheds light on the complex regulatory landscape facing cryptocurrencies in the U.S. In 2020, the SEC accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security. However, after a protracted legal battle, Judge Torres ruled that XRP itself is not a security. Furthermore, she found that many of Ripple’s transactions involving XRP did not constitute investment contracts. Despite this, Ripple faced a partial setback when the court concluded that its institutional sales violated U.S. laws. The ramifications of this violation are pending, with the SEC scheduled to file a brief on remedies.The SEC’s endeavors extend beyond Ripple, aiming to bring the broader U.S. crypto industry under its regulatory scope. The commission has initiated lawsuits against several exchanges and has labeled various cryptocurrencies as securities, such as SOL, MATIC, and ADA. Its latest move to categorize Ethereum as a security has surprised many, given previous statements by SEC officials indicating that Ethereum falls outside the commission’s regulatory domain.Ethereum ETF hopes dampened by SEC actionsThe potential classification of Ethereum as a security carries significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. In 2018, Bill Hinman, the former director of corporate finance at the SEC, stated that ETH was not considered a security. This stance facilitated the treatment of Ethereum as a commodity, with futures contracts listed on CFTC-registered exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). A reversal of this position could hinder the launch of a spot-based Ethereum ETF, a development eagerly anticipated by crypto enthusiasts.Expectations for an Ethereum ETF had been high, with predictions of approval by May 2024. However, the SEC’s recent actions have dampened hopes for a timely launch. The outcome of the SEC’s legal campaign against Ethereum remains uncertain, with potential consequences for regulatory approaches and the future of cryptocurrency investments in the U.S.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s statements reflect broader industry concerns about the SEC’s regulatory strategies. As the legal landscape continues to evolve, the crypto community watches closely, understanding that the outcome of these disputes could shape the regulatory and operational environment for years to come.

Bitcoin Investment Analysis with Kiyosaki and Schiff


                                Kiyosaki vs Schiff Towards Bitcoin and Self-Custody Importance                                In recent discussions about investment strategies, two well-known figures have offered contrasting perspectives on Bitcoin and how investors should approach it. Robert Kiyosaki, famous for his bestseller "Rich Dad Poor Dad," Book and Peter Schiff, a well-known advocate for gold, offer contrasting opinions highlighting the opportunities and challenges facing cryptocurrency investors.Kiyosaki on Bitcoin vs Schiff on Bitcoin ETFsRobert Kiyosaki, the author who brought us Rich Dad Poor Dad, is telling us to jump on the Bitcoin train while we can. He's basically saying, "If you've got the cash, grab as much Bitcoin as you can." Why? Well, he's looking at what's happening in China and around the world and seeing that now might not be the best time to put your money in traditional stuff like stocks and bonds. Instead, he's all about real assets like gold, silver, and especially Bitcoin.Simply, According to Kiyosaki, this is not the time to invest in traditional assets like stocks and bonds but rather to focus on tangible assets such as gold, silver, and the increasingly favored Bitcoin.On the other hand, Peter Schiff, an important gold advocate and economist, has raised concerns about the limitations of owning Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Schiff highlighted the issue of liquidity limitations during non-trading hours, emphasizing the frustration of being unable to trade during market crashes or significant price movements. Schiff's warnings also extended to the vulnerability of Bitcoin ETFs to risky trading behavior, which could worsen market volatility.To know why Bitcoin ETFs are Beneficial, read our coingabbar blog.The Importance of Self-CustodyBut here's where it gets interesting. People who love Bitcoin are saying, "Hey, why not just hold onto your own Bitcoin instead of going through an ETF?" It's like keeping your cash in your own pocket instead of depending on a bank. You have more control, especially when things get wild in the markets.Schiff's criticism of Bitcoin ETFs has sparked discussions about the importance of self-custody in the cryptocurrency space. Many Bitcoin supporters argue that owning Bitcoin directly, without depending on third-party custodians like ETFs, provides greater control and security.James Seyffart, an ETF analyst, acknowledges that liquidity challenges are not unique to Bitcoin ETFs but apply across various asset classes. This highlights a broader issue in the ETF market rather than a specific flaw with Bitcoin.Simon Dixon, CEO of Bank To The Future, emphasizes the convenience and control of self-custody, especially compared to traditional assets like physical gold. He suggests that owning Bitcoin directly is simpler and more accessible for investors.Bryce Clark, an entrepreneur, echoes Dixon's sentiments, advising investors to take charge of their crypto assets and avoid trusting intermediaries like ETFs.Dave Weisberger, a digital assets advocate, sees the shift towards digital assets as unavoidable, highlighting the benefits of 24/7 trading, quick settlements, and decentralized control.Key Takeaways for InvestorsThe advice from Kiyosaki and Schiff, along with the focus on self-custody by Bitcoin supporters, provides important lessons for investors.	Bitcoin as a Digital Gold - Kiyosaki's support of Bitcoin as a digital store of value highlights its growing acceptance among mainstream investors seeking alternatives to traditional assets.	Risks of Bitcoin ETFs - Schiff's view stresses the importance of understanding the risks associated with ETFs, particularly in volatile markets.	Self-Custody and Control - The call for self-custody resonates with investors looking to have direct control over their cryptocurrency holdings, emphasizing security and independence.	Navigating the Digital Economy - As the financial landscape evolves towards digital assets, investors are encouraged to stay informed, exercise caution, and explore options that align with their risk tolerance and investment goals.Overall – What You Need to KnowUltimately, what we can gather from these discussions is that it's crucial to make smart choices and stay on top of your cryptocurrency investments in today's digital world. Both Kiyosaki and Schiff may have different views, but they highlight the importance of being well-informed and taking an active approach to managing your investments.Looking at the bigger picture, these conversations show how investment strategies are constantly changing and becoming more diverse. Kiyosaki encourages us to grab opportunities in Bitcoin and other tangible assets, while Schiff reminds us that having control and self-custody over our investments is key in the digital asset world.Also read - PINK Memecoin Launched by Polkadot on Parachains

Worldcoin Implements Features Allowing Users to Custody Their Data Exclusively on Personal Devices - The Daily Hodl


								A privacy-focused altcoin that uses eye-scanning artificial intelligence (AI) technology is implementing a new custody feature that will allow users to store their data on personal devices.
In a new blog post, Worldcoin (WLD), created by OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, says that the change will increase Worldcoin’s utility in general and is a step toward “solidifying the project’s user-centric architecture.”










“Personal data custody, or Personal Custody, means that the information (images, metadata and derived data) generated at the orb and used to generate the iris code during World ID verification is held on your device. This approach gives you control over the flow of this data – not just deletion, but any future use prior to being deleted.”
According to Worldcoin, since the end result of the new feature is a package of encrypted data that resides on a user’s device, that same information will be deleted from the project’s orb.
“Since all data is encrypted by your public key, the end result of this process is a collection of encrypted data packages that reside exclusively on your device. 
Your information is always deleted from the orb once it has been sent to your device, and the use of double encryption within the end-to-end encryption envelope is a safeguard to protect the confidentiality and privacy of your data in the event your device is compromised.”
Earlier this month, Worldcoin was ordered by the government of Spain to stop collecting data after many users complained about privacy issues.
WLD is trading for $8.22 at time of writing, a 1.3% increase during the last 24 hours.

Short squeeze alert: 2 cryptocurrencies with pump potential next week


The cryptocurrency market has cooled down in the past few days after weeks of high volume and volatility. Despite that, open interest levels continue at yearly highs, fueling the threat of short squeezes in some cryptocurrencies.
A short squeeze happens when a significant amount of traders carrying short positions are forced out through liquidations when the underlying asset reaches a pre-determined price region. Essentially, the higher the market’s open interest in a cryptocurrency, the higher the chances of squeezing downwards or upwards.
Finbold gathered data from CoinGlass on March 22 and spotted two cryptocurrencies to watch for next week.


Short squeeze alert for Ethereum (ETH)
In particular, Ethereum (ETH) has seen an increase in short positions, which created significant liquidity pools to the upside.
The $3,700 zone has the larger amount of liquidations in the weekly time frame, making it a possible target. However, a short squeeze could drive ETH’s price to as high as $3,900 – a 15% pump from $3,380.

Notably, the derivative market open interest in Ethereum reached record levels on March 14 and continues to hold strong. As of writing, over $13 billion in contracts remain open for the second-largest cryptocurrency.

Potential pump for Chainlink (LINK) next week
In the meantime, Chainlink (LINK) also shows record volumes in futures, signaling potential volatility and liquidations are on the edge.

As for liquidations, a short squeeze could pump LINK to above $20 per token. This is where the largest liquidity pools lie for Chainlink and would reflect gains superior to 10% from current prices.

Nevertheless, these liquidation levels do not guarantee any further price action and traders can close their short positions before being liquidated.
As observed, opening leveraged short positions exposes traders to liquidations and incentivizes the market to go in the opposite direction of what most speculators are biased toward.

	                    The open-sourcing of Worldcoin Orb software invites scrutiny into the project's data privacy claims around its iris-scanning technology. 
Image by Andrew Throuvalas, Midjourney.
                        The Worldcoin Orb has open-sourced some of its eyeball-scanning machinery in a bid by founders to verify its claims to data privacy, according to a Friday blog post.Developers can now review the software components of the Worldcoin Orb on Github, where it has been made publicly available under a MIT/Apache 2.0 dual license.Understanding the Worldcoin Orb
The reveal adds to the organization’s pre-existing hardware and iris recognition repositories made available in January 2023 and December 2023 respectively.“Their public availability marks significant progress in making the Orb’s image processing transparent and its privacy claims verifiable,” the Worldcoin Foundation wrote.Worldcoin (WLD) is a crypto project designed to distribute digital tokens to every human being on the planet, creating the foundation for a universal basic income scheme.Doing so requires verifying “humanness” – that each user of the network is actually a one-of-a-kind person, and not artificial intelligence (AI) or a duplicate.Hence, the foundation is spreading a vast network of Worldcoin Orbs throughout the globe, where wanting network participants can peer into the orb, have their iris scanned, verify their identity, and receive tokens.Ensuring Data Privacy Through Open-Source
However, given the ominous nature of “orbs” and “eyeball scanning,” its founders – including Sam Altman – received massive criticism from the crypto community for what seemed like a massive privacy invasion/surveillance tool.According to the Foundation, privacy and security were top priorities in the Orb’s construction, “One privacy-critical step is sending individual data from the Orb to World App for a feature called ‘Personal Custody’. Individuals can use this self-custodied data, for example, for Face Authentication in World App,” they stated.The Foundation added that it may reduce the frequency in which users must visit the orb to re-verify their identity in the future.A white-box audit report by Trail of Bits found that the Orb collects no personally identifiable information from its users besides an Iris code. It also said that it collects no information from users’ devices that have the World App installed.“Further audits are underway and, combined with open sourcing, reflect the Foundation’s aim to maintain a continuously high level of transparency around privacy and security,” the Foundation stated.The WLD token has risen $3.45 to $8,16 over the past three months. In February, the foundation revealed that World App’s daily active user count has crossed 1 million.

Ethereum Insider Unveils Ethereum Founders’ Fraudulent ICOs - Coin Edition


							

Steven Nerayoff unveils the alleged “deceptive evolution” of the Ethereum blockchain.



The Ethereum advisor alleges that Ethereum founders are manipulating the crypto community with fraudulent ICOs.



Nerayoff adds that Ethereum would have been the base of crypto if his ICO proposal had been implemented.




Steven Nerayoff, a former advisor to the Ethereum blockchain, has recently raised his voice against the alleged “deceptive evolution” of Ethereum. In his latest X post, Nerayoff slammed Ethereum founders, claiming their “greed” as the sole reason for SEC’s recent probe into Ethereum and the ETHGate conspiracy theory.







Nerayoff, who has blamed Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and co-founder Joseph Lubin several times for the blockchain’s mischievous journey, once again attacked them. He asserted that Ethereum founders’ ultimate aim is to make the “revolutionary project” nothing more than a “deceptive database controlled by a few to manipulate many.” He added,




Ethereum is built on deceit and lies, and they think you’re all dumb enough to not be the wiser. Well, I am, and I am saying to all of you, don’t allow this to happen a day more. The Ethereum house of deceit must fall once & for all!




In a November post, Nerayoff hinted at a possible truth in the ETHGate theory, arguing that Buterin and Lubin had confidential dealings with the Securities and Securities Commission (SEC) to influence the regulator to frame favorable rules. In a subsequent post, Nerayoff accused Buterin and his team of defrauding the crypto community.









Nerayoff, in his recent revelations, unveiled the fraudulent Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) by Vitalik, which altered Nerayoff’s ICO proposal. He stated,




When I architected the ICO and implemented it with Ethereum, I did this to help them bring Ethereum to life. I saw the endless possibilities of positive change and none of the negatives that they had up their sleeves. My invention was to avoid legal and regulatory issues.




The Ethereum insider added that the blockchain would have been the “base of crypto” if his invention was followed. As per his post, Ethereum founders skipped some significant steps and replicated his ICO proposal, giving rise to fraudulent ICOs.

Solana the ‘Most Popular Blockchain Ecosystem’ in 2024 So Far, According to New CoinGecko Analysis - The Daily Hodl


								Ethereum’s (ETH) leading challenger is dominating global investor interest among blockchains examined by crypto data aggregator CoinGecko.
According to CoinGecko, smart contract platform Solana (SOL) is by far this year’s top blockchain based on an analysis of the web traffic shares of 58 blockchain ecosystems from January 1st to March 18, 2024.










“The Solana ecosystem has emerged as the most popular blockchain ecosystem so far this year, accounting for 49.3% of global crypto investor interest in chain-specific narratives.”
From trading at a low of $101.48 on January 1st, SOL peaked at $209.86 this month. The asset is currently changing hands for $178.77.
CoinGecko says SOL’s rally back to the 2021 highs and the strong performance of key ecosystem project tokens, such as the asset of oracle network Pyth Network (PYTH) and the memecoin dogwifhat (WIF) fuel Solana’s lead.
Ethereum ranks as the second most popular blockchain with 12.73% of investor interest share. The top smart contract platform is followed by crypto exchange Binance’s BNB Smart Chain ecosystem with 5.4%.
“Overall, the 20 most popular blockchain ecosystems represent a combined 97.4% of investor interest towards chain-specific narratives. The remaining 2.6% of interest is spread across another 38 blockchain ecosystems, including the Near Protocol ecosystem which narrowly missed the top 20 ranking.”

                        Cryptocurrencies are no longer on the fringe of finance, and some parents are exploring them as an investment to build their children’s future nest egg.A recent survey found that nearly half (45%) of US parents who own cryptocurrency are already investing it in their children’s future, with 40.6% more planning to join soon.CouponBirds surveyed 1,046 parents in the US between January and March this year, exploring their views on investing in crypto for their children.The top reason for these parents to buy crypto for their kids was the potential for future growth. However, education and currency debasement were also found to be significant motivations.A majority said they approach these investments on a “set it and forget it” basis, intending to leave it untouched until their children are ready to take control.Source: CouponBirdsDanny Baer, a wealth director at Bitcoin life insurer Meanwhile, suggested that instead of viewing Bitcoin as a quick way to make money, it’s wiser to consider it a long-term investment.He explained that from a historical perspective, each Bitcoin price dip has been higher than the previous cycle’s peak. This suggests the asset has been on a 15-year bull run.Long-Term Investment Opportunities
The long-term potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is a topic of debate. While some believe they could become mainstream, there’s no guarantee. However, due to the market’s volatility, experts generally recommend crypto as a long-term investment, ideally held for at least a decade.Identity.com executive director Phillip Shoemaker said the key to investing in Bitcoin is to make frequent, smaller purchases. You buy it, store it safely in a hardware wallet, and then hold onto it for the long term.“You do this with assets like Bitcoin, however, not the more speculative coins,” he told Cryptonews. “But this is one of those things that people should be doing. Gold is a good investment, but Bitcoin is dwarfing all this stuff. So, yes, I would recommend this.”Portfolio Diversification
Cryptocurrency’s rollercoaster price swings, potential security breaches, unclear regulations, and its relatively new existence create a challenging investment landscape.Kelly Ferraro, CEO at River North Communications, said that parents should carefully consider their own risk tolerance before investing. They should also ponder the investment’s long-term time horizon and how it would contribute to diversifying their child’s overall portfolio.For a smart approach, consider talking to a financial advisor and investing a manageable amount as part of a diversified portfolio.“Understanding the legal and tax implications of crypto investments in their region is vital,” she said.“Ultimately, the decision should align with the family’s financial goals, risk appetite, and commitment to ongoing education about the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.”Role of Scarcity in Bitcoin’s Value
Investors should consider Bitcoin’s finite supply, a key differentiator in today’s environment of seemingly limitless central bank money printing, as contributing to its value.Frank Corva, senior digital asset analyst at Finder, advocated for investing in Bitcoin on behalf of children, calling it an “excellent move.” He also predicted a massive price surge for Bitcoin, predicting it could hit $1m by 2030, thanks to its “perfect scarcity.”“Assets like ETH and SOL do not have a hard cap, which makes them a bit more questionable as long-term investments,” he said.Corva added that parents should consider their comfort level with self-custody. Unlike traditional investments, they will need to manage digital assets using a hardware wallet like Trezor. This requires technical knowledge and strong security practices.Negligible Consequences of Small Percentages
The future of cryptocurrency, like any investment, is difficult to predict with certainty. Years or decades from now, it’s unclear how the market will have evolved.Yet, diversifying your money across different assets can potentially improve returns. Limiting risk is equally important, according to Stephen Kates, principal financial analyst at RetireGuide.com.“There is little harm in small, low-single digit percentages within a given investment strategy,” he said. “Any parent who wants to gift or purchase Bitcoin for their children should consider that it should not make up the majority of any investment strategy.”Kates added that seasoned traders swear by position sizing and risk management. Mastering these skills is the ultimate weapon in your trading arsenal.

3 cryptocurrencies under $0.10 to buy next week


As the cryptocurrency market prepares to end the week with many of its assets trading in the red after a period of significant bullishness, some of the best investment opportunities for the week to come are still available at a low price threshold of under $0.10 per wholecoin.
Indeed, Finbold has analyzed the crypto sphere to arrive at the list of several digital assets that are currently changing hands at a price below ten cents apiece and which could represent some of the best purchase choices for crypto traders this week.
#1 Radix (XRD)
In particular, the first is Radix (XRD), the crypto asset of the layer-1 blockchain serving as an interconnected platform for developers of powerful decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which has recently announced the launch of Project Ignition designed to boost liquidity for major cryptos on its platform.



Indeed, Radix recently emerged with strong technical analysis (TA) growth signals that suggest a ‘strong buy,’ and the token is currently trading at the price of $0.0682, advancing 14.78% in the last week during which the majority of the market underperformed, and gaining 42.55% on its monthly chart.

#2 Izumi Finance (IZI)
Meanwhile, the crypto asset of the liquidity-as-a-service (LaaS) platform, Izumi Finance (IZI), is eyeing massive gains in the near future, as it has recently announced a partnership with Build On Bitcoin (BOB), the hybrid layer-2 network connecting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) security and liquidity.

Bolstered by the strong positive sentiment around this partnership, as well as many others, IZI has increased by 11.97% in the past week, as well as adding up to the monthly advance of 33.99%, currently trading at $0.01933, as per the most recent chart information retrieved on March 22.

#2 Nervos Network (CKB)
Finally, Nervos Network (CKB), a Proof-of-Work (PoW) platform that allows developers to create dApps deployable on various blockchain systems, continues to work hard on developing its network, including by bringing more people on its team.

Thanks to its exceptionally positive indicators and price performance above the multiple moving averages (MA) in recent days, the CKB price has managed to grow by 10.16% in the last week and as much as 110.48% across the past month, reaching the price of $0.0211.

Conclusion
Overall, the above cryptocurrencies under $0.10 might, indeed present good opportunities for purchase this week. However, it is important to do one’s own detailed research and carefully weigh all the risks before investing a significant amount of money into any of them.

U.Today presents you with the top three news stories over the past day.Major Bitcoin ETF warning made by Samson MowThis week saw astonishing outflows from spot-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, with $742 million leaving the ETFs within three days. As suggested by experts, the primary cause for these outflows is yet another massive withdrawal of Bitcoin from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC); investors are exiting Grayscale as it charges significantly higher fees than its competitors on the ETF market. Among those who reacted to the outflow news was Samson Mow, CEO at Jan3 and "$1 billion per BTC" advocate. In his latest X post, Mow expressed his optimism regarding the future of Bitcoin and its price surge, writing that he believes in withdrawals eventually turning back into inflows. Thus, he advised the Bitcoin community to "plan accordingly."Litecoin (LTC) gets major core upgrade; Here's implicationAs recently shared by the Litecoin Foundation team on the X platform, Litecoin has undergone a core upgrade, bringing a number of significant improvements to the LTC network. Litecoin Core v0.21.3rc3, or Litecoin Core 0.21.3 release candidate, is a new minor version release, including new features, various bug fixes and important security updates. Among the noteworthy changes brought on by the core upgrade are major security enhancements that strengthen Litecoin's security measures against possible attacks and vulnerabilities. The latest release contains fixes for CVE-2023-33297, which allows an attacker to cause a remote bandwidth and CPU denial of service, an attack that has been exploited in the wild. The upgrade demonstrates Litecoin's dedication to improving its functionality and technology, marking a crucial milestone in the project's ongoing progress.Shiba Inu receives adoption boost with major new exchange's addition of BONEIn a recent X post, Gate, a major crypto exchange, revealed plans to boost the trading potential of BONE, Shiba Inu ecosystem's token.

US government asks for court approval to sell private jets tied to Sam Bankman-Fried

Prosecutors in the United States government’s case against Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried proposed a court order to sell two private aircraft before the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings against the former FTX CEO.In a March 22 filing with U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said the government sought to execute an interlocutory sale of two planes tied to FTX and SBF “to prevent their devaluation.” Prosecutors argued in October 2023 that the Bombardier Global and Embraer Legacy aircraft were subject to forfeiture due to their ties to Bankman-Fried’s criminal case.It’s unclear what price tag the government intends to use for the aircraft, which cost $15.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively, according to October 2023 court filings. Prosecutors said they intended to reimburse up to $1.8 million related to maintenance and upkeep and $183,000 for delivery of the Legacy, assuming the proceeds from the sale were sufficient.Source: Byron YorkAccording to Williams, prosecutors reached an agreement with FTX and related parties to have the Embraer Legacy delivered to a Florida airport where the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) can begin proceedings for a sale “in a timely fashion.” The USMS already has custody of the Bombardier Global following a February 2023 warrant.Related: FTX victims will ‘never’ be whole thanks to SBF’s ‘dumpster fire’ — John RayThe luxury jets are just a few of the assets tied to Bankman-Fried subject to forfeiture following his criminal conviction. A March filing listed assets including Robinhood stock, fiat currency in U.S. dollars, cryptocurrency in Binance and Binance.US accounts and political contributions SBF made during his time as FTX CEO. Bankman-Fried and his attorney, Marc Mukasey, did not object to the aircraft sale.  The former FTX was convicted of seven felony counts in November 2023 and is behind bars while awaiting a March 28 sentencing hearing. Prosecutors have recommended that SBF serve 40 to 50 years, while his attorneys have asked a judge to impose a 6.5-year sentence.Magazine: Can you trust crypto exchanges after the collapse of FTX?

Ethereum Dencun upgrade lowers transaction fees for L2s

A week on from the launch of Dencun, Ethereum’s latest update appears to be meeting expectations and, in some instances, surpassing them.Dencun launched on March 13 with the promise of ushering in a new era of faster and cheaper transactions. Ethereum has historically struggled to ratchet up the speed of its base layer in line with demand, so Dencun shifts focus by scaling with the aid of layer 2s.According to Brian Gallagher, co-founder of Partisia blockchain, the update is not a minute too soon as competition from rival blockchains threatens to erode Ethereum’s market dominance.“The timing for Ethereum to launch its Dencun update [couldn’t] wait any longer,” Gallagher told Cointelegraph. “It’s undeniable that Solana is growing its market share away from Ethereum, particularly in the new token launch, on-chain DEX [decentralized exchange] swaps and NFT [nonfungible token] arenas, where retail traders tend to hang out.”Gallagher added, “It is simply far too expensive to make on-chain transactions still on Ethereum, so alternatives like Solana are rising up to the occasion.”As Gallagher points out, the comparison of fees is not currently flattering for Ethereum. Typical fees on Ethereum are anything from $1–20. This starkly contrasts Solana, where fees are a fraction of a cent. As recently as March 5, fees on Ethereum soared above $30. Ethereum fees are a longstanding problemEthereum’s scaling issues are nothing new. The matter first grew acute when transaction fees rose from under $1 to the $5 mark in September 2020, then above $20 at the end of 2021 and through into 2022. On April 30, 2022, the average fee soared to an all-time high of $197. Previous upgrades to the Ethereum network have attempted to improve the speed and scalability of Ethereum’s base layer. The most significant of these was the Merge, which occurred on Sept. 15, 2022, and completed Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.The Merge may have made Ethereum more energy efficient, but if there were any small reductions to transaction fees, they weren’t to last. By March 2023, fees were beginning to creep upward once more.Recent: Bitcoin price retraces 30 days ahead of halving in historical patternDencun is different. Instead of attempting to make Ethereum’s base layer more scalable, Dencun focuses on improving interactions with layer 2s, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, making them cheaper. In theory, Dencun’s improvements should incentivize and encourage users to shift traffic from Ethereum’s layer 1, spreading the traffic to other networks.Source: Optimism/While Dencun is still in its infancy, the early feedback is encouraging. Dencun promised to drop fees on layer 2s by a factor of 10. Data from Dune Analytics shows it has succeeded in that aim and, in some cases, even surpassed it. According to L2 Fees, transaction costs on Optimism and Arbitrum are now below $0.01.Reasons to celebrate DencunWith Dencun delivering right out of the gate, there is a palpable sense of excitement among many within the Ethereum community.Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), is among those lauding the development. Johnson told Cointelegraph: “The Dencun upgrade ushers in a new era for Ethereum, in terms of economic sustainability. For so long, layer 2 developers have incurred costly transaction fees that have hindered accessibility to the network. The ENS developer team is looking forward to improved accessibility for Ethereum.”As for those layer 2s Johson referenced, the buzz from their camps has been noticeable.Arbitrum took to X to declare Dencun, “One of the biggest upgrades to support layer 2s in scaling Ethereum,” while Optimism said, “Today is going to be a good day.”Given that Dencun has already lowered transaction costs by more than 90%, the general mood of positivity appears justified.Source: ArbitrumMore to doDencun may have succeeded in its initial goals, but the market will determine what happens next. For Dencun to truly succeed, Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync Era, Loopring, Polygon and others will need to pry users away from the Ethereum base layer.Recent: Greens’ push to end German cryptocurrency tax exemption sparks debateThe early signs are encouraging here, too. Data from GrowThePie shows that transaction volume on Arbitrum has increased by 145% in the last seven days, while Optimism has increased by 144%. On-base transaction volume has increased by 203% over the same period.Gallagher says that with Dencun up and running, the focal point over the longer term “will be on DeFi [decentralized finance] and how this upgrade potentially increases speed and lowers cost. If it fails to lower costs significantly, then I believe market share will continue to grow on other chains that are faster and more affordable.”Given that Dencun is yet to be tested against everything the crypto market can throw at it, Gallagher’s note of caution is a reminder against complacency. But for the moment, Ethereum’s latest upgrade looks like a job well done.

Ripple CEO Predicts Setback For US SEC In Ethereum Case, Similar To XRP | Bitcoinist.com


								The legal battle between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ethereum (ETH) has transformed into an intriguing case within the entire cryptocurrency landscape, with several experts predicting possible outcomes regarding the dispute.
Ripple CEO Warns US SEC’s Inevitable Defeat Against Ethereum
As the battle wages on, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple Labs Brad Garlinghouse, has revealed his optimistic insights on the case, while sharing a daring prediction in favor of the Ethereum ecosystem. His positive insights came in light of reports that the SEC is attempting to classify Ethereum “as a security” through its legal dispute with the digital asset.

Brad Garlinghouse has predicted that the US regulatory watchdog is most likely to “lose its war against Ethereum” – the second largest cryptocurrency asset. According to Garlinghouse, the Commission’s several “attempts to include the cryptocurrency industry in legal battles have resulted in severe court losses” over time.
As a result, the agency is now “lagging behind its foreign counterparts” and “competing with other regulators” such as the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
The Ripple CEO then posed a question, “When would the SEC realize that it would not be able to continue fighting to categorize Ethereum as a security, as it did with XRP?”
It is noteworthy that Coinbase submitted self-certifications with the CFTC on March 7, which could pave the way for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC) futures Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), if the CTFC has no complaints against it.
Consequently, the SEC’s prospects of overturning the “Programmatic Sales of XRP” ruling might be impacted by the categorization of these aforementioned tokens as commodities by the CFTC. This could be one of the reasons why the SEC could be fighting the CFTC.
Ripple’s Partial Victories Against The SEC
Ripple first secured a partial win in its lawsuit with the agency when Judge Analisa Torres declared in July last year that programmatic sales of XRP do not meet the requirements of the third prong of the Howey Test. Also, three months later, the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal against the programmatic sales order was denied by the US Judge.

Due to the order, the SEC will be unable to file an appeal until the conclusion of the ongoing SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. It is believed that the resolution of this dispute may have a profound impact on the US regulatory landscape and the cryptocurrency landscape as a whole.
The long-running legal dispute between Ripple and the US SEC began in 2020 when the Commission accused Ripple of selling XRP to US investors as an unregistered security. However, the lengthy battle is slowly approaching its climax as the grand trial is scheduled to take place by April 23.

The Shiba Inu team lead, known by the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama, seems to be continuing with his travels around the globe. The SHIB community keeps watching his location tags changing on X/Twitter.The most recent one has raised a heated and rather humorous discussion among members of the SHIB community. Here’s where the mysterious Shytoshi Kusama has been spotted this time around.Kusama heads for the Maldives, here's potential reasonJapanese SHIB army member @kuro_9696_9696 has tweeted to spread the word about Shytoshi Kusama’s new location – the Maldives.On March 19, he was spotted in New York City thanks to X, and prior to that, in March, his location tags on Twitter included Japan, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico and several cities in the U.S. SHIB’s lead developer Kaal Dhairya has also been moving around – his location tag showed Dubai.Last year, one of Kusama’s location tags showed that he visited Niseko, Japan. At about the same time, he published a message in Discord saying that he was taking a chance to relax and enjoy himself “just like everyone else.” The SHIB community concluded that Shiba Inu lead and Ryoshi's partner in building SHIB was finally on vacation. Since the Maldives is also known as a popular resort destination, odds are that Shytoshi Kusama is also relaxing on the beach at the moment. In the comments thread, some users giggled at Kusama moving from one country to another so fast, saying things like: “I’m convinced Shy’s a pilot or he’s flying on Shiba airlines” and “Since Shytoshi is a Saiyan, he can fly at high speed.”SHIB burn rate plungesAccording to data shared by Shibburn, within the last 24 hours, the SHIB army has succeeded in disposing of a large SHIB amount: almost 10 million. This is much smaller than was burned on Thursday though. The overall burn rate has plunged by more than 70%.The two largest burn transactions on this list carried 4,111,000 and 4,000,000 SHIB to unspendable blockchain addresses.In the meantime, activity on layer-2 blockchain Shibarium, which allows the SHIB army to conduct their personal SHIB burns, has dropped significantly recently. At the time of this writing, this metric has reached a low of 48,730 transactions.

Bitcoin In 'Danger Zone' Ahead Of Halving: Trader Warns Of Potential Price Drop - Benzinga

Even as Bitcoin nose-dived nearly 4% on Friday slipping down to $64,000 levels, the decline comes amid warnings from a pseudonymous crypto trader, who has indicated that the largest digital currency has officially entered the “danger zone,” a period historically associated with pre-halving price retracements.According to Rekt Capital, “It's been two days since Bitcoin officially entered the ‘danger zone' where historical pre-halving retraces have begun.” With the halving event approximately 26 days away, Bitcoin has seen a significant pullback of nearly 18% since last week. The trader highlights the uncertainty surrounding whether the bottom of this retrace has been reached, but emphasizes the potential for further downside within this critical time window.Drawing parallels with past cycles, Rekt Capital notes, “In 2016, Bitcoin performed its pre-halving retrace approximately 28 days before the halving.”Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Coinbase UK CEO Pinpoints Bitcoin’s Rise, Calls Coin A Viable Alternative For Millions In Benzinga Interview“In 2024, Bitcoin performed its pre-halving retrace approximately 32 days before the halving,” the trader added. The analysis points out a pattern of initial strong reactions followed by further retracements, as observed in the 2016 cycle, suggesting that Bitcoin may need to maintain its current highs to avoid a repeat of past downturns.Looking ahead, Rekt Capital speculates on the timing of Bitcoin’s next bull market peak, stating, “Bitcoin tends to perform a bull market top 266-315 days after it breaks its old all-time high.” Given that Bitcoin broke its previous all-time highs last week, the analyst predicts the next peak could occur between late November 2024 and late January 2025. Extending this forecast further, adjustments for the duration beyond old all-time highs could push the bull market peak to mid-December 2024 or mid-February 2025.Read Next: Global Money Transfer Revolution?

Ethereum Surprise Shift: 420,000 ETH Lands on Exchanges

According to crypto analyst Ali, nearly 420,000 Ethereum (ETH) have been transferred to various crypto exchanges over the past three weeks. This steady shift of ETH, valued at approximately $1.47 billion, has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike.The influx of such a large volume of Ethereum to exchanges is noteworthy because it can imply a variety of strategies by holders. Typically, large-scale transfers to exchanges can suggest that investors are preparing to sell, potentially leading to a price drop. However, the ETH token shift remains a subject of speculation. The move could be a response to recent market recoveries, with investors looking to take profits. It may also be related to institutional investors or large holders, known as "whales," adjusting their portfolios in anticipation of future market movements.The total value of the ETH moved, around $1.47 billion, might be substantial enough to impact the market. Ethereum's price has been subject to volatility in recent weeks, and movements of this scale can contribute to price fluctuations.At the time of writing, ETH was down 4.75% in the last 24 hours to $3,345, mirroring general market declines and down 10.21% weekly. ETH remains significantly down from highs of $4,093 attained on March 12.ETH long-term investors remain steadfastAccording to a recent analysis provided by Lucas Outumuro, Head of Research at IntoTheBlock, the amount of ETH in wallets that have been holding for over a year continues to hit new highs.  Despite reports of the SEC attempting to reassess Ether's classification as a security and decreased odds of an ETF being approved, ETH's long-term investors appear not to be selling.Overall, ETH investors remain optimistic following the Dencun upgrade. This week saw the biggest amount of ETH exchanged on Mainnet since May 2022. ETH's daily average volume has been on an upward trend, similar to the early bull market in 2020-2021.In contrast to the last bull market, layer 2s (L2s) have dominated, with the total number of transactions on Base, Optimism and Arbitrum being more than double that of Mainnet. The number of ETH on L2s recently crossed 10 million for the first time, having doubled since last year.

Tether Adds $5.25B in Market Cap Liquidity: Is It a Good Thing? - DailyCoin


        
The surge in Tether’s market cap has pointed to a growing demand for stablecoins in the crypto space.



Stablecoins have provided stability in the volatile crypto market and have acted as a safe haven for investors.



The growth of Tether liquidity has outpaced Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting a deeper pool of stablecoin capital.
The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a surge in liquidity, fueled by a significant increase in the market capitalization of Tether (USDT), the leading stablecoin in the ecosystem. Since the beginning of March, Tether’s market cap has climbed by over $5.25 billion, indicating a growing demand for stablecoins within the crypto space.Tether Market Cap’s Upward TrendThis rise in stablecoin funding is a positive sign for overall market health. Stablecoins pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar provide stability within the often volatile cryptocurrency market. They act as a safe haven for investors seeking to enter or exit positions in other cryptocurrencies without converting back to fiat currency. This readily available pool of stablecoins helps meet the buying and selling demands of Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins. For context, the combined growth of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) this month falls short of the increase in USDT liquidity. Despite significant growth, these Bitcoin ETFs have only attracted less than $4 billion in net inflows. This highlights the deeper pool of stablecoin capital currently available, potentially fueling further accumulation of both Bitcoin and altcoins on cryptocurrency exchanges.Tether’s current market capitalization is $104 Billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This represents a steady rise from around $98.65 billion at the start of March, with a brief consolidation period masking the overall upward trend. Is Tether the Backbone of Crypto Trading?However, concerns continue to linger regarding Tether’s reserve backing. Despite these controversies, Tether has undeniably played a crucial role in establishing stability and facilitating large-volume trades within the crypto market. USDT’s dominance is evident, as it forms a trading pair with most altcoins across various cryptocurrency platforms.Looking beyond its role as a stablecoin issuer, Tether Holdings, the company behind USDT, is actively diversifying its operations. They are venturing into Bitcoin mining and development, with significant investments in the sector. On the Flipside
Tether has a history of facing criticism regarding the transparency of its reserves.



While stablecoins offer stability, a sudden surge in USDT issuance could theoretically impact overall market volatility.



If Tether faces issues or loses its peg to the dollar, it could have a cascading effect on the entire crypto market.
Why This MattersThis surge in Tether’s market cap, surpassing the combined growth of Bitcoin ETFs, suggests investors are increasingly comfortable using stablecoins for crypto purchases. This ample liquidity pool could fuel further growth in Bitcoin and altcoin prices, potentially leading to a significant bull run in the broader cryptocurrency market.To learn more about how Tether’s USDT on Celo drives mainstream crypto adoption, read here:How Tether’s USDT on Celo Drives Mainstream Crypto AdoptionTo learn more about Tether (USDT) reaching a market cap of $100 billion, read here:USDT Hits $100B Market Cap as Stablecoins Match Market Rally

Anonymous crypto wallets now illegal in the EU


In a recent regulatory development, cryptocurrency payments of any size using unidentified self-custody crypto wallets are now illegal in the European Union (EU). This decision is part of a set of new anti-money laundering laws (AML) in the continent.
The majority of the EU Parliament’s lead commission approved the prohibition on March 19, according to Patrick Breyer’s post.
Notably, Dr. Breyer is a member of the European Parliament for the Deutsch Piraten Partei and one of the two leaders who opposed this approval. Gunnar Beck was the other Parliament member who voted against it, representing the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

EU’s new AML: Cash and crypto payments made partially illegal
In particular, the new anti-money laundering law prohibits certain thresholds for cash payments and any anonymous crypto payment. On that note, any cash payment above €10,000 will become illegal, while also anonymous cash payments above €3,000.
The prohibition for payments made in cryptocurrencies will be specific to unidentified wallets operated by providers (hosted wallets). This includes any self-custody wallet provided by mobile, desktop, or browser applications.
Furthermore, the now-approved AML package will apply after three years from its entry into force, according to Dillon Eustace. However, the Ireland law firm expects these laws to become fully operational before the usual enforcement timeline. 
Patrick Breyer’s position on making anonymous cash and crypto payments illegal
Breyer is skeptical about the effectiveness of fighting crimes through these laws. Moreover, he highlighted how anonymous payments are a fundamental human right, needed to achieve individual financial freedom.

“Generally prohibiting anonymous payments would at best have minimal effects on crime, but it would deprive innocent citizens of their financial freedom. (…) We have a right to pay and donate online without our personal transactions being recorded.”
– Patrick Breyer

From another perspective, the Piraten Partei’s representative pointed out to the negative economic and social effects of prohibiting sovereign payments.

“This EU war on cash will have nasty repercussions! For thousands of years, societies around the world have lived with privacy-protecting cash. With the creeping abolition of cash, there is a threat of negative interest rates and the risk of banks cutting off the money supply at any time. Dependence on banks is increasing at an alarming rate. This kind of financial disenfranchisement must be stopped.”
– Patrick Breyer


What do EU citizens think about AML prohibiting cash and crypto payments?
Historically, European citizens have already shown resistance against cash payment prohibition of any kind. Patrick Breyer described a “great public outcry” in 2017 when the Commission consulted the public about limiting cash payments.

In his words, “More than 90% of responding citizens spoke out against such a step. Respondents considered paying anonymously in cash an “essential personal freedom” and that “Restrictions on payments in cash are ineffective in achieving the potential objectives (fight against criminal activities, terrorism, tax evasion).”

Additionally, the shadow economy expert Friedrich Schneider believes these measures would have “only minimal lowering effects on crime.”
Conclusion
In conclusion, the new anti-money laundering law will effectively prohibit cryptocurrency payments through self-custody wallets.
Essentially, most crypto networks operate in permissionless networks, where anyone can generate a cryptographic private key, gaining unlimited access to the system. This is one of the core value propositions of cryptocurrencies, as a more accessible, free, and fair approach to finances, which makes no distinction of any kind on its users. 
Experts and freedom advocates consider this recent approval a tough hit against financial freedom and fundamental human rights. On X (formerly Twitter), commentators talk about the resemblance to the dystopic society introduced by George Orwell in the best-seller “1984.”
European citizens and entrepreneurs now wonder if the EU Parliament will have the political strength needed to sustain this approval moving forward.

Silvergate to face lawsuit over alleged FTX exchange fraud

In a significant development within the cryptocurrency banking sector, Silvergate Bank is set to face a class-action lawsuit. This follows allegations from FTX users that the bank played a role in facilitating fraud at the exchange and its affiliate, Alameda Research. The lawsuit received a boost when, on March 20, a federal court in San Diego, under Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro, dismissed Silvergate’s motion for dismissal filed in June. The court found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged Silvergate’s awareness of FTX’s fraudulent activities. Moreover, they argued the bank unjustly enriched itself at the expense of FTX users, a claim Silvergate vehemently denies.Judge Montenegro’s ruling emphasized that Silvergate’s Exchange Network, primarily designed to facilitate fund transfers to crypto exchanges, played a pivotal role in FTX operations. This network, the court noted, was instrumental in the functionality of crypto exchanges like FTX, making Silvergate’s involvement critical to the allegations. The judge highlighted that Silvergate processed transfers and accepted deposits, channeling FTX customer money to Alameda. This, according to the court, was a clear indication of Silvergate’s deep entanglement in the operations and alleged fraudulent activities of FTX and Alameda Research.Court’s findings and Silvergate’s defenseThe lawsuit against Silvergate outlines the bank’s integral role in the operational dynamics between FTX and its users. According to the court’s findings, Silvergate not only processed financial transactions but also accepted deposits that facilitated the alleged fraud. The court pointed out that FTX customers were initially directed to wire money to Alameda’s account due to FTX’s lack of a bank account, further implicating Silvergate in the alleged scheme. The judge underscored that Silvergate had a vested interest in continuing to service FTX and Alameda, given its business model’s reliance on the adoption of the FTX exchange platform and app.In response to the allegations, Silvergate had argued that it did not owe a duty of care to FTX customers, suggesting that its actions were not a substantial factor in the customers’ financial losses. The bank posited that any refusal to process FTX’s transfers would not have prevented the exchange from finding alternative banking services, a claim the judge deemed speculative. This defense was part of Silvergate’s unsuccessful attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, which the court found lacked sufficient merit to warrant dismissal at this stage.Silvergate faces scrutiny after FTX bankruptcyThe lawsuit against Silvergate emerged against the backdrop of the bank’s collapse in March 2023, which occurred approximately five months after FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022. The legal battle underscores the intricate relationships and dependencies within the cryptocurrency banking sector. It also highlights the potential for financial institutions to face legal scrutiny for their roles in facilitating or enabling the operations of crypto exchanges, especially those later found to be involved in fraudulent activities.This case gains further significance with the conviction of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried in November on charges of fraud and money laundering. With his sentencing scheduled for March 28, the lawsuit against Silvergate adds another layer to the complex narrative of legal and financial fallout following FTX’s collapse. As the legal proceedings against Silvergate proceed, the case is set to offer critical insights into the responsibilities and liabilities of banks in the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry.

Insights from RWA Report 2024 Showcase USD Hegemony in Crypto - Coin Edition


							

Tether (USDT) holds a 71.4% market share, followed by USDC and Dai.



Non-USD stablecoins constitute only 1% of the market.



Market cap surged from $5.2B in 2020 to $150.1B in 2022, with gradual growth since.




In a recent revelation from the Real World Asset Report of 2024, the crypto market witnesses a significant dominance of USD-pegged stablecoins staying at the forefront of real-world asset (RWA) adoption within the digital economy.



The report’s key findings suggest that majority of the RWA market is currently occupied by stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. Topping the charts are Tether (USDT), boasting a staggering $96.1 billion market capitalization, closely trailed by USDC with $26.8 billion, and Dai at $4.9 billion. 



Notably, Tether maintains a commanding 71.4% market share keeping up its position within the space. USDC still struggles to reclaim its lost ground following a brief de-pegging incident during the US banking crisis of March 2023.



Diving deeper into the landscape, the report unveils a stark reality of minimal diversification beyond the USD-pegged stablecoins. Alternative fiat-backed stablecoins, such as Euro Tether (EURT), CNH Tether (CNHT), Mexican Peso Tether (MXNT), EURC (EURC), Stasis Euro (EURS), and BiLira (TRYB), collectively constitute a mere 1% of the market share. 









Furthermore, the report sheds light on the trajectory of stable asset market capitalization over the years. From a modest $5.2 billion at the outset of 2020 the stablecoin market rose to an unexpected $150.1 billion peak in March 2022, however, then declining amidst market fluctuations. 



The year 2024 marks a resurgence of the stablecoin witnessing a 4.9% growth in market cap from $128.2 billion at the inception of the year to $134.6 billion as of February 1.

5 Technologies That Could Be Worth $220 Trillion By 2030, Cathie Wood's ARK Predicts: 'The Time Is Now' - ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS:ARKG) - Benzinga

ARK Investment Management LLC predicts that five disruptive technologies could reach a total market value of $220 trillion by 2030. According to the latest white paper, “Platforms Of Innovation – How Converging Technologies Should Propel A Step Change In Economic Growth,” the Cathie Wood-led investment company explores the ascendance of five critical technologies: Artificial Intelligence, Energy Storage, Robotics, Multiomics, and Public Blockchains.These innovations are not merely advancing in isolation. Instead, they are converging, setting the stage for an explosive increase in productivity and economic development.“Our technological forecasts suggest that the time is now — that a new era of accelerating macroeconomic growth will begin this decade,” says ARK chief futurist Brett Winton, who authored the report. Five Catalysts Of Economic Transformation
Artificial Intelligence (AI): Now seamlessly integrated into various sectors, AI is set to turbocharge productivity worldwide. The growth in the AI industry is captured by ARK’s flagship fund, ARK Innovation ETF ARKK. 



Energy Storage: Innovations have leveled the playing field for electric vehicles, making them as economical as traditional gas-powered cars.



Robotics: The proliferation of technologies from reusable rockets to autonomous delivery bots marks a new era in automation. This market is monitored through the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF ARKQ 



Multiomics: Advancements in this field are revealing new dimensions of life and health, promising breakthroughs in biology and medicine. These innovations are tracked by the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF ARKG 



Public Blockchains: Led by the widespread adoption of Bitcoin BTC/USD, blockchain technology challenges the conventional financial order, poised to redefine finance. 
Winton’s analysis predicts that the convergence of these technological platforms will catalyze a step change in market value and economic growth. By 2030, the market value of these disruptive innovations could soar to an estimated $220 trillion, up from the current $19 trillion, marking an average annual growth rate of 42%.Projected Annual Growth Rates (2023-2030)
AI: 37%



Energy Storage: 50%



Public Blockchains: 48%



Robotics: 78%



Multiomic Sequencing: 39%
Drawing parallels with Tesla‘s ascent to a $600 billion market cap, the white paper highlights the potential of innovative companies. Currently, only a small fraction of S&P 500 companies (less than 2%), representing more than 35% of its market cap, exceed this valuation. Looking ahead, ARK Investment expects these technological advancements to push real GDP to $170 trillion by 2030 and further to $470 trillion by 2040.Cryptocurrency: Beyond A Digital AssetThe white paper also sheds light on cryptocurrencies as potential stabilizers for renewable energy grids. According to Winton, bitcoin mining should foster “the economic installation of large-scale renewable energy and battery systems, which, in a virtuous cycle, should increase the security of the Bitcoin blockchain.”By 2030, the valuation tied to Public Blockchain innovations is expected to reach around $40 trillion.“Cryptocurrencies—and, to a lesser extent, smart contract protocols—are likely to compete with fiat currencies,” ARK stated.

                        Max Howell, the founder of the decentralized technology protocol tea Protocol, sat down for a chat with Cryptonews’ Matt Zahab, to discuss his highly popular Homebrew system, as well as the much-anticipated tea Protocol.He talked about the massive importance of properly compensating developers to create and maintain open-source software so they can work on it full-time, and how tea aims to help that goal.The famous developer also touched upon commercial open-source, the impossible attempt to merge open-source and capitalism, and what open-source is in its essence.In this episode, Howell discussed:
compensating developers to create open-source software;
90% of all publicly traded companies utilizing open-source software across their business units;
relationship between open-source software and capitalism;
the emergence of commercial open-source;
open-source vs. closed-source AI.
VIDEOYou can watch the full podcast episode above or read what Howell told Matt below.The First Big Success
Howell achieved quite a feat early in life.He told Cryptonews that in the mid-2000s, online music service Last.fm offered him a job.It was while he was there that he wrote Homebrew in 2009, a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on macOS and Linux. Tens of millions of developers around the world use it.At Last.fm, the team was using Mac. But at that time, the state of the developer tooling was lacking.“I came from a Linux background where I was used to all these awesome package managers that had amazing feature sets and worked really well,” Howell said.So, after complaining about it at the pub after work, he decided to “do something about it.”Three months later, he open-sourced his product on GitHub. Interestingly, nobody noticed it for a while, so he started “doing some self-evangelism.”“One day, I woke up and found that I had a bunch of people interacting with my code,” Howell said.Homebrew has become “a massive success” and quickly. But this created a different career problem. The then 26-year-old Howell thought that everything should move like Homebrew did or he should give it up.When Homebrew became “extremely popular,” the developer was able to leave his job and work on the product full-time.This eventually led him to create tea Protocol, a decentralized technology protocol that enables open source developers to be rewarded for their software contributions.Open-Source Software and Capitalism
It’s been 15 years since Howell created Homebrew. For most of his career, he’d take up jobs to earn and save money so he could quit and work on open source.He stated tgat “there’s something really wonderful about working on open source. And there’s nothing else that compares in the corporate world.”However, the major problem with it is that there’s no way to work on it full-time in a capitalist society.And while Howell has no issue with capitalism per se, “it really doesn’t map onto open source at all.”There are people doing “commercial open source” nowadays, but it’s not really open source per some of the usual metrics. The main purpose of open source is to solve a problem that is very specific and often unrelated to revenue models.Therefore, people have tried to come up with solutions so that some of the open source developers and maintainers can work on it full-time.Notably, not many realize how important this is. People need to be paid for maintaining such widely used systems.“People building in Web2 realized that open source was the way to bootstrap entire businesses,” Max Howell said, adding:“You could build 95% of your product using freely available open source solutions that are performing and well-maintained and perfectly solved the niche they were trying to solve. Then do 5% of your code as the proprietary bit on the top and make fortunes.”Furthermore, some 70% of enterprise software is built on top of open source, he said.And this is not an issue on its own. The open-source tools are there to be used. But the fact remains that somebody still needs to properly maintain the solutions on which 95% of products are based.There is Money, But Very Little Goes to Developers
Open source is everywhere now. It’s “been to Mars, it’s on the bottom of the ocean, it’s in every computer, every phone,” Howell said.There is “a lot of money” in the software and the internet realms, “but very little of it has ended up trickling back to these people that are maintaining these core pieces of infrastructure.”And you regularly hear about people burning out and rage quitting, he added.“What’s happened as a result of trying to shove capitalism on to open source is you’ve ended up with people treating it like a charity, where the only thing they can expect is the goodness of people’s hearts to throw them five bucks so they can buy a coffee,” said Howell.Developers earning from donations, Patreon, or GitHub sponsors do not receive much either. Upon speaking to many prominent developers, Howell found that the top-earning person makes $24,000 a year. And this man worked on very popular packages.A couple of years ago, Howell was looking once again for something fresh in the space in terms of working on open source full-time. He wasn’t able to find anything that would ensure that.“So in a moment of inspiration, I realized that maybe the person who was going to solve the problem had to be me.”He started exploring technologies he hadn’t looked at before and realized that there was an opportunity with blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies.These could be tools to create something new open source that doesn’t fit onto a standard capitalist model.While commercial open source introduces agendas in order to find a revenue model, Howell aimed to build a system that “recognized what is open source, why it works, and then didn’t change anything about that.”The only thing the system needed to do is fix the problem of providing sufficient rewards.Max Howell approached some crypto venture capitalists in 2022 and subsequently raised 17 million for tea Protocol, with Binance Labs as the lead investor.10.5 Million Projects Over Multiple Decades Ranked
Tea Protocol revealed its Incentivized Testnet on February 21. It plans to launch the mainnet on June 12.Commenting on how and which developers get incentivized on tea, Howell explained that there is a system called Proof of Contribution.It’s a novel consensus mechanism designed to quantify the impact of all projects across all open-source ecosystems.An oracle ranks all 10.5 million projects created over the past 20-30 years and assigns them a teaRank between zero and a hundred. “Everything above a teaRank of 25 is going to get automatic rewards if they onboard to our system,” Howell said.In the three weeks since the testnet launch (between the launch date and the podcast recording), tea saw more than 5,000 open-source projects onboard. And the onboarding process is intentionally made simple.Max Howell told the viewers that “we’ve had over half a million people sign up at this point. And as a result, we have over half a million wallets created on the tea Protocol, and so far, 89% of them are active on the protocol as well.”The goal is to enable developers to work on open source projects more, and if possible even full-time.When it comes to tokenomics, the gas fees are paid with TEA tokens. Paymasters facilitates that.There is also staking, allowing people to “find a project that you think is interesting, […] put some token down, and then earn rewards off of the project.”Therefore, the project is shifting the view of open source from charity to “an incredibly valuable ecosystem that props up the whole internet.”Incentivizing Open Source Security
Another relevant aspect, the developer said, is that until now the incentives for open source to keep their technologies secure just weren’t quite there.What tea is doing is incentivizing whitehats to report any security vulnerabilities they find in a confidential manner via the smart contracts available on the protocols.If that vulnerability is legitimate, the project must fix it within a certain amount of time. Otherwise, they risk a slashing event where people staking against that project are also slashed.Notably, many projects are severely underfunded.

Analysts Rise Bitcoin Price Target Amid Tech Breakthroughs


Analysts have notably increased their price target for Bitcoin (BTC), citing a surge in technological innovations as a pivotal catalyst. 
As Bitcoin establishes new benchmarks, the financial ecosystem attentively observes the transformative impact of Layer 2 (L2) solutions on the cryptocurrency’s scalability, security, and decentralization.
Tech Advancements Will Push Bitcoin Price
Muneeb Ali, the CEO of Trust Machines, has played a crucial role in advocating for Bitcoin’s L2 technologies. He is confident that Bitcoin’s scalability challenges are on the cusp of a revolutionary breakthrough thanks to these L2 solutions. 
This development aims to enhance Bitcoin’s transactional efficiency. It also represents a strategic move to ensure Bitcoin remains at the forefront of the competitive blockchain industry.

“L2s move fast. Bitcoin is not going to change much. L2s are innovative and open to making rapid changes. After a while it becomes part of their culture. These days, I’m seeing “XYZ ecosystem” have a cadence of one major upgrade every six months: That would be very healthy for Bitcoin,” Ali said. 

Furthermore, the introduction of the Ordinals protocol, the emergence of BRC-20 tokens, and the sophistication of smart contracts through BitVM, have significantly contributed to the revitalization of Bitcoin’s free economy. This shift from a store of value to a viable ecosystem reflects a broader acceptance and use in daily transactions.
Elastos’ announcement of the BTC Oracle also marks another milestone in Bitcoin’s technological evolution. This initiative aims to enhance cross-chain operability, allowing Bitcoin to be used across various blockchains. The BTC Oracle and BeL2 are expanding Bitcoin’s utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) and beyond, emphasizing decentralization and privacy.


“By empowering every EVM compatible blockchain to use smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, the industry can unlock incredible innovative and economic potential for the crypto ecosystem via staking ELA and getting Bitcoin rewards,” Jonathan Hargreaves, Global Head of Business Development & ESG at Elastos, added. 

The synergy between these technological advancements and the market’s response has been overwhelmingly positive. In fact, analysts from Bernstein have raised their year-end price target for Bitcoin to $90,000. The decision came from the entry of a new bull run, robust Bitcoin ETF inflows, and aggressive expansion by miners. 
Indeed, this revised forecast reflects the optimism stemming from the technological leapfrogs in Bitcoin’s infrastructure and signals confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value and utility.

“With a new Bitcoin bull cycle, strong ETF inflows, aggressive miner capacity expansion, and all-time high miner dollar revenues, we continue to find Bitcoin miners compelling buys for equity investors seeking exposure to the crypto cycle,” analysts at Bernstein wrote.

                        The Floki price has dived by 7.5% today, sinking to $0.0002272 as the wider crypto market slips by 2% in the past 24 hours.Today’s loss means that FLOKI is also down by 10% in the past week, although it’s a sign of how strong the coin has been that it holds onto a 23% gain in a fortnight and a whopping 600%.Such performance suggests that the meme coin remains in the middle of a growth phase, ready to pick up from where it left off once the current correction has ended.Floki Price Prediction as FLOKI Drops 7.5% – What’s Going On?
FLOKI’s chart is consistent with pretty much every other major token in the market today, with its indicators continuing to show a loss of momentum.Its RSI (purple) has declined from nearly 70 yesterday to 50 as of writing, with its direction pointing to further selling pressure.Source: TradingViewLikewise, its 30-day moving average (yellow) has flatlined after rising a little this morning, with FLOKI’s price bouncing down from its resistance level (red).If there’s one thing that’s encouraging it’s that the meme token’s trading volume remains elevated at around $750 million, up from a very lowly $30 million less than a month ago.This shows how far FLOKI has come in the past couple of weeks, and with liquidity staying high it could easily rebound in the very near future.At the moment, it seems that many whales have been selling, although the start of this month did see some larger withdrawals from exchanges.In other words, FLOKI is still a popular token among traders, and should push back up quickly as the market regains some impetus.This could happen sooner than some bears may think, with the market preparing for the next Bitcoin halving, while also looking forward to the possibility of Ethereum ETF approvals.Such factors could help precipitate a bull market in the next few months, with FLOKI benefitting more than other alts due to its status as a volatile meme token.In terms of fundamentals, there’s also the upcoming Floki 2024 roadmap release, which is actually happening today.This release could help prompt another little rally for FLOKI, although it’s possible that its spike earlier this morning is the only response will see to the roadmap today.Regardless, the Floki price should reach $0.00030 by the end of spring.Alternative Meme Tokens for Big tallies
FLOKI will continue to rise and fall throughout this year, and while it continues to show potential, it may not be the best meme token in 2024 for huge gains.Such gains may come from newer tokens that could rise as they list on exchanges, with new ERC-20 token Dogecoin20 (DOGE20) being one of the most promising new meme coins around.Promising to deliver a bullish update on the Dogecoin formula, its presale has already raised more than $5 million.Given that the sale has been running for just over week, this figure is impressive, with investors attracted by DOGE20’s fundamentals.It aims to offer a stronger version of Dogecoin’s ‘Do Only Good Everyday’ ethos, with the token set to provide regular support to charitable causes and community projects.In addition, its use of the proof-of-stake Ethereum blockchain also makes it much more environmentally friendly than the original Dogecoin, which remains a more energy-intensive proof-of-work blockchain.It also boasts superior tokenomics, featuring a hard cap of 140 billion tokens, in contrast to the infinitely inflationary supplies of many established meme coins.This capped supply seems all the more bullish in light of DOGE20’s staking system, which will provide higher rewards to holders who stake earlier and for longer.VIDEOAll of these features arguably make Dogecoin20 more promising as an investment vehicle than many of its rivals, with investors able to join its sale at the official Dogecoin20 website.They can buy DOGE20 at $0.000206 per token, with the price rising by $0.000002 with each successive stage of the sale.Once the sale ends, DOGE20 will list on Uniswap and then on other trading platforms, where it could rally big.Buy Dogecoin20 Now

VeChain Declares Meatless and EcoNex Winners in Hackathon


							

VeChain has announced Meatless and EcoNex winners of its recent hackathon at the University of Cambridge.



The hackathon awarded winners a portion of $30,000 and an opportunity to access additional funding.



Meatless and EcoNex additions to the VeChain ecosystem could boost VET’s value.




VeChain, an enterprise-grade L1 public blockchain, has announced Meatless and EcoNex winners of its recent hackathon hosted at the University of Cambridge. VeChain hosted the hackathon in partnership with Web3 educational mobile app EasyA and with participation from Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a global consulting firm.



The hackathon aimed to encourage the development of the VeBetterDAO, a VeChain-powered sustainable ecosystem for incentivizing enterprises and individuals with the B3TR incentive token for positive impact.









The hackathon awarded winners a portion of $30,000 in prize money and an opportunity to access additional funding. The panel of judges determining the winners of the exercise include Dr. Bernhard Kronfellner, Partner and co-lead of the digital asset and blockchain group at Boston Consulting Group, and Mark Miller, CEO & Co-Founder of Manta Ray EV. They assessed the participants on their ability to address the developer tracks outlined for the hackathon, namely, X-2-Earn sustainability applications leveraging the B3TR token.



As a winner in the hackathon, Meatless incentivizes people to make sustainable food choices by rewarding them with B3TR. Doing so allows the application to combat unsustainable food production at no cost to food manufacturers. The project achieves this by indirectly subsidizing their products while enabling sponsors to have an attributable direct impact. 



On its part, EcoNex rewards users with the B3TR token as an incentive for opting for eco-friendly commuting options. The application aims to combat the effects of urban congestion, including higher commute times, loss of productivity, excessive fuel consumption, and a significant carbon footprint.



Crypto community members consider Meatless and EcoNex significant additions to the VeChain ecosystem. Their impact on VET, the VeChain ecosystem’s native token, remains to be seen and would depend on the projects’ development and adoption.

Cyber Heist of Over $145 Million in Ether Laundered Following Heco Bridge Exploit | Cryptopolitan

In a dramatic unfolding of events that underscores the persistent vulnerabilities within the cryptocurrency sector, hackers behind the 2023 Heco Bridge exploit have successfully laundered an astonishing $145.7 million in ether. The operation, conducted over a mere eight-day period through the cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash, highlights the sophisticated strategies employed by cybercriminals to evade detection and the ongoing battle against illicit financial flows in the digital asset space.The initial breach: A blow to blockchain securityThe saga began with a significant security breach of the Heco Bridge, a crucial conduit for transferring funds between the Ethereum blockchain and the Heco Chain, managed by the HTX Exchange (formerly known as Huobi). In November 2023, attackers orchestrated a heist that siphoned off approximately $111 million in various cryptocurrencies, including ether, USDT, USDC, and HBTC. The swift movement of these stolen assets across decentralized exchanges for conversion into other cryptocurrencies was a calculated attempt to muddy the waters and obscure the origins of the illicit funds.The exploit not only exposed the vulnerabilities inherent in cross-chain bridges but also set the stage for a complex laundering operation that would further challenge the cryptocurrency industry’s security measures and anti-money laundering protocols.A sophisticated laundering scheme unveiledThe revelation of the laundering operation came to light through the diligent analysis of on-chain data by PeckShield, a blockchain security and data analytics firm. According to their findings, the perpetrators transferred roughly 40,391.8 ETH (equivalent to about $145.7 million) to Tornado Cash, a platform known for its ability to anonymize the trail of cryptocurrency transactions. The move was executed within an alarmingly short span of eight days, showcasing the exploiters’ proficiency in utilizing privacy-enhancing technologies to conceal their tracks.Tornado Cash’s role in the scheme has once again sparked debate over the ethical and legal implications of cryptocurrency mixers, which, while designed to protect user privacy, can also serve as tools for laundering the proceeds of crime. The incident arrives amidst heightened scrutiny of Tornado Cash, whose developer, Alexey Pertsev, faces serious allegations of facilitating the laundering of $1.2 billion in illegal funds.The Ripple effects: Additional exploits and legal entanglementsThe aftermath of the Heco Bridge hack revealed further complications, including suspicious transfers amounting to $23.4 million that bore the hallmarks of the initial exploit. These findings suggested an additional breach of HTX itself, prompting the platform to undertake measures to secure assets and reassure its user base. HTX advisor Justin Sun’s confirmation of the attack and the promise of full compensation for affected users underscored the severity of the situation and the platform’s commitment to rectifying the fallout.Moreover, the legal challenges facing Tornado Cash and its developer, Pertsev, highlight the complex interplay between innovation, privacy, and regulatory compliance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Pertsev’s upcoming trial in the Netherlands for charges related to money laundering and financial crimes emphasizes the growing legal scrutiny of technologies that, while innovative, may inadvertently facilitate illicit activities.ConclusionThe laundering of over $145 million in ether following the Heco Bridge exploit serves as a stark reminder of the sophisticated threats facing the cryptocurrency industry. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, so too do the strategies employed by cybercriminals, necessitating a proactive and comprehensive approach to security and regulatory oversight.

Based on on-chain data, a Bitcoin whale that has been accumulating on Bitcoin's dip has made a significant purchase, acquiring 673 BTC.According to Lookonchain, a Bitcoin whale withdrew 673 BTC worth $45.2 million from Binance in recent hours. Withdrawals from exchanges might indicate a desire to buy, while deposits indicate an intent to sell.The said BTC whale, according to Lookonchain, has consistently bought Bitcoin on the dip. On March 21, Lookonchain reported that the whale had accumulated 4,451 BTC worth $294.6 million from Binance at an average price of $66,195. Bitcoin has been extremely volatile since reaching an all-time high of $73,797 last week. Bitcoin has fallen about 13% from its recent all-time high as demand for fledgling spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds cools, with the worst three-day outflow since the products debuted on Jan. 11.Bitcoin began to recover late Wednesday, boosted by policy decisions made at the most recent U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. The U.S. central bank kept interest rates unchanged and hinted at further rate cuts this year.Bitcoin recovered above $68,000 on Thursday, but bulls were unable to extend the rally, with BTC reaching lows of $64,525.At the time of writing, BTC was extending its declines, down 3.48% in the last 24 hours to $64,796 after hitting intraday lows of $64,529.Eyes peeled for BTC price recoveryIn the days ahead, eyes are peeled for a recovery of the BTC price after testing key support levels. Bitcoin might consolidate and then form a base for a potential upward move. In this scenario, key resistance levels will be closely monitored, with a breakout likely to trigger further buying interest and propel Bitcoin toward higher price targets.In the event of a rebound, the first indicator of strength would be a move above $65,270. If this occurs, BTC may reach $69,000, the final obstacle before challenging its current all-time high of $73,797.A rebound from the current level might face selling pressure at $65,270. In the case of further selling, BTC may fall to the 50-day SMA ($57,614), where bulls are expected to buy aggressively.

Ripple CEO States SEC Will Lose Against ETH, Just Like with XRP - DailyCoin


        
Ripple’s CEO and Coinbase’s CLO have criticized the SEC’s aggressive stance towards Ethereum.



The SEC has been looking to classify Ethereum as a security, a move that would tighten regulations.



There has been a disagreement between the SEC and other regulatory bodies like the CFTC on handling crypto.
The relationship between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the cryptocurrency industry has come under renewed scrutiny following comments from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Industry Leaders Back EthereumGarlinghouse took to social media platform X to express his belief that the SEC is likely to lose its ongoing legal battle against Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. This statement comes amidst reports of the SEC’s increasingly aggressive stance towards Ethereum. The regulatory body has reportedly launched an effort to classify Ethereum as a security, a move that would subject it to stricter regulations. The Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit organization overseeing Ethereum’s development, is also facing scrutiny from the SEC.However, Garlinghouse isn’t the only critic of the SEC’s approach. Industry leaders like Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, have spoken out against the misinformation surrounding Ethereum’s classification as a security. Grewal emphasizes Ethereum’s vital role within the crypto economy and highlights the inconsistencies in the SEC’s proposed regulations. Adding another layer of complexity, the SEC appears to be clashing with other regulatory bodies, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This creates confusion and uncertainty within the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, recent letters from U.S. senators urging the SEC to limit cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) suggest a potential political motive behind the SEC’s actions.Is the SEC Stifling Crypto Progress?The ongoing conflict underscores the fundamental differences in perspective between the SEC and the crypto industry. The industry desires regulations that foster innovation and growth while ensuring investor protection. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, has even called for Congress to halt funding for the SEC’s current approach, deeming it ineffective. The legal battles between the SEC and crypto companies like Ripple are far from over. The outcome of these disputes will have a significant impact on the future regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States. As the situation unfolds, it’s clear that a clear and consistent approach to digital currency classification and regulation is needed to navigate this evolving technological landscape.On the Flipside
Ethereum’s switch to a proof-of-stake model could strengthen the argument for classifying it as a security, as staking rewards could be seen as akin to dividends.



The CFTC’s classification of Ethereum futures as a commodity contradicts the SEC’s security stance, creating confusion for businesses.
Why This MattersIndustry leaders are uniting against the SEC’s aggressive stance towards Ethereum, fearing stricter regulations could stifle innovation, create market confusion due to conflicting regulatory bodies, and potentially be politically motivated. This battle for Ethereum’s classification as a security could set a precedent for the entire cryptocurrency industry.To learn more about the regulatory hurdles surrounding Ether ETFs in the US, read here:Coinbase CEO Demands Ether ETF Approval: “Follow the Law”To learn more about why XRP was not included by Coinbase for futures trading, read here:Coinbase Snubs XRP for Futures Trading: Why Was It Left Out?

U.S. SEC Asking for More Millions, Dozens of Lawyers to Beef Up Crypto Oversight

Executive branch budget proposals are gathered into a single push from the White House for its spending priorities, with more detail about how exactly the agencies want to spend the funds they're requesting. Then Congress gets its turn, sometimes embracing some of the president's wishes, and sometimes ignoring them. But even when lawmakers put together a plan for final consideration, the process can get derailed by politics, as the U.S. has seen in the current federal budget effort, which has flirted repeatedly with failure and government shutdowns. Congress is currently evaluating a budget for 2024, after several false starts and continuing resolutions.

Shiba Inu’s BONE Gears Up for $1 As Gate.io Opens Up Margin - DailyCoin


        
A popular centralized exchange adds BONE as a borrowable digital asset.



BONE inked 55.7% in 30 days, hitting a monthly high of $1.54 on March 5.



Only one out of the TOP 5 exchanges listed BONE despite amplified requests.
Shiba Inu’s alternative token, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), received a substantial boost following Gate.io’s listing of BONE on Margin trading. Gate.io, the 12th largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, answered the popular demand by adding BONE as a borrowable asset on the platform’s Margin trading offerings.According to the official statement, BONE is available for Margin trading with up to three times leverage. The news served a 10% boost for BONE’s price, reaching daily heights of $0.966 on March 21, 2024, but later facing a market correction to hover above $0.90. The previously claimed resistance line at $0.90 has successfully transformed into a support cluster.SHIB’s Continuous Quest to Speed Up BONE’s AdoptionThe vibrant and proactive community of Shiba Inu custodians, popularly known as the SHIB Army, have contributed to BONE’s adoption via multiple listing campaigns across social media. While X is flooded with polite request messages asking top crypto platforms like Binance and KuCoin to list Shiba Inu’s BONE, these two exchanges haven’t responded yet.Moreover, the SHIB Army accelerated the BONE listing campaign since the developer team renounced the Shibarium’s gas fee token’s smart contract. This fulfills the promise of BONE capped at a limited supply, as the SHIB community previously voted to halt BONE’s minting despite its rising demand due to the inception of Shibarium Layer-2.According to trading statistics, nearly 20% of all BONE trading is taking place on OKX, which is currently the world’s third-largest exchange. However, no other TOP 5 crypto exchanges have listed BONE, despite the piling requests on Shiba Inu’s social media. Shiba Inu’s BONE trades at $0.9195 at press time, gaining 5% over the past seven days.On the Flipside
While Margin trading expands the trader’s potential to capitalize on gains, the magnified risks ascribed to leveraged trading in comparison to Spot trades include a lack of token ownership.
Why This MattersShiba Inu is developing a self-sufficient ecosystem via Shibarium L2, in which BONE plays a crucial part as the gas & governance token.Discover DailyCoin’s trending cryptocurrency news:Bitget’s Gracy Chen Joins UN to Promote Gender EqualityCoinbase Snubs XRP for Futures Trading: Why Was It Left Out?

Coinbase surge triggers ARK Invest's $52M profit-taking move

ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, has recently made significant moves in its investment portfolio, selling off a substantial portion of its holdings in Coinbase amid a surge in the stock’s price. ARK divested 199,526 Coinbase shares from its exchange-traded funds (ETFs), totaling approximately $52.3 million based on Coinbase’s closing price that day.ARK profit-taking strategy amid Coinbase’s record highsThe decision to sell comes as Coinbase’s stock price reached multi-year highs, surpassing $270 for the first time since December 2021. This move follows a pattern of profit-taking by ARK, which has been gradually reducing its exposure to Coinbase since early 2023. Despite the sell-off, Coinbase shares have experienced remarkable growth, with prices up nearly 250% over the past six months.This recent sale marks one of the most significant divestments of Coinbase shares by ARK in 2024. Before this, ARK offloaded 270,365 Coinbase shares on March 11 and made its largest sale of 499,149 shares on February 16, when Coinbase traded at around $190 per share. In addition to Coinbase, ARK has also been actively selling shares of Block (SQ) and Robinhood (HOOD) to rebalance its portfolio and comply with regulatory requirements.ARK’s portfolio adjustments and market resilienceARK’s decision to sell shares of Robinhood was partly driven by compliance needs, as the fund’s holdings in HOOD approached the regulatory threshold of 5% of the portfolio’s total weight under Rule 12d3-1. This rule prohibits ETFs from acquiring more than 5% of the value of their total assets in certain securities. By selling off shares of Robinhood, ARK aims to ensure compliance while maintaining a diversified portfolio.Despite ARK’s divestment, Coinbase continues to attract investor interest, with its stock price showing resilience and stability. The recent surge in prices reflects growing confidence in the company’s prospects and the broader cryptocurrency market. As ARK adjusts its holdings, investors will be closely watching for further developments and potential shifts in strategy.ARK’s proactive portfolio management in evolving marketsARK Invest’s decision to sell $52 million worth of Coinbase shares underscores the firm’s proactive approach to portfolio management and risk mitigation. While the sale may signal profit-taking in response to rising prices, it also reflects ARK’s commitment to maintaining a balanced and compliant investment portfolio. As Coinbase’s stock continues to perform strongly, ARK’s strategic moves highlight the dynamic nature of the investment landscape and the importance of adaptability in navigating market trends.ARK Invest’s recent sale of Coinbase shares is a notable development in the evolving cryptocurrency investment landscape, reflecting both profit-taking and strategic portfolio adjustments. As market dynamics evolve, investors will be watching closely for further insights into ARK’s investment strategy and its implications for the broader market.

Encouraging participants in the crypto market to seize buying opportunities during downturns, he outlined his short-term objectives for 12 coins. He anticipates these coins will demonstrate remarkable price rebounds in the next three to four months following recent declines.



At the forefront of the list is Bitcoin (BTC), with Crypto Scofield projecting a surge to $150,000. This forecast suggests a potential 125% increase, considering BTC’s current price of $66,400.



Following closely is Fetch.ai (FET), which the analyst predicts will reach $22 in the short term. This target signifies almost tenfold growth, given FET’s current trading price of $2.5. Notably, FET has been a standout performer this bull season, soaring by over 544% since last November.



Another token for which the analyst projects nearly ten-fold growth was Injective (INJ), which established a new all-time high at $52.75 eight days ago. In particular, Crypto Scofield expects INJ to continue its momentum and rally even to $350 by July. 



Meanwhile, some market participants have contested this $350 target as they consider it overambitious. Notably, INJ has witnessed a staggering 787.65% gain since last year. The recent dip has brought its price to around $37.39.



Furthermore, Crypto Scofield is also extremely bullish about Oasis Network (ROSE) and COTI tokens, which currently hover around $0.14 and $0.19, respectively. The analyst believes a $1 target for both assets by July is realistic.



Additionally, the analyst considers the FLOKI meme coin’s potential to attain $0.005 in four months. Notably, FLOKI is one of the best-performing meme coins this season, growing by over 600% in the last 30 days.



Other coins Crypto Scofield has identified with the potential for a remarkable comeback in the short term during this recent dip are VeChain (VET), Fantom (FTM), OCEAN, Render (RNDR), and Zignaly (ZIG).

Renowned Finance Author Reveals Why You Should Buy As Much Bitcoin As You Can | Bitcoinist.com


								Robert Kiyosaki, the author renowned for his best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” has identified Bitcoin as a real-world asset, urging investors and the broader crypto community to shift their focus from stock investments and prioritize accumulating Bitcoin. 
Buy More Bitcoin Before It’s Too Late
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Kiyosaki advised investors to focus on stacking up more Bitcoin now more than ever. Citing the dilemma China’s stock market currently faces, the finance expert has suggested that investors seize the opportunity to buy as much Bitcoin as they can afford before “the biggest bubble in history goes bust.”

Kiyosaki has claimed that China is in “trouble” because the government had borrowed funds to buy more stocks to potentially inflate the stock market artificially and stabilize the country’s economic challenges. The finance author criticized China’s decision, labeling it as a “Foolish” and “Desperate” attempt. 
According to the author, the problem’s root lies in a global decline in consumer spending. He advised against investing in stocks and bonds at this pivotal time, arguing that the stock market was set to crash and the current economic situation was not conducive for traditional investments.
Instead, he recommends investing in real assets such as gold, silver and Bitcoin, which are historically considered safe havens in times of economic uncertainty. 
Supporting the declaration to buy more BTC, popular crypto analyst and BTC enthusiast, Michael van de Poppe agreed to Kiyosaki’s advice, albeit with a time limit of two years. Poppe revealed that following the anticipated crypto bubble, typically debt collapses and liquidity flows back into the dollar and other fiat currencies.
This scenario often leads to a currency devaluation and a subsequent rise in the stock market. He suggests that investors capitalize on Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum by acquiring more of the cryptocurrency. However, he also underscored the value of diversifying investments into the stock market as Bitcoin’s bullish trends fade. 
Finance Guru Praises BTC’s Fixed Supply
In another X post, Kiyosaki lauded praises for Bitcoin, describing the cryptocurrency as a unique investment opportunity due to its fixed supply. As a popular Bitcoin advocate, Kiyosaki is renowned for his preference for investing in tangible assets such as gold, silver and BTC. 

According to the finance guru, there were certain drawbacks involved in investing in gold and silver, noting that as the prices of these assets grow, their supply also increases. However, the reverse was the case for Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency has a predetermined maximum supply of 21 million coins. 
This scarcity is a key factor driving Kiyosaki’s appreciation for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, as it implies that no matter how high the price of Bitcoin goes, the total supply will remain limited.

ETF Outflows Continu - Decrypt

ETF Outflows ContinuDespite Bitcoin's decline, several alternative cryptocurrencies remain robust. Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase's premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin's all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana's (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.

Alert For Apple Mac Users: Your Cryptos Could Be At Risk


								A newly identified vulnerability in Apple’s M-series processors could have dire implications for crypto users, with the potential to compromise the private keys essential for securing digital assets. This flaw, which resides deep within the microarchitecture of these chips, was first reported by Ars Technica and detailed in a paper published by a collective of researchers from top US universities.
Mac Users Beware: This Is Crucial For Crypto Owners
The vulnerability stems from a side channel in the chip’s data memory-dependent prefetcher (DMP), a mechanism designed to enhance computing efficiency. However, this feature inadvertently allows for the extraction of secret keys during cryptographic operations, a process that is fundamental to the security of cryptocurrencies and other digital transactions.
“The DMP […] uses the data values in order to make predictions […] if a data value ‘looks like’ a pointer, it will be treated as an ‘address’ […] the data from this ‘address’ will be brought to the cache, leaking over cache side channels,” the researchers explained, underscoring the inadvertent risk posed by this hardware optimization.

Dubbed “GoFetch” by its discoverers, this attack method does not require administrative access, raising alarms about the ease with which bad actors could exploit this vulnerability.
According to the team, “We don’t care about the data value being prefetched, but the fact that the intermediate data looked like an address is visible via a cache channel and is sufficient to reveal the secret key over time.” This discovery is particularly concerning for cryptocurrency holders, as private keys are the linchpin of security for digital wallets and transactions.
The implications of GoFetch are vast, affecting not only traditional encryption protocols but also those designed to be resistant against quantum computing attacks. This puts a wide array of cryptographic keys at risk, including RSA and Diffie-Hellman, along with post-quantum algorithms like Kyber-512 and Dilithium-2.
The researchers reported that “The GoFetch app requires less than an hour to extract a 2048-bit RSA key and a little over two hours to extract a 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman key,” highlighting the efficiency and danger of this attack vector.

Mitigation of this vulnerability poses a significant challenge due to its hardware-based nature. While software-based defenses can be developed, they often come at the cost of degraded performance, particularly on devices with older M-series chips.
“For developers of cryptographic software running on M1 and M2 processors […] they will have to employ other defenses, almost all of which come with significant performance penalties,” the researchers noted, indicating a difficult road ahead for both developers and users.
Apple has yet to make a public statement regarding the GoFetch findings, leaving the tech community and crypto users eagerly awaiting a response. In the meantime, the researchers advise end users to look out for software updates that specifically address this vulnerability.
Given the manual and slow process required to assess an implementation’s vulnerability, the crypto community is faced with a period of uncertainty and heightened risk.
At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $63,396, down 5.1% in the last 24 hours.

3AC's Kyle Davis Defiant: No Apologies, Despite Media Backlash - DailyCoin


        
3AC co-founder Kyle Davis refuses to apologize during an interview on the Unchained podcast. 



Mainstream media backlash ensues.



Davis doubles down, saying he will never apologize for losing billions.
The failed high-risk trading strategies employed by Three Arrows Capital (3AC) represented a major domino in the onset of crypto winter. Co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davis were complicit in the crypto hedge fund’s bust in mid-2022, leaving a trail of devastation. In the aftermath, the pair evaded creditors and were even briefly jailed in Singapore for failing to cooperate with probes into 3AC’s implosion.Davis faced a grilling during a recent interview on the Unchained podcast but refused to say sorry for what had happened. The unapologetic stance quickly drew backlash, with the Daily Mail running a scathing piece labeling Davis a “brazen on-the-run coward” for grinning while discussing the events. But rather than bend to the backlash, Davis doubled down by saying he would “never apologize.”3AC Co-Founder Blames CreditorsIn response to the Daily Mail backlash, Davis doubled down in refusing to apologize once more, explaining that he wasn’t grinning; he simply has “big teeth.” Davis added, “We were traders who devoutly believed in up only forever,” before switching tracks to blame 3AC’s creditors for agreeing to lend funds on a “high-risk thesis.”The Daily Mail is a British tabloid that has an upper-middle-class readership with an average age of 56. The comments to the Daily Mail’s article slamming Davis were largely anti-crypto, highlighting society’s divergence when it comes to cryptocurrency.One commenter took the opportunity to question the point of digital assets, saying “crypto “currencies” or anything deriving from them are not assets. They are no more than an inefficient medium of exchange [sic].” Another commented that cryptocurrency is not a bona fide investment, rather it is a “fake currency.”“Not sure why anyone would ever 'invest' in crypto. It is a fake currency made up by some stranger on an imaginary exchange which he runs,” remarked the Daily Mail commenter. While no-coiners harbored deep skepticism about crypto, industry figures, some of whom had direct dealings with 3AC, took an even more scathing view of Davis’ bravado.Crypto Industry Figures Not ImpressedWhile Davis boldly expressed his position on the mainstream media backlash, crypto industry figures promptly joined in, adding their voices to the chorus of criticism. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes tweeted “F*ck your apology,” while calling out Davis’ failure to cooperate with the liquidators overseeing 3AC’s bankruptcy process.BlockTower Capital founder Ari Paul took an even harsher stance, accusing Davis of fraud, theft, and lack of ethical behavior. Paul’s killer blow came as he wrote “Don’t apologize for failing as a trader, apologize for the lying and stealing.”LayerZero co-founder Bryan Pellegrino claimed that Davis had tried desperately to get the firm to hand over its entire treasury to 3AC on the promise of high returns just days before the crypto hedge fund’s stunning collapse.On the Flipside
The British Virgin Island Court ordered a freeze on the 3AC co-founders‘ assets in December 2023, as liquidators Teneo attempted to recoup funds for creditor re-distribution.



The co-founders were in Dubai before being jailed in Singapore in September 2023, but their current whereabouts are unknown.
Why This MattersDavis’ brazen refusal to take responsibility is a slap in the face to the investors who lost billions. This saga highlights the need for more oversight to protect investors from seemingly unaccountable individuals.Read about Zhu’s “magical” experience in Singapore prison here:3AC’s Su Zhu: “I Had the Best Sleep of My Life in Prison”Find out more on renewed concerns over Ethereum’s securities status here:SEC Reignites Ethereum Debate Yet Again: Security or Not?

Grayscale GBTC Outflows in Focus on Bitcoin Price (BTC) Slides to $64K

The weak price action comes as U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs have suffered what's now four consecutive days of net negative flows. To be sure, nearly all the funds continue to see inflows, but each day this week, they've not been nearly enough to offset massive outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). On Thursday, GBTC saw $359 million in outflows, leading to $94 million in outflows for the entire fund group. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) garnered the lowest daily inflow in its history, data compiled by BitMEX Research shows.

Telegram Game on Brand-New Ethereum Layer-2 Scaler Blast Exploited for $4,600,000 in Reported White Hat Hack - The Daily Hodl


								An unknown entity has exploited a Telegram-based game that runs on the newly launched Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling solution Blast Network.
In a post on social media platform X, the team behind the game Super Sushi Samurai (SSS) says token transfers are paused after an attacker exploited a vulnerability that allows exploiters to double their tokens by transferring their holdings to themselves.










“We have been exploited, it’s mint related. We are still looking into the code. Tokens were minted and sold into the LP.”
According to security firm CertiK, $4.6 million worth of tokens were affected by the attack. It turns out though that the incident is a white hat rescue.
Source: Certik/X
In a white hat rescue, the hacker exploits a protocol to show that the project has a vulnerability. SSS says it has already communicated with the exploiter.
“We’re working with the white hat on the safe return of funds. An update and post-mortem will follow.”
Blast, which launched its mainnet a few weeks earlier, has also been facing criticism from the crypto community. In November, Polygon Labs developer relations engineer Jarrod Watts warned about the risks of the platform.
“By sending money to the Blast contract, you’re basically trusting 3-5 strangers to stake your funds for you. You won’t be able to withdraw that money at any point in time unless those 3-5 people decide to do the right thing in the future. Again, there’s no bridge here.”

BlackRock Launches Ethereum Fund, Could #SOL Be Next?


							

BlackRock launches an Ethereum-based tokenized fund to enhance asset liquidity.



Strategic investment in Securitize strengthens BlackRock’s position in digital assets.



Additional support will come from BNY Mellon, Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase, and Fireblocks.




As a step in the finance and crypto industries, BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, has recently launched a fund for tokenized assets on the Ethereum network.



Named the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, it runs with the BUIDL token that is fully collateralized with cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. This approach ensures daily yield distribution to token holders through blockchain technology.



Additionally, BlackRock has made a strategic investment in Securitize to power up its position in the digital asset space. Securitize, a firm that performs tokenization and transfer agent functions of the fund, is the one in charge of it while the details of the investment process remain confidential.







The fund, registered last year in the British Virgin Islands, is a significant extension of BlackRock’s delving into the digital assets field. Through the Securitize experience in tokenizing real-world assets (RWA), the fund will be a manifestation of the novel age of financial instruments, which are designed to promote the liquidity and effectiveness of assets.



The joint effort between BlackRock and Securitize was alluded to in the previous regulatory filing, which led to widespread speculation about the possibility of the development of a tokenized fund. According to a press release, BNY Mellon will custodize the fund’s assets. Additional support will come from Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase, and Fireblocks, creating a robust ecosystem for the fund’s operations.



This development is a continuation of BlackRock’s deepening foray into digital assets, as stated by Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets. Mitchnick emphasized the company’s focus on solving client issues through digital asset solutions, highlighting the significance of this launch in BlackRock’s digital assets strategy.










We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients, and we are excited to work with Securitize.




In parallel developments within the crypto space, speculation is mounting over the potential approval of a spot Solana ETF, following the pathway laid by the spot Bitcoin ETF. The progression towards such approvals is expected to begin with the incorporation of a Solana futures ETF, mirroring the precedents set by Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs. This approach aims to pave the way for the eventual approval of a spot Solana ETF, indicating a growing integration of traditional finance (TradFi) with altcoin markets.

EU Parliament Outlaws Anonymous Crypto Payments: Details


								The majority of the EU Parliament’s lead committees approved a new legislative move to ban anonymous crypto payments has ignited a firestorm of debate, marking a pivotal moment in the regulation of digital currencies within the bloc. This comprehensive package of anti-money laundering measures, extending beyond cryptocurrencies to include significant restrictions on cash transactions, represents one of the most assertive regulatory efforts seen in the global financial landscape.
The Legislative Framework
Under the new legislation, anonymous cash payments in commercial transactions are limited to amounts under €3,000, with a complete prohibition on cash transactions exceeding €10,000 in business contexts. The legislation casts a wide net over digital financial transactions as well, specifically targeting anonymity in crypto payments.
Any transaction involving cryptocurrencies to wallets managed by service providers, known as “hosted wallets,” is now required to be fully traceable, eliminating anonymity for even the smallest transactions.
The EU’s legislative bodies assert that these measures are critical in the fight against money laundering, financing of terrorism, and tax evasion. However, the sweeping nature of these laws has raised serious concerns about privacy rights and the fundamental freedoms of EU citizens.
MEP Dr. Patrick Breyer of the Pirate Party, a staunch critic of the legislation, has termed the EU’s approach as “financial paternalism.” In a detailed blog post, Breyer vehemently opposes the outright ban on anonymous payments, arguing it does little to curb crime while significantly infringing on personal liberties.


He asserts, “Generally prohibiting anonymous payments would at best have minimal effects on crime, but it would deprive innocent citizens of their financial freedom.” Breyer’s comments underscore a broader concern among critics that the legislation could disproportionately affect ordinary citizens under the guise of combating illegal activities.

Highlighting the importance of anonymity for political and social activism, Breyer points out, “The medicines or sex toys I buy is nobody’s business. To collect donations, dissidents such as the late Alexei Navalny and his wife are increasingly reliant on anonymous donations in virtual currencies worldwide.”
This perspective sheds light on the potential repercussions for privacy and freedom of expression, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach to regulation.
Crypto Community’s Reaction
The crypto sector, known for its emphasis on privacy and decentralization, has responded critically to the EU’s regulatory measures. Daniel “Loddi” Tröster, host of the Sound Money Bitcoin Podcast, highlighted the practical challenges and implications of the new laws, particularly focusing on the KYC requirements for transactions to hosted wallets.
“As KYC is required when opening accounts on the crypto exchange anyway, there are no major changes here for the time being (for most providers). However, there are restrictions in other areas. Hosted wallets are likely to include the following: Alby, blink, Wallet of Satoshi…,” he remarked.

These wallets have no KYC thus far. For example, the users of Wallet of Satoshi, have not yet gone through a KYC process. In future, the transfer of Sathois to this wallet would therefore require a KYC process.
Tröster further elaborates on the impact on donations and the broader implications for cryptocurrency use within the EU. “What initially gives me a lot more ‘stomach ache’ are donations. Anyone who wants to donate anonymously can no longer do so with the new regulations,” he states, articulating concerns over the stifling effect these rules might have.
Notably, self-custody to self-custody transactions are not affected by the new law. “It may have been understood that no prevention/regulation is possible here,” Tröster stated.
Enforcement Challenges
Skeptics of the legislation question its effectiveness and enforceability, given the inherently decentralized and borderless nature of crypto. They argue that the global internet infrastructure and the technical capabilities of digital currencies to facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries could significantly hinder the EU’s regulatory efforts.
“Virtual Assets can technically be transferred directly from one person to another without using intermediaries, which makes them impossible to regulate,” Dr. Breyer highlights, challenging the practicality of the EU’s approach.
Moreover, the criticism extends to the potential overreach of the EU in attempting to regulate a global phenomenon through regional legislation. The inherent flexibility and global reach of cryptocurrencies suggest that users may find ways to circumvent these regulations, raising questions about the ultimate effectiveness of the EU’s measures.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Witnesses Epic Whale Activity Spike Amid Coinbase Outflows


Today, the crypto space observed notable activity within the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem, particularly involving substantial transfers of SHIB tokens. A transfer totaling $11.9 million in SHIB was noted, directed toward the address "0xB22." This movement places "0xB22" among the top three wallets by SHIB volume received within the past 24 hours.This transfer originated from the address "0xdaA," which had been accumulating SHIB tokens over the preceding five days. Further examination reveals a trend spanning eight months, with significant quantities of SHIB tokens moving between various unknown wallets before reaching the destination at "0xB22."Of particular interest is the suspected association of these transactions with addresses believed to be linked to DV Chain, a recognized liquidity provider and market maker in the crypto space. Although no direct confirmation of DV Chain's involvement exists, the simultaneous presence of smaller transfers from Coinbase Prime wallets adds complexity to the situation.Source: EtherscanCoinbase Prime, a platform catering to institutional clients, raises questions regarding the scale and nature of SHIB movements observed. While connections to Coinbase Prime addresses are not inherently suspicious, the magnitude of these transactions may warrant attention within the community.This uptick in whale activity occurs amid heightened volatility on the broader cryptocurrency market. As Shiba Inu holders monitor the market, the focus remains on understanding the implications of this whale activity and its correlation with the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency's price trajectory.

Bitcoin Struggles at $66K; Ripple's XRP Defies Bearish Momentum (Market Watch)


																The cryptocurrency market has failed to recover as swiftly as many expected it to, and Bitcoin’s price seems to be struggling to break above $66K definitively. Most of the altcoins are also trading in the red, with two notable exceptions.
Bitcoin Fails at $66K
As seen in the chart below, Bitcoin’s price was unable to retain its bullish momentum that took it all the way to $68K.
BTC has since retraced, declining by more than 2% on the day, trading where it’s currently at around $65,500.
The sentiment is currently mixed, with many believing that there’s more pain to come. The other end of the spectrum is analysts who claim that this is nothing but a normal correction following months of “up only” action. Meanwhil, spot Bitcoin ETF flows continue to be negative for the fourth day in a row.

Are Spot Bitcoin ETF Buyers "Noobs" And Panic Selling?


								Billions have been channeled to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light in mid-January. However, on-chain analysis indicates that some of these spot ETF investors might, after all, be less experienced than initially assumed.
Spot Bitcoin ETF Investors Acting Like “Noobs”?
Taking to X, Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, shared the Bitcoin Network Flows data and picked out crucial leads to suggest that some spot Bitcoin ETFs are shaken out too quickly by the market. 
Bitcoin Network Flows | Source: Willy Woo on X
In a post, Woo pointed to a $1.6 billion outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs when prices crashed on March 5. During this dip, the network had inflows worth $1.1 billion. This outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs and a marked influx of cash to the mainnet could mean that some investors choose to redeem and get hold of the underlying coin, explaining the capital injection. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a simple and accessible route to Bitcoin investment. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which speculate on future prices, spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin directly. This means investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of buying and holding the coins themselves. 
All they need to do is purchase shares of spot Bitcoin ETFs from issuers like BlackRock. A specific amount of Bitcoin backs each purchase.

However, as on-chain data shows, by redeeming their shares when prices fell, investors choose to self-custody their coins instead of allowing the issuer, through its partners, to control their coin’s private keys. United States SEC filings show that most ETF issuers rely on Coinbase Custody as their primary custodian.
 This regulated third party safeguards billions worth of Bitcoin backing each share of spot Bitcoin ETF in circulation.
Grayscale Outflows Increasing, BTC Facing Headwinds
The apparent shakeout and inflow directly into the mainnet as Woo shares appear to confirm previous studies. In a report, CoinDesk noted that a big chunk of early spot Bitcoin ETF demand was likely driven by retailers. 

Their investigation found that the average trade size for one ETF hovered around $13,000. This finding reinforces the “retail investor” narrative. Even so, the actual purchasers of spot Bitcoin ETFs will be confirmed when made public.

For now, there is no fresh capital going into spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Lookonchain data on March 21, Grayscale and the other issuers reduced over $700 million from their holdings. CoinMarketCap data shows that BTC remains below $70,000 and is under pressure.

“Imminent” Supply Shock Could See Bitcoin at $500K by Q4 2025


							

According to George of CryptosRUs, a supply squeeze is imminent for Bitcoin soon.



George noted that the effect of upcoming macroeconomic events will favor Bitcoin.



The analyst believes Grayscale’s diminishing supply will promote the upcoming Bitcoin squeeze.




According to George of CryptosRUs crypto YouTube channel, a supply squeeze is imminent for Bitcoin soon. George noted that Bitcoin has slowed down over the past several days, but it does not mean market participants should give up on the pioneer cryptocurrency. He believes coming events will regenerate an active market for Bitcoin.



In a recently uploaded video, George argued that the effect of upcoming macroeconomic events will favor Bitcoin. The CryptosRUs analyst highlighted the proposed interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve as a signal for an imminent Bitcoin supply squeeze. He further noted that other top economies plan the same thing and would implement rate cuts.









To explain this, George cited Switzerland, one of the top economies to implement rate cuts this year. He considers it a confirmation that several other top economies have concluded plans to revitalize their economies soon. The analyst believes it would encourage liquidity flows, with a significant volume flowing into assets, including Bitcoin.



Another factor George thinks will contribute to the supply squeeze is the ETFs. In his analysis, he predicts the outflow seen on Grayscale is bound to slow down based on a diminishing supply. According to him, that would have a massive impact on the Bitcoin supply squeeze, especially with the newly launched ETFs creating more inflow.



The analyst noted that Grayscale sold half of its ETF supply in eleven weeks, suggesting they would soon run out of volume. According to George, that would be a significant moment for the supply squeeze, especially with the other ETFs injecting more money into the Bitcoin ecosystem.



For prediction, George believes Bitcoin has more room for growth and could rally to $500,000 by the end of 2025. The flagship crypto traded for $65,191 at the time of writing, recovering from a recent dip to $60,760, according to data from TradingView.

Don't buy Bitcoin on this day!


Crypto traders know that many factors affect investing in cryptocurrencies. Timing your Bitcoin (BTC) purchase right can get you more value for the same amount. At the same time, the opposite is true: bad timing can mean that you just wasted a part of your money that you did not have to.
Today’s article will discuss the worst day you can pick to buy Bitcoin, explain why you should avoid buying crypto coins on this day, and provide other relevant information on how to properly time your Bitcoin investments.
Volatility of Bitcoin
Bitcoin price, like that of all crypto, is notoriously volatile. Compared with stocks and bonds, it can swing wildly and frequently within a short time.


The main reason for this is the cryptocurrency’s relatively young age, as it has not yet gained universal acceptance, as well as market demand, trader sentiment, regulation, and the state of the global market.
Therefore, the patterns of change and price cycles are chaotic, and attempting to time the market is tricky. If you want to deal with BTC, you need to be prepared for these fluctuations.
Which factors determine the price of Bitcoin?
Despite the unpredictability of Bitcoin price, there are key factors that can determine the worst possible day to buy BTC. These include:
Price movement patterns
Careful research on how Bitcoin price changes can yield the best and worst times to buy the crypto token. One way to determine this is to perform technical analysis, which studies historical price data for the asset. Alternatively, you can consult chart patterns and trading indicators to forecast future price swings. 
Support and resistance levels are another strategy that can provide you with pressure points on certain price levels. These can tell you the potential times when selling pressure overwhelms buying pressure, which is when you definitely do not want to buy Bitcoin. 
Finally, you can track price trends using moving averages, which are technical indicators that smooth out day-to-day price fluctuations to reveal a possible pattern over a specific period of time. Depending on the time frame, you will want to use different moving averages, which are then used to signal a bearish crossover when you should definitely not buy Bitcoin, as its price will likely go down.
Global crypto market trends
You should always consider the wider market sentiment when you decide to buy Bitcoin. Bad news and negative developments in the world of crypto will likely bring down the value of these assets, which can be a good time to buy if you expect the market to rebound. On the other hand, positive news can ripple through the community, raising confidence in the token and driving up the price. It is crucial to stay in the loop regarding Bitcoin, which means following press releases, news sources, and crypto social media platforms and forums. 
Quarter-year patterns
Some traders claim that Bitcoin displays different price patterns depending on the season or quarter of the year. While historical performance is a fickle and notoriously unreliable indicator, sifting through past data can uncover potential regular movements that can help you determine when to buy and sell crypto.
For example, some analysts claim that Bitcoin price tends to follow the price of other assets and commodities and peaks during the pre-holiday and holiday seasons, which are November and December. The reasoning is that gift-buying and seasonal shopping sprees increase demand for cryptocurrency, which is then higher than the rest of the year. If this is true, this is a bad time to buy Bitcoin.
Day of the week effect
The day-of-the-week effect is an alleged phenomenon in which traders can predict price shift patterns depending on the day of the week. While concrete academic and practical research is very limited on this topic, some studies and experiments have demonstrated that certain days of the week are better for buying BTC than others.
Some historical data shows that the price of Bitcoin is higher during weekdays than on weekends, which can indicate reduced crypto trading activity and investor fatigue that leads to a decrease in demand. The weekend is a time of less volatility due to lower trading volumes, so less opportunity to get a good deal. 



When is the best time to buy bitcoin?

From Reddit users doing their own experiments to university bloggers, there is a broad consensus that Bitcoin price tends to be the highest during the early days of the week, specifically on Tuesday. If this is true, you should not buy Bitcoin on Tuesday. However, relying on technical indicators and daily research is always better than apocryphal stories online, especially if sufficient and reliable studies do not back them. To compare, check out our research for the best day to buy Bitcoin here.

A factor to consider when buying Bitcoin – dollar-cost averaging (DCA)
Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a common investment approach aimed at solving the issue of timing purchases, including Bitcoin. By spreading out trades over regular intervals, DCA annuls the effects of short-term price fluctuations and allows you the opportunity to acquire BTC over time.
Some advantages that DCA provides include:

Eliminating the risk of bad market timing;
Smoother market entry and negation of short-term BTC price instability;
Potentially lowering the average cost you pay for the same value.




Dollar-cost averaging
Lump sum investing


Investment strategy
Purchases at regular intervals over time
A one-time lump sum investment


Timing consideration
Timing the market has less effect
Timing the market is a major factor


Risk management
Helps mitigate short-term price fluctuations
Factors in immediate market conditions


Psychological impact
Less effort and stress associated with market timing
May lead to bad calls if the timing isn’t done right


Table 1: Comparison of dollar-cost averaging vs. lump sum investing
The bottom line: Is now a bad time to buy Bitcoin?
Many factors determine the day you should NOT buy Bitcoin, as the market is highly complex and volatile. You should factor in market trends, repeated price movements, quarter-year patterns, and the day-of-the-week effect. However, if you tend to trust the rumors, just skip Tuesdays.
Jokes aside, always do your research and keep informed about the global trends in order to find out the best and worst possible days to purchase Bitcoin. You will have much more confidence in your decisions, and, ultimately, your crypto investing results will be better if you ground your strategy on solid foundations.

XRP Set For Rapid Rally, Target At $5 In The Short Term


                            XRP continues to maintain its spot as one of the leading cryptocurrency assets in the crypto market today after witnessing a notable rally starting the day at the $0.64 price mark, putting it in the limelight.
Although the price of XRP is still lagging behind its all-time high level of $3.30, some analysis indicates that it may soon start to rise toward its peak. Following the recent rise, several analysts anticipate XRP will rally even further and reach unprecedented heights in the upcoming months.
Short-Term Price Target Set At $5 For XRP
Jake Gagain, a cryptocurrency expert and trader, has made a daring prediction for XRP, noting that the asset could reach a new peak in this bull cycle. The analyst forecast delves into the crypto asset’s potential to move higher before and after the Bitcoin Halving event, which is expected to take place in April.

Gagain asserts that “XRP is one of the top crypto assets today.” However, “unlike other notable coins,” the coin achieved its all-time high record of $3.30 over 6 years ago.
Furthermore, Gagain claims that the token was unable to reach a new peak in the 2021 bull run due to its legal disputes with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
In December 2020, the SEC charged Ripple with raising over $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP in an unregistered securities offering, which Gagain believes was the reason for the coin lagging behind in 2021. Another factor considered by Gagain was the massive number of tokens that “developers were dumping “on a monthly basis.” 
However, if the company manages to win the lawsuit, Gagain believes XRP could hit a new all-time high at the climax of the present bull cycle. As a result, the crypto analyst is placing his price target at the $5 threshold after the bull run ends.
According to Jake Gagain, the Bitcoin halving event is just around 30 days away, and the market is already showing strong momentum. Specifically, the entire crypto market cap is at $2.5 trillion, indicating an over 4% increase in the past day after a slow week.
Gagain also addressed a few other leading crypto assets in the market, predicting massive gains before the halving. These include Bitcoin (BTC) – the biggest digital asset, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA).
$1 Target For April In Progress
Another crypto analyst optimistic about XRP is Dark Defender, predicting that a “$1 price mark by April is in progress.” This suggests that the coin could attain this level before the halving occurrence.

Dark Defender highlighted that as of February 28, the asset was trading at $0.58. Meanwhile, he expects XRP to be pegged at “$0.6462 by March 1, $0.77-$0.92 on March 13, and $1 by April.”
Given the new peak of $0.75, he believes the Fibonacci Levels in the short term will be at $0.9772-$1.5048, $2.3172. He expects his April targets to develop “if XRP maintains the $0.58 Orange Support level, which performed admirably.”

SoundHound AI Inc.'s Executives Cash Out as Stock Continues to Slide - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



SoundHound AI Inc. (NASDAQ: SOUN), a prominent player in the voice-enabled AI and conversational intelligence technology sector, has recently been in the spotlight due to significant insider selling activities and stock price volatility.



The company’s top executives, including the CEO, COO, and VP of Engineering, have sold many shares, raising questions about their confidence in the firm’s prospects. This insider selling coincides with a noticeable downturn in SoundHound AI stock price.



Insider Selling at SoundHound AI Inc.



In a series of transactions on March 19, 2024, critical insiders at SoundHound AI Inc., a leader in voice-enabled AI and conversational intelligence technologies, sold their shares. Michael Zagorsek, the Chief Operating Officer, disposed of 24,105 shares at an average price of $8.37, resulting in a total sale value of approximately $201,718.85. Meanwhile, Keyvan Mohajer, the company’s CEO and 10% owner sold 48,837 shares at the same price point, amassing about $408,837.79 from the transaction. 



Further sales underscored the trend, with Majid Emami, Vice President of Engineering, selling 17,041 shares at an average price of $8.3656, which netted approximately $142,558. This sale was particularly noted to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to vesting shares from restricted stock units granted to Emami. Additionally, Eric R. Ball, a company director, liquidated 90,000 shares at an average price of $5.94, collecting around $534,810.





SoundHound AI Inc. Continues Downturn in Premarket Trading Friday



SoundHound AI Inc. witnessed notable volatility in its stock price in recent trading, underscoring the fluctuating investor sentiment surrounding the voice-enabled AI and conversational intelligence technology firm. The stock closed at $6.68 on Thursday, experiencing a sharp decline of $1.25, or -15.76%. This downturn continued in pre-market trading, where it was already down by $0.64, or -9.58%, at the time of writing.



The movement marked a significant shift from its previous close of $7.93, despite opening slightly higher at $8.00, only fluctuating between $6.65 and $8.42 throughout the trading day. This trading pattern reflects the broader challenges and investor perceptions facing the tech company in a highly competitive market.



The company’s stock performance over the last year has been equally tumultuous, with a 52-week range between $1.49 and $10.25. This illustrates the high volatility and potential risk associated with SoundHound AI’s shares. On the most recent insider transactions date, SoundHound AI Inc.’s market capitalization stood at approximately $2.066 billion.

                        Meme coin FLOKI appears to have rebounded from a March 19 bottom of $0.000165 as it trades today at $0.000225, a hefty appreciation of about 36%, according to figures taken from CoinGecko. Like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu before it (SHIB) and BONK and DogWifHat (WIF) after it, FLOKI is based on the eminently memeable Shiba Inu.However, FLOKI’s inspiration and IRL namesake is a Shiba Inu with a famous owner: Elon Musk.In terms of overnight gains, DOGE and SHIB firmly outpaced FLOKI. The largest meme coin by market capitalization, DOGE, blew up by about 4.7% overnight. SHIB posted more modest 24-hour gains of about 1.2%.FLOKI’s performance is more in line with the broader market, though. In general, crypto is down today. Market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum both shed 2.5% while FLOKI dropped 7.7% to post heavier overnight losses than any of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.Over on FLOKI’s trading chart, we can see that it is currently trading at a new support level that it found after a sharp but volatile rally in early March.FLOKI is roughly the same price as its 30-day moving average, and with a relative strength index (RSI) reading of 49 there is likely to be more selling throughout the day but the price is altogether stableSource: TradingViewAs FLOKI Rebounds, GBTC Gains Momentum
Meme coins are a whimsical game.The rapid nature of their price movements, which often exaggerate the gains and losses of market leaders like Bitcoin, make them into a bit of an investment gamble, often with higher stakes involved.That’s why prudent investors limit and spread risk and diversify their portfolios with more useful (although perhaps less funnier) projects.However, in assessing projects to speculate on, two considerations reign supreme: utility and upside potential.Green Bitcoin (GBTC) just raised $7.6 million over a two-week-long presale because early investors think it checks those two boxes.GBTC has a hardcap of 21 million, a clear nod to its inspiration, Bitcoin. Limiting the number of tokens in circulation creates value through scarcity.However, GBTC’s use of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain over Bitcoin’s less energy-efficient proof-of-work mechanism makes it cleaner and greener than its inspiration.Green Bitcoin touts itself as a “gamified green staking” project. Essentially, token holders participate through the staking platform, where they earn GBTC rewards by predicting Bitcoin price trends.Holders can stake their tokens for up to six months to earn even bigger rewards.Staking is a fundamental part of Green Bitcoin’s tokenomics. By reducing GBTC’s circulating supply, staking helps drive the price over the long term.Anyone can get involved by simply visiting the official Green Bitcoin website and connecting a crypto wallet.1 GBTC presently costs $1.1062, with the price due to rise in a little over six days.There are still a few weeks left of the presale, and the token could rally sharply by the time it’s listed on major exchanges.Get in early and Buy Green Bitcoin Now

$25 Billion XRP Surge: What Happened?

XRP's real trading volume surged to a whopping $25 billion in the last 48 hours. But the reasoning behind it is not clear. Let's try to break it all down.From the real volume chart, it is clear that there has been a steady rise in trading, but recently, things really took off. A jump this big makes you think, why now? One reason could be that the market is getting out of correction mode, and when that happens, large caps like XRP often see a lot of action.XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewXRP's price has been bouncing up and down, but there was a moment when it shot up higher than it had in a while. This is what traders call a "higher high." It means that, for a moment, people were willing to pay more for XRP than they have in recent times.The key levels to watch now are the support around $0.50, where the price has bounced back before, and the resistance near $0.60, which is like a ceiling that the price has to break through to keep climbing.Now, for a bit of guesswork as to why this might be happening. It could be that investors are getting more confident about the future and starting to buy more XRP, despite the fact that the asset remains suppressed. If this trend keeps up, we could see XRP's price climb higher, especially if it breaks past that resistance level. But as always with cryptocurrencies, it is a wait-and-see game. There is always a chance that prices could swing the other way, so it is important to keep an eye on the market.A sudden surge in XRP's volume could mean a lot of things, but one thing's for sure: XRP might be finally getting ready for a proper reversal. However, growth of underlying metric does not necessarily means growth of an asset's price.

Vitalik Says Ethereum Must Achieve Mainstream Adoption Within Five Years - The Defiant

Buterin pointed to stablecoins and non-financial applications like social and identity as key opportunities for Ethereum to reach new users.Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder and chief scientist, believes the next five years will be critical in determining whether the network can achieve mainstream adoption.Speaking during an interview at the ETHTaipei conference on March 20, Buterin predicted that the next half-decade will prove whether Ethereum is ready for “real-world” adoption.Buterin said stablecoins have emerged as the leading use case for crypto in recent years. Indeed, stable tokens facilitate frictionless payments, protection from price fluctuations and inflation for users residing in countries with volatile fiat currencies, and a popular on-and-off ramp to the broader web3 ecosystem.Buterin asserted that low fees and high-quality user interfaces are critical to ensure that stablecoins continue to reach new audiences.“Historically, Ethereum has not had those things, but, over the next five years, Ethereum will start to have those things,” Buterin said. “We’re already seeing Layer 2s… starting to get there... I expect Ethereum to be a very leading player in helping to make stablecoin accessible to people in a way that actually is open, actually is decentralized, and actually doesn’t require trusting fragile third-parties.”Buterin’s comments came a little over one week after Ethereum’s highly-anticipated Dencun hard fork went live, ushering in a huge reduction in Layer 2 transactions through the activation of EIP-4844.Data from GrowThePie shows the average transaction fees on leading L2s plummeting by up to 98% since Dencun’s deployment, making Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem competitive with low-cost Layer 1s like Tron and BNB Chain while inheriting the decentralization of Ethereum’s base layer.Tron and BNB Chain, networks that offer low fees at the expense of adopting a highly centralized network architecture, currently dominate on-chain stablecoin activity.A recent report from the Brevan Howard hedge fund found that 49% of weekly active wallets using stablecoins resided on Tron at 2.41 million, followed by BNB Chain with 1.37 million users or a 28% dominance. Ethereum came in third with just 379,769 or a 7.7% market share.Data from DeFi Llama also suggests Tether (USDT) on Tron boasts a 70% dominance with $104 billion of the on-chain stablecoin sector’s $148 billion market cap.Non-financial applicationsButerin also predicted that “‘non-financial applications” will have a significant “impact” as a vehicle driving mainstream adoption, noting the success of decentralized social platforms including Farcaster and Lens.“There is a big desire to have alternatives to things like Twitter and Facebook at the moment,” he said. “Farcaster has] managed to be used by non-crypto people in a way that a lot of other applications have not. I think that’s an important success to build on and for other applications to try to replicate.”Vitalik also highlighted the growing interest in decentralized identity and proof-of-personhood protocols on Ethereum amid the backdrop of increasing concerns regarding the rise of artificial intelligence.“One of the big challenges that people are worrying about right now is how to prove that an account on some platform is a person, as opposed to being a bot,” Buterin said. “The big risk I see is that when people need to solve that problem, people will jump to centralized solutions, and centralized solutions… are going to have very bad risks in terms of excluding all kinds of people.”Buterin also noted that prominent ideas underpinning the ethos of web3 are also beginning to penetrate the mainstream. He cited the upcoming initial public offering from Reddit, the popular social media platform, which will give highly active users including contributors and moderators “the ability to participate on the same terms as institutional investors.” Reddit likely drew inspiration from the airdrop model that rewards early adopters of web3 dApps.Expanding Ethereum’s validator ecosystemLooking forward, Vitalik emphasized his excitement for Verkle Trees, which will be implemented as part of Ethereum’s next hard fork, Pectra. Buterin noted that technical barriers are persistently cited as a major factor discouraging ETH holders from staking.“With Verkle Trees, as a node, you would not have to store the state locally. And with EIP-4444: History Expiry, you would not have to store most of the history locally,” Buterin said. “The amount of data that you would need to be a node would decrease from multiple terabytes to... being able to run a node in RAM.”Vitalik continued that the future introduction of zk-SNARKs will reduce the data burden for nodes even further.“In the long term, running a node will feel like… a few very simple computations that will be very easy to do as a background process on any computer, maybe even a phone, even inside a browser,” Buterin said. “There’s a pre-existing technology roadmap to get to that point.”

Optimistic Trends for Floki Inu



Despite recent market downturns, Floki Inu’s valuation exhibits potential recovery signs, notably after a drop to an intraday low. The emergence of a hammer candlestick pattern, combined with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) standing and positive readings from the Awesome Oscillator (AO), hints at an upcoming positive shift in its price trajectory. 








Should the buying momentum persist, Floki Inu is expected to solidify its current level as a support base, possibly aiming for a higher Fibonacci retracement mark, although it faces significant resistance ahead. Alternatively, an increase in selling pressure might push the price down further, potentially negating the optimistic outlook and prompting additional sell-offs. 



Anticipated Price Adjustment for XRP



XRP’s journey has been rocky, marred by ongoing legal entanglements and asset liquidation by Ripple, casting a shadow over its market valuation. Despite a recent uptick, XRP’s growth is relatively subdued when compared to its peers. Presently, technical indicators suggest an imminent price correction, with the currency at a crossroads, influenced heavily by overarching market moods. 







BlockDAG: Pioneering the Crypto Mining Sector And Much More



BlockDAG is at the forefront of the presale domain, introducing its groundbreaking X-series mining rigs, which are set to transform the cryptocurrency mining industry with their energy efficiency and superior performance. The product range, from the X1 (mobile mining app) to the X100 models, caters to various mining needs, offering substantial daily BDAG coin yields.




Currently in its third presale stage, BlockDAG’s coin price is expected to soar, predicting a substantial return on investment by the end of the presale phases. The initial enthusiasm from investors is evident from the swift accumulation of $6.8 million and the fast selling out of batch 3 presale. The presale is leading to a grand $2 million giveaway, engaging the community and rewarding participation.







Additionally, over 4.3 billion BDAG coins have been sold already, as the project still in the third batch of a total 45 in presale. The technology behind this blockchain is a hybrid and highly effective one (recently revealed in a video keynote displayed at Shibuya Crossing, Tokyo), characterized by the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) that help with all the questions related to transaction speed and Proof-of-Work (Pow) which ensures that questions as security, decentralization and scalability are heavily guarded.



Concluding Thoughts



As the cryptocurrency industry evolves, Ripple’s XRP faces a looming price correction amidst regulatory challenges. Floki Inu, however, presents a hopeful scenario for investors, contingent on sustained buyer interest. 



BlockDAG stands out with its presale momentum and the transformative potential of its mining technology, promising amazing returns (the latest keynote specified potential returns already reaching 5,000x). These developments signify a dynamic phase in the cryptocurrency market, highlighting opportunities amid uncertainties.

Shorthanded EU Struggles in Crypto Regulation Risk Falling behind Global Standards | Coinspeaker



EU’s securities watchdog ESMA struggles to keep pace with crypto regulations as ESMA confronts resource constraints.

Establishing a robust regulatory frame­work for cryptocurrencies remains a significant obje­ctive for the European Union (EU). Howe­ver, the European Se­curities and Markets Authority (ESMA) confronts a substantial impedime­nt due to resource constraints. As a result, the EU risks falling behind othe­r markets in embracing cryptocurrencie­s and blockchain technology.
Overse­eing Europe’s complex financial landscape­ is a primary endeavor for ESMA, the­ Union’s premier regulatory authority. Ve­rena Ross, the este­emed chairperson, acknowledges this challenge, highlighting the several additional responsibilities and warrants assigned to the agency in recent years.




“Resources is an issue for ESMA generally because we have had a large number of additional responsibilities and mandates given to us over the last few years, and not always necessarily with a lot of additional resources, […] That has certainly created some challenges for us”, Ross said in a recent interview.
One­ such consequence is the­ delay of the Europe­an Commission’s October 2023 deadline for asse­ssing the potential inclusion of crypto assets within Ucits funds – a wide­ly favored investment ve­hicle among European retail inve­stors. However, as acknowle­dged by the Chair, Vere­na Ross, resource constraints have required a significant delay, pote­ntially deferring the time­line to the end of 2024 or e­ven early 2025.
EU Struggles with Crypto Regulation Challenges
The European Union lags be­hind when it comes to crypto oversight. Me­anwhile, America embrace­s digital assets with open arms. Bitcoin ETFs soared state­side, netting $11 billion since January 2024. This regulatory agility allows US investors easy e­ntry into the crypto world – a stark contrast to Europe’s glacial pace and rigid re­gulations. Capital flight looms as funds seek gree­ner, pro-innovation pastures overse­as.
Furthermore, the lack of harmonization regulations within the­ European Union poses significant challenge­s. Jupiter Fund Management’s experience serves as a prime example. While their Irish Ucits fund was forced to abandon a planned crypto investment due­ to harsh Irish regulations, Spain permits e­xposure to such assets through exchange­-traded products.
The Urgency for Action
The growing convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurre­ncies underlines the­ pressing need for a transpare­nt and cohesive regulatory frame­work within the European Union. The e­mergence of US-base­d ETFs and the UK’s receptive­ness to comparable offerings acce­ntuate this developme­nt. ESMA acknowledges this interconnectedness and stresses the importance of getting the Ucits review right.
“What we’re seeing happen is just an increased interconnectedness between crypto assets and the traditional financial sector and various products,” Ross said
With mere­ly 300 staff and a €75.2 million budget unchanged from last year, ESMA is forced to prioritize tasks rigorously. This may involve strategic staff allocation potentially retraining existing employees to specialise in crypto regulation. Additionally, a phased rollout of MiCA could ease the implementation burden for both ESMA and member states.
The EU needs to address ESMA’s resource constraints to ensure effective crypto regulation. A well-funded and empowered watchdog is crucial for fostering innovation, protecting investors, and ensuring the EU remains competitive in the global digital asset landscape.

U.S. SEC's Gensler Says Crypto Firms Skip Public Disclosures by Dodging Registration

Gensler, whose tenure atop the agency has been marked by a legal crusade against what he argues is a largely noncompliant industry, suggested that digital assets businesses are among those seeking to "whittle away at the SEC's disclosure regime," which requires companies to register securities and provide information to investors about them.

Worldcoin makes Orb software open-source, implements ‘personal custody’

The Worldcoin Foundation announced in a blog post that it has open-sourced components of the software running its iris-scanning Orbs, making it publicly available. According to the announcement the core components of the Orb software can be accessed on GitHub under an MIT/Apache 2.0 dual license. The new open-source components “complement” hardware it previously released. The release includes code on the Orb which is crucial for capturing images and securely transferring them to the product's app. Worldcoin said that its publicly available software and iris recognition repositories mark “significant progress” in creating transparency for the Orb’s image processing, along with verifiable privacy claims.In addition to open-sourcing more of the software behind the infamous metallic, eye-scanning Orb, Worldcoin revealed another privacy feature called “Personal Custody.” This new feature allows individual users to self-custody their data given over to Worldcoin through a data package signed with the Orb’s private key and then encrypted with a user-provided public key before it is transferred to the user's mobile phone. The developer said this means that users will “always remain in control of their data,” and only the individual can decrypt this biometric data. Worldcoin said:“Once the encrypted data is sent from the Orb to the individual’s World App, no unencrypted copies of this data exist anywhere.” According to the developer, the feature could potentially reduce the number of times users would need to return to an Orb to verify their World ID. Related: Data privacy and security concerns worry nearly half of tech industry consumers: ReportThis update to Worldcoin comes as the company faces scrutiny from global regulators over privacy concerns. On March 21, the Kenyan government denied a request from the United States government to revoke its suspensions of the Worldcoin project. The government said it would ban Worldcoin activities in the country until it can be assured of its safety for the Kenyan people and integrity of financial details are provided.On March 18, Worldcoin posted on its blog that it operates “lawfully in all of the locations in which it is available” and is fully compliant with all laws and regulations governing data collection and data transfer.However, earlier in March, it received more pushback. This time, the Spanish Agency for the Protection of Data demanded that Worldcoin stop collecting and processing data locally and issued a temporary ban on its operations.Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the firm behind artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot ChatGPT. OpenAI is also currently facing scrutiny for its decision not to open-source its code for its AI models.

We Asked AI to Predict March Madness Winners-Here's Our Bracket - Decrypt

March Madness is upon us, with the western sports world obsessed with analyzing and picking how the NCAA men's basketball tournament will unfold—a task that the sports league says has odds of one in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808. Of course, the 1:9.2 quintillion odds assume a 50-50 probability for each matchup, no better than a coin flip.Each team and game brings countless variables, and that's what makes March Madness predictions so engrossing for fans (and oddsmakers). It's a lot of information for humans to process, but how about artificial intelligence?Beating the oddsAfter the first eight games, fewer than 2.5% brackets remain perfect, the NCAA says—the biggest "bracket buster" on day one was third-ranked Kentucky losing to #14 Oakland U, 80-76 on Thursday.In fact, if every single person who has ever lived on Earth since the dawn of time filled out a different bracket, there would still be a 99.9999999883% chance that nobody would pick every winner. If you had drafted a unique bracket every second that has elapsed since the Big Bang, there would still be effectively zero likelihood of a perfect score.Against that, you have a comparably great chance of winning a lottery.Enter AINobody has picked a perfect bracket so far. No human, that is. Machine learning has long been enlisted to aid in the endeavor, but now AI has advanced at an explosive rate.Google—a company not typically keen on promoting betting or gambling—has been researching and sharing findings related to March Madness predictions for years. The tech giant has an entire section dedicated to teaching how to use Google Cloud to analyze NCAA basketball data. This allows folks to dig into various variables, compare game performance metrics, download comprehensive player and team stats, and more.Google has even been an official partner of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, sharing data analysis tools for America's biggest annual sports spectacle as a use case for AI in big data analysis in 2020.Picking an AI to pick winnersAI has since advanced at an explosive rate, and there are manifold ways to harness artificial intelligence for bracketology: you could process reams of data according to your own methodology, trust another's work, or even train your own model from scratch.We opted for the lazier path and consulted ChatGPT. Among the many basketball-savvy GPTs available, we picked "March Madness Bracket Buster Bot" because it was the only one to show a real statistical analysis behind its predictions.Spoiler alert, the bracket was busted after day one.East:
Florida Atlantic vs. Northwestern: This could be tight, but I'm leaning toward Northwestern with their balanced play. Correct!
Illinois vs. Morehead St.: Illinois' seed suggests they're the team to beat in this one. Correct!
Washington St. vs. Drake: Washington St. seems poised to pull through with their strong seeding. Correct!
Iowa St. vs. South Dakota St.: Iowa St.'s seeding and stat line say they'll dance on. Correct!
BYU vs. Duquesne: BYU might just have the edge with their dynamic offense. Wrong.
UConn vs. Stetson: The power's definitely surging through UConn here, and I'd expect them to advance.
San Diego St. vs. UAB: San Diego St. has the defensive chops to shut down UAB.
Auburn vs. Yale: Auburn should dominate this academic showdown on the court.
West:
North Carolina vs. Wagner: North Carolina's history and stats say they'll advance. Correct!
Dayton vs. Nevada: Dayton's consistent play all season makes them the pick here. Correct!
Arizona vs. Long Beach St.: Arizona's ranking and stats make them the clear favorite. Correct!
Mississippi St. vs. Michigan St.: Mississippi St. has a good chance, but it’s going to be a nail-biter. Wrong.
South:
Texas Tech vs. NC State: Texas Tech's higher seed points to victory. Wrong.
Houston vs. Montana: Houston is the team to beat with their impressive seed.
Wisconsin vs. James Madison: Wisconsin is the favorite here, thanks to their powerful lineup.
Duke vs. Vermont: Duke is likely to show why they're a perennial powerhouse.
Midwest:
Gonzaga vs. McNeese St.: Gonzaga's pedigree in March Madness should see them through. Correct!
Kansas vs. Sanford: Kansas should have no trouble advancing past Sanford. Correct!
Creighton vs. Akron: Creighton's higher seeding should be the difference-maker. Correct!
Texas vs. Colorado St.: Texas' stats suggest they'll round up a win here. Correct!
Tennessee vs. Saint Peter's: Tennessee's impressive seed and stats make them the pick. Correct!
South Carolina vs. Oregon: This could be a toss-up, but South Carolina might just sneak by. Wrong.
Second, and third, opinionsOther AI models provided different results, though many of them agreed on certain outcomes, like BYU beating Duquesne—which didn't pan out yesterday. The unpredictability of humans prevails again. Duquesne certainly beat the odds scoring its first win in half a century, with many of ESPN’s stats favoring BYU by a large margin.Image: ESPNWe also checked Kaggle.com, a platform for data science competitions and an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners, to see if there was something out there for "bracketologists"—and indeed there was. A machine learning model published by Nishaan Amin analyzed 153 MB of data files with dozens of charts and thousands of statistics and information. The repository has been checked over 4,000 times until today.This lets you adapt the model and analyze what you consider important, fitting your style. The owner shared its own predictions.The model says UConn will win the tournament after beating Purdue, but it hints that Connecticut has a chance to beat Purdue before the finals.The model also provides an upset bracket simulation with different parameters and results for those who like alternatives:Of course, predicting human behavior—whether for bracketology, sabermetrics, or technical analysis—is an inexact science. Models analyze past performance and make predictions in "ceteris paribus" conditions: the most likely outcome if everything happens under the exact same circumstances as before.A machine learning model can analyze huge amounts of data and find patterns that may be hidden before our eyes, understanding the relationship between hundreds or even thousands of variables. But no model or methodology can foresee extraordinary circumstances like an Elon Musk tweet tanking the whole crypto market, someone having an existential crisis and market-selling a huge crypto position, a team riding high off their fans' energy, a star player's untimely injury, or a hungover squad fresh off a massive rager.So AI won’t solve the problems that only time machines can. In the end, that's what makes sports so compelling: the underdog stories, the stunning upsets, the unknown variables that defy the odds. We already failed on our first day after picking BYU. But sometimes David beats Goliath, slinging a stone to take down an armored giant. That probably happened in March.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Trezor says phishing, not SIM swap, compromised X account

SatoshiLabs, the company that designs and markets Trezor crypto hardware wallets, has issued a detailed explanation of an incident that led to the posting of fraudulent presale token announcements on its official X account.The company said the security breach was caused by a phishing attack, not a SIM-swap attack, which it suspected at the time.SatoshiLabs emphasized that it does not use a mobile device for two-factor authentication, instead opting for more secure methods of authentication.Despite these precautions, attackers made a series of unauthorized and misleading posts, including requests for users to send funds to an unidentified wallet address alongside harmful links, which sent users to a bogus token presale site.Independent blockchain sleuth ZachXBT notified his 528,000 followers on X of Trezor’s suspected breach in a March 19 X post.The official X account of hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor published a series of posts directing users to fraudulent presale token offerings. Source: TrezorSatoshiLabs disclosed that it detected unauthorized entry into its X account on March 19. It now suspects it to be a sophisticated and premeditated phishing attack planned by hackers over several weeks.Once SatoshiLabs became aware of the breach, the deceptive posts were promptly identified and removed, limiting damage. The company said:“We want to stress here that the security of all our products remains unaffected. This incident has in no way impacted or compromised the security of Trezor hardware wallets or any of our other products.”Investigations indicate that starting on Feb. 29, the attackers posed as credible entities in the cryptosphere. They maintained a convincing social media presence and engaged in seemingly authentic discussions.Related: HECO Chain exploiter anonymizes $145M of Ether on Tornado Cash in 8 daysUnder the guise of a well-established X account with thousands of followers, the impersonator contacted SatoshiLabs’ public relations team, suggesting an interview with the CEO. Following this, a meeting was arranged, during which the impersonator shared a malicious link disguised as a Calendly calendar invitation.A team member was prompted for their X login credentials by clicking the calendar link, raising suspicion. However, the meeting was rescheduled. In the next session — pretending to be facing technical issues — the attacker succeeded in linking their Calendly to SatoshiLabs’ X account.Trezor suffered a security breach in January that exposed the contact information of nearly 66,000 users. According to the firm’s website, the wallet maker has sold over two million hardware wallets since it launched in 2012.

2 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week


Meme coins surged for impressive gains year-to-date, dominating most of the cryptocurrency market’s top performances in 2024. However, the results cooled down in the past week while cryptocurrencies faced a major correction, threatening further losses.
Over $230 billion was wiped in a day from March 18 to March 19. The overall sentiment drastically changed from ultra-bullish to slightly bearish, which can put an end to the meme coin’s hype.
In this context, Finbold selected two cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week, among the previously most traded speculative tokens.


Pepe (PEPE)
Pepe (PEPE) has seen over 500% gains in the last 30 days, from $0.000000115 on February 22.
Now, PEPE loses momentum, back to a 55 Relative Strength Index (RSI), similar to one month ago. A bearish divergence appears to be surging in the daily chart, as the price remains high despite the strength loss.
Currently, PEPE has a market cap above $3 billion and no solid use cases besides price speculation and being a meme. There is price support at $0.000005927 but no other meaningful support between that and $0.000000115, for a 98% drop.
PEPE/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView (Finbold)
Dogwifhat (WIF)
Second, Dogwifhat (WIF) had an even greater performance, attracting retail investors to the Solana (SOL) blockchain. WIF is up nearly 600% in 30 days while testing support at around $2.0 per token.
Like PEPE, dogwifhat investors may finally decide to realize part of their massive profits, which could create a liquidity shock. Losing the current region would potentially drive the price to its month-over-month lows at $0.29, for an 86% crash.
WIF/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView (Finbold)
Why investors should avoid trading meme coins?
The most dangerous aspect of trading meme coins is that, without further use cases, prices can engage in a death spiral once the hype goes away. Notably, investors usually deploy capital to these tokens in the expectation of selling for higher prices for the next buyer.
This behavior is described as “The Greater Fool Theory” by finance experts.

“The Greater Fool Theory is the idea that, during a market bubble, one can make money by buying overvalued assets and selling them for a proﬁt later, because it will always be possible to ﬁnd someone who is willing to pay a higher price. An investor who subscribes to the Greater Fool Theory will buy potentially overvalued assets without any regard for their fundamental value. This speculative approach is predicated on the belief that you can make money by gambling on future asset prices and that you will always be able to ﬁnd a “greater fool” who will be willing to pay more than you did. Unfortunately, when the bubble eventually bursts (which it always does), there is a large sell-oﬀ that causes a rapid decline in the asset values. During the sell-oﬀ, you can lose a great deal of money if you are the one left holding the asset and cannot ﬁnd a buyer.”
– Harford Funds blog post: “The Greater Fool Theory: What Is It?”

This purely speculative demand works well while the market is bullish and prices can go up quickly, as observed. Nevertheless, sentiment shifts erase the demand, and investors can initiate a run, panic-selling the coins to avoid losses. In these events, the price drop can be faster than the previous pump, with low chances of recovery.
Yet, cryptocurrencies are unpredictable, and further support from celebrities or other news could fuel more greed and a rally continuation. On that note, investors should avoid trading PEPE and WIF in a zone of possible huge retracements, while higher prices are still possible.

Ripple's CTO Schwartz teases future possibilities with tweet

Ripple‘s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, recently stirred a curiosity within the XRP community with a cryptic tweet, leaving enthusiasts speculating about its potential significance. The tweet, featuring a mathematical problem yielding the solution “5,” prompted a flurry of interpretations, particularly regarding its implications for the future price of XRP.Following the enigmatic tweet, numerous XRP enthusiasts engaged in spirited discussions across social media platforms, particularly X, formerly known as Twitter. Many interpreted the numeric solution of “5” as a veiled prediction hinting at XRP’s price potentially reaching $5 in the foreseeable future. This interpretation gained traction, especially considering Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which could significantly impact XRP’s market dynamics.Ripple’s legal challenges with the SEC have been a focal point for both investors and enthusiasts. In a pivotal victory last year, a federal judge ruled that XRP sales on secondary markets do not constitute sales of securities. This ruling provided a boost to XRP’s value, briefly propelling it to $0.71. Furthermore, recent developments within the cryptocurrency regulatory landscape, including the approval of Grayscale’s spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) alongside others, have contributed to the evolving market sentiment surrounding XRP.As of the latest market data, XRP maintains its position as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently trading at $0.63214. Despite experiencing a 6.05% increase in value over the past 24 hours, a subsequent decline has moderated this growth to 4.91%.Schwartz ventures Into trading bot developmentIn a notable departure from his role as Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz has recently revealed his immersion into the world of algorithmic trading. This venture takes the form of a trading bot specifically crafted for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Representing a significant pivot within Schwartz’s career trajectory, this endeavor underscores his ongoing commitment to innovation and exploration within the cryptocurrency sphere.The trading bot, meticulously designed by Schwartz, draws inspiration from the mechanics of the XRP Ledger’s Automated Market Maker (AMM). This algorithmic approach aims to leverage market dynamics and liquidity to optimize trading strategies, potentially yielding favorable outcomes in an ever-evolving market environment.Schwartz’s decision to embark on this project reflects his deep-rooted understanding of blockchain technology and its practical applications beyond Ripple’s core operations. By harnessing the principles underlying the XRP Ledger’s AMM, Schwartz seeks to replicate its success in facilitating efficient and seamless transactions within centralized exchanges.Schwartz’s impact and future trajectoryMoreover, this initiative underscores Schwartz’s proactive stance toward embracing emerging trends and technologies within the cryptocurrency landscape. As the industry continues to evolve rapidly, characterized by dynamic market conditions and regulatory developments, Schwartz’s foray into algorithmic trading signifies a strategic move towards diversification and innovation.While acknowledging the early stages of development, Schwartz remains optimistic about the potential of the trading bot. He envisions it as a tool for empowering traders with enhanced efficiency and sophistication, ultimately contributing to a more robust and resilient cryptocurrency ecosystem.David Schwartz’s cryptic tweet and subsequent ventures into trading bot development have ignited speculation and interest within the XRP community. As enthusiasts eagerly anticipate potential price movements and technological advancements, the broader cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve amidst regulatory developments and market fluctuations. With XRP maintaining its position among the top cryptocurrencies, the community remains poised for further developments and opportunities in the digital asset space.Schwartz’s tweet and ongoing initiatives reflect the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where innovation and speculation intersect, shaping the future trajectory of digital assets like XRP.

Ethereum leads NFT sales despite market dip


Ethereum retained its position as the leading blockchain in non-fungible token (NFT) sales for the third consecutive day to close the week, CryptoSlam data shows.
Ethereum sales dipped by 63% on Friday, falling from Thursday’s US$32.81 million which was boosted by a single CryptoPunk NFT selling for US$16.38 million.
Following Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana ranked second and third, with sales volumes of US$7.99 million and US$6.10 million respectively in the same period.
Bitcoin experienced a 23% decrease in sales volume. This is the first time Bitcoin NFTs fell below US$10 million this week. 



Solana sales fell 7.62%.
These figures reflect a market that, while experiencing a general downturn, still sees fluctuations in activity across different blockchains.
BNB Chain had one of the strongest performances on Friday with a 12% sales increase to US$1.22 million. Its “lucky start” collection accounted for US$668,236 of those sales.

TICKER Presale Ends in $900K Theft by French Developer - DailyCoin


        
The project behind the TICKER token is in trouble.



The problem arose after the team completed a presale event.



A French developer faces scam allegations.
Popular blockchain detective ZachXBT has exposed an alleged crypto scam involving French developer Jolan Lacroix, who faces accusations of stealing nearly $1 million from the TICKER token presale event.The TICKER team launched a presale on March 16 and touted an elaborate token distribution plan, reserving 71% of the tokens for presale/airdrops, 24% for liquidity pool (LP,) 4% for errors, and 1% for early contributors. However, things took a different turn once the Token Generation Event (TGE) and presale were over.French Developer Accused of “Rugging Everyone”According to a recent X (Twitter) thread shared by ZachXBT, after raising 877 ETH ($3.19M) during the presale event, the TICKER team sent 15% of the TICKER supply to Jolan Lacroix, the developer tasked with assisting the project in distributing the airdrop.Instead of facilitating the airdrop, the developer reportedly sold 13% of the token’s supply for $900,000, “rugging everyone supporting the project.” The developer then began laundering the proceeds by bridging all of the ETH from Base to Ethereum via Orbiter Finance. This was followed by bridging everything to Solana via Mayan Swap & Allbridge.While it’s typical for most rug-pull scammers to lay low by going dark, Jolan allegedly taunted the people he stole from.“Jolan then went to X/Twitter to address the allegations and confirms he controls the stolen funds while saying he is “not sorry” for his actions taunting the people he rugged in three posts. The posts are no longer available as he deactivated his account.” ZachXBT wrote.ZachXBT further explained how Jolan later turned into an NFT collector and a memecoin trader using the stolen funds. The developer allegedly bridged $536K back to Ethereum, where they spent 46 ETH ($161K) on Milady & Milady derivative NFTs and started trading memecoins.Following the development ZachXBT has urged victims to come forward and file reports with law enforcement, promising to share the personal details of the developer with any of the affected people via DM.Read how another crypto project faced exit scam allegations:Humanized AI Faces Exit Scam Accusations After Going DarkStay updated on why MEXC faces more controversy:Why MEXC Faces Yet More Controversy, This Time in Hong Kong

$200,000,000 To Be Handed Out in US State With Zero Strings Attached - If New Guaranteed Income Proposal Passes - The Daily Hodl


								A US state is advancing a bill that would allocate $200 million to give to residents with no strings attached.
Representative Athena Hollins co-authored bill HF 2666, which seeks to create a guaranteed income program in Minnesota.










The bill has already advanced through a House committee, reports Minnesota Public Radio.
If the bill passes, $100 million would be allocated this year with an additional $100 million in 2025 to fund the program.
All households living at or below 300% of the federal poverty level would be eligible to apply.
Depending on demand, each household is expected to receive $350 to $1,200 every 30 days for 12 to 24 months.
Hollins says she expects the program to significantly impact the lives of participants while also benefiting communities across the state.
“So we’ve seen across the country, the studies that have been done on this, it shows that people end up having better jobs. They have better mental health outcomes. Studies done with people with young children, their children have better performances on testing and in daycares. 
Just across the board, we see an increase in health, well-being, economic development across the board.
And then the reality is, that money also flows back into local communities. And so, that’s what we’re really trying to do, is make sure that the communities where this help is needed across the state get to have access to it, and then hopefully bolster those local communities.” 
Funding for the program would come from the state’s general fund.

Spot Ether ETF Approval Faces Delays Amid Financial Institutions' Strategy Gaps



                    
The anticipated green light for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might face delays beyond their final decision deadline in May. 



Robby Greenfield, CEO of Umoja, a smart money protocol, highlighted to Cointelegraph the challenges large financial institutions face due to a lack of a clear strategy towards these ETFs. 




He pointed out, “What makes it difficult for institutions to position themselves advantageously with Bitcoin, Ether and cryptocurrencies generally is that they can’t facilitate the same market manipulating functions as with previous commodities. 



“You can’t create paper Bitcoin like you can create paper gold.” Several prominent firms, including BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, are in the race to launch an Ether ETF.



Despite these efforts, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart anticipates a rejection of the current Ether ETF applications in late May, referencing a March 19 post on X. 




This expectation follows the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent postponement of its decision on the Hashdex and ARK 21Shares spot Ether ETFs, with a final verdict due by late May.



The unique challenges posed by the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies like Ether complicate the development of institutional strategies for ETFs, though Greenfield believes approval is inevitable.

He asserts, “Whether it gets approved in May or in December, it’s inevitable… I wouldn’t understand why it wouldn’t be approved, particularly given that even the SEC’s perspective on Ether has been increasingly one of it being a commodity rather than a security.” 



The SEC has set specific deadlines for the decision on applications from various companies, ranging from May 23 to August 7.



Moreover, the hesitance of large institutional players to dive into decentralized finance (DeFi) stems from infrastructure inadequacies, which also deter traditional retail investor participation. 



Greenfield emphasizes the need for more accessible investment strategies and infrastructure to bridge this gap, especially for retail investors who, despite owning a significant portion of global assets under management, face limited wealth creation opportunities. 



To this end, Umoja has raised an additional $2 million, bringing its total seed funding to $4 million, aiming to democratize access to asset management strategies. 



Greenfield underscores the importance of catering to retail investors, who are projected to hold a larger share of global assets in the coming years, according to World Economic Forum estimates.

Pakistani university launches country’s first metaverse-based classes

Information Technology University of Lahore in Pakistan has launched the nation’s first virtual reality-based classes in the metaverse.The new courses will imitate the traditional classroom experience via virtual reality headsets and motion tracking, according to a report from local Pakistani news outlet Samaa. Per the report, ITU Lahore’s head of the computer sciences department, Ibrahim Ghaznavi, said ITU expects the initiative to improve the academic abilities of students participating in the metaverse experience. Online courses began at the university in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the shift to metaverse technology comes as virtual reality applications for education have begun to find their footing throughout the globe. Related: Metaverse for education: How virtual reality can help schools and collegesThe ITU Lahore program was reportedly developed in partnership with support from the University of Denmark. It may also take inspiration from the university’s spiritual alma mater, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ITU Lahore was founded in 2012 with the stated intention of emulating MIT’s success in the field of technology and engineering. It has various partnerships with other noteworthy universities and corporations, including Harvard and IBM. While the past decade has seen the rise of virtual, mixed and augmented reality headsets and support technologies, much of the early excitement surrounding the start of the metaverse era was dedicated to the gaming sector. Unfortunately, as several aggregators such as Steam player counts and Oculus sales figures indicate, the metaverse hasn’t gripped gamers in quite the same way as the creatio of other transformative gaming technologies such as handheld consoles and cloud computing have. However, recent analysis shows that the metaverse for industry, medicine, education and marketing is heating up, with many applications finding their way into consumer headsets and browsers. Tim Berners-Lee, the person largely credited with creating the World Wide Web, recently predicted that spatial computing — displaying and operating computer applications in three-dimensional, augmented reality — was the future of the Web. “You can go do things with a VR headset, and then when you take the VR headset off, you could do it with a huge screen,” Berners-Lee told CNBC in an interview, adding that multimodal support would be key to adoption. “Whenever you move, you can grab your phone and the experience will be as one. It should very smoothly go between different devices.”

Bitcoin Troubles Far From Over As More Carnage Looms, JPMorgan Analysts


                            Despite optimism about Bitcoin’s future trajectory heading into the Bitcoin Halving, analysts at JPMorgan have raised concerns that things may not go according to everyone’s expectations. They believe that a storm still lies ahead for the flagship crypto token before any massive move to the upside. 
Further Bitcoin Pullbacks Are To Be Expected
According to a Bloomberg report, JPMorgan strategists have warned that Bitcoin could still experience further pullbacks following its recent decline. They alluded to the recent net outflows recorded by the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which underscored the current bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

These strategists, led by Nikolaos Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, also highlighted the sustained open interest in CME Bitcoin futures as another bearish signal for Bitcoin’s price. They further argue that Bitcoin “still looks overbought” and expect further price dips leading up to the Halving event in mid-April. 
Meanwhile, these JPMorgan analysts emphasized the decline in net inflows into Spot ETFs, noting that this proves that a sustained one-way net inflow is not possible. Therefore, they expect investors in these funds to keep taking profits heading into the Bitcoin Halving. This wave of profit-taking is also more likely, considering that Bitcoin “still looks overbought despite the past week’s correction.” they claimed. 
This recent research note by JPMorgan further reaffirms their bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin’s price despite the flagship crypto exceeding expectations. Last month, the bank predicted that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $42,000 after April as “Bitcoin-halving-induced euphoria subsides.”
Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, also echoed JPMoragn’s sentiments when he suggested that Bitcoin’s recent rally didn’t show enough strength. Aslam believes Bitcoin could fall below $50,000 if the Halving event “fails to really keep the momentum going.”
What Could Happen After The Halving Event
Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital recently provided insights into what could happen after the Havling event while elaborating on the four phases of Bitcoin Halving. According to him, there is usually a re-accumulation period after the Halving, which could last for up to five months. 

During this period, he noted that many investors get “shaken out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving.” Rekt Capital added that this time could be different since it is the first time this re-accumulation could develop around the new all-time high (ATH) area. 
Therefore, he believes this “Re-Accumulation Range may simply take the shape of a regular sideways range and may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation.”

Google integrates Ethereum Name Service data for search - Crypto Briefing




Multinational tech firm Google appears to have integrated the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for the results on its search engine. The crypto address data appears to be sourced from Etherscan, an Ethereum block explorer.An initial investigation conducted by crypto news and research platform CryptoSlate confirmed the integration. According to the tests done, several ENS addresses, including Vitalik.eth, which belongs to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.The search results displayed address details such as the Ethereum balance and the timestamp of the last transaction, with data collected from Etherscan.At the time of writing, no official statement from ENS has been published, although Brantly Millegan, a former member of the ENS development team, shared his discovery of the integration on X.Google has been involved in crypto for some time now. A previous update from Google enabled users to check Ethereum address balances directly through the search engine. During the days leading to the Ethereum Merge event in September 2022, a countdown timer was uploaded by Google to help track the update whenever a user searches for “Ethereum” or “Ethereum Merge”Despite Google’s previous forays into crypto, it includes significant investments in crypto firms such as Dapper Labs through GV (Google Ventures), its financial arm. According to data from CryptoRank, GV also has investments in Web3 platform and BAYC creator Yuga Labs, decentralized wireless network Helium, and Bitcoin infrastructure provider Voltage, among others. With these incursions into crypto, Google also revised its advertising policy for crypto late last year to include “Cryptocurrency Coin Trusts,” allowing investors to trade shares in trusts holding digital assets. As a result, Bitcoin ETF products from prominent asset managers like BlackRock now appear in search results for related queries.News of the Google ENS feature has positively impacted the ENS token, which gained around 6% in the 24 hours following the announcement, trading at $21.56 at the time of writing. The ENS project has recently achieved significant milestones, including becoming fully decentralized and securing a partnership with domain registrar GoDaddy to link traditional DNS with Ethereum names.

Whale Activity Backs Dogecoin's (DOGE) Surge Above $0.16: Data


																Dogecoin has emerged as one of the top-performing assets amidst market recovery from significant volatility last weekend. Trading at $0.164, the eighth-largest crypto by market capitalization, has extended its monthly gains to nearly 96%.
Coinciding with this surge, the number of transactions by DOGE whales has hit a new milestone.
Dogecoin Whales Make a Splash
Amidst renewed market activity, Dogecoin’s whale activity appears to be soaring, with transactions exceeding $1 million, increasing by more than 600% in the past month alone.
According to IntoTheBlock’s latest analysis, this spike not only indicated unprecedented growth but also marked the highest number of Dogecoin millionaire transactions since the OG meme coin topped in May of 2021, essentially heightened engagement from large investors despite market fluctuations.






While the broader market started on a relatively flat note on Friday, Dogecoin amassed almost 5% in gains over the past day. Several factors are at play.
For one, Coinbase Derivatives, the derivatives division of the American crypto exchange Coinbase, has revealed intentions to introduce cash-settled futures contract offerings for Dogecoin, in addition to Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, by April 1.
“Coinbase Derivatives will launch the first leveraged and CFTC-regulated futures contracts for Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, and Litecoin in April!”
The timing of this announcement aligns with yet another revelation from X Payments LLC – the financial branch of X (formerly Twitter) – with reports indicating that it had secured additional licenses to facilitate payment functionalities on the social media platform spearheaded by Elon Musk.
Musk, who is also known for being a vocal proponent of Dogecoin, has hinted at potential integrations with its blockchain as early as 2022.
Dogecoin’s Surging Open Interest
Data from CoinGlass revealed that Dogecoin’s Open Interest (OI) was hovering above $1.30 billion as of March 22nd. Its OI hit a new peak of $1.4 billion earlier this month when the meme coin itself was trading well over 70% down from its ATH value witnessed during the previous bull run.
If the bullish momentum continues, Dogecoin could soon break into a fresh high.

Kenya Reiterates Worldcoin Ban Despite U.S. Govt Intervention - DailyCoin


        
Worldcoin will remain suspended in Kenya.



The project was suspended last year.



A powerful nation has tried to intervene to have the suspension lifted.
Kenya remains unmoved by a push by the U.S. government to lift the suspension of Worldcoin operations in the country, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki said in Parliament.Worldcoin ran into trouble with Kenyan authorities last year after observers expressed worries that sensitive data gathered from scanning a person’s iris might be targeted by the wrong people. The project had reportedly collected data from over 350,000 Kenyans before it was suspended on August 2.Kenya Takes a Firm Position Against WorldcoinAccording to a local media report, Prof Kindiki told the National Assembly’s committee on Public Petitions that Kenya has been under pressure from the U.S. government to lift the suspension it imposed on Worldcoin operations.“They (US) think that they (WorldCoin) still have a case to set up their activities here. We have remained adamant and the decision we took will remain,” Kindiki said.When Kindiki issued a statement suspending Worldcoin’s operations last year, the minister revealed that relevant security, financial, and protection agencies had commenced inquiries and investigations into the project’s legality and authenticity.In his latest address, the minister said the suspension will remain in place until the relevant agencies are assured of the safety and integrity of Worldcoin’s activities.Besides the hurdle in parliament, Worldcoin faces a lawsuit filed at the High Court of Kenya by the office of the Data Commissioner, seeking the preservation of user information collected by the project in the country between April 19 and August 8 last year.Read about Worldcoin’s plan to upgrade its iris scanning devices:Worldcoin CEO Teases New Orb Upgrade Despite Privacy ConcernsStay updated on Worldcoin’s WLD rally last month:This Is Why Worldcoin Is up 200% in 7 Days

BlockDAG presale hits $6.8 million, Maker retraces recent gains and Starknet makes a splash - CoinJournal



                    

                    
BlockDAG has impressed analysts with a $6.8 million presale
The Maker token (MKR) has fallen off its recent $3.3k high to test support levels at $2.7k
Starknet has had a promising first month of trading

A growing number of crypto enthusiasts are making comparisons between the new BlockDAG coin and established tokens like Maker (MKR) and Starknet (STRK). The focus is on how BlockDAG‘s advanced technology potentially reshapes banking, setting a new benchmark in the industry and challenging the traditional frameworks.
Maker (MKR) Price Dynamics
The Maker token (MKR) has recently seen a whirlwind of activity with its price experiencing substantial volatility. The MKR price soared to a yearly high of $3.3k, subsequently retracting to $2.7k. This fluctuation reflects market sentiment and strategic movements within the ecosystem, with significant entities and whales capitalising on these shifts.
The Maker (MKR) price oscillations are more than mere numbers but signify the continuous recalibration of investor trust and strategy, painting a broader picture of the crypto environment’s fluidity.
Starknet’s Market Entry
Entering the crypto scene with a splash, Starknet (STRK) has navigated its inaugural market month with a modest 1.2% gain, an introduction marred slightly by a subsequent 1.6% dip. This initial performance tableau is painted against a high-expectations backdrop and market speculations, influenced heavily by a substantial STRK token airdrop.
Starknet crypto news frequently highlights this balance of anticipation and reality, sketching a portrait of a platform at its nascent stage yet brimming with potential. The Starknet crypto news marks its value oscillations and mirrors the broader narrative of Layer 2 blockchain technologies.

The Revolutionary BlockDAG Network
BlockDAG has big, bold ambitions, aiming to revolutionise industry standards by leveraging blockchain’s power for a spectrum of services, from logistics to digital identity verification. With a strategic launch that has already garnered $6.8 million from its third presale batch and sold over 3817 miners, some analysts believe BlockDAG could be on a fast track to achieving a top-50 spot in Coin Market Cap, underpinned by its robust liquidity goal of $100 million at launch.
BlockDAG leads innovation in cryptocurrency with its new BlockDAG Payment Card, providing users with a secure and easy way to handle transactions globally. This card integrates flawlessly into the BlockDAG ecosystem, empowering users to utilise their cryptocurrencies for everyday efficient transactions. It supports an array of digital currencies, including major ones like Ethereum and Bitcoin, enabling the swift conversion of cryptocurrencies into fiat at competitively low exchange rates.
The card’s versatility extends to a wide range of transactions, facilitating everything from online purchases to ATM withdrawals, all while ensuring users have access to the latest exchange rates, promoting transparency and trust in every transaction.
The strategic foresight is aimed at building a foundation of trust and stability for its community and investors, positioning BlockDAG as the emerging cryptocurrency to pay attention to. The platform’s comprehensive strategy and innovative payment solution place it in a prime position to redefine financial transactions and offer an efficient investment opportunity.
Wrapping Up
BlockDAG distinguishes itself as a frontrunner, with the potential to redefine the financial ecosystem, even as dynamics around the Maker (MKR) price and updates from Starknet crypto news capture traditional market interest. The insights reveal BlockDAG’s potential to innovate beyond the conventional, challenging the status quo upheld by Maker’s fluctuating prices and Starknet’s developments. Choosing BlockDAG means stepping into a modern financial future powered by blockchain, raising the bar for our interactions with digital currencies.

                        CryptoPunks non-fungible token (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain saw a record-breaking sale of one of its nine Alien Punks.On Wednesday, an anonymous collector purchased CryptoPunks #7804 for 4,850 ETH, or $16.38 million.This marks the second-largest CryptoPunks sale, both in terms of ETH and USD value, according to CryptoSlam data. The first most expensive CryptoPunks #5822 NFT sale took place in February 2022, valued at 8,000 ETH worth $23.7 million.Additionally, the recent sale surpassed Punk NFT #3100, which was sold early this month set at a value of 4,500 ETH or $16 million.The seller of CryptoPunks #7804 wrote on X (Twitter) that he bought the NFT in 2021 for 4,200 ETH, equivalent to $7.57 million at that time. The person has been searching for a potential buyer for over an year.Under the pseudonym Peruggia, the seller wrote on X that the sale marks “End of an era”.“I’ve long since felt like an imposter. Holding punks, and potentially NFTs a whole hostage by not elevating 7804 in the way he deserves.”Cryptopunks was launched in June 2017 by the Larva Labs studio. The most expensive NFT sale is affiliated to Beeple’s digital artwork collage titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” auctioned for a staggering $69.3 million in March 2021 by Christie’s.Is the NFT Hype Back?
NFT environment has been bleak for the past few years, however, the sale of the CryptoPunk #7804 NFT marks the beginning of an NFT revival.Per data from Statista, NFT sales volumes in 2023 were well below 2022 and 2021 numbers. However, it noted that revenue in the NFT market is projected to reach US$2,378 million in 2024.“In the NFT market, the number of users is expected to amount to 16.35m users by 2028,” the data noted.Though the market has been volatile, this recent sale could inspire investors to take another look at the NFT market. Further, it could also inspire creators to begin pumping out new projects, which eventually would make a resurgence overall.

Anglo-Italian company claims major breakthrough in Bitcoin mining


The world of Bitcoin (BTC) mining is a race against time and inefficiency. Miners dedicate huge computing power to solve complex mathematical puzzles, securing the network in the process. 
Enter Quantum Blockchain Technologies (QBT), an Anglo-Italian company, with a story that could rewrite the narrative of Bitcoin mining.
Their secret weapon
Method C represents a revolutionary approach that leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. 


Unlike traditional methods, which resemble a brute-force attack on a digital lock, Method C aims to be more elegant. It utilizes an AI oracle technology, to predict the outcome of these computations. 
The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining has been a major point of contention. A 30% reduction in computations would translate to a substantial decrease in the overall energy footprint of the network. 
For miners themselves, Method C presents the enticing prospect of lower operational costs and potentially higher profits.
From theory to reality
However, the path forward isn’t without its challenges. While the theoretical framework for Method C is solid, integrating the AI solution with existing mining rigs requires careful consideration. 
It’s akin to fitting a high-tech fingerprint scanner onto a traditional lock – a complex feat that demands seamless integration.
Despite these obstacles, QBT remains confident. The company plans to demonstrate Method C’s viability by integrating it with prototype chips and existing patent applications. 
Conversations with leading mining rig makers are happening, aiming to demonstrate real-world performance improvements.
Key milestones on the horizon
The coming months will be a period of intense prediction for QBT. 
The successful application of their Methods A and B (details yet to be revealed), alongside live comparisons demonstrating Method C’s efficiency gains, will be key milestones to observe. 
If QBT can bridge the gap between theory and practice, they have the potential to guide in a new era of sustainable, efficient, and more intelligent Bitcoin mining. 
This isn’t just a story about tech; it’s a story about innovation with the potential to reshape the future of cryptocurrency.

Exclusive Interview: Kevin Lee, CEO Gate.HK Uncovers Insights on Market Sentiment, Token Listings, and Regulatory Challenges | Cryptopolitan

In this exclusive interview, we talk to Gate.HK’s CEO Kevin Lee. Gate.HK is a leading cryptocurrency exchange with its headquarters in Hong Kong. The exchange has a diverse range of cryptocurrencies and provides its users with a secure and efficient trading environment.BackgroundHi Kevin, please introduce yourself and share your role at Gate.HKHi there! I’m Kevin; I serve as the CEO of Gate.HK, a pivotal role that allows me to merge my 18 years of diverse experience across traditional finance and the crypto industry to steer our ambitious project, aiming to obtain regulatory licenses in Hong Kong and expand the business in the city. My journey through the financial landscape has equipped me with a rich blend of insights and expertise, which I now channel into leading Gate.HK. The strategic acquisition of regulatory licenses with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is at the core of my responsibilities. This critical aspect of my role ensures that our operations meet and exceed the stringent compliance standards set forth by regulatory bodies, safeguarding our platform’s integrity and users’ trust. This focus on regulatory excellence allows us to provide secure, efficient, and innovative trading experiences that comply with global standards. Equally important to my role is cultivating a strong, vibrant community both locally and internationally. I am deeply committed to building meaningful connections with industry peers and our users, fostering an ecosystem where collaboration, support, and shared growth are at the forefront. Through open dialogues, community initiatives, and constant engagement, we aim to empower our users and stakeholders, making them an integral part of our financial inclusivity and innovation journey. As the CEO of Gate.HK, what aspects of the project are you most passionate about? As the CEO of Gate.HK, my enthusiasm for our project is deeply rooted in the remarkable and unique journey we’re embarked on. This adventure is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as we are at the forefront of a brand-new industry growing exponentially. The chance to contribute to the success and integration of cryptocurrency within the broader financial ecosystem is not just exciting; it’s a privilege that fuels my dedication every day. What makes this journey uniquely thrilling is the blend of pioneering a “zero-to-one” venture while simultaneously drawing upon the substantial resources and reputation of the Gate Group. Starting Gate.HK, from scratch just about a year ago, presented its own set of challenges and opportunities. Yet, the process has been significantly empowered by the immense support and resources provided by the Group. This unique advantage has enabled us to navigate the complexities of establishing a new entity in the rapidly evolving crypto space with confidence and strategic insight.Furthermore, the encouragement and collaboration we have received from our business partners and counterparts have been extraordinary. Their recognition of the long-established Gate brand name and willingness to support our vision and growth have been instrumental in our early successes. Our partners’ collective enthusiasm validates our efforts and propels us forward with a sense of shared purpose and optimism. Market Sentiment How would you describe the current market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong and globally? In Hong Kong, the sentiment towards cryptocurrencies is distinctly positive, reflecting the broader supportive stance of the government towards the Web3 industry with a promising top-down approach. The city’s authorities, including the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Customs and Excise Department, and the Hong Kong Police Force, are not just individually acknowledging the importance of this burgeoning sector but are also making concerted efforts to establish and enforce a coherent and comprehensive regulatory framework. This unified approach is instrumental in nurturing a secure, innovative, and investor-friendly environment, positioning Hong Kong as a premier, all-round Web3 hub in Asia and globally. Globally, my outlook is cautiously optimistic. The recent upticks, seeing coins hit new all-time highs, have been a welcome change of pace following over 18 months of a prolonged crypto winter. However, this resurgence also attracts attention from those primarily interested in speculative investments. Given cryptocurrencies’ inherently dynamic and fluid nature, we must remain vigilant and ready for potentially shorter yet more volatile cycles compared to traditional financial markets. How does the market sentiment affect the operations and strategies of Gate.HK? Market sentiment plays a pivotal role in shaping the operations and strategies of Gate.HK. Our philosophy of maintaining a cautious stance during bull markets reflects a broader commitment to prioritizing security, compliance, and accessibility in our virtual asset trading platform, irrespective of prevailing market conditions. This approach ensures that Gate.HK remains resilient and adaptable, focusing on long-term sustainability rather than short-term gains. Investing in a secure and compliant platform provides a foundation of trust for our users, which is essential in both buoyant and challenging market environments. Cryptocurrency Listing Process at Gate.HKPlease walk us through the process of listing a new cryptocurrency on Gate.HK. What are the key factors you consider when listing a new coin?In listing a new coin on Gate.HK, we rigorously adhere to Hong Kong’s regulatory framework, focusing on key factors: the management team’s background, the token’s regulatory compliance, its market supply, demand, maturity, and liquidity, as well as its technical security features and utilities. Additionally, we assess market, legal, and governance risks alongside potential risks for money laundering and terrorist financing. While this thorough vetting process may result in a more curated selection of tokens than unregulated platforms, it underscores our commitment to user protection. We continuously engage with regulatory bodies to refine our listing criteria, ensuring a secure, compliant, and accessible trading environment for our users. Regulatory Outlook How do you see the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies evolving in Hong Kong? The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong is on a path of progressive evolution. The Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) approach, which involves leveraging and adopting the existing regulatory frameworks from the securities market for cryptocurrency trading, marks a pivotal step towards establishing a more comprehensive regulatory environment. This initial phase indicates the broader journey towards more detailed and complete regulations in the coming years. Given Hong Kong’s robust regulatory infrastructure for traditional financial markets, including derivatives trading, margin trading, borrowing and lending, and prime brokerage, there’s a strong foundation to build. The SFC is poised to explore extending these regulations to encompass more than just spot trading in the future. Gate.HK is proactively preparing for these potential regulatory expansions. We are committed to staying at the forefront of regulatory compliance, ensuring we can swiftly adapt to new regulations as they emerge. This preparation involves continuous engagement with regulatory developments, investing in our platform’s compliance capabilities, and maintaining a flexible operational model that can quickly respond to new regulatory requirements. By aligning our operations closely with the evolving regulatory framework, Gate.HK aims to ensure that we can offer corresponding compliant products without delay in time-to-market when broader regulations are introduced. This forward-looking approach not only positions us to integrate new regulatory changes seamlessly but also underscores our dedication to providing a secure, compliant, and innovative trading environment for our users, reinforcing our commitment to leadership and excellence in the burgeoning crypto market. Gate.HK Upcoming Features and ProjectionsWhat new features or services can users expect from Gate.HK in the near future? In the near future, Gate.HK users can look forward to a suite of new features and services designed to enhance their experience with depositing, withdrawing, storing, and trading virtual assets. Committed to our mission of being the “Gateway to Crypto,” we aim to ensure a seamless experience across our web platform, mobile app, and API access. Additionally, we will expand our offerings to include specialized services for our VIP clients through delegated OTC traders. These upcoming features are aligned with our mission to provide comprehensive access to the crypto market, reinforcing our commitment to user-centric innovation and ease of use. Beyond platform enhancements, Gate.HK is dedicated to building a strong community presence in Hong Kong. Through hosting various events and seminars throughout the year, we aim to offer valuable education on cryptocurrencies and foster a well-informed user base. Our commitment extends to local charity work, reflecting our vision to contribute positively to the community and establish a meaningful connection beyond the digital asset space. These initiatives differentiate Gate.HK from other exchanges and reinforces our role as a leader in promoting a more inclusive and educated cryptocurrency environment.

BlackRock clearly wants to take crypto seriously. Too bad it’s forever silly. - Blockworks


Ethereum, not even once.
BlackRock has learned the hard way just how silly “crypto” can be in comparison to Bitcoin.
Working with digital assets was a breeze when all BlackRock’s fund managers had to do was max bid bitcoin on Coinbase Pro on behalf of ETF shareholders.
But Larry Fink (or whomever else in charge of BlackRock’s crypto adventures) threw a spanner in the works when they opted to launch a $100-million money market fund that exists entirely on Ethereum.
It took only minutes for Crypto Twitter™ to name an Ethereum address tied to the fund, and even less time for the wallet to be drowned in low-quality memecoins and NFTs, most of which are valued at zero.
While there is indeed $100 million USDC in BlackRock’s suspected Ethereum wallet, which aligns with its SEC filing, there’s now more — 100 other cryptocurrencies, definitely not purchased by BlackRock, sitting alongside those stablecoins. There’s tokens like Jesus Coin, Cramer Coin, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, Lery Fenk and DERANGED, and also some more offensive stuff that likely won’t get past my editor (for good reason).
Altogether, the tokens with more than zero value contribute an additional $84,000 to the fund’s portfolio. NFTs like CryptoDickbutts and KaijuKingz and goblintown add another $5,000 in value. 
Think of those contributions as guerilla marketing spend for micro-cap crypto projects: BlackRock’s Etheruem address is destined to be watched like a hawk to see how it trades crypto markets. Etherscan then doubles as a billboard for all sorts of wacky clown shows.

It’s not as though BlackRock should feel special that it’s targeted for such financially nihilistic trolling. Practically every public figure in crypto gets the same treatment. 
Brian Armstrong’s Ethereum address contains nonsense like Unicorn Candy Coin and Make Trump President Again — tokens that he had no hand in acquiring himself. 
Vitalik Buterin’s most well-known wallet contains nearly 2,000 tokens, most of them worthless, as well as more than 67,000 NFTs thrown in his direction (although there is that whole shiba inu saga which culminated in Buterin burning and donating hundred of trillions of tokens sent in his direction, worth hundreds of millions of dollars).
Shitcoins mixed up with legitimate USDC aside, BlackRock’s boffins have now been forced to deal with novel legal headaches on account of their Ethereum endeavor.
One plucky prankster tainted BlackRock’s reported wallet with 1 ETH ($3,350) washed and sent through sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash.
Read more from our opinion section: Slerf investor or not, no one deserves to lose money in crypto
It’s been illegal for US citizens to interact with Tornado Cash since the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added the smart contract protocol to its blacklist in August 2022. The mixer made the blacklist on account of its suspected usage by North Korea-linked Lazarus Group to wash stolen crypto, often coming from high profile hacks like the $625 million Ronin bridge attack two years ago.
VIDEO

All this probably isn’t what Fink was thinking of when he was hyping tokenization
The string of deposits to those addresses directly from Tornado Cash is considered something of a political protest — both pointing out the absurdity of sanctioning a permissionless protocol and highlighting the impossibility of enforcing restrictions on fungible cryptocurrencies that may have at one point touched crypto mixers.
Is BlackRock now at risk of itself being sanctioned by OFAC for holding ether washed by an illegal protocol? It doesn’t take a law degree to figure out that’s highly unlikely.
Now, BlackRock presumably has accountants and legal departments combing through the legalities of holding CYBONK and harrypottertrumphomersimpson777inu, as well as ETH of dubious origin, all in the same wallet as proper investor funds.
Should’ve just stuck with bitcoin.
Updated Mar. 22, 2024 at 2:20 pm ET: An earlier version incorrectly stated it was possible to block incoming transactions from sanctioned addresses. That’s not possible.

Starknet Expands Airdrop Eligibility, Addressing Immutable X and ETH Staker Concerns



                    
The Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Starknet has expanded the eligibility for its first round of Starknet provisions, now including two sub-categories of users who initially encountered difficulties in claiming STRK tokens. 



This adjustment comes after the Starknet Foundation, the entity behind the Starknet network, resolved uncertainties about the eligibility of certain pre-Merge ETH stakers and Immutable X users for the Starknet (STRK) airdrop scheduled for February. 




Following a detailed evaluation, eligibility has been extended to include VeVe users, non-VeVe StarkEx users mistakenly identified as VeVe users, and pooled stakers.



According to a communication shared with Cointelegraph, the new group of users now eligible for the February airdrop will be able to start claiming their STRK tokens in April. Starknet discovered inaccuracies in a list from Immutable, which incorrectly categorized many Immutable X users as VeVe users. 



This list was crucial for distinguishing between users of the nonfungible token (NFT) platform VeVe, which manages its users’ private keys, and other users. 




As a result of correcting these inaccuracies, Immutable X users who executed eight or more transactions before June 1, 2022, are now entitled to claim their airdrop.



The conversation around airdrops for VeVe users is ongoing between Starknet and the VeVe team.

Additionally, pooled ETH stakers faced hurdles in receiving their STRK due to various complications with the staking protocols. 



However, some protocols have now provided Starknet with a list of users eligible for the airdrop, which will commence in April.



Starknet also revised its unlock schedule in February, following concerns that the original plan favored early investors at the expense of retail users, leading to a more equitable distribution plan over three years. 



This change followed criticism from Starknet users who felt excluded from the STRK airdrop despite significant transaction volumes, largely because they did not meet the requirement of holding at least 0.005 ETH as of November 15, 2023.



After the STRK airdrop on February 20, substantial sell-offs by large holders led to a dramatic 60% drop in the token’s value, from a peak of $4.40 to $1.90, within just over two days. 



The struggle to recover the price of STRK continues, with it currently trading at $1.88, according to the latest CoinGecko data.

Hacker Transfers $10M from 2023 Phishing Attack to Tornado Cash: CertiK


																Phishing scams have wreaked havoc in the digital asset ecosystem and are making a comeback amidst market-wide recovery.
These attacks have grown increasingly sophisticated, leading to high-profile crypto investors, whales, and prominent industry figures becoming victims, ultimately resulting in substantial financial losses.

In its latest update on March 21st, CertiK identified a deposit of 3,700 ETH into Tornado Cash on the Ethereum blockchain.
This transfer by the hacker, valued at over $10 million, raised eyebrows due to its link with a major phishing incident dating back to September 2023. The funds were pilfered from a crypto whale.
During this phishing attack, the whale in question lost a staggering $24 million worth of staked ETH on the liquid staking provider Rocket Pool.
The hack was executed through only two transactions, with 9,579 stETH stolen in one and 4,851 rETH in another. The value of the stolen assets amounted to $15.5 million in stETH and $8.5 million in rETH at the time of the breach.
Scam Sniffer’s investigation subsequently revealed that the whale unknowingly granted token approval to the fraudsters through the authorization of “increaseAllowance” transactions.
February saw a slight decrease in losses attributed to hacks, exploits, and scams. Phishing attacks, for instance, accounted for $14.6 million out of the total $160 million lost during the month. Fortunately, $6.4 million was recovered successfully.
Scam Sniffer’s February Phishing Report revealed that many victims of phishing attacks were tricked by scams through X (formerly Twitter). Fake comments from fraudulent X accounts led unsuspecting victims to malicious websites, where they were targeted by these schemes.
Earlier this year, an anonymous individual lost $4.2 million to a phishing attack that used a falsified ERC-20 permission signature.

Stocks in Focus: Lululemon, Nike, and Tesla Slump Amid Headwinds - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE: NKE), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) opened lower and are experiencing downward pressure on their stock prices today.



Lululemon’s decline is attributed to a slowdown in US store traffic and a weaker outlook, marking its most severe slump since the pandemic’s onset. Nike’s drop followed earnings announcements and broader market movements, reflecting adjustments in market expectations and reactions to corporate strategies and performance.



Tesla’s decline is linked to reduced electric vehicle production at its China factory, highlighting demand issues and competitive pressures in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle market.



LULU Stock Drops After Reports of Slowdown in Store Traffic



Lululemon Athletica Inc. experienced a significant drop in stock price, plummeting by $88.70 (−18.52%) at the time of writing. The substantial decline is attributed to reports of a slowdown in US store traffic and a weaker outlook for the company. This marks the most severe slump for Lululemon since the onset of the pandemic, raising concerns among investors about the company’s growth prospects and ability to navigate the challenging retail landscape.





Nike Stock (NKE) Dips Along with LULU



NIKE, Inc. also faced a notable decline, with its stock price falling by $8.25 (−8.18%) at the time of writing. The drop followed the company’s earnings announcements and was part of broader market movements, where Nike was mentioned alongside Lululemon for experiencing a dip in post-earnings announcements. The stock movement reflects adjustments in market expectations and reactions to the company’s corporate strategies and performance as investors reassess Nike’s position in the highly competitive athletic apparel and footwear industry.



Tesla Dips on China Numbers



Tesla, Inc. saw a more modest decline, with its stock price falling by $3.16 (−1.83%) at the time of writing. The movement is linked to reports of reduced production of electric vehicles at the company’s China factory, highlighting the challenges Tesla faces regarding demand issues and competitive pressures in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle market. The adjustment has put the company’s shares under pressure as investors closely monitor Tesla’s ability to maintain its market share and profitability in the face of increasing competition.







Do you see Tesla making a comeback in 2024? Let us know in the comments below.

Bots are front-running bots front-running Base meme coins


Bots are front-running other bots in the hopes of front-running meme coin traders. Welcome to the degenerate world of Ethereum layer 2 tokens.
Posting to X (formerly Twitter), meme coin trader GK screenshotted four examples of traders building bots to front-run other meme coin traders’ bots.
Specifically, a bot is executing an identical sequence of layer 2 blockchain actions across various meme coins on Base, the Coinbase-operated layer 2 atop Ethereum’s layer 1 blockchain. (A layer 2 is a more centralized version of a regular, layer 1 blockchain.)

Front-running meme coins
This clever actor deposits a small amount of capital into a liquidity pool for trading newly-launched meme coins. It then waits for so-called ‘launch bots’ to detect its small liquidity deposit. 
Because these launch bots believe that a new coin has launched and is gaining attention, by virtue of its recent minting and liquidity events, the launch bot adds additional liquidity. Its owner thinks that this is a clever strategy — joining in early to possibly the next memetic rally.
The front-runner then sells into their additional liquidity, effectively front-running their attempt to front-run.
Degenerate meme coin traders
A number of targets of this type of attack have included variations on asdfasdf, Internet slang for ‘bored,’ ‘filler text,’ or ‘nothing.’ To GK, naming these tokens with ticker symbols of careless convenience — i.e. whichever lefthand keyboard characters were most readily available — indicated an embrace of degenerate trading. For a while, it worked.
Most meme coins are simply jokes and their most important attribute is usually a mascot. 
Meme coin traders embrace their own degeneracy. Its shorthand, degen, has become a crypto community membership title of endearment. Coinbase and the Bored Ape Yacht Club once planned to film three movies entitled ‘Degen Trilogy.’
Apparently, the strategy of front-running front-runners works well on Base. It might also work well on other fast, cheap blockchains. The ‘front-run the front-runners’ strategy is straightforward.

First, thanks to Base’s fast, cheap operation, low-effort creation of altcoins is easy. This allows anyone to copy a smart contract, tweak a few parameters like ticker symbol or supply, and create their own meme coin in seconds.
Second, at least while meme coins are a hot category, Base is still popular enough to attract front-running ‘launch bots.’ These launch bots scan blockchains and their layer 2s for signs of promising meme coin launches — including, to their peril, fake meme coin launches with honeypot liquidity.
Finally, after the front-running bot has rug-pulled the launch bot, a few retail traders might still occasionally buy after both bots have traded, providing a final source of exit liquidity via a long-term rally.

Front-running, like MEV, is a perennial tax on retail traders
Although GK highlighted just one front-running campaign aiming to profit approximately 0.2 ETH per token, there are endless variations of systematic exploitation of crypto token offerings. 
Coinbase, for its part, promotes Base as a low-cost and developer-friendly layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It aims to turn Base into a decentralized ecosystem, though naturally, it has prioritized Coinbase products to date.

Read more: Bored Apes puts the ‘shit’ in shitcoin
Eventually, the operators of meme coin launch bots will stop trading after they realize that even more sophisticated front-runners are front-running their attempts at front-running.
As always, when there are degenerate retail dollars up for grabs, more sophisticated traders quickly learn how to master those markets. This week, a Base trader minted low-effort meme coins, deposited a small amount of liquidity, and then rug-pulled after launch bots took the bait. Several crypto market observers found it amusing to watch.

Justin Sun affiliated TrueUSD market cap collapses 50% in 7 days


TrueUSD, the dollar-pegged stablecoin affiliated with Justin Sun, has seen its market cap collapse more than 50% from $1.29 billion on March 15 to $615 million on March 22, according to data from CoinMarketCap. 
This mass redemption of TrueUSD follows Binance’s delisting of several TrueUSD pairs on March 15. TrueUSD spent much of February struggling to maintain its peg, falling as low as $0.95.
TrueUSD’s market cap has collapsed from $1.29 billion to $615 million during March.
A review of the attestations provided by TrueUSD also seem to show that it no longer has United States treasury bills in its reserves. The remaining funds are split between approximately $200 million held “at a Hong Kong depository institution, a Swiss depository institution, and Bahamian depository institutions” and approximately $500 million held at First Digital Trust Limited.
First Digital Trust has also launched its own stablecoin, FDUSD, which has seen its own market cap fall from approximately $3 billion to $2.6 billion since March 15. Again, this is according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This contraction hasn’t affected the entire stablecoin market equally. Tether has seen its market cap grow by approximately $700 million since March 15.

ETF staking addition is ‘positive development,' says ETC Group exec

The addition of staking into spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications is a crucial milestone, according to an executive at the European investment firm ETC Group.The Ethereum staking aspect is important in the context of ETFs because it’s associated with the “difference between giving investors the price return or the total return of the asset,” ETC Group’s head of product Chanchal Samadder told Cointelegraph.According to Samadder, Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism and related network rewards make it conceptually very similar to dividends in equities. “But only shareholders who exercise their voting right are eligible to receive 'dividends,'” the exec noted, adding:“We view this as a positive development. Staking offers investors the complete economic benefits of Ethereum and leads to improved outcomes.”Despite ETC Group’s optimism about the staking addition, the approval of potential spot Ethereum ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains uncertain, according to Samadder. That is because taking products is associated with a high level of new risks and difficulty and requires enough knowledge about the Ethereum blockchain, he said.“If issuers lack deep familiarity with the technical aspects of the Ethereum protocol and do not have expertise in exchange-traded products (ETPs), it could potentially harm investor outcomes,” Samadder said.Spot Ethereum ETF filers have been rushing to amend their SEC applications to add staking recently.Financial services giant Fidelity filed a 19b-4 amendment with the SEC on March 18, seeking permission to stake a portion of the Ether ETH. If approved, Fidelity’s spot ETF would stake an undisclosed amount of its assets through one or more trusted staking providers.Related: 3 theories why the SEC may be eyeing down Ethereum: Crypto lawyerGrayscale Investments, the operator of the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF by assets, proposed the addition of staking in its spot Ethereum ETF application on March 20. In a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC, Grayscale mentioned the ability of the fund to stake ETH through the trust in a PoS validation protocol among the four total proposed items.Samadder speculated that spot Ether ETF applicants didn’t add staking into their applications before due to staking complexity as well as too high tech and analysis requirements from the SEC.“It is very complex to structure a product and requires an extremely deep knowledge of Ethereum protocol, the mechanics of ETPs and the bridge between crypto and traditional capital market — this takes time.” He also suggested that there may have been a feeling that the SEC simply “wasn’t ready to properly analyze the risks associated with staking.”Magazine: Bitcoin ETFs make Coinbase a ‘honeypot’ for hackers and governments: Trezor CEO

DOGE is Setting Up For A New Upward Rally Following Recent Rebound - Coin Edition


							

Rekt Capital has spotted a developing uptrend on Dogecoin.



DOGE rebounded 24% to set up a potential upward movement.



Dogecoin is trading between $0.12 and $0.20 ahead of a confirming uptrend.




Rekt Capital, a crypto analyst on X, has spotted a developing uptrend on Dogecoin amid the current market conditions. In a recent post, the renowned analyst highlighted that DOGE has tagged the macro downtrend for a successful retest, rebounding 24%.







Explaining his analysis, Rekt Capital showed a reversal candle that formed on the DOGE/USDT weekly chart on TradingView. He revealed how the candle bounced off significant support around the $0.12650 level, reflecting a retest of that level ahead of resuming its uptrend.



Meanwhile, the analyst showed Dogecoin’s uptrend started in October 2023, when the memecoin bounced off support at $0.0574. However, the move boosted last February after DOGE surged past the $0.09617 region, changing the cryptocurrency’s sentiment into a bullish perspective. 



DOGE tested another significant resistance with the recent rally, reaching $0.20626, as highlighted by Rekt Capital. Pulling back from that level saw Dogecoin dropping by 40% before the current reversal spotted by the famous analyst.



From Rekt Capital’s plottings in the shared chart, Dogecoin has the potential to rally to $0.33825. With that, the memecoin would climb above the recent high at $0.20626 and overcome another significant resistance around $0.27817. 









Meanwhile, Dogecoin has overturned the losses incurred in 2023 and is already testing levels last reached in 2022. The flagship memecoin traded for $0.1644 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView. 



Rekt Capital’s recent post confirms his earlier prediction from last week when he spotted an initial retest after DOGE broke its macro downtrend. He thinks the memecoin is trading within a new macro range between $0.12 and $0.20 ahead of a confirming uptrend.

Reddit IPO could trigger a spike in demand for sub-Reddit memecoins MOON and BRICK, data suggests



                    

                    Key takeaways


Reddit’s stock ends trading at $50.44 per share, up by 48% on its market debut.


Sub-Reddit memecoins MOON and BRICK could rally higher on Reddit’s successful IPO. 


Reddit shares up by 48% on market debut
Social media platform Reddit finally debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company’s stock, with a ticker symbol RDDT, began trading on the NYSE on Thursday, March 21st.
By the end of the trading day, RDDT was up by 48% as investors took the opportunity to buy the company’s shares. 
Reddit attracted investors despite the company not turning an annual profit since launching in 2005. However, the company promises investors that its content will be the training ground for artificial intelligence (AI) programs.
The company also recently struck a data licensing deal with Google worth about $60 million a year. This move further convinced investors that Reddit could soon turn over its loss-making fortunes. 
With Reddit now a publicly traded company, RDDT could soon join other stocks CFDs at OANDA, making it easier for investors to take a position on the future trajectory of Reddit’s share price. 
Sub-Reddit memecoins MOON and BRICK could soar higher
With Reddit now a public company, data suggests that subreddit memecoins like MOON and BRICK could soar higher in the short term. r/CryptoCurrency Moons is one of the trending coins in the crypto market.
MOON is down by 20% over the last 24 hours. However, it is up by 70% over the last seven days. The token is used to reward active users who contribute to the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit. This is one of the most active subreddits on the platform. In October, the r/CryptoCurrency community removed moderators accused of insider trading
Meanwhile, BRICK is also up by 109% in the last seven days despite losing 21% of its value in the past 24 hours. BRICK is used for rewarding active users who contribute to the r/Fortnite subreddit. 
With Reddit’s opening day a success, these memecoins could soar higher in the coming days and weeks. Reddit is known to be home to meme investors. One notable event on Reddit was when a group of retail investors collaborated on the “wallstreetbets” subreddit to pump the shares of game retailer GameStop (GME.N). 
Reddit’s successful IPO could see investors buy more MOON and BRICK tokens, pushing the memecoins prices higher.  Despite the ongoing market correction, MOON and BRICK have shown bullish momentum in recent days.

This Bitcoin Halving May Not Result In Supply Squeeze: Glassnode


                            Glassnode has suggested that the upcoming Bitcoin halving might not result in a supply squeeze that the market may have anticipated.
Bitcoin Halving May Not Carry Same Impact Due To Spot ETFs
In a new report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed the impact the next Bitcoin halving may have on the economics of the cryptocurrency.
The “halving” is a periodic event for BTC where its block rewards (the rewards the miners receive for adding blocks on the network) are permanently cut in half.

This event is built into the coin’s code, meaning it happens automatically. The halving kicks in after every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.
The next such event will take place sometime in the coming month. Historically, the halving has been considered an important event for the asset due to how it influences its supply dynamics.
The block rewards the miners receive are the only way to introduce new BTC tokens into circulation. Since they get tightened during these events, the cryptocurrency’s production rate slows down following them.
As such, halvings are considered bullish events, with the price increasing following them due to the constrained supply, as supply-demand dynamics would dictate.
“However, the current market conditions differ from historical norms,” says Glassnode. The reason behind that is simple; there is something now that was never there in the past: the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that buy and hold Bitcoin and allow their users to gain indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price action through them. Since the spot ETFs are available on traditional exchanges, they can be preferable for those not looking to dabble with digital asset platforms and wallets.
Thus, the ETFs have introduced a notable amount of fresh demand for the asset, with supply rapidly leaving the market and entering these funds. To put this demand into perspective, the analytics firm has compared it against the BTC amount miners issue on the chain daily.

As the above chart shows, the Bitcoin ETF flows have generally been much higher than what the miners have been introducing into circulation. Based on this, Glassnode believes “the upcoming halving might not result in the supply squeeze once anticipated.”

The report further says:
The ETFs are, in essence, preempting the halving’s impact by already tightening the available supply through their substantial and continuous buying activity. In other words, the supply squeeze usually expected from halvings may already be in effect due to ETFs’ large-scale bitcoin acquisitions.
Something to note, however, is that the ETFs aren’t certain to always be a bullish influence for the market. Should the current inflow-heavy regime flip to one dominated by outflows, the cryptocurrency could naturally witness extraordinary selling pressure.
In fact, the spot ETF netflows have been negative for Bitcoin for four straight days now, so such a trend shift may already be in action.
BTC Price
Bitcoin had recovered beyond the $68,000 level yesterday, but the coin has since declined again, falling back towards $64,200.

Ripple CEO - 'SEC will lose to Ethereum, just like it did to XRP' - AMBCrypto



The legal battle between SEC and Ripple seems to have certain remedies after almost 4 years. 
Ripple’s XRP has recorded a bullish sentiment over the last 24 hours.

Since 2020, Ripple [XRP] and the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been in a continuous legal battle. At present the longstanding conflict has come to a common point with certain remedies which are yet not the final solution of the case. 
Remarking on the same, James K. Filan, a defense lawyer revealed, 
“#XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The parties have filed a joint sealing proposal “to govern sealing issues relating to the upcoming remedies-related briefing to be filed in this case.”
How is this affecting XRP’s price movement? 
The proposal was submitted to Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York, U.S. District Court, on the 19th of March. If accepted, sensitive details like Ripple’s finances and XRP sales would remain undisclosed, potentially affecting market sentiment. 
Criticising SEC’s stand, CEO of Ripple Labs Brad Garlinghouse, added, 
“The SEC picked fights with the industry and is losing badly in the Courts. They’re now fighting fellow regulators like the CFTC, and falling behind international counterparts. At what point will the SEC realize they will lose the war against ETH just as they lost against XRP?” 
Seeing the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory aspect of Ripple’s XRP, the market still seems to be on an upward trajectory highlighting positive sentiment among XRP supporters. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.6214 with a 1.2% hike over the last week. 
Will XRP still top the altcoin charts? 
Additionally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving is yet another factor that has garnered attention from investors and enthusiasts for XRP. 
Monica Long, Ripple’s president, recently emphasized the significance of 2024 in the institutionalization of cryptocurrencies. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), she highlighted,
“2024 is quickly shaping up to be the year of crypto institutionalization on a macro scale (tho worth noting that several TradFi companies launched crypto access, tokenization products, etc. in previous bear markets).”
This highlights Ripple’s ongoing efforts to bridge traditional finance and the crypto space for broader adoption and innovation. Hence, despite various speculations and the ongoing legal battle, Ripple (XRP) remains one of the top contenders in the altcoin market.

Investor Dan Tapiero Says Bitcoin Bull Market in Third Inning, Predicts 200% BTC Rally - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								Macro investor and fund manager Dan Tapiero believes the bull market cycle for Bitcoin (BTC) is still in its early stages.
The CEO of investment firm 10T Holdings tells his 114,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could soar 3x from its current value in the next year or two.










“Conservative again on BTC price. A mere 3x over next 12-24 months. Bull market just in its third inning now.” 
Since there are nine innings in a baseball game, he suggests Bitcoin’s upward momentum will continue for a while. He also says there may be price volatility, but investors should “hold on for dear life” (HODL), a term used to encourage crypto investors not to sell when prices dip.
“Third inning of this Bitcoin bull market…at least 12-24 months to go in this up-cycle. Ignore short term wiggles. It’s hodl season.”
Last month, the investor said Bitcoin’s bull market was in the second inning.
“I think we’re in the second inning of this bull market, so I’d be much more concerned and think that there [could be] problems potentially if I felt we were in the seventh inning, the eighth inning. The bullish consensus at 75%-80% – I mean that’s an issue but maybe [it] just means you have a short-term correction. We’re just getting started here.” 
The investor previously said  Bitcoin could soar to somewhere between $150,000 and $200,000 this year. And while he thinks there will be short-term Bitcoin corrections this cycle, he doesn’t envision Bitcoin ever dipping down to the $20,000 level.
“If you’re saying do I think we’re going to go back down to the $20,000, $18,000 lows in Bitcoin, I don’t see it at all.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $63,665 at time of writing, down more than 4% in the last 24 hours.

Class Action Suit Against Silvergate Bank Over FTX Fraud Allegations Moves Forward After Judge's Ruling


                        
                            Class Action Suit Against Silvergate Bank Over FTX Fraud Allegations Moves Forward After Judge’s Ruling

                        FTX users are suing the now-defunct Silvergate by claiming it abetted FTX and its affiliated trading firm Alameda Research to commit a historic fraud.According to the customers launching the suit, FTX knowingly transferred customer money into Alameda Research. FTX is currently on trial for numerous offences related to fraud and money laundering charges.Central to the case is the allegation that FTX illegally wired Alameda Research customer funds to cover the cracks in its balance sheet after the trading company made some risky crypto bets.On March 20, Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro of a San Diego federal court filed an order denying Silvergate’s motion to dismiss the case.Montenegro ruled that the customers had adequately presented a case for Silvergate knowing and participating in FRX’s fraud in their filing on March 19.“It was foreseeable that allowing FTX customer funds to be deposited into non-FTX accounts would lead to fraud and harm the owners of those funds,” said the order.The numbers ostensibly speak for themselves. According to the order, Silvergate’s annual income before taking on FTX as a client was $7.6 million. The bank’s post-FTX income was nearly ten times higher, at $75.5 million, through transaction fees and interest on money deposited in FTX and Alameda accounts.The court also ruled that Silvergate’s earlier assertion that it doesn’t owe a duty of care to FTX customers is incorrect. Silvergate’s argument rests on the fact that the bank was not directly responsible for the withdrawal freezes that spread panic when FTX began to collapse. The bank also argued that had it not dealt with FTX, the exchange would have found another bank, an assertion that the judge labeled called “highly speculative” because Silvergate “one of few banks willing to service the crypto industry.”Like Silvergate: 3AC Also Denies Wrongdoing
Another company at the heart of 2022’s industry-wide recession, dubbed “crypto winter”, came under media scrutiny this week after its co-founder denied responsibility in the collapse.Kyle Davies, the founder of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) told his interviewer in the latest episode of Unchained that he feels he has nothing to apologise for. “Am I sorry for a company going bankrupt? No, like companies go bankrupt, almost every company goes bankrupt, right?” reasoned Davies, in response to criticisms that he had shown no remorse when his company failed. In May 2022, a huge crypto project called Terra collapsed when its dollar-pegged stablecoin UST slipped its peg and spiralled down to nothing. Terra sold UST on the promise that an algorithm could peg it to the greenback by burning $1 dollars worth of a sister token called LUNA to create it. In order to redeem it, holders burned UST for equivalent amounts of LUNA. The mechanism failed, however, after too many people exited UST at once, causing the algorithm to nosedive into a hyper-inflationary spiral. At the time when Terra collapsed, 3AC had $200 million to half a billion LUNA tokens. The industry-wide contagion from UST’s historic depegging is also considered a factor in FTX’s downfall.

Trezor's security breach was traced to a meticulous phishing operation, not SIM-Swap

Trezor, a leading manufacturer of crypto hardware wallets, has disclosed details regarding a recent security breach on its official social media account, X. The breach, initially suspected to be a SIM-swap attack, has now been confirmed as a sophisticated phishing incident by SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor. Trezor’s vigilance amidst adversityDespite the breach, reassures users that the security of its hardware wallets remains uncompromised.SatoshiLabs revealed that the breach occurred, with hackers gaining unauthorized access to the Trezor X account. Upon investigation, the company determined that the breach was the result of a meticulously planned phishing attack, rather than a SIM swap, as previously suspected. The attackers, posing as credible entities within the cryptocurrency community, engaged in convincing social media interactions and discussions to establish credibility.The attackers, under the guise of a legitimate cryptocurrency account, approached SatoshiLabs’ public relations team, suggesting an interview with the CEO. During subsequent communications, the attackers shared a malicious link disguised as a Calendly calendar invitation. Trezor’s swift response and ongoing security enhancementsAlthough suspicions were raised when a team member was prompted for login credentials, the attackers successfully linked their Calendly to Trezor’s X account during a rescheduled meeting.Upon discovering the breach, Trezor promptly identified and removed the fraudulent posts, minimizing potential damage. The company emphasized that while the breach affected its social media account, the security of its hardware wallets and other products remained intact.This incident follows a security breach in January, where Trezor inadvertently exposed the contact information of approximately 66,000 users.

March 2024 Smart Money - Why Investors are Choosing 'Black Account' Exchange Token Over Shiba Inu and Dogecoin | Cryptopolitan

As we step into March 2024, a noticeable shift in investment strategies within the cryptocurrency domain is becoming apparent. Smart money, the term often used to describe investments made by those with comprehensive knowledge of the market or insider information, is increasingly moving towards the ‘Black Account’ feature offered by Option2Trade (O2T), diverging from traditional favorites such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). This pivot reflects a broader trend of seeking higher value and more strategic investment platforms. Below, we delve into the reasons behind this shift, explore the unique benefits of the ‘Black Account’, and discuss its potential impact on the crypto market.The ‘Black Account’s’ appeal is not just in its innovative features but also in its promise of higher returns, which resonates with those previously invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). As such, the movement towards Option2Trade (O2T) and away from Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) reflects a strategic realignment of investment priorities, signaling a broader shift in the cryptocurrency landscape where utility and performance increasingly dictate investment choices.Reasons for the ShiftThe transition away from meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) towards more structured investment opportunities such as O2T’s ‘Black Account’ can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the increasing sophistication of the crypto market has prompted investors to seek platforms that offer more than just speculative value. Secondly, the allure of meme coins, while still significant, has been tempered by their volatility and the maturation of investors’ strategies seeking stable and sustainable growth. Benefits of the ‘Black Account’Option2Trade’s (O2T) ‘Black Account’ stands out for several reasons, primarily due to its focus on leveraging artificial intelligence to optimize trading strategies and the exclusive benefits it offers. These include:– Copy Trading Incentives: This feature rewards experienced traders with O2T tokens for sharing their successful trading strategies, allowing novices to replicate these strategies. It fosters a symbiotic ecosystem where all participants can benefit from shared knowledge and success.– Access to Premium Social Trading Features: The ‘Black Account’ offers unparalleled access to advanced trading tools, exclusive signals, and a premium community. This access is instrumental in providing traders with the insights needed to make informed decisions, surpassing the capabilities traditionally associated with meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).Impact on the Crypto MarketThe growing preference for O2T’s ‘Black Account’ over Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) is indicative of a larger shift within the cryptocurrency market towards platforms that offer tangible, strategic benefits. This shift is likely to influence the market in several ways:1. Increased Market Sophistication: As more investors opt for platforms that provide advanced trading tools and community support, we can expect an overall increase in market sophistication, leading to more stabilized and sustainable growth across the crypto ecosystem.2. Redefining Value: The preference for features like the ‘Black Account’ challenges the crypto community to reassess what constitutes value, moving beyond hype and speculation towards utility and strategic advantage.3. Innovation Drive: The success of the ‘Black Account’ feature could drive further innovation within the crypto space, encouraging platforms to develop new ways to engage users and enhance their investment potential.In conclusion, the shift towards Option2Trade’s (O2T) ‘Black Account’ by smart money in March 2024 is a testament to the evolving nature of cryptocurrency investments. As investors increasingly prioritize platforms that offer strategic advantages and sustainable growth potential, the appeal of meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) may wane. However, this trend also underscores the dynamic and innovative spirit of the crypto market, where new opportunities continually emerge, reshaping the landscape and setting new benchmarks for success.For more information on the Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T) Presale: Use promo code O2TLaunch to get 15% bonusVisit Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T)Join and become a community member: https://t.me/O2TOfficialhttps://twitter.com/Option2Trade (O2T)

Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Unveils Predictions For 2030 | Bitcoinist.com


								Founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson has boldly predicted a revolutionary advancement in the landscape of computational power. His forecast anticipates a remarkable leap forward in machine learning capabilities in the next few years.
Machine Learning Breakthrough Expected By 2030
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Hoskinson declared that by the end of the decade, it would be possible to run machine learning models 1,000 times more powerful than Mixtral on a standard gaming Personal Computer (PC). The Cardano founder’s statement implies a substantial improvement in the capabilities of handling complex computational tasks in the realm of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

According to the crypto founder, this technological innovation will only be possible with specialized hardware and optimization techniques. By leveraging these advanced technologies, the computational power of gaming PCs is potentially set to rise to unexpected levels, enabling them to effectively handle tasks previously reserved for high-performance systems. 
Hoskinson’s prediction ushers in a potential for improved accessibility to computational power, with its implications becoming far-reaching, as various industries would potentially benefit from its applications. The Cardano founder’s proclamation also comes at a time when technological innovation and advancement, particularly in the fields of AI and machine learning are growing rapidly. 
In the advent that his predictions come to fruition, the boundaries of computational power would effectively be breached, driving innovation on a global scale and unlocking potential benefits that could come from harnessing immense computational power on consumer-grade hardware. 
Cardano Founder Excludes ADA In Projections
While making his predictions for 2030, Hoskinson failed to provide any personal projections on the future outlook of Cardano’s native token, ADA. The crypto founder has recently been focusing on the transformative capabilities of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning models within the industry. 

At the time of writing the price of ADA is $0.64, marking a 10.05% decline over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. While other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have experienced bullish rallies, ADA has remained relatively subdued.
Although Hoskinson has not provided a price forecast for Cardano, other crypto analysts have stepped in to fill the gap. According to popular crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, the price of ADA is expected to reach $1.70 following a period of consolidation between the range of $0.55 to $0.80 in the upcoming weeks.
The crypto analyst has predicted that after the upswing to $1.70, Cardano could experience a significant breakout to $5. This surge would surpass the cryptocurrency’s previous all-time high of $3.10 in 2021.

Dogecoin's million-dollar trades: Will DOGE holders see a 2021 re-run now? - AMBCrypto



The transactions reached the same peak as the time DOGE hit its ATH.
On-chain data revealed that the price might retest $0.19 again.

Dogecoin [DOGE] transactions valued at $1 million and above increased by a staggering 600% in the last 30 days, AMBCrypto discovered. But this development only scratched the surface of what has been happening with the coin lately.
Furthermore, the unprecedented move marked the highest number of million-dollar transactions since DOGE hit its all-time high in May 2021. DOGE’s all-time high was $0.73 which it reached on the 5th of May, 2021.
Source: X
Has the conditions changed?
At that time, large transactions were one of the catalysts that drove the value higher. However, the glee around Dogecoin during that period was much more than it is now.
This was because memecoins producing mind-altering gains were not as many as the number the market has now. Because of that, attention span was not as divided.
Despite the difference in circumstances, the rise in transactions could be a bullish signal for DOGE.
At press time, Dogecoin changed hands at $0.16, indicating that it was 77.38% down from its ATH. But does DOGE have the capability to surpass the price this cycle?
On different occasions, AMBCrypto reported price predictions explaining how the coin might hit $1 this cycle. However, if the coin were to repeat its performance, it would take more than a whispering campaign.
Outside of the on-chain condition, we also mentioned how Coinbase listed the coin on its futures market. For Dogecoin’s price, this could be good considering how stringent the exchange listing conditions are.
Furthermore, we decided to look at DOGE by comparing user activity in 2021 to press time. To do this, we employed the active addresses.
At press time, Dogecoin’s 24-hour active addresses had decreased to 58,400.  In May 2021, the number was around 242,000, indicating a good level of utility on the blockchain.
Source: Santiment
DOGE wants to surpass its peak
But at different times, the memecoin has crossed that number. For example, active addresses hit 794,000 in a full-blown bear market in 2022. Despite many downturns, DOGE’s price did not stop appreciating.
Therefore, it is not out of position to mention that the value might tap the ATH or cross it this cycle. This Weighted Sentiment shown by traders also aligned with this potential.
As of this writing, Dogecoin’s Weighted Sentiment had left the negative region, and risen to 0.457. The hike here, suggests that market participants were bullish on the short-term price action.
In terms of the one-day circulation, on-chain data revealed that the metric dropped. At press time, the circulation was down to 557.4 million, indicating a decrease in usage.

Read Dogecoin’s [DOGE] Price Prediction 2024-2025

A decrease also means less likelihood of widespread sell-offs. Consequently, DOGE’s price might ascend more than it has done within a short period.
In a highly bullish case, the value of the coin might revisit $0.19 one more time.

Mem Tokens Rained in the Wallet of BlackRock, the World's Largest Asset Manager! Prices Increased Due to Blackrock Effect! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Blackrock, one of the world's largest asset managers, recently launched the 'USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund' (BUIDL), which allows investors to earn US dollar returns.
The BUILD fund attracted a lot of attention, and after its launch, various meme tokens and NFTs were sent to BUIDL's wallet.


According to Spot on Chain's post, while altcoins such as DETF, USH and ROI came to the BULD fund, the prices of these altcoins increased by up to 20% due to the effect of the BlackRock wallet.
While none of these altcoin transfer transactions were made by BlackRock, the 100 million USDC that Blackrock initially transferred to its wallet is still waiting.






“After BlackRock launched the first $100 million tokenized fund on Ethereum, the fund wallet “0x13e” received various meme tokens and NFTs worth about $100 thousand: 250 thousand DETF ($20.7 thousand), 10 thousand RICO (15.7 thousand dollars), 500 thousand USH (13.9 thousand dollars)
BlackRock, in collaboration with Securitize, yesterday announced the 'USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund' ( BUIDL ) which allows investors to generate US dollar yield. “BlackRock withdrew 100M USDC from Circle for this fund 6 days ago.”

Polygon (MATIC) Price Analysis: Potential 10% Drop Ahead?


The Polygon (MATIC) price is under scrutiny as Daily Active Addresses have declined over the last eight days, hitting a seven-day Moving Average low not observed since February 27. With 51% of MATIC holders now facing losses, there’s a likelihood they might cling to their assets in anticipation of future price recoveries. 
Furthermore, the recent formation of a death cross in MATIC Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines points towards a persistent bearish trend, casting shadows over the immediate outlook for the cryptocurrency.
Polygon Active Addresses Are Declining
The number of MATIC Daily Active Addresses has seen a notable uptick in recent times, exhibiting a robust growth pattern. Specifically, from February 1 to March 14, there was a significant increase in daily active addresses, soaring from 1,946 to 3,301, marking an impressive 69.63% growth. 
This uptrend shows a growing interest and engagement within the MATIC network. However, this vigorous growth pace has shown signs of deceleration over the last eight days, a trend discernible from the seven-day Moving Average depicted in the chart below.
MATIC Daily Active Addresses. Source: Santiment.
The relationship between MATIC price movements and its Daily Active Addresses, particularly the seven-day Moving Average, has historically been tight. This correlation was displayed in the recent price surge observed from February 1 to March 14, during which the MATIC price experienced a notable increase of 41.77%.

Given the recent downturn in the Daily Active Addresses’ seven-day Moving Average, there’s an inference that MATIC price might be gearing up for a potential correction phase shortly. If historical patterns hold true, this downturn in active address growth could presage a cooling period for MATIC market valuation, hinting at an upcoming adjustment in its price trajectory over the ensuing days. 

Holders Face Losses: On-Chain Metrics Signal Bearish Trend
The current situation, with 51% of MATIC addresses being at a loss while only 44% are in profit, tends towards a bearish sentiment. Having the majority of investors underwater suggests they purchased at higher prices, leading to diminished buying enthusiasm and potentially stalling any upward price momentum. 
This situation might also prompt those at a loss to sell as soon as prices recover, introducing selling pressure at certain thresholds and limiting potential price growth.

The psychological impact on investor sentiment, with a majority facing losses, could foster a bearish outlook, as the concern over further declines overshadows optimism for recovery. This could dissuade new investments and delay any positive price movement. 

YTD Growth Of 21 Coins. Source: Messari.
Comparing the year-to-date (YTD) growth of some of the biggest crypto in the market today – excluding stablecoins and memecoins, MATIC is now at a loss. That status is only followed by the other two coins: ADA and XRP. With the rest of the market booming, investors could start leaving MATIC behind as they seek other investment opportunities with more potential return on their investment. 
MATIC Price Prediction: Is A 10% Drop Imminent?
MATIC’s 4-hour price chart shows that both of its short-term EMA lines recently crossed below long-term EMA lines, triggering a bearish trend. This indicates that recent prices are lower than the historical average, suggesting a period where selling pressure has outweighed buying interest. 
Such a trend implies that the market may continue to see downward pressure on MATIC prices as the bearish sentiment persists over time.

MATIC EMA lines. Source: TradingView. 
Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are a moving average that places a greater emphasis on recent price data, aiming to provide a more accurate reflection of current market trends. They are pivotal in identifying the direction of the price momentum and potential trend reversals.

If the downtrend persists, MATIC’s price could drop until the next support zone at $0.90, an almost 10% price drop. On the other hand, other factors, such as an ETH price surge, could revert this trend and make MATIC’s price start rising again. In that case, it could test resistances at $1.10 and $1.15.

Solana flooded by 20K new tokens daily: Will it make or break SOL? - AMBCrypto



20,000 new tokens are being created on Solana every day.
Sentiment around Solana remained positive despite spike in number of rugpulls.

Solana’s [SOL] network has outperformed most other protocols in terms of activity over the last few months. One of the reasons for this is the accessibility of the network and cheap fees.
Moreover, the recent memecoin frenzy has also contributed to the growth of the network.
Token creation on the rise
As a result of the combination of these two factors, market participants are creating multiple tokens on the Solana network so that they can benefit from user interest.
Based on new data, over 20,000 new tokens are being generated on Solana each day. Even though this is an indicator of a vibrant ecosystem, the creation of these many tokens on the network can have some pitfalls.
One major drawback of the deployment of such a large number of illiquid tokens would be the possibility of rug pulls occurring to addresses holding these tokens.
Even though this behavior is expected from memecoin launches, it could still impact the overall sentiment around the Solana ecosystem.
To combat these problems SolanaFM has introduced blue checkmarks that have been added to the tokens so that they can be verified. The Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Jupiter has also taken actions to help users check for legitimate tokens.
Source: X
Sentiment remains positive
Despite the uptick in the number of rug pulls on the Solana network, the sentiment around the network remained high.
AMBCrytpo’s analysis of Santiment’s data indicated that the weighted sentiment around Solana had grown significantly over the last few weeks. This implied that the number of positive comments around Solana had outnumbered the negative ones at the time of writing.
Coupled with that, the social volume around the Solana network has also grown significantly.
Source: Santiment
However, the positive sentiment around Solana was not reflected in the recent price movement around SOL. In the last 24 hours, the price of SOL had fallen by 6.21% and it was trading at $179.75 at the time of writing.

How much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?

This correction in SOL’s price may be a reaction to SOL crossing past the $200 threshold. If SOL manages to re-test this level it may rally even further.
However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) of SOL decreased during this period. This may indicate a potential decrease in buying pressure for SOL which could impact SOL’s ability to see green going forward.

Shiba Inu has seen a huge amount of action in the past day. A massive two trillion SHIB tokens have been shuffled between numerous entities, including whales, exchange and trading desks. Could it be a signal for SHIB?So, who's moving all this SHIB? Whales and a few crypto exchanges are making the moves. For example, one transaction had a massive 77.453 billion SHIB moving to a Coinbase hot wallet, and another 412.7128 billion SHIB were sent to Coinone's hot wallet.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewBut that's not all – there was a huge transaction of 500 billion SHIB sent to a Crypto.com hot wallet. Another big chunk of 431.1738 billion SHIB landed in yet another anonymous wallet, most likely owned by a whale or a trading desk. These are just a few of the gigantic transactions that occurred.Why all the movement now? It is likely because the whole market is picking up speed, getting back on its feet after a tough time. And it is not just SHIB; other meme coins are bouncing back too.These massive moves might be exchanges shuffling funds around for better security or to manage their wallets more efficiently, in order to stay liquid. Whales might also be ones getting ready for something big or taking advantage of the market's recovery to make some Shiba Inu trades.Whatever the reason, it is clear that activity on the SHIB network is on the rise right now, and these massive transfers are a sign that something is cooking. With the market getting back in shape, it seems like SHIB and other meme coins are coming back.

ENS data from Etherscan now visible in Google search results

Tech giant Google has integrated Ethereum Name Service (ENS) data into its search results through data available from Etherscan.A former ENS core team member, Brantly Millegan, noticed the update and posted the news on X. Cointelegraph confirmed the feature by testing it with several ENS addresses, including Vitalik.eth, an address belonging to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain network.The displayed result showed the address particulars, such as Ether (ETH) balance and the time of the latest transaction. The data is collected from Ethereum block explorer Etherscan.Ethereum Name Service allows the use of complex wallet addresses on the internet in the exact way domains are used. For example, instead of complex numbers, you get an ENS address like yourname.eth, which you can easily share. This is similar to quickly accessing websites directly through domains instead of IP addresses.Source: Google SearchGoogle has become increasingly involved with crypto and blockchain technology. In May 2023, it introduced native support for Ethereum wallet balances. Initially, users could search for a specific public address and view the wallet balance directly in the search results. This functionality has now been expanded to ENS domains.In 2022, Google integrated a crypto feature enabling some Ethereum wallet addresses to have their Ether balances tracked by the Google search engine, saving the need to make the trip to Etherscan. The feature was first made public by a principal at Google Ventures, Han Hua, in an Oct. 11, 2022 post.In addition, the firm also initiated a countdown to the Ethereum Merge event in 2022 by featuring animated pandas moving in sync. In 2023, Google revised its crypto advertising policy to include “Cryptocurrency Coin Trusts.” These products enable investors to trade shares in trusts holding digital assets. Related: Ethereum Name Service founder reveals Vitalik Buterin’s timely grant interventionConsequently, Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) products from notable asset managers like BlackRock now appear in search results for queries like “Bitcoin ETF.”On Feb. 5, ENS announced a partnership with domain registrar GoDaddy, which allows the Web3 community to link their .eth names (domains) to traditional Web2 domains at no extra cost.The GoDaddy-ENS partnership eliminates the barrier of high gas fees that previously dissuaded users from bringing domain names over to ENS. ENS enabled the cost-free transition by deploying new smart contracts for resolution. As a result, DNS domain holders can realize a new form of self-sovereignty by having greater control over their own decentralized identities.Magazine: Doctor Who materializes in Web3 — Tony Pearce’s journey in time and space

Crypto Market Sees Red as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Dip Ahead of Halving - Decrypt

The cryptocurrency market began Friday covered in red. Several coins, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, fell in morning trading. It could be a sign of volatility ahead of the Bitcoin halving as traders attempt to gauge whether they’ve priced in the event correctly. And as Bitcoin goes, so too typically does the rest of the market.The price of Bitcoin (BTC), the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell over 4% in the last 24 hours to a current price of about $63,400, according to CoinGecko.Cooling off after setting multiple all-time high price milestones in recent weeks, Bitcoin’s fast-approaching halving is adding to volatility, with investors anxiously waiting to see if the price drops after the event—or if it surges to yet another new all-time high.On Thursday, global investment firm AllianceBernstein predicted that Bitcoin will hit $90,000 by the end of 2024. Adding to the bullish market sentiment is surging activity around the Bitcoin ETFs that were approved earlier this year.“ETFs now represent $4 to $5 billion in average daily BTC spot market volume,” Coinbase Asia-Pacific Managing Director John O’Loghlen told Decrypt late Thursday. “So [ETFs] are 15 to 20% of the total across the centralized exchanges globally.”Ethereum, meanwhile, is down almost 6% over the last 24 hours to a current price of about $3,320. While investors wait to see if the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve spot Ethereum ETFs, investment firms—including BlackRock and Grayscale—have filed applications with the regulatory agency.Damping the enthusiasm around an Ethereum ETF is the concern that the SEC may be on the verge of declaring ETH a security, and the Ethereum Foundation recently disclosed that it is being investigated by an unnamed “state authority.” Fortune reports that the SEC is indeed investigating the foundation."On any one of these crypto tokens, it's about the facts and circumstances as to whether the investing public is anticipating a profit based on the efforts of others," SEC chair Gary Gensler told Bloomberg TV earlier this month. "We do have filings in front of us. I'm not going to comment."Solana, recently buzzing due to surging meme coin trading activity, is down even harder today—it has plunged by 8% over the last 24 hours to a current price around $171, just days after tipping over the $200 mark for the first time in more than two years.The network has been struggling with congestion issues in recent weeks due to demand for meme coins, but it could see some relief as the frenzy cools off—at least for now. Notable Solana meme coin prices are down, with BONK falling 9% on the day, Dogwifhat (WIF) dipping by about 6%, and Slerf (SLERF) plunging by nearly 25%.Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

New York gives regulatory green light to blockchain-focused asset manager - Blockworks


WisdomTree has gained clearance to offer its “blockchain-enabled” financial app to New York users via a charter expected to also extend its digital assets offerings more broadly.
The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) cleared the fund group — managing $106 billion in assets — to operate as a limited purpose trust company under the state’s banking law, WisdomTree said Friday.
The charter allows the firm to custody digital assets, as well as issue, exchange and manage the reserves of DFS-approved stablecoins. The newly formed WisdomTree Digital Trust Company intends to issue its gold and dollar tokens and maintain reserves for those assets, the company noted.
The company is also set to make its WisdomTree Prime app available to New York customers in the coming weeks, the firm said in a news release. 
The app, which launched in 21 states in July, offers bitcoin and ether, as well as dollar and gold tokens. It also allows users to access digital funds that have share ownership records kept on the Stellar or Ethereum blockchains.

Will Peck, WisdomTree’s head of digital assets, is now also the CEO of WisdomTree Digital Trust Company. 
The charter sets up a roadmap to offer products, such as DFS-approved stablecoins, on public blockchains outside of WisdomTree Prime, Peck told Blockworks.
“We believe long-term legislative and regulatory trends are likely to favor or require the use of highly regulated organizations, like New York limited purpose trust companies, for issuing tokenized products and providing related services,” he added.
The latest regulatory clearance comes after WisdomTree executives have reiterated their vision to bring fixed income, equities and commodities into the digital world via digital funds and tokenized exposures.
Read more: WisdomTree triples down on future blockchain focus
WisdomTree Prime’s tech stack integrates software from DTCC Digital Assets and Fireblocks’ Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet technology for security related to private keys management. 
“Crypto’s interesting, but the real opportunity is blockchain-enabled finance,” Chief Operating Officer Jarrett Lilien said during an October 2022 earnings call. “It’s a mistake to confuse crypto, which is a use case for the blockchain…with the broader opportunity we’re pursuing.”
WisdomTree launched one of the 10 US spot bitcoin ETFs cleared to start trading in January.
“We have no plans to incorporate the trust company into our ETF franchise,” Peck told Blockworks on Friday. “But over time, we plan to use the WisdomTree Digital Trust Company to offer products and services to institutions and business customers.”

Crypto Analyst Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says BTC in ‘Danger Zone’ and Could Fall Further - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) could pull back further before next month’s halving event when miners’ rewards are cut in half.
Pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 433,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin has entered a “danger zone” when historically the crypto king has corrected between 20% and 40%.










“It’s been two days since Bitcoin officially entered the ‘danger zone’ (orange) where historical pre-halving retraces have begun. Historically, Bitcoin has performed pre-halving retraces 14-28 days before the halving. Currently, BTC is approximately 26 days away from the halving and has pulled back almost -18% in total since last week. 
Whether the retrace bottom is in already or not is uncertain. But what’s clear is this: Bitcoin has just recently entered its ‘danger zone’ time window. Technically, there’s still time for additional downside.”



Source: Rekt Capital/X



The trader says Bitcoin’s price pattern is showing similarities to the 2016 cycle, which could indicate a deeper dip ahead before the halving event.
“In 2016, Bitcoin performed its pre-halving retrace approximately 28 days before the halving. In 2024, Bitcoin performed its pre-halving retrace approximately 32 days before the halving. Interestingly, when Bitcoin began its 2016 pre-halving retrace, price initially produced a long downside wick before retracing further. 
Recently, Bitcoin has also produced a long downside wick on its pre-halving retrace. Bitcoin will need to continue to maintain these current highs to avoid a 2016-like fate where the initial reaction was strong but short-lived.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
The trader is also predicting when Bitcoin could reach the peak of the current bull market cycle.
“When could Bitcoin peak in this bull market? Bitcoin tends to perform a bull market top 266-315 days after it breaks its old all-time high. Bitcoin broke its old all-time highs last week. The next bull market peak may thus occur in 266-315 days. That’s very late November 2024 or very late January 2025.”
However, the trader says that historically Bitcoin is taking longer to hit peaks each cycle, which could push the peak of the current bull market to December 2024 or mid-February 2025.
“Historically, the amount of days that Bitcoin has spent beyond old all-time highs have increased by approximately 14 days to 35 days… 
If we add 14-35 days to the initial bull market peak range of 266-315 days, that would bring the total to 280-350 days. This in turn could push the Bitcoin bull market peak to mid-December 2024 or mid-February 2025.”

Bitcoin is trading for $65,410 at time of writing, down more than 3% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin traders anticipate volatility as BTC futures open interest tops $36B

Bitcoin (BTC) investors are always waiting for and excited by volatility but seldom enjoy it when a price pump is followed by a sharp correction that triggers forced liquidations in futures contracts and amplifies the downside price movement. Bitcoin futures play an essential role since traders can use leverage; thus, the larger this market becomes, the greater its price impact.Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest, USD. Source: CoinglassThe aggregate Bitcoin futures open interest reached a $36 billion all-time high on March 21, up from $30 billion two weeks prior. Moreover, the market leader, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), achieved an $11.9 billion open interest, surpassing the inflow of U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since their inception.Bitcoin’s volatility increased after the spot ETF launch in the U.S.Despite the successful debut of spot ETFs, some analysts anticipated reduced volatility, given that these instruments trade over $3 billion per day on average. However, recent data indicate the opposite, as Bitcoin's volatility has increased in the last four weeks.Bitcoin/USD 30-day historical volatility. Source: TradingViewBitcoin's 30-day volatility surged above 80%, marking its highest level in over 15 months. For comparison, the S&P 500 index volatility stands at 13%, while WTI oil futures stand at 23%. Even stocks traditionally considered volatile in the traditional market, such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Unity Software (U), currently exhibit a volatility of 72% and 59%, respectively.Volatility examples in Bitcoin include a 10% correction on March 19, reaching a low of $60,795, followed by a 12% gain on March 20. This unforeseen price swing resulted in $375 million of forced liquidations in BTC futures contracts over two days. While this movement may not directly impact holders, it certainly influences the trajectory of the bull run and, more significantly, Bitcoin's risk perception by the broader market.The Bitcoin futures market, like any derivatives instrument, is a double-edged sword: it enables leveraged bullish and bearish bets. While entities aggressively shorting BTC futures may seem detrimental to the spot Bitcoin price, ultimately, the derivatives trade must be settled, either through buying back the contract or forced liquidation.Consequently, if Bitcoin's price was suppressed by investors using leveraged shorts, one should anticipate the movement to eventually reverse, leading to short-term buying pressure. This partly explains why high futures open interest is linked to increased volatility.Are Bitcoin futures behind the apparent BTC price ‘manipulation’?Some analysts attribute the added volatility to excessive leverage, while others simply attribute it to 'manipulation'.Source: amitX user Amit Kukreja, for instance, alleges that market makers have been pursuing leveraged longs and shorts. He claims that stocks directly related to the sector, such as the miner CleanSpark (CLSK), gained 7% on the day Bitcoin's price crashed to $68,000. While suppositions can be made, it is impossible to ascertain the rationale behind each market participant's intentions.To determine whether Bitcoin futures contracts have been used to exert negative pressure on BTC's price, one should analyze the monthly contracts premium. These are the preferred instruments of professional traders due to the absence of a funding rate. To compensate for the extended settlement period, sellers typically demand a 5% to 10% premium relative to spot markets.Related: History of Crypto: Bitcoin — Satoshi Nakamoto’s response to the global financial crisisBitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: LaevitasThe BTC futures premium has maintained levels above 16% for the past three weeks, which is typical of bullish markets. Furthermore, the indicator has not significantly declined even after Bitcoin's price fell by 17.6% between March 14 and March 20.If anything, the demand for leverage on Bitcoin's futures appears to be more heavily concentrated on the buy side. Conversely, if the Bitcoin price continues to downtrend, those leveraged buyers might face forced liquidation, leading to drastic consequences given the $36 billion open interest.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Why Did LUNA-LUNC-USTC Price Surge? Here are All That is Known - Bitcoin Sistemi


Terra Classic (LUNC), Terra USD (USTC) and Terra (LUNA) prices experienced a slight increase with the recent news.
The rises came after Vijesti, a local newspaper based in Montenegro, claimed that the sentence of Do Kwon, the founder of the altcoins in question, would be commuted to house arrest and Kwon would be released.


The Terra (LUNA) ecosystem experienced a collapse in May 2022 and deleted approximately $40 billion worth of assets from the cryptocurrency market. A significant portion of the cryptocurrency world thinks that Do Kwon is a scammer running a Ponzi scheme. Kwon printed billions of additional LUNA tokens to maintain the stability of his stablecoin called UST at $ 1, causing the value of this altcoin to almost zero.
However, Kwon was caught trying to leave Montenegro with a fake passport. Since then, both the United States and South Korea have requested Kwon's extradition, but Montenegrin officials have not yet made a decision. Kwon's lawyers favor extradition to South Korea, where sentences are lighter.

US DOJ Files Lawsuit Against Apple Over Unfair Rules Targeting Crypto Apps

                        The Department of Justice (DOJ) and 16 state and district attorneys general have filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of monopolizing or attempting to monopolize smartphone markets in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.Apple, a publicly traded company headquartered in California, generated significant revenues in fiscal year 2023, surpassing those of many countries’ gross domestic products.DOJ Files Lawsuit Against Apple, Alleging Illegal Control of Smartphone MarketAccording to the lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, Apple is accused of illegally controlling the smartphone market by imposing restrictive contracts on developers and limiting their access to essential points. This allegedly prevents the development of crypto apps, products, and services that could reduce dependence on iPhones, promote compatibility with other platforms, and lower costs for consumers and developers.The DOJ alleges that Apple uses its dominant position to extract more money from various parties, such as consumers, developers, artists, and small businesses. The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, stated in a press conference on Thursday,“Apple has maintained its power not because of its superiority but because of its unlawful exclusionary behavior. Monopolies like Apple threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based.”According to the DOJ, Apple’s policies have unfairly eliminated alternative payment systems and spotlighted the 30% fee it imposes on apps and in-app purchases despite not being the app developer.This fee, coupled with Apple’s exclusive support for fiat currencies in its payment systems, has posed challenges to integrating cryptocurrencies in apps. As a result, many crypto-based apps have found it economically unfeasible to offer in-app purchases or utilize cryptocurrencies within the Apple ecosystem.Government officials also allege the smartphone company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services, among other tactics, to preserve its dominance over the smartphone market.Apple Faces Legal Challenges from US DOJ and EU Regulators
Apple’s practices also allegedly restrict iPhone users and developers from accessing alternative app stores, which could compete with Apple’s fees. The DOJ claims that Apple arbitrarily enforces its App Store rules and penalizes developers who use technologies that could disrupt its monopoly power.Some examples cited include nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces like OpenSea disabling certain features on their iOS apps due to the 30% fee and a Bitcoin-friendly social app called Damus removing its BTC tipping feature after Apple delisted it for not using its in-app payments system.Additionally, Apple’s control extends to web apps accessed through iOS devices, as the company requires all iOS web browsers to use its WebKit browser engine. The DOJ also accuses Apple of denying access to competing digital wallets and preventing developers from providing customers with payment services.The officials leading the case stress that no company should be above the law, no matter how big they are. They’re determined to enforce antitrust laws to protect consumers and promote fair competition in the market.In response, a spokesperson from Apple stated that the DOJ’s complaint is inaccurate and that they will vigorously defend against it. The company argues that the lawsuit could set a dangerous precedent by giving the government excessive control over technology design.Following the news of the lawsuit, Apple’s shares [NASDAQ: AAPL] fell by 4% to approximately $171, remaining flat in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance.Read more news stories about Apple:

This Trending Meme Coin Explodes 50% Daily: Details


																TL;DR

Meme coins on the Solana blockchain have shown potential for high profits, with instances of substantial investment returns highlighted.
Despite these opportunities, the inherent volatility of meme coins underscores a considerable risk of losses.


Meme coins built on the Solana blockchain have been thriving in the past several months, with the sector spewing new ones quite frequently.
Today’s best performer from that list is Book of Meme (BOME). The asset has experienced a price spike of approximately 50% on a 24-hour scale, while its market capitalization briefly exceeded $900 million. This is a serious achievement for a token that saw the light of day a week ago.

BOME Price, Source: CoinGecko
Currently, BOME is the 126th largest cryptocurrency, and at one point, it entered the top 100 clubs. This happened on March 16 when its market cap neared a whopping $1.5 billion.




The token’s impressive price appreciation has allowed savvy traders to make substantial profits. CryptoPotato reported about the case of one such investor who turned 50 SOL into 767 SOL (equivalent to over $137,000 at current rates).
BOME is not the only meme coin to have exploded by triple digits in a short period of time, thus positioning the investments of some traders well in the green. 
Last year, a mysterious individual purchased over 2.5 million dogwifhat (WIF) tokens, spending just $310. The stash is currently worth almost $6 million.
Despite offering the chance to make life-changing profits, dealing with meme coins can lead to crucial losses due to the infamous volatility of the niche.

Worldcoin (WLD) Slips 3% as It Sunsets Data Storage Amid Regulatory Pressure

Worldcoin has slipped about 3% to $8.07 following the unveiling of its data control known as Personal Custody, a model meant to address regulators’ concerns about data privacy. Market reaction following the announcement has upset Worldcoin's performance with sharp sell-offs.The concept of Personal Custody — a groundbreaking approach recommended by privacy experts — was first unveiled alongside the introduction of World ID 2.0 and intends to reform the way personal data is handled, empowering individuals with unprecedented control over their information.Reforming data handling with Personal CustodyPersonal Custody signifies a shift in the handling of data generated during World ID verification, including images, metadata and derived data, which is securely held on the user's device.This novel approach grants users not only the ability to delete their data but also to control its future use before deletion; it is a level of autonomy that was previously unavailable. The significance of this is that it is a departure from the default practice of data deletion.One of the key advantages of Personal Custody is its ability to unlock new World ID use cases, particularly through Face Authentication for high-security applications. With Face Authentication, users can verify their identity at any time locally on their device, without the need for their data to leave their phone.Additionally, optional Data Custody will no longer be offered during orb visits, ensuring that users have the opportunity to learn about Worldcoin before deciding to share their information. Experts say that with this level of user control, the privacy concerns of the Spanish authorities over its use of eye-scanning technology for data collection should be reconsidered.Personal Custody's impact on Worldcoin's performanceAnalysts say that Personal Custody's regulatory scrutiny will be less on Worldcoin. In late January, the Hong Kong Privacy Commissioner's Office (PCPD) initiated an inquiry into Worldcoin under a court warrant. The authorities concentrated on potential significant privacy risks related to personal data and possible breaches of the Privacy Ordinance.Despite that, the blockchain-based biometrics verification company has soared to new heights to hit a new all-time-high of $11.82 on the back of a sustained bullish rally. However, analysts have predicted that the long-term benefits of this innovative approach, including reduced regulatory scrutiny and enhanced user control, will ultimately contribute to Worldcoin's sustained growth despite initial market sentiment.

Fantom’s FTM Outperforms Ahead of Upgrade

Layer 1 blockchain Fantom’s native token, FTM, has gained over 190% in four weeks, becoming the best-performing non-meme cryptocurrency among the top 100 digital assets by market value. FTM’s price surged to $1.16, the highest since April 2022, according to data tracked by CoinGecko. The token’s market capitalization jumped to $3.29 billion, becoming the 44th largest digital asset in the world. Fantom’s impending Sonic upgrade, expected to boost transaction processing speeds, may have galvanized investor interest in the cryptocurrency. The Sonic mainnet will replace the existing Opera mainnet in the next few months. Sonic’s testnet went live in October. The closed testnet with simulated traffic has demonstrated a maximum theoretical throughput of 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) and a time to finality of 1.1 seconds.

SWIFT proposes a role for itself in a tokenized future on a unified ledger

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) has been watching the development of fintech carefully, with a focus on its own future. After a variety of projects using new technologies, the pillar of the current international payments system has thrown its weight behind a unified ledger payment model.SWIFT looked in particular at tokenization and the shared ledger model, according to a post on its website. Common infrastructure could provide real-time balance to all of the participants in the shared ledger, it said. That’s not to say messaging is unneeded, SWIFT was quick to add:“Shared ledgers are not well suited to carrying and storing high volumes of data due to the way data is synchronised across parties and the computing power required. This is where a messaging layer fits in.”“For transactions to be frictionless, additional types of data also need to be transferred to enable value-added services such as AML, compliance, sanctions screening, trade and accounts receivable reconciliation,” it continued. Related: WEF 2022: SWIFT probably won’t exist in 5 years, says Mastercard CEORather than starting a unified ledger from scratch, SWIFT suggested the creation of a state machine — “a dynamic model that reflects the current state of transactions and balances across institutions” — that could be built on the ISO-20022 messaging technology already in use. It could work on a blockchain or on a centralized platform like SWIFT’s Transaction Manager.Unified ledger technology has been embraced by the International Monetary Fund in its XC platform and by financial institutions participating in the Regulated Liability Network. The Bank for International Settlements has also endorsed the model.Source: Richard TurrinSWIFT, which was founded in 1973, settled on the unified ledger model after considering several other options. In 2022, it teamed up with fintech Symbiont in a pilot project to upgrade its information delivery to corporate clients through Symbiont’s blockchain-driven Assembly platform. SWIFT argued against the use of a unified ledger in a 2023 report in favor of SWIFT as a “single point of access” to different blockchain networks. SWIFT plays a key role in the imposition of economic sanctions worldwide. In February 2022, at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission ordered the removal of an unknown number of Russian banks from SWIFT.Magazine: Block by block: Blockchain technology is transforming the real estate market

Google Integrates Ethereum Name Service, Simplifying Crypto Transactions | Cryptopolitan

Google has rolled out an update that integrates Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains into its search results, making it easier for users to view Ethereum wallet balances directly through Google search. The development, first spotted by Brantly Millegan, a former core team member of ENS, marks a pivotal moment in bridging the gap between traditional internet users and the burgeoning world of digital currencies.Simplifying Crypto Transactions with ENS DomainsThe Ethereum Name Service revolutionizes how we interact with Ethereum wallets by replacing complex public addresses with human-readable names, such as “example.eth”. It is not only demystifies the process of sending and receiving cryptocurrencies for the average user but also paves the way for broader acceptance and use of digital assets in everyday transactions. With Google’s latest update, users can now simply enter an ENS domain into the search bar and instantly view the associated Ethereum wallet’s balance, streamlining the user experience significantly.Google’s introduction of native support for Ethereum wallet balances in May 2023 was a landmark moment, signaling the tech giant’s recognition of the growing importance of cryptocurrencies in the digital economy. By allowing users to search for a specific public address and view the wallet balance within the search results, Google had already taken a significant step towards integrating crypto functionalities into its ecosystem. The expansion of the feature to include ENS domains further underscores Google’s commitment to enhancing accessibility and usability for crypto holders and enthusiasts.The Impact of Google’s Integration on the Crypto EcosystemThe integration by Google is more than just a technical update; it represents a significant leap forward in the normalization and adoption of cryptocurrencies. By making crypto transactions more accessible and understandable to the general public, Google is helping to remove some of the barriers to entry that have hindered broader adoption of digital currencies. Furthermore, the move could potentially lead to increased trust and interest in cryptocurrencies, as it aligns with Google’s reputation for providing reliable and user-friendly services.The visibility of Ethereum wallet balances and ENS domains in Google search results is poised to significantly boost interest and participation in the cryptocurrency realm. This development could act as a gateway for more individuals to explore and invest in cryptocurrencies, thereby fueling innovation and growth within the sector. It underscores the growing importance of digital asset management tools and the role they play in simplifying the user experience.Furthermore, the prominence of ENS domains in this context highlights their critical role in the crypto ecosystem. ENS domains provide a user-friendly and efficient way for individuals to manage their digital assets, making the process more accessible and straightforward. This enhancement in visibility and usability is expected to encourage more users to engage with and navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency world, fostering a more inclusive and expansive digital economy.ConclusionGoogle’s integration of Ethereum Name Service domains into its search functionality is a testament to the growing intersection between traditional tech industries and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. The move not only enhances the user experience for existing crypto enthusiasts but also plays a crucial role in demystifying digital currencies for the average internet user. As the lines between the traditional internet and the blockchain continue to blur, initiatives like this are pivotal in paving the way for a more interconnected and accessible digital future.

The Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange platform, through its derivatives department, announced that the platform is preparing to launch new products for its investor pool on April 1st. The recent announcements to introduce cash-settled futures contracts for three major altcoins. Coinbase International took to X (formerly Twitter), to announce the launch. The announcement comes as a huge boost of approval for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. The three Altcoins mentioned have been in the top ten cryptocurrency space for a long time, and this announcement brings hope to long-time investors of the various tokens. The announcement serves as a further endorsement of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that has often been viewed as the father of meme coins. The coin is clearly transitioning to a more stable cryptocurrency with clear-cut use cases. Considering Dogecoin has often been listed as a legitimate cryptocurrency that can be used to purchase Tesla vehicles, the coin has since recorded significant growth. The crypto exchange platform teased crypto fans, hinting that their first leveraged and CFTC-regulated futures contracts for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dogecoin could be available to trade on different platforms. Coinbase encouraged cryptocurrency investors to be on the lookout for these leveraged futures as they will be available to trade on partner platforms as well. This is a huge step for crypto enthusiasts and it marks a crucial step towards broader adoption and increased accessibility for digital assets. Behind the Scenes; What steps did Coinbase take?Coinase Derivatives filed a request to list new Futures contracts to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on March 7th. The exchange platform however, expected delays during the regulatory process and therefore planned to launch the products anyway, as they are confident the leveraged contracts adhere to the legal guidelines established by the US Commodity Futures and Trading Commission. In Coinbase’s application to list Dogecoin Futures, it stated that the Doge cryptocurrency has withstood the test of time and undoubtedly grown beyond its reputation as a memecoin. The cryptocurrency’s popularity across the board has soared even more after the announcement, witnessed by the sharp (18%) increase in DOGE price.What Coinbase looks to achieveThe cryptocurrency exchange has played around with the idea of crypto-leveraged derivatives for a long time. Back in 2022. The crypto exchange platform clearly mentioned that it has intentions of making cryptocurrency derivatives contracts reachable to its retail investors. Per its mission, Coinbase reportedly acquired FairX, a derivatives exchange platform regulated by CFTC. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchange platforms in the market is continuing to drive cryptocurrency adoption through different products. These steps are received positively within the Web 3 space, and crypto investors are undoubtedly excited as they wait for this opportunity, come April 1st, to access CTFC-regulated derivatives of well-known cryptocurrencies like BitcoinCash, Litecoin, and Dogecoin.

CryptoPunks record another $16M NFT sale in March

Blue-chip nonfungible token (NFT) collection CryptoPunks saw another record-breaking sale in March, as one more rare alien piece sold for roughly $16 million in Ether (ETH). On March 20, CryptoPunk #7804 was purchased for 4,850 ETH, worth about $16.4 million at the time of the sale. The NFT sale claimed the second-highest selling price ever for a CryptoPunk and followed another high-profile NFT sale earlier in March. On March 4, CryptoPunk #3100 sold for 4,500 ETH, worth around $16 million at the time of sale, making it the third-largest CryptoPunk sale after the recent #7804 punk sale. Top CryptoPunks ranked by sales price. Source: CryptoPunksCryptoPunk #7804 is one of 10,000 NFTs within the collection. However, its value comes from the rarity of its attributes. The character in the NFT has its cap forward, which only 254 CryptoPunks have. It has a pipe, which only 317 of the NFTs have, and small shades shared by only 378 CryptoPunks. However, what truly makes the digital asset rarer is that it’s one out of only nine alien CryptoPunks. Peruggia, the NFT’s seller, posted on X to express thoughts on the sale. The CryptoPunk seller described the sale as the “end of an era” and confessed to feeling like an imposter and holding NFTs back by not elevating the piece to what it deserves. Source: PeruggiaPeruggia bought the CryptoPunk in March 2021 for 4,200 ETH, worth $7.5 million at the sale. The NFT trader held onto the piece for over three years despite being offered around $18 million in 2022. The transaction also held the record for the second-largest CryptoPunk sale before the two $16 million sales this month. Source: FVCKRENDER Community members praised the sale, with many congratulating the seller and giving words of appreciation for holding the NFT asset. Related: BlackRock receives memecoins, NFTs after depositing $100M USDC onchainThe sale of CryptoPunk #7804 catapulted the NFT collection’s sales volume to surpass other popular NFTs like NodeMonkeys and Mad Lads in weekly sales. According to NFT data tracker CryptoSlam, CryptoPunks recorded $21.5 million in sales in the last seven days. With high-profile NFT sales happening in multiple blockchains, transaction volume for NFTs started skyrocketing. In the last 30 days, NFTs recorded $1.5 billion in sales volume across multiple blockchain networks.

Will decentralized protocols become the future infrastructure of machine learning?

Booming interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has led to a shortage of hardware resources and exorbitant cloud service costs, but decentralized infrastructure could challenge the dependence on centralized players.Harry Grieve, co-founder of machine learning compute network Gensyn, spoke exclusively to Cointelegraph during the ETHGlobal event in London about the promise of peer-to-peer computing networks challenging Web2 services like Amazon Web Services. Gensyn is an in-development decentralized network that will enable people to connect to various devices across the internet to train machine learning models. The company is backed by several Web3 venture capital firms and raised $50 million from Andreessen Horowitz in 2023.Grieve says the network holds significant potential as the internet changes to a more dynamic representation of information that will empower “self-sovereignty and computational liberty online.”Grieve chats to Cointelegraph in London during the ETHGlobal hackathon. Source: Gareth JenkinsonGensyn has been in development since 2020, with Grieve and co-founder Ben Fielding researching machine learning computing for training and decentralized verifiable systems. The pair have been looking to solve a threefold problem with blockchain-based technology.“How can you peer with another device and train a machine learning model on that device where A), the device is untrusted? B), your training model can’t fit on that single device. And C, you want the achievable scale of the entire system and unit economic outcomes as good as AWS,” Grieve said.Gensyn’s lite paper describes the protocol as “a layer-1 trustless protocol for deep learning computation.” The network directly and immediately rewards participants for availing computing resources to the network and performing ML tasks. Grieve said the challenge of building the network is verifying completed ML work, which sits at the intersection of complexity theory, game theory, cryptography and optimization:“We realized that if you want to build this in a decentralized way, you need a way to reach a decentralized consensus about who did what. That’s basically all a blockchain is.” Taking a leaf out of Satoshi’s Bitcoin playbookGensyn takes some inspiration from the ideals of the Bitcoin protocol, and Grieve says he’s a big believer in the old Bitcoin laptop mining days, where users could acquire BTC when it was still possible for smaller devices to be used for mining:“Satoshi gave people the right to their money again; they could generate it from a laptop. They could convert electricity into money. They could convert fiat into something harder.”While the long-term plan is to make Gensyn a tool that allows a wide set of users and hardware to provide or access computing resources for ML training, the initial launch will target users with more graphics processing units (GPUs) because they represent the quickest way to get a lot of feedback.“We are thoroughly planning on people building on top of Gensyn to make more user-friendly, supply-side, and contribution applications. Ultimately, an individual with a laptop will be able to download our client and run it in a way that connects you to the network,” Grieve said.Related: io.net adds Apple chip support to its cloud-based GPU-sourcing networkApple’s Silicon chips also promise to unlock massive global computing resources. Grieve says that research into Apple M2 and M3 chips shows that the hardware reaches parity with mid-tier, current-generation consumer Nvidia RTX GPUs. This provides two potential major benefits for protocols like Gensyn, which could tap into a broad set of devices to contribute to its global supercluster. Grieve says:“I think people are more likely to have something that looks like a MacBook than a standalone GPU, so it’s a much more like democratizing force if you can contribute that.”Apple Silicon chips are also highly versatile, acting as a “system on a chip” that could be emulated by other chip manufacturers. Grieve believes the future could have more edge devices that are far more powerful than existing smartphones, adding that decentralizing across lots of devices and verifying device-agnostically is essential.As Cointelegraph previously reported, Solana-based decentralized network io.net will onboard Apple Silicon chip hardware for its artificial intelligence and machine learning services.Magazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has issued an important warning about ongoing scams aimed at customers of the now-defunct crypto trading platform FTX. As the bankruptcy proceedings of FTX advance and the possibility of repaying some customers emerges, opportunistic scammers are sprouting up, aiming to prey on unsuspecting victims. According to Bloomberg, FTX told a bankruptcy judge in January that creditors of the company who can prove their losses are likely to get all of their money back.In light of this, scammers are reportedly reaching out to FTX customers, offering to expedite the claims process or retrieve assets from the beleaguered exchange. However, these offers are nothing more than a ruse to deceive users and potentially steal (more of) their assets.Ripple CTO issues warningThe collapse of FTX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, dealt a serious blow to the crypto industry, causing widespread uncertainty and a loss of trust among investors. In the aftermath, many users have been left in limbo, hoping to recover their funds. It is within this context that the Ripple CTO alerts of scams that are exploiting the situation.According to Schwartz, scam emails are presently circulating, claiming that customers must take action regarding their FTX claims. These unscrupulous actors generally exploit the fear of customers missing out on their claims, urging them to connect their crypto wallet to verify their eligibility or expedite the claims process.The Ripple CTO warns users not to click on links on scam emails when sharing the link to the official FTX claims page.Users should bear in mind that the deadline for filing a proof of claim on account of a customer claim has passed - Sept. 29, 2023.

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest Reshuffles Portfolio: Trims Coinbase, Buys Reddit - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest recently made two significant transactions involving Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares. The firm, known for its focus on disruptive innovation, sold some of its Coinbase holdings for a profit while simultaneously investing in Reddit’s highly anticipated IPO.



Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest Books Profit on Coinbase, Buys Reddit



ARK Invest, the investment management firm led by Cathie Wood, recently made significant transactions involving Coinbase and Reddit shares. On March 21, ARK sold 199,526 Coinbase shares across three of its ETFs, with the majority (133,533) coming from the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK).



The sale, including shares from the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), amounted to approximately $52.35 million based on Coinbases’ closing price that day. The transaction occurred as Coinbase’s stock price surged above $270, reaching its highest level since December 2021, and is part of a series of significant sales of Coinbase shares by ARK in 2023 and early 2024.



In contrast to the Coinbase sale, ARK Invest acquired nearly 10,000 shares of Reddit on the occasion of the social media platform’s strong market debut.



The firm added 9,982 shares to its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF, with the transaction value amounting to approximately $503,492 based on Reddit’s closing price on the day of the purchase. The acquisition of Reddit shares demonstrates ARK’s interest in the potential growth and innovation of the social media platform as it enters the public market.





Reddit IPO a Success, Closed at $50.44



Reddit’s shares surged 48% on their first day of trading in New York, closing at $50.44 per share after opening at $47. This exceeded the initial pricing of $34 per share set for the IPO.



The company was valued at $6.4 billion post-IPO, raising $748 million through the sale of shares, which decreased from a $10 billion valuation in a private fundraising round in 2021.



Despite not reporting an annual profit since its inception in 2005, Reddit has generated interest by positioning its content as valuable for training artificial intelligence (AI) programs. This includes a reported data licensing deal with Google worth approximately $60 million annually.



The company’s IPO was highly anticipated, having confidentially filed in December 2021, but market conditions delayed the public offering until 2024.



Reddit allocated 8% of its shares to eligible users, moderators, certain board members, and friends and family members of employees and directors. Retail investors were given early access to some shares through various platforms, introducing risks associated with increased price volatility due to the lack of a lock-up period for these investors.



The company’s cultural significance and the “meme-stock” phenomenon of 2021, in which its subreddit “Wallstreetbets” played a key role, contributed to its high profile leading up to the IPO. Its post-IPO performance will be closely monitored to determine its future direction and financial health indicators.







Do you think Reddit has a good long-term potential, or will it be a meme stock? Let us know in the comments below.

Ripple’s chief technology officer and one of the XRP Ledger creators David Schwartz has taken to the X social media network (formerly Twitter) to publish a cryptic tweet. It was a math problem that ultimately equaled 5.Does Ripple CTO's tweet hint at future XRP price?This tweet by Schwartz triggered an enthusiastic response from multiple X/Twitter accounts. The response given to a lot of commentators by the top Ripple executive was “5,” and many XRP enthusiasts preferred to interpret this as Schwartz making a prediction about the XRP price reaching $5 in the future. Perhaps it will once Ripple manages to ultimately win the case against the SEC.When, last year, a major victory in this legal case was obtained and Federal Jjudge Analisa Torres made a ruling that XRP sales on secondary markets do not qualify as sales of securities, XRP soared to the $0.71 level briefly. In the same year, the SEC lost another major case; that one had been initiated by Grayscale to compel the regulator to give serious attention to its filing about converting its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF. This wish was granted on Jan. 11 this year, when Grayscale’s spot ETF was approved along with 10 others, including those issued by BlackRock, Ark Invest and Fidelity.As of this writing, XRP proudly holds the position of the sixth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization value and is exchanging hands at $0.63214. Over the last 24 hours, the price demonstrated 6.05% growth; however, it was quickly reduced to 4.91% by the decline that followed.David Schwartz develops trading botIn a tweet issued on March 21, the Ripple CTO informed the cryptocurrency community that he had successfully completed the development of a new bot for trading on centralized crypto exchanges.David Schwartz revealed that the bot operates using an algorithm that is similar to the one on which the XRP Ledger's AMM runs.For now, according to Schwartz, the bot is “really rough,” but he is considering adding a GitLab link. The software engineer pointed out that it is too early to tell whether this bot is going to bring high profits. For the time being, he expects he would be able to make approximately 11% per year.

Tether's $5.25 Billion Surge Sparks Speculation, Is This Good for Bitcoin (BTC)?

Tether (USDT), the crypto ecosystem’s dominant stablecoin, has added over $5.25 billion to its market capitalization since the start of March. This boom in stablecoin funding is a good omen for overall market liquidity as it generally provides a baseline that can help meet Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins' demands.For proper reference, the combined spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) market, despite its massive growth thus far this month, has only managed to add less than $4 billion in netflow. That USDT liquidity is higher than the ETF's asset under management (AUM) growth means there is enough stablecoin to fuel both BTC and altcoins' accumulation on exchanges.Based on the current market outlook, data from CoinMarketCap pegs the market capitalization of Tether at $104,056,161,009. This marks a move from around $98.65 billion at the start of the month, with a steady uptrend masked by the short stint consolidation phase recorded through the month.Though this supply figure comes with many speculations of improper reserve backing, Tether has always refuted any related claims, with vocal backing from Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether’s custodian.Tether's relevance on crypto marketSince its creation, Tether has played a key role in bolstering the crypto market’s trading integrity. Many billion dollar trades involving USDT have been recorded lately. Tether’s USDT is hosted on almost every crypto trading platform as it forms a unique pair with the majority of altcoins around.The company behind the stablecoin Tether Holdings is gradually pivoting away from being just a USDT issuer; it is making a push to become a Bitcoin mining entity and developer with extensive investment in the sector. The connection to Bitcoin has sparked conversations around market manipulation, further FUD that the company has tried to vehemently fight off over the past few years.

Worldcoin (WLD) Announces New Step in Response to Criticism - Bitcoin Sistemi


Worldcoin (WLD) announced a new initiative called “Personal Custody” that aims to build additional trust among its users. The initiative will reform how biometric data is handled during the World ID verification process.
Previously, when people signed up for a World ID, they had the option of having their biometric data stored and then encrypted. However, with the Personal Storage application, this option will no longer be available.


Instead, biometric data captured by Orb during World ID verification will be held on users' personal devices, usually a smartphone. Thus, users will have full control over their data, including the option to delete it if they wish.

Tiago Sada, from Tools for Humanity, the altcoin's developer company, said that while Worldcoin has always taken privacy seriously, the private custody initiative is seen as an opportunity to bolster the level of trust felt by potential users who have not yet signed up:






“While previously everything was deleted by default, users now have control over what they do with their data, giving them peace of mind without having to trust absolutely anyone.”

In addition to the private custody move, Worldcoin claims that Orb also aims to promote transparency by making key components of its software publicly available on GitHub.
Worldcoin has been criticized for privacy for scanning people's eye irises and issuing WLD altcoins to users who have not previously registered.

Avalanche continues memecoin push with $1M reward for liquidity providers

The Avalanche Foundation — the organization behind the smart contract blockchain platform Avalanche — is doubling down on memecoins with a liquidity mining incentive program to drive momentum for community-owned coins within its ecosystem. On March 21, the foundation announced “Memecoin Rush,” which provides $1 million in Avalanche (AVAX) tokens as an incentive for traders and liquidity providers of community coins based on Avalanche. The program’s first phase will begin on the decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms SteakHut and Trader Joe. Avalanche said these platforms will “incentivize trading and add liquidity strategies” for community tokens within the network. According to the announcement, rewards will be given to liquidity providers on liquidity pools of memecoins Coq, NoChill, Tech and Kimbo paired with the AVAX token. In addition, Avalanche listed Coq, Kimbo, NoChill, Gec, Tech, Husky, Meow, Kong, Meat and Kingshit as beneficiaries of the incentive program’s vaults. While crypto community figures like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have been critical of memecoin traders, Avalanche seems to have a different perspective. On Dec. 29, it announced that its $100 million culture catalyst fund would be used to purchase memecoin assets based on the network. Source: Vitalik ButerinAvalanche said that memecoins represent the “collective spirit and shared interests of diverse crypto communities” and claimed that they go “beyond mere utility assets.” It also highlighted that the initiative aims to position its blockchain as a network that supports new forms of creativity and culture.Related: Trader fumbles $1M bag after selling a Solana memecoin earlyOn Jan. 24, Avalanche clarified that not all memecoins will get a piece of the $100 million fund. The foundation shared eligibility requirements like having contracts renounced, possessing low ownership concentration among whales and having high levels of liquidity. The Avalanche foundation also said that the project should be a month old at minimum. In March, memecoin on the Solana network hit what a community member described as “peak degeneracy,” with token projects raising over $100 million in just three days. Memecoin founders received millions from March 15 to 18 through a controversial fundraising method called “pre-sales.” With this crowdfunding model, investors send Solana (SOL) tokens to a wallet address, hoping to receive a weighted distribution of tokens once it goes live. However, there is no guarantee that the investors will receive the tokens in exchange for their SOL. Magazine: Real-life Doge at 18: Meme that’s going to the moon

WisdomTree secures NYDFS charter for digital asset custody and stablecoin issuance - Crypto Briefing




Global financial company WisdomTree announced today that it secured the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval to operate as a New York limited-purpose trust company charter. This development allows WisdomTree to engage in digital asset activities, including custody of digital assets and stablecoin issuance.According to a press release published on Friday, this prestigious charter enables WisdomTree to offer fiduciary custody of digital assets, issue DFS-approved stablecoins, and manage stablecoin reserves through its new entity, WisdomTree Digital Trust Company, LLC.WisdomTree Digital Trust Company will initially provide products within the WisdomTree Prime ecosystem, including the WisdomTree Gold Token and the WisdomTree Dollar Token, with reserves maintained under a DFS-approved framework. The charter also grants WisdomTree the ability to serve New York’s retail customers with access to WisdomTree Prime.Jonathan Steinberg, WisdomTree Founder and CEO, is confident in WisdomTree’s ability to regulate the digital asset industry effectively while ensuring the safety of consumers through existing robust regulations.
“The New York State Department of Financial Services is the premier regulator for businesses that engage in digital asset activity. This well-established trust company charter program – which long predates digital assets – is based on bank-grade regulation, allowing us to offer products that capitalize on innovation without sacrificing customer protection,” stated Steinberg.
Will Peck, Head of Digital Assets at WisdomTree and CEO of WisdomTree Digital Trust Company, LLC, emphasized the high compliance standards of a New York limited-purpose trust company, which offers a leading platform for regulated tokenized products and services.
“We have a robust initial product offering and a strong plan to grow in a responsible manner with this charter in New York and through our other licenses across the nation,” stated Peck.
In recent years, some states have created new regulatory frameworks to address the growing popularity of crypto assets. These include limited-purpose charters that allow financial institutions to offer crypto-related services while providing some level of consumer protection through state oversight. An example of a limited-purpose banking charter is the New York Limited Purpose Trust Company Charter. Issued by the state of New York, it allows institutions to act as trustees for digital assets.With the latest regulatory win, WisdomTree joins the ranks of established players like Coinbase, Fidelity, and Gemini. All these companies now hold chartered limited-purpose trust company status, allowing them to act as fiduciaries for digital asset custody under the Banking Law.

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Speaks About Cryptocurrencies: Makes Bizarre "Disinfectant" Comment - Bitcoin Sistemi


In a speech today, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler cited the cryptocurrency industry as a problem area and accused it of avoiding public disclosure by avoiding registration.
Gensler, who has led a legal fight against what he perceives as a largely noncompliant industry during his tenure, has suggested that digital asset businesses are among those seeking to undermine the SEC's disclosure regime. This regime requires companies to register securities and provide investors with information about them.


“There are participants in crypto securities markets who want to avoid these registration requirements,” Gensler said in a speech prepared for an event at Columbia Law School. “No registration means no mandatory disclosure.”

“Many agree that crypto markets could benefit from some disinfectant,” Gensler added. The regulator is currently pursuing various enforcement actions against companies it accuses of failing to register as exchanges and listing unregistered securities, such as Coinbase and Binance. He is also reportedly exploring Ethereum (ETH) and considering classifying the asset as a security, unlike Bitcoin.





Gensler's statement that crypto platforms should be registered may soon be tested. Prometheum, the first firm to launch as an approved, special-purpose crypto brokerage firm, is preparing to open this business to its customers, according to its executives. Coinbase, on the other hand, asked an appeals court to intervene and force the SEC to impose crypto-specific rules.

UN Says North Korea Steals Billions In Crypto To Fund Doomsday Weapons - Benzinga

The United Nations (UN) Security Council has disclosed findings from an investigation into North Korea’s sanction evasion tactics, revealing a significant portion of the country’s foreign currency earnings — approximately 50% — stem from cyberattacks on cryptocurrency-related firms. These cyber operations have inflicted an estimated $3 billion in damages, spotlighting the regime’s reliance on digital theft as a major revenue source.From July 2023 to January 2024, a panel of experts delved into North Korea’s adherence to international sanctions, uncovering sophisticated strategies to bypass these restrictions. While the report carries no legal weight, it paved the way for potential new sanctions by the Security Council and its member states against entities or individuals found in violation.The investigation further highlighted that nearly 40% of North Korea’s expenditures on weapons of mass destruction were financed through revenues from cyberattacks. Defense companies have increasingly become targets, with evidence of hackers linked to the Reconnaissance General Bureau sharing resources and tools more frequently.Additionally, the panel explored allegations of the Islamic organization Hamas utilizing weaponry produced by North Korea. Read Next: Bitcoin, Altcoins Ready For Massive Gains, According To AnalystIsraeli investigations have identified the presence of North Korean missiles and anti-tank arms within Hamas’s arsenal. North Korea has consistently refuted such claims, dismissing them as unfounded.The report also sheds light on North Korea’s continued ballistic missile launches, with at least seven detected in the six months leading up to January 2024. Notably, Japan reported the introduction of a “tactical nuclear attack submarine” capable of underwater assaults.Despite the imposition of economic sanctions aimed at curtailing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions — through fund inflow restrictions and bans on certain imports and exports — the country managed to engage in sanctioned trade activities. These include importing refined petroleum products and exporting luxury goods, leading to a trade volume in 2023 that surpassed figures from the previous year.Read Next: Should You Stay Or Should You Go?

Final Fantasy 15 director says AI, VR, Web3 important for devs ‘whether you like it or not’

Developers should embrace future-facing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and Web3 if they want to stay relevant in the changing gaming industry, says Final Fantasy 15 director Hajime Tabata.Tabata’s comments came during a seminar held by Human Academy featuring former Square Enix president Yoichi Wada and Tabata, who is now the CEO of JP Games. According to a Google translation of a report from Japanese news source 4Gamer, the two gaming industry luminaries discussed the future of gaming with topics ranging from “what is required of creators now" to “these people are not suitable for creators".Creators who haven’t tried generative artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT or dabbled in Web3 and metaverse development won’t be able to keep up with the needs of the industry going forward, according to Wada and Tabata. In reference to these technologies, Tabata said:“It’s important whether you like it or not, but being a game creator is also a service industry, so you can only get paid if you make something that satisfies others and provide it.”The overarching point of the conversation between the two appeared to address the changing landscape and the need for developers to remain both curious and agile as new modalities transform the nature of both game creation and monetization. “To make a game from a management perspective,” said Wada, “you need three things: authorship, craftsmanship, and teamwork.” He added, “If you don’t understand the characteristics of media and the technology related to it, you can’t create proper content.”Under its current president, Yosuke Matsuda, Square Enix has become one of the largest proponents of future-facing technologies among AAA game publishers. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the company pivoted to future tech in 2024 with a promise to modify its organizational structure to support blockchain, Web3, and AI technologies throughout its verticals.

Will Qatar Really Buy Bitcoin (BTC)? Analyst Explained His Opinion - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bitcoin is notable for its volatile price movements and growing acceptance among mainstream investors. But convincing the world's sovereign wealth funds of the advantages of investing in Bitcoin remains a challenge, according to one analyst.
In early March, rumors spread that Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), could potentially invest in the BTC market. This speculation emerged when it was reported that one of the private jets of the Emir of Qatar landed on the island of Madeira for the Bitcoin Atlantis conference.


But Fadi Aboualfa, director of research at Copper, questioned the likelihood of any sovereign wealth fund choosing Bitcoin over fixed income or more traditional assets during its capital allocation. He discussed why sovereign wealth funds would invest in BTC rather than the security of five-year bonds that can offer risk-free returns of 5-6% annually.

When it comes to rumors of QIA's Bitcoin investment, Aboualfa suggested that the country would be better off using its unmined natural gas for Bitcoin mining. “This would be growth in terms of revenue versus the untapped natural resources they already have and the most expensive part of Bitcoin mining,” he added.





However, Aboualfa suggested that BTC could potentially appeal to countries looking to separate themselves from the dollar-dominated global financial system:
“Especially countries that are more dependent on the West for payment networks than they would like may turn to Bitcoin because blockchain and digital assets allow them to reduce geopolitical risks and provide more control. This could eventually lead, in the long run, to a return to monetary sovereignty, which currently only applies to BTC.”

Worldcoin To End Storing Users' Personal Data - Benzinga

Although Worldcoin WLD/USD has always maintained it is highly protective of peoples' biometric data when scanning their eyeballs to prove they are human, the project is now implementing a plan designed to build additional trust. With the implementation of what Worldcoin calls "Personal Custody" when people sign up for a World ID, they will no longer be given the option to have their biometric data stored and encrypted. Now, instead, the biometric data "captured by the orb and used to generate the iris code during World ID verification" will be held on people's own personal devices — in most cases a smartphone — and users then can decide what to do with the data, including deleting it if they choose to. The project's personal custody plan was first teased back in December when Worldcoin announced details for its World ID 2.0, dubbed "a human passport for the internet."Read the full story at The Block.© 2024 Benzinga.com.

JUST IN: Anthropic Makes a Move to Acquire FTX's $1 Billion Stake - Bitcoin Sistemi


Anthropic, a leading artificial intelligence startup, is reportedly currently in the process of raising a new investment round. The company plans to sell the shares of the bankrupt cryptocurrency company FTX for around $1 billion.
However, the company made it clear that it would not accept funds from Saudi Arabia.


The current for-sale stake in Anthropic belongs to FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange that recently declared bankruptcy. FTX bought the shares three years ago for $500 million. Due to recent developments in artificial intelligence, the 8% stake is now worth over $1 billion.
Proceeds from the sale of FTX's shares will be used to refund the cryptocurrency exchange's customers. The transaction is expected to close within the next few weeks.





The shares offered for sale are Class B shares without voting rights. The shares are selling at Anthropic's last valuation of $18.4 billion.
Over the past few years, Anthropic has raised nearly $7 billion from tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, and Salesforce. Anthropic founders Dario and Daniela Amodei reserve the right to object to potential investors.


However, they are not involved in the current fundraising process or discussions with potential investors for FTX's stake.

New EU AML Laws Ban All Anonymous Crypto Payments - DailyCoin


        
The EU has implemented a new law restricting cash transactions to fight money laundering.



The EU has cracked down on money laundering by restricting cash and banning anonymous transactions.



New AML regulations have outlawed unidentified cryptocurrency wallets.
The European Union (EU) has taken a significant step towards curbing money laundering activities by approving anti-money laundering laws (AML). The legislation, which was met with some opposition, aims to restrict both cash and cryptocurrency payments to increase transparency and financial oversight.EU Cracks Down on Cash and Crypto PaymentsThe new regulations, which were greenlit by the majority of the EU Parliament’s lead commission on March 19, establish specific limitations on cash transactions. Notably, any cash payment exceeding €10,000 will be prohibited, while anonymous cash transactions above €3,000 will also be outlawed.Perhaps cryptocurrency payments are the most contentious aspect of the new AML package. Under the new laws, any crypto payments made using unidentified self-custody wallets will become illegal. This applies to any digital wallet, be it mobile, desktop, or browser-based, not operated by a licensed provider.The enforcement of these new AML regulations is slated to begin within three years of their official entry into force. However, Dublin law firm Dillon Eustace anticipates that these laws will be fully operational well before the standard enforcement timeline.One vocal opponent of the new legislation is Patrick Breyer, a member of the European Parliament for the German Pirate Party. Breyer expressed skepticism regarding the effectiveness of these laws in combating crime. MEP Calls Out EU Law’s Impact on Financial FreedomBreyer further emphasized his belief that anonymous transactions are a fundamental human right for achieving individual financial autonomy. Beyond the infringement on privacy rights, Breyer warns of the potential economic and social repercussions of the EU’s war on cash.Public resistance to limitations on cash transactions is not a new phenomenon in Europe. Breyer referenced the “great public outcry” in 2017 when the European Commission previously consulted the public on limiting cash usage.The effectiveness of the new AML legislation in combating money laundering remains to be seen. While some believe it is necessary, others fear it may come at the cost of individual financial privacy and economic freedom.On the Flipside
The legislation might disproportionately affect unbanked individuals who rely on cash for everyday transactions.



The new AML rules may place a significant compliance burden on businesses, especially those dealing with high-value transactions.



The regulations on self-custody wallets could be technologically bypassed by using decentralized exchanges or privacy-focused blockchains.
Why This MattersThe EU’s new AML laws, particularly the restrictions on self-custody crypto wallets, could significantly impact how Europeans interact with cryptocurrency. This crackdown on anonymity raises concerns about user privacy and financial inclusion, potentially stifling innovation and hindering mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies within the EU.Interested in learning more about how the EU’s new stablecoin guidelines work and what they mean for the future of cryptocurrency?

How Solana Stacks Up With Ethereum in One DeFi Key Metric - DailyCoin


        
Solana’s design enables more efficient DeFi applications with less capital locked up.



Solana’s architecture offers faster transactions and parallel processing. 



Network metrics showcase this efficiency.
The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector is at the forefront of blockchain innovation, offering an alternative to traditional financial systems through decentralized applications (dApps). Within this competitive landscape, Solana and Ethereum stand out as leading platforms, each striving to offer the most efficient, secure, and user-friendly environment for DeFi applications.The battle for dominance hinges on several factors, including transaction speed, fees, and scalability. Most recently, a Reflexivity Research report highlighted the importance of capital efficiency in DeFi. Notably, Solana stands out in terms of this key metric, offering better performance for traders than Ethereum. Solana’s Capital Efficiency Outshines EthereumIn March 2024, Reflexivity Research published an analysis highlighting Solana’s significant lead in capital efficiency over Ethereum. This metric is essential in the DeFi space as it indicates how well a blockchain utilizes locked-up value to facilitate economic activity and growth. Capital efficiency, a key metric in TradFi, measures how effectively capital is used to generate revenue and facilitate economic activity. In DeFi, the metric measures the relationship between the total value locked (TVL) and the platform’s economic output, such as trading volume or generated fees.In the first quarter of 2024, Solana was ahead of other chains in terms of the relationship between its DEX volume and TVL. In fact, DEX volume to TVL in that period was at 3.12, compared to Ethereum’s 0.27. This indicates strong capital efficiency. Source: ReflexivityReseachThis metric soared in recent months, thanks to a significant increase in DEX volume, without a comparative increase in TVL. This was in contrast to Ethereum, for which DEX volume to TVL remained largely unchanged. Source: ReflexivityReseachThe report suggests that one of the reasons behind this change is Solana’s architecture. The network supports faster transactions and reduced fees, which means less capital is tied up in transactions waiting for confirmation. Additionally, Solana’s ability to process transactions in parallel significantly boosts its DeFi operations’ efficiency.By requiring less capital to achieve higher levels of economic activity, Solana can potentially attract a wider array of developers and users. In fact, the latest data suggests that Solana is attracting even more activity. Solana’s DeFi Volume Surges in 2024High capital efficiency has already propelled Solana forward, and it has seen a meteoric rise in its ecosystem and trading volume. Solana’s TVL stands at an impressive $3.913 billion, underscoring the substantial amount of assets pouring into its ecosystem.Trading volume has seen a substantial rise, currently standing at $1.792 billion. Moreover, the network collected $4.39 million in fees and generated $2.2 million in revenue over the last 24 hours. Source: DefiLlamaSolana’s impressive metrics in TVL, fees, revenue, and DeFi volume illustrate the platform’s significant competitive edge in the DeFi space. These figures are a testament to Solana’s capital efficiency, where less capital is needed to unlock higher economic activity compared to other platforms. On the Flipside
Low fees on Solana means that many of Solana’s transactions are spam. While this contributes to capital efficiency, it also showcases an issue with the network. 



Reflexivity Research’s report acknowledges that Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem should include the activity on both the mainnet and L2 rollups for a complete picture. 
Why This MattersThe competition between Solana and Ethereum underscores the importance of continuous improvement and innovation within the blockchain space. Read more about Solana’s performance: Solana’s Stellar Rise in 2024: What’s Behind the Success?Read more about Polkadot’s ecosystem: Polkadot (DOT) Embraces Memecoin Mania with $PINK’s Launch

Crypto markets need ‘disinfectant,’ says SEC chair

United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler took aim at crypto industry participants, claiming some avoided registration requirements with the regulator.In a prepared speech released on March 22 for Columbia Law School, Gensler used his closing remarks to criticize crypto firms’ approach to regulatory oversight. The SEC chair spoke in favor of the benefits of mandatory disclosure for market participants, citing Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who said, “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”“[T]here still are those who would like to whittle away at the SEC’s disclosure regime,” said the SEC chair. “There are participants in crypto securities markets that seek to avoid these registration requirements. No registration means no mandatory disclosure. Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant.”Gensler’s remarks came as the SEC is pursuing several enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including Kraken, Binance, Ripple and Coinbase. Many crypto companies and advocacy groups have called on the SEC to establish clear rules of the road in an effort to keep innovation in the United States.Related: Senators pressure SEC’s Gensler not to approve any more crypto ETFsThe commission has reportedly sent out subpoenas as part of a campaign to eventually classify Ether (ETH) as a security under the SEC’s regulatory purview. In the last two years, the commission has made inroads into approvals of crypto-tied exchange-traded products for U.S. exchanges, including investment vehicles tied to ETH and Bitcoin (BTC) futures and the first spot BTC exchange-traded funds in January.Magazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?

DOGE Landing On X Payments? Twitter Secures 3 More Licenses - DailyCoin


        
X Corp attained three new money transmitter licenses for X Payments.



The peer-to-peer system is expected to include Dogecoin payments.



DOGE slides below $0.15 amid a market-wide drawdown on Friday.
Dogecoin’s future implementation into Elon Musk’s envisioned all-in-one X app comes a step closer to reality, as the social media giant has acquired three new licenses for money transmitter activities in the United States. Preparing the legal groundwork for X’s peer-to-peer (P2P) financial ecosystem, these money transmitter licenses include popular cryptocurrencies.Recently heralded by Musk as “the people’s crypto,” DOGE is a top contender to align with the X’s payment system. Dogecoin’s market value witnessed blitz pumps on several Elon Musk-related endeavors, with DOGE picking up 12% gains on XPayments account inception in January 2024.XPayments P2P: A Game Changer for DOGE?The latest three approved money transmitter licenses allow X Corp to handle cryptocurrency and other digital payments in New Mexico, Oregon, and Illinois on customers’ behalf. Before that, X Corp had successfully secured licenses in 19 other US states, now counting 22 out of 50 states with appropriate regulatory groundwork laid out for the forthcoming product by X.Following the positive news, the top dog coin embarked on a short rally to briefly reclaim $0.16 but slipped below this price range due to an all-around market correction. Losing 6% of the previous gains over the last 24-hour timeframe, DOGE is now exchanging hands at $0.1466, according to CoinGecko. Ultimately, Dogecoin’s inclusion on X could bring tangible utility for a cryptocurrency that started as a joke.On the Flipside
Earlier, X Corp struck a deal with eToro to make cryptocurrency purchases available on X via plugins and widgets provided by eToro’s exchange.



While Dogecoin’s inclusion in the P2P system is plausible due to Elon Musk’s sweet spot for DOGE, Twitter’s staff haven’t confirmed these plans yet.

                        SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor hardware crypto wallets, announced on March 21 that the recent compromise of its X (formerly Twitter) account resulted from a phishing scam and not a SIM-swap attack as earlier suspected.The hardware wallet also shared that only its X social media account was compromised and guaranteed the safety of all wallets for crypto transactions and storage.Trezor Confirms No Trezor Account or Funds Were Compromised
Cryptonews recently reported the breach of Trezor’s X account when popular blockchain and crypto security investigator ZachXBT alerted his 533K followers about the compromise of the hardware wallet page.Soon after, crypto security firm Scam Sniffer detected the suspicious activity and warned crypto traders to steer clear.According to SatoshiLab’s detailed report via Medium, the unauthorized access to their X account was identified at 11:53 PM on March 19, scaling past a series of security protocols, including two-factor authentication (2FA) and a strong password.Nevertheless, the hardware wallet producers stated that all compromises have been resolved, and accounts on its ecosystem were safe.“We want to stress here that the security of all our products remains unaffected,” SatoshiLabs said. “This incident has not impacted or compromised the security of Trezor hardware wallets or our other products. Your Trezor device and Trezor Suite remain safe.”It is worth noting that the hardware wallet’s X account was used to promote a $TRZR presale on the Solana blockchain network during the breach, to deceive traders into sending funds into a Solana wallet.The post also mentioned a new Solana memecoin named Slerf to attract more attention and directed crypto investors to click on a malicious link designed to connect to their wallets and wipe off all assets and funds stored. These posts were deleted shortly after.Popular Web3 security investigator John Holmquist said the hardware wallet breach was due to neglecting to implement two-factor authentication (2FA).This was off the mark, however, as SatoshiLab highlighted that its X account had 2FA and other security measures active. It is still unknown if there will be an impending investigation to identify the perpetrator(s).Trezor Asserts Phishing Attack Was in the Works for Weeks
SatoshiLab further stressed that the official X account breach was a complex and calculated phishing attack that had been in the works for weeks.The company’s investigation revealed that the plan kicked off on February 29, 2024. The bad actors created a faux entity in the crypto sector that convinced members of crypto communities of its high reputation.Although the entity’s name was left out in the report, it was noted that the bad actor participated in genuine crypto conversations to boost its media presence, grew their followership to thousands, and reached out to SatoshiLab’s PR team for an interview with the wallet firm’s CEO.This led to a meeting being set up and a malicious link being shared under the guise of a Calendly invitation. The firm’s PR team member clicked the link and was directed to a page asking for X login details, which raised red flags and halted initial plans for an interview and a suggested reschedule.During the rescheduled meeting, the attacker notified Trezor’s team members of technical issues and urged for a call authorization, which linked the attacker’s Calendly app with SatoshiLab’s X account.The breach then enabled the bad actors to promote fraudulent crypto and malicious links on behalf of the hardware wallet. This was what ZachXBT detected, which made him alert his followers.

LMAX Group CEO Forecasts Bullish Trend: Anticipates Crypto Prices To Surge, Citing Potential $6 Trillion Asset Class - Benzinga

One of the largest ways in which institutions interact with financial markets is through foreign exchange. LMAX Group provides electronic trading opportunities for institutions as well as cryptocurrency trading. CEO David Mercer discussed his views on the future of crypto on CNBC. Mercer said that Bitcoin reaching new highs is "inevitable" because of institutional investment, which outweighs selling pressures. He noted that about 900 Bitcoin are mined per day, which is worth between $60 million and $70 million, as opposed to inflows into the exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which reached nearly $700 million in a single day in early March. According to Mercer, this huge imbalance of supply and demand is driving the price of Bitcoin up.Don't Miss:Additionally, Mercer also discussed the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected in mid-April. This would lower the amount of Bitcoin mined per day by half to around 450, which could further decrease selling pressures and cause Bitcoin to continue going up. However, some, including Mercer, believe that this is already priced into the market. He also made a statement regarding the total size of the crypto market, saying that if "3% of the world's assets go to crypto, that would be a $6 trillion asset class." For reference, the entire crypto market is estimated to be worth around $2.5 trillion. "You should expect most crypto prices to go north from here, and I think that Ethereum and Solana will follow," Mercer said. Looking beyond crypto, Mercer sees tokenization as "the fourth or fifth industrial revolution" and he predicts that "the token economy will be $20 trillion by 2030." He thinks that tokenization is the true underlying benefit of crypto, and he sees Bitcoin as just a "signpost" and a "proof of concept" for tokenization to take off, "which we will be lucky to live through and enjoy." "Based purely on supply and demand … you should see the price of Bitcoin being multiples of what it is today," Mercer said. Though Mercer noted that he is not in the business of predicting, he is basing his idea of Bitcoin going up on the assumption that it will continue to be allocated into standard investment portfolios. This could happen sooner than some expected; the largest pension fund, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), recently submitted a request to explore the viability of incorporating Bitcoin into its investment strategy.  In terms of the potential for spot Ethereum ETFs, Mercer said that "Bitcoin is the store of value … the gold of the crypto market. Ethereum is the utility. The oil of the crypto market." He predicted that the Ethereum ETF would happen and be great for Ethereum and the decentralized economy. Mercer discussed nearly all of the pressing issues relating to crypto, bringing every point back to his bullish stance on the asset class. It will be interesting to see how his predictions play out, particularly his idea that crypto could reach a total market size of $6 trillion. Read Next:

This feature allows users to store their verification data, including images and metadata used for iris code generation, locally on their devices rather than on centralized Worldcoin servers.“Personal data custody, or Personal Custody, means that the information (images, metadata, and derived data) generated at the orb and used to generate the iris code during World ID verification is held on your device,” Worldcoin explained. The shift to personal custody also introduces new use cases. Users can leverage Face Authentication for high-security applications directly on their devices. According to Worldcoin, this approach eliminates data needing to leave the device.Does Worldcoin’s Personal Custody Keep Users Safe?While personal custody is a step in the right direction, there are still avenues through which malicious actors could exploit user data. For instance, If a malicious actor gains physical access to a user’s device, they could bypass security measures (like device encryption) to access the stored biometric data. Moreover, malicious software designed to infiltrate devices could be used to steal the encrypted biometric data. If the malware is sophisticated enough, it could intercept the data during its encryption or decryption process or exploit vulnerabilities in the device’s operating system.The security of personal custody also relies heavily on the encryption of data using public-private key pairs. If a malicious actor obtains the private key, they can decrypt the user’s data. In summary, while personal custody is a step in the right direction, it cannot protect users from all attacks. Data protection still relies both on the network and responsible use by the users. On The Flipside
According to the recent third-party audit commissioned by Worldcoin, the network has fixed its vulnerabilities. The audit came after a significant data breach on the network in April 2023. 



In March 2024, Kenya kept its ban on Worldcoin, despite pressure from the US government. The country cited privacy concerns in its decision. 
Why This MattersWorldcoin’s implementation of personal custody underscores the growing recognition of the importance of user control over personal data in the digital age. However, security challenges remain, even with the new system. Read more about Kenya’s Worldcoin ban: Kenya Reiterates Worldcoin Ban Despite U.S. Govt InterventionRead more about Solana’s major milestone in DeFi: How Solana Stacks Up With Ethereum in One DeFi Key Metric

Buy High, Sell Low: FOMO Made Crypto Trader Lose 6,039 SOL


                            Cryptocurrency traders constantly look for the next big project to yield significant profits. However, not all of their investments result in massive gains.
A recent report by Lookonchain revealed that a trader lost more than $1 million within three days.

When Buying High Doesn’t Result In Selling Higher
According to the blockchain research platform Lookonchain, a crypto trader lost 6,039 SOL over the last three days after FOMO-buying a memecoin. Per the report, the trader bought Slerf (SLERF) for 4,958 SOL, worth around $1 million.
The different transactions occurred when the price hovered between $0.8 and $1.4 on its launch day. A couple of hours later, the trader sold its SLERF tokens, losing 2,793 SOL after the token’s price plunged to the $0.4-$0.6 range, for a loss of $564,000.


Seemingly, the fear of missing out made the trader buy SLERF a second time when the price neared its all-time high (ATH) of $1.30. The address bought 3 million Slerf at $1.17, spending 19,133 SOL, worth around $3.152 million.
At the time, the pending question was whether the trader would profit from this second attempt or lose more money. As Lookonchain reported, the FOMO buyer sold all their SLERF tokens at a loss again, losing 6,039 SOL, worth $1.15 million.
The Slerf token, which has been all over the news for its dramatic launch, saw a significant price decrease of 52.39% from the ATH registered the day after launch. At writing time, SLERF is trading at $0.6351, an 18.4% decrease in the past 24 hours.


A second trader lost 3,731 SOL, worth $775,000, just one hour after buying 790,236 SLERF at its ATH price. The trader then doubled down on its bet and bought another 650,000 SLERF. Unluckily, the token’s price plummeted after both purchases.
Is The Crypto Presale Meta Hand In Hand With FOMO?
To paint an even bigger picture, another crypto trader lost money yesterday after buying a different ‘presale meta’ memecoin. Although the figures are more modest than the other two cases, this trader bought SMOLE and lost 371 SOL. Later, the address spent 2,549 SOL to buy SLERF.


SMOLE, despite only being out for one day, has already seen massive criticism and a 17.1% price drop. At writing time, the memecoin is changing hands at $0.0001499, a 70.39% decrease from its highest price of $0.0005086.
As this might suggest, FOMO seemingly drives memecoin traders’ decisions during this presale meta. The trend has seen hundreds of millions of dollars sent to memecoins, most of which report millions in losses for investors.


Despite experienced traders being able to profit from this trend, the current numbers hint at a considerable amount of traders losing massive figures while trying to catch the next memecoin to go “turbo parabolic,” even if it doesn’t have a long-term roadmap.

Layer-2 Builder Espresso Systems Raises $28,000,000 in Andreessen Horowitz-Led Funding Round - The Daily Hodl


								The blockchain infrastructure project Espresso Systems has raised $28 million in a Series B funding round led by investment giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).
Espresso aims to increase interoperability between Ethereum (ETH) rollups by building a marketplace where rollups can sell the right to build their blocks to bidders.









Rollups are solutions that execute transactions outside of Ethereum’s blockchain but record the transactional data.
Espresso notes that Polygon, Taiko, o1Labs, StarkWare, Offchain Labs and strategic investors from more than 30 ecosystem projects joined their recent Series B round. The project had already raised $32 million between a seed round in 2020 and an Early Stage VC round in 2022.
Says the company,
“This additional funding will help us continue product development, meaningfully invest in the broader rollup ecosystem, and set the stage for the community to ultimately operate and govern Espresso as a fully decentralized, credibly neutral public good for all L2s [layer 2s], from based rollups to validiums. We’ll be hiring aggressively to build out our team and expand our efforts.”
The two primary types of rollups are optimistic and ZK. Optimistic rollups automatically assume transactions are valid, while ZK rollups run computations off the chain and then submit a validity report.
Espresso notes that their marketplace enables proposers to bid on multiple rollup blocks to become shared proposers for multiple chains at the same time, facilitating cross-chain activity.

Will Shiba Inu Outperform Dogecoin In 2024 As The Top Meme Coin? | Bitcoinist.com


								As the crypto bull market rolls around once more, top meme coins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have started vying for the position of best performer once again. The year 2024, despite only being three months in, has already been incredibly interesting in this regard as both meme coins rally to new yearly highs.
Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Price Performance
Taking the year 2024 into account, it seems that Shiba Inu is finally winning the top meme coin battle against Dogecoin. A comparison of prices at the start of the year and now shows that Dogecoin has performed poorly compared to Shiba Inu.

To put this in perspective, the Shiba Inu price started out the year around $0.000009 and then surged more than 400% in March to $0.000044. The price has since retraced since this and returned to the $0.000027 level where it is currently trading now, still a more than 150% increase from where it started the year.
In comparison, the Dogecoin price started 2024 at around $0.08 and then rallied to $0.2 in March. This is less than a 300% increase in the same time period in comparison to SHIB. Then, just like SHIB, the DOGE price has retraced some of its gains and is now trading at $0.15, which is around a 100% increase from where it began the year.
However, when it comes to holding up during a downtrend, DOGE has proven to be the better performer. This is because while Shiba Inu has seen its price fall around 50% from its March highs, the DOGE price has only seen a 25% decline. This suggests that Shiba Inu is the much more volatile option, thus making it more likely to move up faster than Dogecoin. But it also means that the price of SHIB is more likely to crash rapidly compared to the more stable DOGE.
The Rivalry Between SHIB And DOGE
The rivalry between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin goes right back to the launch of SHIB in 2020. SHIB adopted the Shiba Inu dog which is the face of Dogecoin, and after the DOGE price rallied in 2021 due to billionaire Elon Musk’s influencer, SHIB’s position as the “Dogecoin killer” became more prominent.
This piggybacking of the already popular Shiba Inu dog breed made popular by DOGE, as well as a very clever marketing campaign of sending half the total supply to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who proceeded to burn the majority of it, propelled the SHIB price and brought it into the limelight.

Even now, this rivalry continues to wax stronger, with the Shiba Inu team threatening to dethrone Dogecoin as the leading meme coin. In an X post, the Shiba Inu team boasted that the end was close for Dogecoin. The post hinted at major updates coming for the SHIB ecosystem that will help to solidify its position as the leading meme coin.
Nevertheless, Dogecoin remains the leading meme coin for now with a market cap of $22.8 billion. This puts it ahead of Shiba Inu which is the second-largest meme coin with a market cap of $16 billion.

Cryptocurrency Investment Company, Taking Loss for the First Time, Moves All of Its Altcoins to Binance - Bitcoin Sistemi

DWF Labs, a well-known market maker in the cryptocurrency market, has reportedly deposited all BEAM altcoins to Binance.
DWF Labs moved all of its assets worth 130.8 million BEAM ($4.31 million) to the stock market at $0.03296.


Interestingly, just a week ago, on March 15, 2024, DWF Labs had withdrawn these BEAM tokens from Binance at an average price of $0.03631 ($4.75 million). If the firm's transfer transactions were indeed trades, the company would suffer an estimated loss of $439,000, a decline of 9.23%. This marks the first loss for DWF Labs following the market rally in February.

In other news, a supposed investor known as with the short address 0x6c0 continued to deposit MKR tokens to Binance. In the last deposit, 2,000 MKR ($6.52 million) was deposited to Binance at a price of $3,261 per token. Over the last three days, the wallet deposited a total of 5,500 MKR to Binance, for an average of $3,213 ($17.7 million) per token.





Between December 21, 2018 and December 6, 2023, the wallet purchased a total of MKR 7,496 ($9.63 million) from four unidentified wallets at an average price of $1,285. Three of these wallets redeemed their old MKR tokens for new ones through the “MakerDAO: Redeemer” contract, and the old MKR tokens were claimed from MakerDAO in 2016.

Orb Eye-Scanning Code Made Open Source by Worldcoin Foundation - Decrypt

Worldcoin Foundation, the organization behind the digital asset protocol developed by OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman, said on Friday that it is open-sourcing “core components” of its Orb technology. In a move meant to foster trust and collaborative development, Worldcoin says anyone can examine the code for its Orb eye scanners.“Open sourcing typically helps to foster trust, transparency and verifiability while also encouraging developer communities to further advance a technology,” a Worldcoin spokesperson told Decrypt. “This builds on the open sourcing of the iris code last late last year and opening up of the hardware nearly a year ago.”Worldcoin is a crypto project separate from OpenAI, intended to establish a global identification standard that proves "personhood" to combat bots. Altman and Alex Blania launched it in January 2023 as Tools for Humanity. In July, Worldcoin launched its WLD token on the Optimism mainnet.Worldcoin’s Orb scans the irises of users to provide a unique "fingerprint," the IrisCode, which is stored on Worldcoin's blockchain. This scan forms the basis of a WorldID linked to the user.Worldcoin has faced controversy over its eye-scanning technology, offering its WLD token in exchange for users letting the company scan their biometric data with the Orb. Security has been another concern, highlighted by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in a post."If even one Orb manufacturer is malicious or hacked, it can generate an unlimited number of fake iris scan hashes and give them World IDs," Buterin warned.The foundation said user privacy is a top priority.“Privacy and security have always been top priorities when building the Orb,” Worldcoin said in its announcement. “Further audits are underway and, combined with open sourcing, reflect the Foundation’s aim to maintain a continuously high level of transparency around privacy and security.”In February, blockchain-based esports platform Community Gaming said it would use Worldcoin’s WorldID to root out cheaters. Community Gaming clarified that the Worldcoin Orb is unnecessary for the company’s WorldID integration.Following the Orb news, Worldcoin's WLD cryptocurrency rose nearly 4% to $8.40—amid variability as large as 10% within the past 24 hours due to the wave of volatility currently hitting the broader cryptocurrency market.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Shiba Inu To The Moon: Crypto Analyst Predicts 300% Surge For SHIB | Bitcoinist.com


								Pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader Xanrox has predicted a significant price surge that could happen for Shiba Inu (SHIB) this year. The crypto trader also provided an opportunity for investors to profit from this move, as he stated an entry point for those interested in getting on the trade. 
Shiba Inu To See A 300% Gain Before Year-end
In a recent analysis, Xanrox expressed his bullishness on SHIB and stated that the “next profit target is 300% away.” He further asserted that the meme coin would “definitely go higher later this year” and that what was important was to catch the “bounce and ride the next wave to the upside.”

Looking at SHIB’s chart, the crypto analyst noted that the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement at 0.00002249 looks like a great level to invest in the crypto token. He added that an Elliot Wave technical analysis is also important for such big moves to get an idea of the full picture. That way, one can see the “full market structure and map of the uptrend.” 
Therefore, Xanrox suggested that investors wait for a bullish flag or pattern or simply set their limit order to buy SHIB lower. This bullish pattern seemed to form not long after as the crypto trader provided further updates in his analysis, noting that SHIB only had one resistance on the way, and that level was at its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845. 
As part of his update, Xanrox also mentioned an entry point for those looking to benefit from this move to the upside. He directed investors to load up their coins at 0.0000212995, suggesting that the 300% move would start from there.
Shiba Inu Could Hit New ATH By July
From the accompanying chart Xanrox shared, he hinted at SHIB rising to as high as $0.00008854 by July. That would see the meme coin set a new ATH with its current ATH at $0.00008845. SHIB’s rise to that price level might just be the beginning of its run in this market cycle, as other analysts have predicted that the meme coin could delete another zero.

One of these analysts is Javon Marks, who predicts that SHIB hitting the $0.000081 price range could set the stage for a further rise to $0.0001553. In the meantime, SHIB investors will have their eyes on crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s prediction that the meme coin could rise to $0.000052. 
At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002794, up over 3% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Are Ethereum Spot ETFs Coming? Grayscale Senior Executive Speaks Out - Bitcoin Sistemi


John Hoffman, Head of Distributor Partnerships at Grayscale Investments, discussed the emergence of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, their performance, and Grayscale's important role in the crypto market at a recent NYSE Floor Talk event with Judy Shaw.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a combination of two groundbreaking financial innovations, Bitcoin and ETFs. Hoffman highlighted how ETFs have revolutionized investing by simplifying and making it more accessible, while Bitcoin is the world's leading digital asset with a market capitalization exceeding one trillion dollars.


When asked about his recent performances, Hoffman described a promising trend. Despite a slight initial sell-off following GBTC's listing, Bitcoin's price rose from around $48,000 to over $70,000.
Discussing the recent Bitcoin rally, Hoffman attributed it to Bitcoin's base rarity of only 21 million in existence. He noted that the interplay of supply and demand dynamics is amplified by the new accessibility of Bitcoin investing to a wider range of investors globally.






Hoffman said that they are working on the ETHE product, which they want to turn into a spot ETF:

“Yes, at Grayscale we run the world's largest Ethereum fund, ticker is ETHE. This is not an ETF. However, we have filed 19 b4 to upgrade this to an ETF, similar to what we did with GBTC. So today we are working with regulators and having active discussions about the product. But it's still the world's largest Ethereum fund, and we've seen GBTC go. “This is definitely something we've been thinking about a lot and talking to our clients about their interest in this fund.”

Bitcoin eyes historic seventh consecutive month rally 1

Bitcoin is on the verge of achieving a significant milestone, potentially closing its seventh consecutive month in the green by the end of March. This would mark a historic achievement in BTC’s price history, requiring the cryptocurrency to maintain a price above February’s close of $61,130, according to data from Tradingview.Bitcoin eyes new record as its price holds steady The last time BTC experienced such a sustained uptrend was from October 2020 to March 2021, during which its price surged by an impressive 445% from $10,781 to $58,783. However, following this remarkable rally, BTC underwent a notable correction, declining by 40% over the subsequent three months, dropping from $58,790 to $35,037.Historically, BTC has often faced corrections in the period leading up to halving events. Nevertheless, the current influx of funds from spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could potentially fuel further price increases in the near future. Matthijs de Vries, the founder of AllianceBlock, expressed optimism about this development, mentioning that the constant inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs could serve as a significant catalyst for price growth in the coming days.Moreover, with the BTC halving cycle approaching, bullish sentiment is expected to strengthen further. De Vries also offered a price projection, envisioning Bitcoin settling at $74,000 by the end of Q1. However, recent market movements have seen Bitcoin’s price dip by 6.1% over the past week, with the cryptocurrency currently trading at $64,177 as of 4:30 pm UTC.Market dynamics and price projectionsDespite this short-term decline, BTC has still recorded an impressive 25% gain on the monthly chart. Analyzing historical chart patterns, crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin remains within the “Danger Zone,” a zone typically associated with pre-halving retracements. This suggests that there is a possibility of downside movement in the coming weeks until the halving event.Despite some larger sell-offs by spot Bitcoin ETFs, there are signs of investors “buying the dip.” Bitcoin analyst and CMCC Crest’s managing partner, Willy Woo, highlighted this trend, noting that while ETFs experienced outflows of $1.6 billion during the first dip, the Bitcoin network received net flows totaling $1.1 billion. This indicates that many investors are opting for self-custody solutions and leveraging price dips to accumulate more BTC.BTC’s current price trajectory and market dynamics present a mix of short-term volatility and long-term optimism. Factors such as ETF inflows, halving cycles, and investor sentiment continue to play crucial roles in shaping BTC’s price movements. The coming weeks leading up to the halving event will likely be closely monitored by market participants for further insights into Bitcoin’s resilience and potential for sustained growth.

$167,911,000,000 Added To US National Debt in 20 Days As Citadel CEO Warns Government Spending at 'Borderline Insanity' - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of a $60 billion hedge fund says Americans should be alarmed about the country’s rapidly expanding debt.
New numbers from the Treasury Department show the national debt climbed from $34.393262 trillion on March 1st to $34.561173 trillion on March 20th, a rise of $167.911 billion in just 20 days.










At this point, the rapid pace of the country’s debt accumulation poses a major risk to America’s fiscal future, according to Citadel CEO Ken Griffin.
In a new CNBC interview at the International Futures Industry conference in Florida, Griffin says the lack of daily dialogue about the growing national debt is allowing the government to borrow at a rate that’s irrational and dangerous.
Griffin says no outside entity can or will save the United States from a debt crisis.
“I think the biggest issue that’s not priced in the markets right now is the sovereign risk of US credit… It’s not AAA anymore, I wish it were AAA.
I think it’s just not part of the day-in and day-out dialogue, and that allows Washington to continue to spend at levels that are borderline insanity at this point in the economic cycle.
We’re talking about a budget next year of $7 trillion. Spending is up about 20% in two years. This is just out of control, and unfortunately when your sovereign markets start to put the hammer down in terms of discipline, that could be pretty brutal. There’s no country that’s going to bail America out. We’re going to right our own ship. There’s no IMF for the United States of America.”

RNDR or TAO: Which AI token should interest you today? - AMBCrypto



Demand for open-source AI grew materially in the last few days.
Render and Bittensor may stand to benefit from the same.

Render [RNDR] and Bittensor [TAO] witnessed a massive surge in interest over the last few months due to the growing popularity of AI. However, recently, the hype around the token has died down.
Even though the momentum around AI tokens isn’t the same as it was a few weeks ago, there are other factors that can contribute to RNDR and TAO’s growth in the long term.
Open source AI is the future?
According to new research data, AI users wanted an open-source approach for the creation of AI-related technology.

Apart from this research, major internet figures have also called for the open-sourcing of AI technology. Recently, Elon Musk announced that Grok, X’s LLM tool, had been open-sourced for the public. These factors have shifted the sentiment positively toward open-source AI technologies.
Both Render and Bittensor are open-source technologies in the AI sector that use the decentralized principles embedded in the crypto ethos. As the demand for open-source AI tools grows, so can the interest in both these technologies and subsequently, the interest in their tokens.
However, investment in AI tokens may be a long-term play, as their current price movement wasn’t showing a positive picture.
High correlation
At press time, RNDR was trading at $11.06 and its price had declined by 0.28% in the last 24 hours. In the last few weeks, the price of RNDR had exhibited multiple lower lows and lower highs indicating a bearish trend.
The CMF had also declined to -0.03. A declining Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) suggests that the buying pressure is weakening relative to selling pressure.
It may take significant bullish momentum to reverse the price movement of RNDR and bring it back to $13 levels.

The price of TAO exhibited similar movements in terms of price and also showcased a bearish trend in the last few weeks. Coupled with that, the RSI of TAO had plummeted indicating that there was no bullish momentum behind this token.
The price movement of both TAO and RNDR showed extreme co-relation which is very common for tokens in the AI sector and they may show similar price movement going forward as well.

Bitcoin traders anticipate price drop below $50,000, options data show - Crypto Briefing




Bitcoin traders are preparing for a potential extended decline in the token’s price, with options data suggesting a bearish outlook in the near term, according to crypto options exchange Deribit.The volume of Bitcoin put options expiring on March 29 has exceeded call options in the past 24 hours. This shift in the put-to-call ratio, a key indicator of market sentiment, signals that traders are bracing for a potential drop in Bitcoin’s price. The strike prices of these put options are clustered around $50,000 and $45,000 on the platform, while Bitcoin traded at around $63,500 on Friday.David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX, attributed the market correction to heavy outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).“Spot ETF net inflows data as of yesterday showed the second four-day streak of outflows since these products launched on January 11,” Lawant told Bloomberg.The pullback in Bitcoin’s price contrasts with the recent rally in the stock market, where traders are more optimistic about the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year. Bitcoin has dropped over 10% from its all-time high, marking one of the largest retreats this year, as the group of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs is on track to post the biggest outflow since their launch. Over $218 million in bullish bets were liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass.Chris Newhouse, a DeFi analyst at Cumberland Labs, told Bloomberg that while digital assets initially reacted positively to macro tailwinds surrounding the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, a weakening correlation to equities, driven by product-specific outflows and liquidations, seems to have driven Bitcoin and Ethereum lower.The funding rates for perpetual futures, which indicate the level of leverage in crypto trading, remain relatively low after recent bouts of liquidations. This suggests that the current drop in Bitcoin’s price may not be as sharp as previous pullbacks. However, the high level of leverage in long positions accelerated the slump in Bitcoin on Monday, with over $582 million in long liquidations and a total liquidation of over $738 million.Despite the current bearish sentiment in the options market and the recent price decline, some analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. According to a recent report by Bernstein, Bitcoin could be poised for significant gains by the end of the year, with a price target of $90,000.The analysts also view Bitcoin miners as attractive investments for equity investors, citing factors such as the new Bitcoin bull cycle and strong exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows.

This Blockchain Game Was Exploited for $4.6 Million Right Before its Launch


																Super Sushi Samurai, a blockchain game native to layer-2 solution Blast, was exploited hours before its much-anticipated gaming product was launched.
The exploit, reportedly orchestrated by a white hat hacker, has resulted in a loss of $4.6 million due to a bug in its smart contract code.
Smart Contract Bug Exploited
According to an announcement from the Super Sushi Samurai team, the exploit was due to a bug in the smart contract code, allowing an unauthorized party to initiate an infinite mint function. This resulted in the creation of an excessive number of tokens that were subsequently sold into the liquidity pool.


CertiK, an on-chain security firm, confirmed the extent of the exploit, stating that $4.6 million worth of tokens were affected. According to CoinGecko data, the exploit led to a 99% token value slippage following an unauthorized token dump. The attacker managed to get 1310 ETH from the token’s main liquidity pool by exploiting the smart contract vulnerability.




Investigations into the incident revealed that an unauthorized party acquired 690 million SSS tokens and initiated a series of transactions through an attack contract designed for this purpose.


Exploiting a vulnerability within the platform’s update function, the attacker duplicated the tokens in their possession 25 times, inflating the quantity to 11.5 trillion, which was then exchanged for approximately 1,310 ETH.
Recovery Efforts
Following the breach, Super Sushi Samurai has actively engaged with its community, providing updates and assurances through its official Telegram channel and other social media platforms.
In an X post, they revealed that the exploit was conducted by a white hat hacker who is currently in communication with their team. The hacker’s message, visible on Blastscan, indicated that it was a rescue mission and plans to reimburse affected users were underway.
They have also disclosed the address containing the compromised funds to facilitate tracking and potential recovery of the lost assets and that they are working with the white hat hacker to ensure the safe return of funds.


Meanwhile, a “post-mortem” update from Super Sushi Samurai outlines the extent of the damage, with negotiations ongoing to reach a resolution that safeguards both users and the white hat hacker involved in the incident.

SUI Surges 28% in 7 Days Despite Slowing TVL Growth - DailyCoin


        
SUI has continued to mount steady gains.



The token’s price performance aligns with the broader market momentum.



Sui has lost its position among the top 10  TVL.
Over the past months, SUI, the native token of the smart contract platform and Layer-1 blockchain solution Sui, has had an impressive run, doubling its year-start trading price and recording new milestones. However, like many, the broader industry volatility has tested the token’s resilience, triggering price fluctuations.   Despite this, SUI has continued to notch gains, experiencing an impressive uptick over the past week.SUI Price Inches Up According to the trading price of SUI on Friday, March 22, the token has shed most of its gains over the past 24 hours. At press time, it was worth $1.79, down approximately 8.9% from its day-high price of $1.902.However, despite its decline, SUI’s current trading price brings its total gains over the past seven days to a healthy 23%, which marks its position as one of the impressive gainers of the week.SUI’s price also marks an approximate 143% increase from its year-start trading range of $0.70 to $0.8, highlighting its bullish momentum and fueling optimism for the token’s potential to regain its all-time trading price of $2.16. The volatility in native token price is not isolated. It coincides with the sluggish trend of the blockchain’s TVL, which experienced an impressive uptick earlier in the year.Sui’s TVL Slows Down, Loses TOP 10 SpotPer the decentralized finance analytics platform DefiLlama today, Sui holds the 12th position among chains by Total Value Locked (TVL).While its present $626 million value represents a 213% increase from its year-start value of $200 million, it underscores a slowing momentum from its previous growth peak, which secured its 9th position on the chart in February 2024.Now surpassing Sui are layer-2 chains Optimism and Base, now holding the 9th and 10th positions with $946 million and $785 million locked, respectively.Find out more about SUI’s performance during the Bitcoin-led rally:SUI Struggles to Reclaim ATH as It Relinquishes Rally GainsTo discover the latest updates in the FTX customers’ claims against Silvergate, read here:What Judge’s Silvergate FTX Fraud Ruling Means in Its Case

Bitcoin Halving to Test Mining Efficiency, Executives Warn

As the Bitcoin halving approaches, industry executives anticipate significant challenges for smaller and less efficient miners, while well-established players are poised to weather the storm with operational efficiency and capital access.Impact on profitability and network feesIn less than a month, Bitcoin miners will experience a reduction in block rewards, expected to substantially dent profitability and income. This looming reality has prompted major mining firms to prepare for the impending halving, which is set to test the resilience of various players in the market.According to Adam Swick, Chief Growth Officer at Marathon Digital, the halving will serve as a litmus test, separating the efficient and well-funded mining entities from the rest. Larger firms with robust operational structures and ample access to capital are expected to navigate the reduced rewards more effectively. However, Swick warns that smaller operations operating on thin profit margins may struggle to survive the halving.Michael Bennet, co-founder of OceanBit, underscores the importance of strategic planning and operational efficiency in the post-halving landscape. Miners burdened with debt and maturing securities are likely to opportunistically sell their holdings to alleviate financial pressure, particularly as competition intensifies and operational efficiency becomes paramount.Historical precedent and adaptationGreg Beard, CEO of Stronghold Digital Mining, points to historical precedent, noting that previous halving events have compelled mining companies to adapt to lower-margin environments. With profitability margins shrinking, miners are expected to adjust their strategies to remain viable in the evolving market.In the face of diminishing rewards, miners must explore avenues to maintain profitability. This may involve strategic selling of Bitcoin holdings or optimizing operational processes to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.Capital structure and debt managementThe significance of sound capital structure and debt management cannot be overstated in the post-halving era. Miners burdened with excessive debt may be disadvantaged, particularly as competition heightens and profit margins shrink.As the Bitcoin halving looms, mining executives emphasize the importance of adaptability and strategic planning. While the event may pose challenges for some miners, it also presents opportunities for those able to innovate and optimize their operations.The Bitcoin halving is poised to test the resilience of miners, with efficiency and access to capital emerging as key determinants of success. As the industry braces for reduced profitability and increased competition, strategic planning, and operational efficiency will be essential for navigating the post-halving landscape. By leveraging historical insights and adapting to changing market conditions, miners can position themselves to thrive in the evolving Bitcoin ecosystem.

New Bitcoin Price Explanations from Billionaire Cathie Wood: "It Could Easily Pass $3.5 Million" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood reiterated her bullish stance on Bitcoin, calling it a “financial superhighway” in her speech at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York today.
Wood, whose company recently became one of the issuers of the spot Bitcoin ETF ARKB, said there are important uses for BTC in emerging markets. He noted that Ark Invest focuses on these markets and the global macro environment, which has been “shocked” by the US Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.


“There are signals that all is not well in the world,” Wood said, referring to countries like Nigeria, which has been one of the biggest adopters of Bitcoin due to the strong depreciation of their currencies. As a result, Wood sees Bitcoin as both a risk-off and risk-prone asset.

Ark's spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, has become one of the most successful Bitcoin ETFs among the ten funds launched in January. Wood believes Bitcoin's price could easily rise above $3.5 million as more institutions enter the space. However, he refrained from giving a new specific price target.





“Bitcoin has a long way to go,” said Wood, pointing to his previous $1.5 million price target call.

What Judge's Silvergate FTX Fraud Ruling Means in Its Case - DailyCoin


        
The FTX-Silvergate Bank lawsuit will proceed as the court validates investor claims.



A judge has rejected Silvergate Bank’s motion to dismiss.



The sentencing hearing for the convicted FTX founder is fast approaching.
As one of the largest financial fallouts in crypto history, the 2022 FTX collapse resulted in a flurry of legal actions, roping in major institutions and venture firms. In February 2023, a group of FTX investors filed a class action lawsuit against Silvergate, alleging the bank’s involvement in the multi-billion dollar fraud scheme orchestrated by Sam Bankman-Fried.Over a year later, the legal tussle has recently gained momentum as a federal court in San Diego has validated the investors’ claims.FTX-Silvergate Ties Lawsuit ProgressesAccording to a Tuesday filing, US Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro has ordered the advancement of the class-action lawsuit against Silvergate Bank, its parent company Silvergate Capital Corporation, and CEO Alan Lane, which alleged that the defendants hid “the true nature of FTX” from its customers.“This follows the rejection of the bank’s motion to dismiss, filed on June 19, 2023. While Silvergate argued that the bank “conducted significant due diligence on FTX and its related entities, including Alameda,” the court asserted otherwise, emphasizing that Silvergate neglected its “duty of care” to customers.“It was foreseeable that allowing FTX customer funds to be deposited into non-FTX accounts would lead to fraud and harm the owners of those funds,” the filing stated.Judge Bermudez Montenegro endorsed the plaintiff’s claim that Silvergate benefited from the FTX and Alameda’s fraudulent operations, evidenced by the staggering 889% increase in its annual net income.“Before Silvergate went public on November 7, 2019, and before Silvergate attracted FTX as a client, Silvergate had an annual net income of only $7.6 million. By 2021, Silvergate’s annual net income had increased to $75.5 million,” it stated, asserting that  the bank had a strong incentive to conceal the fraud.The judge emphasized that the plaintiffs adequately alleged that the defendants aided and abetted the FTX and Alameda fraud, advancing the case to further scrutinize Silvergate’s involvement in the activities. This coincides with the looming sentencing of FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was also convicted of fraud.SBF on His Way to JailThe upcoming sentencing of SBF has thrust the disgraced crypto mogul under renewed spotlight as questions of his fate linger amid an escalating legal tussle between his lawyers and United States prosecutors.In a sentencing memorandum filed on March 13, prosecutors stated that SBF deserves no less than 40 to 50 hears bend bars. They highlighted his lengthy list of offenses, including wire and securities fraud, money laundering conspiracy, and illegal campaign contributions.Bankman Fried’s legal team however opposed, criticizing the 50 years sentencing proposal as exceeding the judgment necessary to satisfy the goals of his punishment. The legal team emphasized the recommendation does not align with the principles of justice, and is equivalent to “a death-in-prison” sentencing recommendation.SBF is incarcerated in the New York Metropolitan Detention Center, awaiting a sentencing hearing scheduled for March 28, 2024.On the Flipside
While Silvergate announced plans to wind down its operations and liquidate following the FTX collapse, the bank remains liable for its actions and ensuing legal consequences.



Other firms, including  Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo, and Paradigm, were also targets of lawsuits following the FTX fallout.



FTX remains indebted to an extensive list of creditors, with over $8 billion in liabilities.
Why This MattersThe ongoing tussle between FTX’s customers and Silvergate highlights the enduring aftermath of the exchange’s implosion, even years later. Additionally, the judge’s validation of the investors’ claims confirms the questionable relationship between Silvergate and FTX, which has significant implications for the bank’s reputation.Read more on the efforts to bag SBF little to no time behind bars:“SBF Is Selfless”: Lawyers Seek Shorter Term with Image Shift Here’s how Bitget is championing advocacy for gender balance in the industry:Bitget’s Gracy Chen Joins UN to Promote Gender Equality

FTX to offload $1B Anthropic stake to pay off bankruptcy debts within weeks - report

Defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX will soon offload its stake in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic worth around $1 billion as part of a deal to pay off its bankruptcy debts, according to a report from CNBC on March 22. Anthropic is currently considering a slate of investors to purchase the stake, per the article, with a deal expected to occur in a time period of “within a couple of weeks.” The report cites sources familiar with the matter who’ve asked to remain anonymous due to the ongoing nature of the financial negotiations. The shares are being shopped through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), according to CNBC’s sources. This is likely due to the fact that FTX is bankrupt, as SPVs are essentially separate corporate legal entities that exist to ensure a parent company can meet its legal obligations in the event of insolvency. Related: US government asks for court approval to sell private jets tied to Sam Bankman-FriedCNBC’s sources also claim that Saudi Arabia has been locked out of contention over alleged national security concerns, however the article doesn’t specify whether this refers only to state investors or if individual or corporate investors from Saudi Arabia or citizens operating companies in foreign territories will be similarly barred. This, despite the fact that the shares are considered “Class B” non-voting shares. As Cointelegraph reported back in February, Delaware Bankruptcy Court Judge John Dorsey ruled in a Feb. 22 hearing that FTX could sell its shares in Anthropic. At the time of the stock purchase, in April of 2022, FTX bought about $530 million in Anthropic shares. But those shares have since nearly doubled in value amid the generative AI boom and are currently estimated to be worth around $1 billion. This news comes just under a week before FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing hearing is scheduled on March 28. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven fraud counts in November 2023. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams described Bankman-Fried’s crimes as among the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history and “a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the king of crypto.”

Apple Macs Have a Fatal Flaw That Lets Hackers Steal Your Crypto-And There's No Fix - Decrypt

Hackers have a new way to try and steal your crypto—and if you're using an Apple device made in the last half decade, there's not much you can do to mitigate the attack.Security researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Apple's latest computer chips—its M1, M2, and M3 series, which powers all of its latest devices—that could let hackers steal cryptographic keys designed to protect data from disclosure. That includes the keys to software crypto wallets installed on vulnerable Apple devices.The likely target for a malicious exploit would be “high-end users, like someone who has a cryptocurrency wallet with a lot of money,” Matthew Green, a cryptographer and computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University, told author and journalist Kim Zetter. While not a “practical” attack, it could be aimed at web browser encryption—which would affect browser-based applications like MetaMask, iCloud backups, or email accounts.The potential hack has been dubbed the “GoFetch exploit” in an eponymous report released by a team of scientists from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), University of Texas, Austin, Georgia Tech, UC Berkeley, University of Washington, and Carnegie Mellon University. It works by gaining access to the computer's CPU cache through Data Memory-Dependent Prefetchers (DMPs) built into the chips.“In a cache side-channel attack, an attacker infers a victim program’s secret by observing the side effects of the victim program’s secret-dependent accesses to the processor cache,” the researchers said, adding that the experiment was validated using the Apple M1’s 4 Firestorm (performance) cores. “We assume that the attacker and the victim do not share memory, but that the attacker can monitor any microarchitectural side channels available to it, e.g., cache latency.”Today's disclosure is different from the so-called “Augury” pre-fetchers exploit announced in 2022, although it involves a similar mechanism.The researchers said they notified Apple of their findings on December 5, 2023, and that more than 100 days had elapsed prior to the public release of the research paper and accompanying website.In an email, an Apple spokesperson told Decrypt that the company is grateful for the collaborative efforts of researchers and highlighted the significant impact of their work in advancing understanding of specific security threats.While they did not comment further, the Apple spokesperson pointed Decrypt to a developer post by Apple that shows how to mitigate the attack. The recommended workaround could slow down application performance, because it would mean assuming “worst-case” processing speeds to avoid invoking the cache. Further, changes would need to be made by creators of MacOS software, not users.Despite its published post, Apple's response fell short, Zetter says.“Apple added a fix for this in its M3 chips released in [October],” Zetter tweeted, "but developers were not told about the fix in [October] so they could enable it. Apple added an instruction to its developer site on how to enable the fix only yesterday.”For crypto users, that means it's up to wallet makers like MetaMask and Phantom to implement a patch to protect against the exploit. It's unclear if either company has yet made those efforts and representatives for MetaMask and Phantom did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.For now, if you have a crypto wallet installed on a vulnerable Apple device, all you can do is remove the wallet from the device to play it safe. (If you're on an older Apple device with, say, an Intel chip, you're in the clear.)Apple users have long considered themselves safe from malware attacks because of the way MacOS and iOS devices are designed. Nonetheless, a separate report in January, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky sounded the alarm on “unusual creativity” in building malware targeting both Intel and Apple Silicon devices.Kaspersky said the Apple malware targeted Exodus wallet users, attempting to get them to download a fake, malicious version of the software.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

'Real-World' Crypto Asset Project Surges 69% in One Week Amid Rollout of New Blockchain - The Daily Hodl


								The native token of a crypto project focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has surged 69% in the past week amid the rollout of a new private blockchain.
Polymesh (POLYX) is a public blockchain purpose-built for RWA tokenization. The project’s native token, POLYX, is trading at $0.415 at time of writing, up from $0.245 one week ago.










The 192nd-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up 7% in the past 24 hours.
On Monday, the project announced the launch of Polymesh Private, a confidential version of the network’s public permissioned blockchain. Polymesh notes that companies can use the new private permissioned network and then migrate to the public network when ready.
Graeme Moore, head of tokenization at the Polymesh Association, says the new private blockchain will offer “seamless public migration.”
“The vast majority of RWA tokenization by banks and large financial institutions is still taking place on private blockchains. Polymesh Private will meet these players where they are while providing a future-proof tech stack.”
After its gains this week, POLYX is only 16% down from its all-time high of $0.494, which it set back in October 2022.
The token is used for staking, governance and transaction payments on the network.

DEX Screener To Review Moderation Policy Amid Flurry of Racist Memecoins - The Defiant

The platform ensured it won’t be a gatekeeper, but that it’s also not here to spread hate.A proliferation of racist tokens has pushed DEX Screener, a real-time DeFi token analytics platform, to review its token profile moderation policy.“We'll be reviewing our token profile moderation policy in the coming days,” said the platform’s X account, adding that it, “won't be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we're definitely not here to spread hate.”The announcement, made late Friday, March 22, came as a number of unsavory token profiles began popping up on the platform–most of which are surfacing on Solana.Some of these include derogatory terms and symbols based on race and religion, as well as other hateful language.Permissionless for Good or Bad Racist memecoins highlight an odd situation in the cryptocurrency space. For one, it shows an ugly underbelly in the ecosystem, with people interested in creating and purchasing these types of tokens.Meanwhile it also shows the permissionless nature of open blockchains, and the fact the technology enables the freedom to create anything a developer or user wants–for good or bad.Memecoins have taken the cryptocurrency ecosystem by storm in recent months. Some, like DogWifHat and Book of Meme, have climbed the market cap ladder extremely quickly. The former trades for $2.21 with a $2.2 billion market cap, whereas BOME–which reached a $600 million market day in less than two days–now sits at $800 million, trading for $0.01.

Racist Solana Memecoins: Freedom Isn't a Free-for-All - DailyCoin


        
The Solana blockchain is booming with activity.



Some users are launching racist memecoins.



Rumors of psyop and sabotage swirl.
Solana’s network growth has exploded since the market flipped bullish in Q4 2023, culminating in more than 20,000 new coins being created daily. This frenetic pace of innovation has democratized access to blockchain assets like never before. While this effect has birthed smash hit projects like Dogwifhat and BOME, it has also taken a darker twist with the proliferation of bigoted memecoins recently.Bigoted memecoins, such as slur-laden coin tickers and stereotyped imagery, are flooding Solana DEXs, highlighting the double-edged sword of decentralization principles like censorship resistance and permissionlessness. Yet, at the same time, racist memecoins should not be tolerated. Is Solana Racist Now?Trying to understand the rise of racist Solana memecoins, X user @trading_axe wondered whether these tokens align with Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of total freedom prescribed under a truly decentralized system. He argued that the internet has become overly “serious” and lacking “flavor” compared to the early internet, an issue compounded by the “woke agenda.” In @trading_axe’s view, the trend represents a backlash against the absurdity of wokeism and a cry for the return to pre-Google days. While doubting the likelihood of a bigoted token gaining serious traction, @trading_axe contended that their existence demonstrated a willingness to “burn money” to make a provocative point. However, regardless of how racist memecoins are rationalized, there is no getting away from the bad optics foisted on Solana as a result. Recognizing this, “Ethereum Damien” considered whether this trend was a deliberate ploy by Base supporters to damage Solana’s reputation through offensive content. As far-fetched as that seems, this sentiment was echoed by NameGames, who warned concerned Solana holders not to get taken in by the deception. “941” argued that while presenting a poor look, racist tokens emerged on Ethereum in 2017 before its massive rally, stating, “Let nothing shake uw out” from Solana.Although it’s too early to determine where the Solana community goes from here, as demonstrated by the Pepe backlash in 2023, cryptocurrency communities wield the power to shape narratives around ethical transgressions.Freedom of ExpressionThe 2023 Pepe incident, in which Coinbase was forced to retract and apologize for associating the meme with far-right groups, showcased cryptocurrency communities’ power. Despite its creator’s intentions, Pepe was increasingly co-opted by racist online subcultures. However, Coinbase’s attempt to document this faced fierce backlash, with #deletecoinbase trending as users defended Pepe’s broader harmless usage.While Pepe’s creator could not stop fringe groups from adopting the imagery to spread hate, Solana’s racist memecoins represent a deliberate attempt to shock and stir bigotry from inception. This disturbing development was perhaps inevitable after anonymous individuals launched provocative memecoins overtly mocking reviled industry figures like Gary Gensler and Elizabeth Warren.Whether regarded as an offensive social statement or pure profit-seeking, the proliferation of bigoted tokens undermines blockchain’s credibility. It gives no-coiners yet another excuse not to get on board.On the Flipside
Memecoins generally lack fundamentals, making them a high-risk trade.



This dynamic is magnified by racist memecoins, which are highly likely to be pump-and-dumps or rug pulls in the making.



Some racist memecoins have exploded in price.
Why This MattersRacist Solana memecoins lay bare the paradoxical relationship between decentralized technologies and societal norms. Blockchain offers a neutral base pliable to anyone who chooses to build on the tech, whether to solve real-world financial problems or express bigoted ideologies. This underscores that true decentralization comes at a price.Find out more on Solana memecoins post significant losses amid the wider market downturn:Solana Memecoins Drop Across the Board: Is the Party Over?Kyle Davis holds firm in refusing to apologize despite media backlash.

As Bitcoin’s Consolidation Continues, Crypto Analyst Compares BTC’s Movements to Previous Cycles - The Daily Hodl


								With Bitcoin (BTC) falling nearly 7% in the last week, one widely followed crypto analyst believes the correction is all part of the process.
Digital assets trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 705,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC’s downward trend may be a result of a pre-halving peak.










“The consolidation on Bitcoin continues. 
I don’t think we’ll see much spectacle coming from Bitcoin; if we do, it will need to break $70,300.
Above, there is time for new all-time highs, but I suspect we’re still seeing the case of peaking pre-halving. 
Just like any other cycle.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
The BTC halving refers to the quadrennial event when Bitcoin’s mining rewards are cut in half. The next halving is expected next month.
According to the analyst, BTC’s current price chart is similar to the 2016-2017 cycle chart.
“In some way, the price action of Bitcoin is comparable to the 2016-2017 cycle.
Peak four weeks before the halving takes place.
Consolidation and another correction, after which a slow upward grind happens until acceleration 6 months later.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Van de Poppe also claims that BTC’s correction only strengthens his bullish thesis.
“Bitcoin still correcting down. 
My main thesis is that we’ve seen the pre-halving hype and that we’re going to have a long, massive bull market.
Anything in the lower boundaries -> buy opportunity.
Interested in buying dips on altcoins too.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
BTC is worth $63,873 at time of writing, down 4% in the last 24 hours.

Montenegrin authorities to release Do Kwon as he awaits extradition: Report

Authorities in Montenegro will reportedly release Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon as local courts decide on his fate over extradition to the United States or South Korea.According to a March 22 report from Montenegrin news outlet Vijesti, Kwon will be allowed to leave prison on March 23 after being held in custody for roughly a year but forced to surrender his travel documents to prevent him from leaving the country. The decision to release Kwon reportedly came from the Council of the Supreme Court, which is set to review a decision that could grant or deny extradition to his native South Korea.Source: VijestiKwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 for using falsified travel documents with his colleague, Terraform Labs’ former chief financial officer Han Chang-joon. Authorities from the U.S. and South Korea filed competing extradition requests to have Kwon face fraud charges in their respective countries, but no final decision has been made.If extradited to the United States, the Terraform Labs co-founder would likely face eight felony charges filed by prosecutors in March 2023. In South Korea, Kwon could face an indictment for fraud and violations of capital markets law. It’s unclear where he will ultimately be extradited, if at all, at the time of publication.Related: Prosecutors request Changpeng Zhao surrender all passports ahead of sentencingProsecutors purportedly plan to confiscate Kwon’s South Korean passport, which authorities applied to revoke in 2022 after the collapse of Terra. He reportedly used a forged Costa Rican passport in Montenegro — which Kwon claimed was authentic — leading to his 2023 arrest. Terraform Labs co-founder Shin Hyun-Seong, also known as Daniel Shin, and others associated with the platform face criminal charges for defrauding investors at trial. Shin stayed in South Korea after the collapse of Terra in May 2022, an event for which the platform faced regulatory scrutiny and contributed to a significant crypto market downturn.Magazine: Decentralized identity: Proving it’s really you in the 21st Century

Crypto market experiences general crash ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving 1

The crypto market witnessed a significant downturn on Friday, with major coins like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) experiencing notable price declines. Bitcoin, the leading digital asset by crypto market capitalization, dropped over 4% in the last 24 hours, reaching around $63,400, as reported by CoinGecko.The crypto market sees red ahead of BTC’s halvingThis decline comes after a series of all-time high price milestones, signaling potential volatility ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Investors are closely monitoring the Bitcoin halving event, speculating on whether the current prices adequately reflect its impact. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been associated with increased market volatility, prompting traders to adjust their positions accordingly.Global investment firm AllianceBernstein has expressed a bullish outlook on Bitcoin, predicting a price target of $90,000 by the end of 2024. This optimism is further fueled by the growing activity surrounding Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have contributed significantly to the daily spot market volume, according to Coinbase Asia-Pacific Managing Director John O’Loghlen.On the other hand, another crypto market favorite Ethereum experienced a nearly 6% decline, settling around $3,320. Investors are awaiting a decision from the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding spot Ethereum ETFs. While investment firms like BlackRock and Grayscale have submitted applications for Ethereum ETFs, concerns linger about a potential SEC classification of ETH as security.Digital assets decline amid regulatory concernsThe Ethereum Foundation’s disclosure of an investigation by an undisclosed “state authority” has added to regulatory uncertainties surrounding the cryptocurrency. Solana, amidst its recent surge in meme coin trading activity, faced a sharp 8% decline, dropping to approximately $171. The network has been grappling with congestion issues due to the demand for meme coins, leading to operational challenges.Notable Solana meme coins such as BONK, Dogwifhat (WIF), and Slerf (SLERF) also saw significant price drops in the crypto market. Despite the current crypto market fluctuations, investors remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, driven by factors such as institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and technological advancements.However, ongoing regulatory scrutiny and market dynamics continue to influence price movements and investor sentiment in the crypto space. The performance of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in the cryptocurrency market reflects the complex interplay of various factors. Market participants are closely watching key events such as the Bitcoin halving, regulatory decisions on ETFs, and investigations by regulatory agencies.These developments contribute to market volatility and shape investor confidence in the evolving landscape of digital assets. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, investors and stakeholders navigate through a dynamic environment, balancing opportunities with risks and regulatory compliance. The resilience and adaptability of cryptocurrencies to external factors will continue to shape their trajectory and influence investment strategies in the years to come.

BlackRock Customers Show No Interest in Ethereum ETF


Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, indicated a tepid interest from the firm’s client base in an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), starkly contrasting the growing demand for Bitcoin.
This revelation came during the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York, where Mitchnick shared insights into the company’s digital asset strategy and its reception among investors.
No Interest in Ethereum ETF
Despite the growing interest in various cryptocurrencies, BlackRock’s clientele exhibits a pronounced preference for Bitcoin, relegating Ethereum to the sidelines. Mitchnick’s comments reflect a critical assessment of the demand within the crypto market, suggesting that, aside from Bitcoin, the appetite for other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, remains tepid at best.

“I can say that for our client base, Bitcoin is overwhelmingly the number one focus and a little bit Ethereum,” Mitchnick said. 

BlackRock’s strategic moves in the cryptocurrency market have been closely watched. Especially, following the successful launch of its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) earlier this year. The fund’s rapid ascent to becoming one of the top five ETFs in the market, with an impressive $15 billion in assets, reflects a keen investor interest in Bitcoin. 

This contrasts sharply with the “very, very little” interest in the possibility of an Ethereum ETF.

Still, BlackRock’s journey into crypto has been fraught with enthusiasm and caution. For example, launching a $100-million money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain brought to light the unforeseen challenges of operating within the cryptocurrency market. BlackRock’s Ethereum wallet, intended for legitimate transactions, quickly became a magnet for an array of low-quality meme coins and NFTs.

This incident highlighted the legal and operational challenges that come with embracing blockchain technology, prompting a reevaluation of strategies for managing and securing digital assets.

Floki Inu Roadmap Reveals Plans For Regulated Bank Accounts, FLOKI Faces 17% Downtrend


                            The development team behind the dog-themed meme coin Floki Inu has unveiled its highly anticipated roadmap for 2024, revealing several upcoming features and utility-focused initiatives. 
Notable highlights include the launch of regulated digital banking accounts, integration with the Venus decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, the Floki debit card’s introduction, and the Valhalla mainnet’s upcoming release.
Floki Inu Aims To ‘Bank The Unbanked’
Floki Inu plans to introduce regulated digital banking accounts, enabling users to create and fund bank accounts using FLOKI tokens. 

In partnership with an unnamed licensed fintech company operating in key jurisdictions such as Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE, these accounts will support SWIFT payments and SEPA IBANs. 
In addition, the upcoming launch of Floki Debit Cards will allow users to link their digital bank accounts to debit cards, providing a convenient and secure way to spend their FLOKI tokens in traditional currencies such as Euro (EUR) and US dollars (USD). 
According to the proposal, the initiative aims to “bank the unbanked” by enabling a broader user base to access traditional banking services using their FLOKI tokens while increasing the utility and adoption of cryptocurrency.
Pending governance approval, Floki Inu also seeks to list its native token, FLOKI, on the Venus Core Pool. This integration aims to unlock deeper liquidity, comparable to established blue-chip cryptocurrencies and allow FLOKI holders to use their tokens as collateral to borrow various assets such as Maker (DAI), Circle’s USDC stablecoin, Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH). 
By integrating Venus Markets directly into Floki’s user interface (UI), the protocol states that users will have frictionless access to the liquidity provided by the platform, further integrating Floki into the decentralized finance ecosystem.
FLOKI-Powered Trading Bot And Valhalla Mainnet Launch
Floki Inu plans to introduce a cross-chain Telegram and Discord trading bot powered by the FLOKI token. This bot will allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on leading blockchain networks. Specifically, 50% of the fees generated will be used to buy and burn FLOKI tokens, increasing their utility and contributing to a deflationary mechanism. 
Finally, the highly anticipated mainnet release of Valhalla, Floki Inu’s flagship utility and metaverse game, will occur. Valhalla on the Mainnet will feature on-chain game mechanics, a PlayToEarn economy, upgradeable NFTs, and an open-world experience.

As of this writing, the FLOKI token has experienced a correction of over 17% in the past seven days, aligning with the overall market trend. This correction has resulted in the current trading price of $0.0002295 for the FLOKI token.
Despite the recent downtrend, it is worth noting that FLOKI has still achieved a remarkable year-to-date gain of 440%. This substantial increase in value has propelled the token’s market capitalization to $2 billion, solidifying its position at the 59th spot among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the market.

Axie Infinity's Biggest Guild Is Transforming Into a Protocol for ‘Pixels’ and Beyond - Decrypt

As co-founder Gabby Dizon tells it, Yield Guild Games always aimed to be much more than a guild. The vision was to help other groups of crypto gamers unite, collaborate, and thrive together. It just had to start somewhere.“The biggest problem of any platform starting out is that no one really cares about you, right?” he told Decrypt’s GG. “And for us, the way to reach that goal long-term was to be the biggest guild ourselves. And we were able to achieve that with Axie Infinity.”When Axie Infinity’s monster-battling, token-earning model became lucrative amid the crypto and NFT bull run of 2021, play-to-earn gaming suddenly looked like the future. Yield Guild Games was already proving an adjacent business model as the biggest operator of “scholarships,” or lending gaming NFTs to players and taking a cut of their in-game winnings.Investment from Andreessen Horowitz and other VC heavyweights followed, while infamous crypto exchange FTX even “sponsored” Axie players in the Philippines and elsewhere via Yield Guild. But that particular economic model didn’t stay viable for long, and no other crypto game approached Axie’s raging, albeit short-lived momentum.Yield Guild kept building during the brutal bear market, investing in assets for various games, developing infrastructure to support regional sub-DAO organizations, and making plans for a hopeful wave of high-quality crypto games to come.Now those games are arriving, in the form of Pixels and Parallel and others, and Yield Guild Games is starting to showcase its next big evolution: from a guild into a guild protocol.What does that mean? Effectively, Yield Guild wants to be the infrastructure layer to enable all guilds to exist and thrive—both on-chain and in games. Think tokenized credentials and tooling to manage assets and roles, and deep integrations into blockchain games so that players can not only carry those structures into game worlds, but also quest and be rewarded together.“Think about it as the guild system of World of Warcraft pulled out and put on chain,” Dizon said.We’re just now seeing the first real example of that concept in Pixels. It’s the biggest crypto game of the moment, and Yield Guild is once again in a key position to not only benefit from that position but to help others benefit as well.And Gabby Dizon himself is right there to help you out in Pixels. Yield Guild is the official guild partner of Pixels, the blazing-hot social farming game on Ethereum scaling network Ronin—the very same network that powers Axie Infinity. And indeed, Dizon’s smiling, 16-bit visage is there to help you learn about the game’s guild system, which went live this week.Pixels’ guilds are designed to be a literal game-changer, with founder Luke Barwikowski recently telling Decrypt’s GG that he envisions such squads of on-chain gamers giving the game a more competitive edge and helping to disperse resources in the game world. Dizon also said that there will be large-scale quests that only guilds will be equipped to tackle.Every gaming guild today invariably has a Discord server, and some may have a main wallet for holding shared assets. But there’s no common tech stack for managing such groups, and while numerous blockchain games have guild integrations to some level, they can vary widely. Pixels' integration is substantial, and could be a sign of things to come in the industry.Dizon sees gaming guilds as the “small-to-medium enterprises of Web3”—and in his view, they desperately need proper infrastructure to scale.Yield Guild itself endured the Axie boom days of ad hoc guild and scholarship integrations and lived through the hype and crash of the early play-to-earn premise. With that experience under its belt, the firm now is building to help other guilds thrive via transparent, composable, and interoperable on-chain assets and tooling.Yield Guild Games has also amassed a trove of in-game NFT assets across various titles over the years, and Dizon thinks that can complement the protocol.Imagine staking varying amounts of YGG tokens to borrow NFTs, with the more valuable assets requiring a larger stake, thus representing both an investment in and commitment to the protocol. Dizon said that the protocol can also develop something of a “credit rating” for guilds over time, based on their likelihood to honor their revenue share and not bolt with the assets.Yield Guild already has features like quests and achievements launched for various games, but otherwise is currently in the process of building out its on-chain infrastructure. The on-chain guild format will include a multisig wallet for each guild, along with NFT badges and an allowlist that defines roles within the gaming organization. That should launch in Q2 2024.Alongside the integration in Pixels, Yield Guild has had a number of other recent moves, including strategic investment from LongHash Ventures. On Thursday, Yield Guild brought its YGG token to Ronin and held an airdrop to reward Ronin (RON) stakers using its network validator.As Yield Guild aims to develop the infrastructure to power the next generation of crypto gaming guilds, it’s also working closely with game studios to advise them and develop content to help new players learn and thrive. They’re demonstrating how guilds can support games—and fighting the idea that such organizations are purely there to earn and extract.“The narrative of scholarship in Axie Infinity was so strong that people would think, ‘Oh, these guys are just extracting value from the ecosystem,’” said Dizon. “But that often was not true from what I've seen with the guilds that we operate with, actually.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Can Aptos (APT) Price Rally 20% to All-time High Next?


Aptos (APT) price is treading against the broader market cues to consistently post gains on the daily chart.
The altcoin now stands less than 20% away from charting fresh all-time highs, provided APT does not lose this crucial support level.
Aptos Price Finds Support From the Market
Aptos price, trading at $16 at the time of writing, is continuing the bullish trend that began towards the end of February. Despite the prolonged rise in APT by over 80%, the growth remains unstopped and could stay this way.
The first sign of this potential comes from the Average Directional Index (ADX). This indicator measures the strength of a trend to provide a sense of the price’s direction. Values above the 25.0 threshold suggest the active trend is strong and could extend going forward.

This is the case of Aptos price as well, which, in addition to being in an uptrend, is noting strength to its uptrend. Furthermore, investors are likely going to go back to being bullish again as long-term liquidations are now declining.
Read More: An Ultimate Guide to Aptos Cryptocurrency (APT) and Its Network
Long contracts tend to liquidate when the price falls sharply and suddenly, inducing pessimism among investors. This prevents the altcoin from finding support for being bullish again. However, low volumes hint at the bearishness waning, leaving the altcoin open for bullish bets.

Aptos price could benefit from these bullish bets as they would drive the price higher.
APT Price Prediction: Next Stop – All-Time High?
Aptos price is less than 20% away from the all-time high of $19.92. This is the present ceiling reached by APT back in January 2023. Breaching through this barrier would mean that not only has the cryptocurrency formed a new all-time high, but it is also closer to hitting $20.

However, if Aptos price fails to substantially test the $15.68 line as support it could fall through towards $13.61. Losing this level would invalidate the bullish thesis, pushing APT to $12.16

                        Unabomber prosecutor Robert J. Cleary has been given the green light by a U.S. bankruptcy judge to probe law firm Sullivan and Cromwell’s potential conflicts of interests in relation to FTX, according to a Wednesday court filing.What Will Cleary Find in FTX Probe?
Cleary’s appointment by Judge John Dorsey marks a key shift in the examination of the FTX’s collapse, formally reversing his rejection of an independent examiner in February 2023. Sullivan and Cromwell spearheaded the doomed crypto exchange through its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and has since charged over $170 million for its services.Last month, a number of FTX investors filed a class action lawsuit against the law firm, noting Sullivan and Cromwell’s “conduct and participation” in “racketeering activity” with Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange. Investors claimed that through the firm’s advisement to FTX through 2021 and 2022, Sullivan and Cromwell “placed itself in a unique position to gain deep insight into the FTX entities’ convoluted organizational structure, abject lack of internal controls, and dubious business practice.”Additionally, they alleged that the law firm “vouched for the solvency, safety, and security of the FTX Group up until its very collapse,” misleading customers and investors regarding the exchange.“Despite this knowledge, S&C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain,” the filing continued.FTX’s Collapse Prompts Conflict of Interest Concerns
News of Cleary’s approval comes just two months after a federal appeals court mandated the reversal of Dorsey’s February 2023 decision, citing added security to the crypto sector as a whole.“The collapse of FTX caused catastrophic losses for its worldwide investors but also raised implications for the evolving and volatile cryptocurrency industry,” said Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo. “For example, an investigation into FTX Group’s use of its own cryptocurrency tokens, FTTs, to inflate the value of FTX and Alameda Research could bring this practice under further scrutiny, thereby alerting potential investors to undisclosed credit risks in other cryptocurrency companies.”Critics of FTX’s collapse have long called for such an examination, with Senators John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) penning a letter to Dorsey in January 2023 for an “objective investigation.”“As legal counsel is often central to major financial scandals, given their role in drafting financial agreements, risk management compliance practices, and corporate controls, it is perfectly reasonable to have concerns about the impartiality and manner that Sullivan & Cromwell will approach any investigation of FTX with,” the senators wrote.Going Forward with FTX Probe

Big Money Eyes Dogecoin: Whale Activity Explodes 600%


								On-chain data shows whale-related activity on the Dogecoin blockchain has registered a sharp 600% increase over the past month.
Dogecoin Whale Transactions Have Exploded In The Last Month
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, DOGE whales have become quite active recently. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the Transaction Count of transfers on the Dogecoin blockchain with a value of at least $1 million.
Generally, only the whale entities are capable of moving such large amounts with single transactions, so these transactions are attributed to involving these humongous investors.

As such, the total number of transactions taking place on the network every day that are of a size falling in this range can provide us with hints about the behavior of the whales.
When the value of the Transaction Count of moves of this size is high, the whales actively participate in the network. Such a trend implies that interest around the memecoin may be high among these large traders.
On the other hand, low values of the indicator suggest not many large transactions are happening on the blockchain, a potential indication that the whales aren’t paying attention to the cryptocurrency.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Transaction Count for the whales over the past month:

The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
As the above graph shows, this Dogecoin indicator has recently registered a sharp uptrend. “The number of DOGE transactions larger than $1 million increased by more than 600% in the last 30 days!” notes IntoTheBlock.
The analytics firm has also shared a zoomed-out view of the chart for the same metric, which puts into perspective the scale of the recent DOGE whale activity.

The trend in the whale Transaction Count over the past few years | Source: IntoTheBlock on X
It would appear that the recent levels of the Transaction Count of the Dogecoin whales have been the highest that the network has witnessed since May 2021, when DOGE hit its top.
What does the high whale activity mean for the memecoin’s price? Generally, it’s hard to say anything about a price outcome based on the Transaction Count of these humongous entities alone, given that both selling and buying transfers count equally in the metric.
What the indicator’s trend can say, though, is whether the asset is likely to see more volatility in the near future. A large number of whale transactions means a significant shift of volume in the market, which can naturally produce some noticeable fluctuations in the price.

As Dogecoin has been going through high whale activity recently, it may see more volatile price action soon, should whales continue to remain active. However, the direction of this volatility can theoretically take the memecoin in either direction.
DOGE Price
When writing, Dogecoin is floating around the $0.15 mark, down more than 6% over the past week.

Cardano Defies Crypto Downturn: Smart Contract Development Up 170% Year-to-Date | Cryptoglobe


                                
Amid a wider cryptocurrency market downturn that has seen cryptocurrency prices plunge after Bitcoin ($BTC) hit a new all-time high, the smart contract platform Cardano ($ADA) has been seeing its smart contract development skyrocket.



Data from Cardano Blockchain Insights shows a remarkable increase of over 170% in Plutus scripts, the network’s language for building smart contracts, since the beginning of the year.



 This translates to nearly 500 new smart contracts being added to the Cardano network per day, as CryptoPotato first reported. The total number now sits at an impressive 39,000, with a particular emphasis on the newer Plutus V2 iteration.



Plutus is designed with a focus on security and reliability, drawing on principles from functional programming. Plutus V2, however, offers additional features and benefits for developers that include reduced transaction sizes and costs, along with a more flexible and scalable framework for building applications.

A closer look at the figures reveals 6,447 Plutus V1 scripts, representing a modest 2.2% increase since January 1. However, Plutus V2 scripts have skyrocketed by over 300% over the same period, now totalling 32,897. This translates to an average daily addition of 495 new smart contracts, with roughly 82 being Plutus V1 and 413 being Plutus V2.



Cardano’s growth extends beyond smart contracts, as the network has seen a significant rise in user activity over the last 30 days, with the number of active wallet addresses reaching a one-year peak of over 600,000 after surging nearly 40% over that same period.



According to data from Cardano-based decentralized exchange Danogo, the number of active wallet addresses on the network hit a lot of 297,000 back in September 2023, when the price of ADA was trading at $0.24 before a wider cryptocurrency market rally kicked off earlier this year with the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETFs) in the United States.

Ethereum Long-Term Holders Unfazed by SEC Probe, Data Shows - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum long-term holders appear undeterred by the SEC’s probe.



The data suggests that these investors believe ETH’s price will continue to appreciate.



Besides the resilience of long-term holders, key Ethereum on-chain metrics also remain strong.
Following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, speculators immediately turned their attention to Ethereum (ETH), anticipating that the SEC was set to approve ETFs backed by the asset next. Recent reports suggesting that the SEC seeks to label the asset a security, however, have sent hopes of an Ethereum ETF approval diving. Despite the recent uncertainty and market jitters, data suggests that long-term ETH holders are undeterred and even adding to their holdings.More Upside in the Card for Ethereum?On Friday, March 22, IntoTheBlock data shared by the firm’s Head of Research, Lucas Outumoro, suggested that long-term holders who have held ETH for over one year have been unfazed by the SEC’s recent probe of the Ethereum Foundation. On the contrary, the amount of ETH held by this class of investors continues to reach new highs at over 98 million ETH.Chart of ETH Balances by time heldSource: XExplaining the behavior of these long-term ETH holders, Outumoro suggested that they likely believed that the asset’s bull rally had yet to be exhausted."Based on previous market cycles, it appears that hodlers still believe ETH has room to continue appreciating. As we've covered before, Hodlers tend to sell into the later stages of a bull market and begin re-accumulating after 50% drops."Meanwhile, the lack of selling from long-term holders is not the only key metric unfazed by the SEC’s recent probe, as on-chain volumes are also rising.ETH Volumes Tap Highest Level in Over 2 YearsAccording to IntoTheBlock data, ETH on-chain volumes reached their highest level since May 2022 this week at about $12.27 billion. As highlighted by Outumoro, Layer 2 chains dominate with combined transaction numbers on Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, more than double that of the Ethereum mainnet.Chart of ETH transaction volumeSource: XOutumoro suggested that the recent Layer 2 dominance was only likely to continue following the recent Dencun upgrade, which has led to a dramatic decrease in gas fees on these chains.Citing the lack of long-term holders selling and rising volumes, the analyst suggested that the Ethereum ecosystem would likely continue to grow despite recent concerns."Overall, after undergoing a major upgrade, ETH hodlers continue to be bullish. Despite recent headwinds, the data supports continued growth for Ethereum both on layer 1 and layer 2s," he wrote.On the Flipside
Details of the SEC’s probe against the Ethereum Foundation remain unclear.



Some analysts have disputed the growing narrative that the recent SEC probe would automatically lead to a denial of Ethereum ETF applications.



BlackRock recently launched a tokenized fund on Ethereum.
Why This Matters The recent Ethereum data suggests that the crypto market is growing tough skin in response to the SEC’s crypto regulatory efforts. At the same time, the data also supports continued Ethereum growth.Read this for more on the SEC probe:SEC Reignites Ethereum Debate Yet Again: Security or Not?See how Polygon is attempting to simplify EVM DApp development:Polygon (MATIC) Labs To Scale DApp Development With New Tool

Key Technical Indicator Suggests Ethereum ($ETH) Price Could Top $5,400 This Year | Cryptoglobe


                                
Technical indicators suggest Ethereum ($ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could see its price climb above $5,400 this year, according to data shared by a cryptocurrency analyst.



The analysis, based on the Mayer Multiple oscillator, which is calculated “as the ratio between price, and the 200-day moving average” points to the possibility of Ether reaching the upper band of the indicator, as reported.



Ethereum is at the time of writing trading at $3,300 after losing over 10% of its value over the past week amid a wider cryptocurrency market downturn that has seen Bitcoin plunge from a new all-time high above $73,400 to around $62,800 at the time of writing.







Ethereum’s value has recently plunged partly as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly started investigating whether to classify it as a security, with multiple companies having received subpoenas related to the probe.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The SEC’s move casts doubt on the potential approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds this year, which would come after the regulator greenlit the trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds that helped the cryptocurrency market rally materialize.



The SEC’s investigation involves demanding documents and financial records from firms regarding their dealings with the Switzerland-based Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit overseeing the blockchain’s governance and development. Sources familiar with the subpoenas said the investigation began after Ethereum’s shift to a Proof-of-Stake network in September 2022.



Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, as reported, has bashed the SEC’s investigation in a strongly-worded response, where he refused the implication that Ethereum’s status is in question. He stressed that millions of Americans hold ETH, underscoring its significance within the crypto space since 2015.



Per Grewal, the SEC is contradicting itself, as senior SEC officials like Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman have previously acknowledged that ETH is not a security. Grewal went further, referencing SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s own Congressional testimony (in July 2018, which was before he became the SEC Chair) classifying ETH as a commodity rather than a security.

Ethereum price clings to key support amid SEC probe and traders’ shifting sentiment

Ether (ETH) price faced a significant setback after encountering robust resistance at the $4,100 mark on March 12. Ether has seen a 9% decline over the past week, underperforming when compared to the broader cryptocurrency market, leading traders to speculate whether the current support level of $3,200 will hold. For context, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by 2.5% during the same timeframe.Ether/USD, 12-hour price index. Source: TradingViewEther’s bullish prospects hinge on spot Ether ETF approvalFrom a bullish viewpoint, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) remains a key catalyst. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing the matter, with a final decision anticipated by May 23. However, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart does not consider approval as his base scenario.The recent upgrades to the Ethereum protocol should not be overlooked. The Dencun hard fork, which took place on March 13, aimed at enhancing the network's scalability and improving layer-2 data processing capabilities, is highly sought after by rollup solutions. As a result, transaction fees for most applications on Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base have significantly decreased.Cointelegraph notes that, in theory, Dencun’s enhancements are expected to encourage Ethereum users to embrace layer-2 solutions. Data indicates a surge in 7-day volumes for Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base by 145%, 144%, and 203%, respectively, thereby alleviating some of the downward pressure on Ether’s price that was attributed to high gas fees.It's worth noting that competitors like BNB Chain (BNB) and Solana (SOL) provide significantly lower transaction fees at the base layer, which often appears more accessible to newcomers. Despite the positive impact on Ethereum’s ecosystem, Solana’s decentralized application (DApps) volumes have increased by 57% over the last week, according to DappRadar.Regulatory challenges could adversely affect Ether’s priceThe bearish outlook for Ether’s mid-term price is bolstered by the increasingly complex regulatory environment in the United States. Cointelegraph reported on March 20 that the SEC is scrutinizing companies for possible connections with the Ethereum Foundation, aiming to classify Ether as a security.This move by the SEC was reportedly sparked by Ethereum’s transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake network, with several U.S.-based companies being asked to submit financial records and documents related to their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation.Market experts, including Van Buren Capital and lawyer Scott Johnsson, suggest that the SEC's probe into Ether's status as a security serves as "an additional pretext to deny" the spot Ether ETF applications. However, this perspective is not universally shared, with Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, arguing, "The SEC has no valid reason to reject the Ether ETP applications."To understand if professional traders flipped bearish after Ether’s price decline, one should use the ETH options 25% delta skew as a proxy. A skew metric rising above 7% indicates anticipations of a price drop, whereas a negative 7% skew typically reflects bullish sentiment.Ether 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: LaevitasFrom March 21 to the present, the ETH options 25% skew has increased from 0% to 5%, suggesting a cautious skepticism toward the $3,200 support level. However, one might argue that despite an 11% correction in Ether's price over a week, the skew metric has stayed in neutral territory, showing little sign that bearish sentiment has intensified.Looking at the bigger picture, the Ethereum network maintains its leading position in terms of deposits, with a total value locked (TVL) of $94 billion. The initiative by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, to launch a tokenized asset fund on Ethereum solidifies the network's prominence. Consequently, there seems to be no compelling reason to doubt that Ether's support at $3,200 will break in the near term.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Dogecoin to the Moon? Analyst Predicts Potential 550% Increase for $DOGE Price | Cryptoglobe


                                
A prominent cryptocurrency analyst has recently revealed he is bullish on the price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin ($DOGE), predicting it could surge over 550% from its current levels to reach the coveted $1 mark.



In a recently published video on the Google-owned platform YouTube, pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst DonAlt revealed that he believes DOGE reaching $1 “isn’t too unlikely,” suggesting the cryptocurrency could move up over 550% from its current $0.15 level.




VIDEO




His bullish outlook on Dogecoin, as Daily Hodl first reported, stems from the coin’s recent price action relative to Bitcoin, which he interprets as a sign of strong support as DOGE “kind of dipped back into support on the BTC chart,” he explained.



DonAlt acknowledged potential drawbacks to his bullish thesis, setting a price point of around $0.05 as a level that would negate his optimism. However, he emphasized that the potential reward outweighed the risk, particularly considering that Dogecoin recently traded at a low price of $0.12, which is 20% away from the $0.1 mark that he considered an “optimal” entry point.



As CryptoGlobe reported, another popular pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst, Altcoin Sherpa, noted in a post on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to their over 200,000 followers, that DOGE’s price surge could be partly supported by its “firepower” attributed to it being “king meme” and being supported by Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk to surge over 550%.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Musk has previously expressed his interest in the token and has hinted at its possible integration into his ventures, such as X, which have historically led to DOGE price rises.



The price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency surged in November 2022, for example, when Musk noted that the platform would be supporting payments, fueled by speculation the cryptocurrency – which Musk has said “might be my fav cryptocurrency” – could be a part of the payments system integrated into the platform.



DOGE has historically seen significant rallies over short periods of time. Back in 2021,  search interest for Dogecoin exploded during the cryptocurrency’s massive 10,000% price rally, going from an average of 135,000 monthly searches in April 2020 to 16.5 million in April 2021.



Dogecoin was created back in 2013 as a joke. The cryptocurrency’s community is well-known for taking on philanthropic projects, which included helping charitable organizations. It made headlines in 2014 after raising more than $25,000 worth of DOGE to let the Jamaican bobsleigh team attend the Winter Olympics in Sochi.

SEC Again Delays Decision on Grayscale Ethereum ETF - Decrypt

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission postponed a decision on whether to approve Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust's Ethereum ETF application, the agency said in a document filed on Friday. Its new deadline is May 30.The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 gives the agency has 180 days or six months from when notice of the proposed rule change is published. The Grayscale application was first filed in September, and the agency deferred making a decision in November.“The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,” the SEC said, echoing previous announcements.Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are a type of investment fund that tracks the price of digital assets and is traded on traditional stock exchanges, providing investors a taste of crypto without requiring them to hold tokens directly. A futures EFT focuses on the future price of the asset, versus a spot ETF that tracks the current price in real time.In January after approving 11 Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC delayed its decisionmaking on spot Ethereum ETF application from Grayscale and BlackRock. The next month, the SEC delayed its decision on a joint spot Ethereum ETF application from investing firms Invesco and Galaxy Digital.While the SEC’s decision on Grayscale's Ethereum futures ETF may disappoint cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts, some say the agency's delay is a good thing, allowing for greater adoption of Bitcoin ETFs.“Spot Ethereum ETFs will gather more assets if they launch in December versus if they launch in May,” Bitwise Chief Information Officer Matt Hougan said on Twitter. on Tuesday “TradFi needs more time to digest the Bitcoin ETFs.”The SEC's postponing its Ethereum ETF decision adds to negative pressure pushing the price of Ethereum down. On Friday, Ethereum was down 10.4% for the week and is currently trading at $3,289, according to Coingecko.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

SEC pushes back decision on Grayscale Ether futures ETF

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended the deadline yet again to decide on the approval of digital asset management firm Grayscale’s Ethereum (ETH) Future Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF).In a filing published on March 22, the SEC stated that it will postpone the March 31 deadline to May 30 to decide on whether or not to approve Grayscale's Ethereum Futures Trust ETF, which would focus on investing in Ethereum futures contracts.“The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.”In December 2023, the SEC postponed the approval date for Grayscale's future ETF product, stating that it would seek additional public input regarding whether the ETF should be listed.Related: SEC is attempting to classify Ether as a security: ReportThis came only three months after Grayscale proposed listing and trading shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E in September 2023.Following the listing, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart claimed that Grayscale was using its futures ETF application as a “trojan horse” to influence the SEC's decision into approving its spot Ether ETF.He explained that if the SEC approved Grayscale’s application, it would allow Grayscale to argue for the approval of its spot Ether ETF application.Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart Marchpost on X.Meanwhile, on Jan. 25, the SEC delayed its decision on whether to approve a spot Ether ETF from Grayscale, also opening the application to public comments.Following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, there has been increased skepticism among crypto industry commentators regarding whether the SEC will take a tougher stance on crypto-based ETFs.Cointelegraph recently reported that Capital founder John Lo expects the SEC to put increased scrutiny on all upcoming crypto-based ETFs, especially Ether ETFs:“Scrutiny towards cryptocurrency ETFs has only grown, as you could argue to a certain degree that the SEC was forced to approve the Bitcoin ETFs because of its case with Grayscale. No doubt, the SEC internally views that as a huge loss for themselves.”Other asset management firms are also facing obstacles with their Ethereum ETFs. In separate March 4 filings, the SEC announced that its decision on applications from BlackRock for its iShares Ethereum Trust and Fidelity for its Ethereum Fund would be delayed.Magazine: SEC radio silence on Ethereum ETF ‘not a good sign’ — Bloomberg analyst

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders & Price Top: Glassnode Reveals Pattern


                            The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has explained that Bitcoin tends to reach a potential top when the long-term holders show this pattern.
Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Ramping Up Distribution
In a new report, Glassnode discussed the influence that the BTC long-term holders have on the cryptocurrency’s supply dynamics. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days.
The LTHs comprise one of the two main divisions of the BTC user base based on holding time, with the other cohort known as the “short-term holders” (STHs).

Historically, the LTHs have proven themselves to be the persistent hands of the market. They don’t quickly sell their coins regardless of what is happening in the broader sector. The STHs, on the other hand, often react to FUD and FOMO events.
As such, it’s not unusual to see the STHs participating in selling. However, the LTHs showing sustained distribution can be something to note, as selling from these HODLers, who usually sit tight, may have implications for the market.
There are many different ways of tracking the behavior of the LTHs, but in the context of the current discussion, Glassnode has used the “LTH Market Inflation Rate” metric.
As the report explains:
It shows the annualized rate of Bitcoin accumulation or distribution by LTHs relative to daily miner issuance. This rate helps identify periods of net accumulation, where LTHs are effectively removing Bitcoin from the market, and periods of net distribution, where LTHs add to the market’s sell-side pressure.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC LTH Market Inflation Rate over the past several years:

The value of the metric seems to have been on the rise in recent days | Source: Glassnode
In the chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data for the asset’s Inflation Rate, which is basically the amount that the miners are introducing into the circulating supply by solving blocks and receiving rewards for them.
When the LTH Market Inflation Rate equals 0%, these HODLers are accumulating amounts exactly equal to what the miners are issuing.
This implies that the indicator below the 0% mark suggests the LTHs are pulling coins out of the supply, while it being above is a sign that they are either distributing or just not buying enough to absorb what the miners are producing.
The graph shows that historically, the cryptocurrency’s price has tended to reach a state of equilibrium and potentially even a top when the LTH distribution has peaked.

The LTH Market Inflation Rate has been increasing recently, but it’s yet to reach any significant levels. As for what this could mean for the market, Glassnode says:
Currently, the trend in the LTH market inflation rate indicates we are in an early phase of a distribution cycle, with about 30% completed. This suggests significant activity ahead within the current cycle until we achieve a market equilibrium point from the supply and demand perspective and potential price tops.

Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Could Skyrocket To $3.8M By 2030 Thanks To 'Institutional Green Light' - Benzinga

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has projected a staggering price target for Bitcoin BTC/USD. According to Wood, the cryptocurrency’s price could soar to $3.8 million. What Happened: Wood made this prediction at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on Friday. She attributed this potential surge to the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the introduction of new ETF products, reported Business Insider.Wood’s previous prediction in January suggested that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030. She now believes that if institutional investors allocate just over 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, her projection would surge to $3.8 million in the same time period.See Also: Shiba Inu Blockchain Shibarium’s Meme Coin DAMN Leads Board With 22% Single Day Gains"With this institutional green light that the SEC has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we’ve done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you." Wood’s firm, Ark Invest, was among the 11 companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, that received approval from the SEC for spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.The introduction of these products has led to a surge in demand, setting new records for inflows into US ETFs and driving up demand for Bitcoin itself. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, anticipated in April, is also expected to create a supply shock, further fueling the current demand-driven rally.Why It Matters: Wood’s recent prediction aligns with her revised expectations for Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. Wood’s forecast also resonates with other experts’ bullish outlook on Bitcoin. An analyst recently predicted significant growth for Bitcoin and altcoins, with Bitcoin potentially reaching close to $100,000 by the end of 2025.Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin has shown resilience. The cryptocurrency, along with other major cryptos, experienced a surge following the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady, indicating a strong market sentiment.Wood’s projection also underscores the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. This trend is in line with the broader shift towards digital assets and blockchain technology, which ARK Invest predicts could reach a total market value of $220 trillion by 2030.Price Action: Bitcoin was trading at $63,990, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin Dip ‘100% Predictable,’ Could Trade Below $60K Before ‘Meaningful Rally Attempt'Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image made via photos on Flickr by WEF and Shutterstock

Solana Meme Coin Mania Breaks Records: DEX Volume Surges, Yet Failed Transactions Hit 72% | Bitcoinist.com


								Solana (SOL) has experienced an exceptional uptrend, with a staggering year-to-date (YTD) surge of 652%. However, the recent surge in meme coins has further amplified the blockchain’s growth narrative. 
Solana-based tokens such as dogfight (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), and Boof of Meme (BOME) have witnessed remarkable growth rates of 574%, 3200%, and 49%, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. 
Nevertheless, this unprecedented meme coin mania has its fair share of ramifications, including increased transaction failures, rising transaction fees, and the dominance of bot-driven activities.
Meme Coin Ecosystem Faces Challenges
The surge in meme coin popularity is evident through the rise in decentralized exchange (DEX) and meme coin volume on Solana. On March 16th, major meme coins like BONK, WIF, TREMP, BODEN, and BOME recorded a cumulative volume of $1.33 billion. 
This surge in trading activity highlights investors’ significant interest and participation in the Solana meme coin ecosystem.
However, the influx of bots seeking to exploit potential opportunities has resulted in a notable increase in failed transactions within the Solana network. 

On-chain researcher and analyst Tom Wan reveals that 72% of the failed transactions can be attributed to bot activities. Although this high failure rate has impacted the network’s efficiency, the effect on organic users has been relatively less severe than bots.

However, as the meme coin frenzy continues to grip Solana, the network has witnessed a substantial increase in average transaction fees. 
While average users can still execute transactions without paying priority fees, Tom Wan highlights that the median transaction fee has tripled from 0.000005 SOL to 0.000016 SOL. As a result, the average transaction fee has risen to $0.065, reflecting increased demand and congestion on the network.
Ultimately, the surge in meme coin trading activity on Solana has brought benefits and challenges. While the DEX and meme coin volume growth signifies the increasing adoption and interest in these tokens, it has also exposed vulnerabilities within the network. 
Solana Surpasses All Other Blockchain Ecosystems
The competition between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana continues to intensify, as the so-called “Ethereum Killer” appears to be the latest to dominate global investor interest, outpacing other blockchain ecosystems. 
According to recent research by CoinGecko, Solana’s growing popularity can be attributed to its recent rally, which has propelled it to reclaim its 2021 highs. 
This resurgence has captured the attention of investors worldwide, who are drawn to blockchain’s potential for innovation and growth. In addition, the success of notable projects within the Solana ecosystem, such as Pyth, has further boosted investor confidence and interest in the platform.

While Solana has emerged as the most popular blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum holds a significant position in the industry. CoinGecko’s data reveals that Ethereum captures 12.7% of investor interest, ranking it as the second most popular ecosystem 2024. 
According to the research, Ethereum’s continued relevance can be attributed to its well-established presence and familiarity among investors. However, attention within the Ethereum ecosystem is increasingly dispersed to layer 2 solutions built on top of the Ethereum network.

With a 5.4% share of investor interest year-to-date (YTD), the third most popular blockchain ecosystem is crypto exchange Binance’s BNB Smart Chain ecosystem.

Currently, the price of SOL stands at $171.80, reflecting a continuation of its price correction over the past seven days, which amounts to a 5% decline. This correction has also persisted over the past 24 hours, with a further decrease of 6.6% in price.

Billion-Dollar Bank Abruptly Freezes Woman’s Account and Refuses To Return Funds, Forcing Her To Rely on Family and Friends for Survival: Report - The Daily Hodl


								An Atlanta woman says a popular US bank abruptly froze her account and refused to let her cash out, leaving her to fend for herself.
Shelley Camp says Green Dot locked her out of her bank account out of nowhere for “unusual activity,” reports the ABC-affiliated news station WSB-TV.










Camp says she was out of town when the bank, which has $4.817 billion in assets and 33 million customers, decided to lock her account.
The move forced her to borrow money from friends and family for basic necessities like food, gas and transportation.
“It’s $640. And it might not seem like a lot. But when it’s the money you got, it’s a lot, you know?” 
Camp says the $640, which was her IRS refund, was in deep freeze with no further explanation until WSB-TV began investigating.
After the news team reached out, Green Dot unlocked the account, stating that it’s deployed “extra fraud protections” for some IRS refunds.
 “The majority of those accounts that required additional verification have now been fully processed, and funds have been received by those customers.”
Similar reports of Green Dot freezing accounts in relation to IRS refunds circulated late last year in Tennessee.
Green Dot Bank is partnered with Walmart and TurboTax and specializes in processing tax refunds for its 33 million customers.
In the first six months of 2023, the bank processed about 13.78 million in tax refunds, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) filing.

Is Your Crypto Safe? Trezor Addresses Concerns Over X Hack


								On March 19, Trezor’s X suffered a security breach that exposed the account’s 200,000 followers to a fake crypto presale. After the alarms were raised, most crypto users stayed vigilant while the hardware wallet company regained control.
Trezor’s team recently published a preliminary report addressing the concerns. The post also explained the elaborate phishing scam that bypassed the company’s security measures.

Is Trezor’s “Unwavering Security” Still Protecting Your Crypto?
After gaining control of the account, the hacker posted a fake presale address for a $TRZR token. Disguised as an “initiative” to help the Slerf community, the post offered a “separate bonus airdrop” from a website linked in the post that redirected to a wallet drainer.
After Trezor regained control of the account, X users expressed their worries about the incident and suggested that the hack was a “bad look” on the security-focused company. However, the company guaranteed that they had “robust security measures.”
We want to clarify that we do not make use of SMS for 2FA, and instead employ more secure methods of authentication.
The company finally addressed users’ concerns in a preliminary report. The hack is possible due to a “sophisticated phishing scam” instead of a lack of basic security measures.
The company is based on “unwavering security,” the post states; as such, all products and internal systems remain unaffected despite the breach.

Sophisticated Phishing Scam Steals Pocket Change
According to Trezor, the ongoing investigation has revealed that “the breach appears to have arisen from a sophisticated and calculated phishing attack that was in the works for weeks.”
The calculated scheme began on February 29 after the attacker posed for a “credible entity” from the crypto industry. At the time of writing, the identity of the impersonated figure was not revealed.
The attacker contacted Trezor’s PR team through X using a “well-crafted social media presence.” The seemingly genuine contact aimed to schedule an interview with the company’s CEO.
According to the report, the attacker and the team had a back-and-forth conversation over several days, which made the efforts to stage a call seem more credible. However, the call agreement led to the click of the link that granted access to Trezor’s X account.
The malicious link was disguised as a Calendly invite that, upon clicking, redirected a Trezor’s team member to a page requesting the X login credentials. The team rescheduled the call as the incident raised red flags.
During the rescheduled call, the attacker pretended to have technical issues and urged Trezor’s team member “to ‘authorize’ joining the call.” This authorization connected the hacker’s Calendly app with the company’s X account. As a result, the attacker gained access to the account and published the now-deleted posts.


The hacker only stole $8,100 from the malicious link redirecting to the wallet drainer.  Impressively, just 0.96 SOL (around $162,4 at writing time’s pricing) were sent to the fake presale address.
Undoubtedly, the attack was a calculated and elaborate scheme that aimed to become a big heist. However, the hacker’s attempt was halted by the crypto community surveillance and the suspicious nature of the unauthorized posts.
