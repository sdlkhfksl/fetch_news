                        Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer has initiated its token-claim process, commonly referred to as an “airdrop,” for Season 1, Phase 1 rewards.According to a recent blog post by the protocol’s development team, users who are eligible for the new EIGEN token can now acquire it through the claims process after a few weeks of anticipation.However, it’s important to note that EIGEN tokens are currently nontransferable, meaning users cannot sell or trade them.EIGEN Token to Become Transferable in Future
The blog post further mentioned that the EIGEN token will become transferable once the development team implements new features in the upcoming months.The tentative target date for these implementations is set for September 30.It’s crucial for users to claim their tokens before the claim process closes on September 7, as any unclaimed tokens after that date will not be distributed.According to EigenLayer’s documentation, the EIGEN token is not available for users in over 30 jurisdictions, including the United States, Russia, China, and Canada.Additionally, most VPN server addresses are prohibited from being used for token claims.The current claims process has unlocked 6.05% of the total supply of EIGEN tokens, and an additional 0.7% will be unlocked in mid-June during “Phase 2.”At that time, users of applications such as Kelp, Pendle, Equilibrium, and similar apps will be eligible to claim their tokens.The ongoing airdrop primarily caters to users who restaked Ether or its liquid staking derivatives on EigenLayer before March 15.Users who hold liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) can also claim their rewards now, as long as their activities do not fall under “Phase 2.”Additionally, users who restaked on EigenLayer between March 15 and April 29 are eligible to claim 100 bonus tokens immediately, with the majority of their claims becoming available in mid-June alongside other Phase 2 participants.The EIGEN airdrop has sparked controversy within the decentralized finance (DeFi) community. Leandro Schlottchauer, co-founder of Kuyen Labs, stated that it might be one of the last “life-changing airdrops.”Conversely, many EigenLayer users have criticized the airdrop for its ban on VPN servers, the distribution of nontransferable tokens, and its perceived short snapshot period.LayerZero Labs to Exclude Sybil Farmers From Airdrop
As airdrop season rages on, LayerZero Labs, a renowned cross-chain interoperability protocol, has vowed to tackle the issue of sybil farmers ahead of its highly anticipated airdrop.The project has stated that it will conduct an internal investigation to identify and exclude sybil farmers from receiving allocations in its future token generation event.Additionally, the project plans to launch a reward program, offering a 10% bonus of the intended token allocation to bounty hunters who identify additional sybil users.LayerZero Labs recently completed the first snapshot for its highly anticipated airdrop.In December, the project announced its plans to distribute tokens to early adopters in the first half of 2024.

To encourage long-term investment, the project introduces a staking system rewarding those who lock their Sponge V1 tokens with significant staking benefits in $SPONGE V2 for up to four years.

Additionally, $SPONGE V2 features a Play-to-Earn game themed around the popular SpongeBob SquarePants, upgrading user involvement and using its meme appeal. With the presale closing down, investors are urged to grab the remaining tokens at attractive prices.
>>>Get Sponge V2 Now<<<
DogWifHat (WIF) — Hilarious Pup in a Pink Cap Gains Popularity and Emerges as One of the Leading Meme Coins in the Market
Launched in late 2023, Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a Shiba Inu dog wearing a pink knitted cap. Avoiding the big visions and interesting websites typical of meme coins, WIF chooses its straightforward identity, billing itself as “literally just a dog wif a hat.”
Despite its simple concept and lack of innovative features, WIF has defied expectations. Starting at just 7 cents early in 2024, the token quickly picked up steam. By February’s end, it broke the $1 mark, and by the end of March, it peaked at $4.85—an astonishing 7,000% increase in under three months.
WIF’s market cap followed this path, hitting over $1 billion by mid-March and reaching a peak of $4.75 billion. This phenomenal growth turned what began as a playful meme into one of the crypto market’s major players by 2024.
Final Thoughts
The market has finally emerged from the red, with many popular altcoins gradually recovering their losses.
Now, with another bull run on the horizon, investors are seeking the next meme coin poised to skyrocket and deliver significant profits.
Many industry experts suggest that these five meme coins are prime candidates for investment in May 2024.
Given that most of these tokens are still in the presale phase, there remains an opportunity to secure them at reasonable prices before they explode.

The Crypto Industry Will Win The SEC in the Long Run - Ripple CEO


							

Brad Garlinghouse believes the crypto industry will win the fight against the SEC.



According to Garlinhouse, the best technologies always win in the long run.



The SEC is currently entangled in several disagreements with crypto establishments.




Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes the crypto industry will win the fight against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a recently uploaded video, Garlinghouse noted that the best technologies always win in the long run.







According to the Ripple CEO, the SEC’s efforts to curtail crypto activities will fail in the long run. He noted that what the SEC is doing in its fight against crypto is nothing compared to the industry’s continued multi-decade growth.



Furthermore, Garlinghouse highlighted his optimism about the future of crypto, noting that all the current happenings will look pale with the industry’s development twenty years from now. He believes users will measure the crypto market in many trillions in the future, noting that it is an industry that will change how transactions work. According to the Ripple Chief, cryptocurrencies reduce friction and cost, making things more efficient.



The SEC’s fight against the crypto industry remains a significant occurrence surrounding the sector. The commission’s legal battle with Ripple represents one of many lawsuits and regulation attempts the SEC is pursuing.









Many users believe the commission’s legal battle with Ripple is nearing a conclusive end, following recent filings by both parties. However, Garlinghouse’s position is that no matter the outcome of current events, the crypto industry will naturally overcome the challenges and thrive above all obstacles.



Apart from Ripple, the SEC is entangled in other disagreements with crypto establishments, including top crypto exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Earlier this week, Kraken filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the SEC’s case against it, citing inappropriate wording in the latter’s submission.

Bill for Cryptocurrency Regulation in Turkey to be Submitted to Parliament this Week - Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


With the regulation on crypto assets that it will submit to the Parliament this week, the AK Party aims to include the platforms where crypto assets are traded within the scope of the Capital Markets Board (CMB) regulation and supervision. With the work carried out under the chairmanship of AK Party Group Chairman Abdullah Güler, the preparations on the bill containing regulations regarding crypto assets were completed. The proposal is planned to be submitted to the Speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly within the week.
The new proposal aims to reduce the risks of parties transacting with crypto assets in Turkey, similar to international practices. The regulation, which will define crypto assets in a broad sense, aims to license the platforms on which they are traded by the CMB and to include them within the scope of CMB regulation and control.


The proposal will include the storage of cash and crypto assets held on behalf of customers on the platforms, the relations between platforms and customers, and the sanctions and penalties to be applied. The criteria regarding the operating principles of the platforms will be determined by the secondary regulation.

The bill will include provisions authorizing the CMB to authorize people who develop block-chain and similar technologies to sell or distribute crypto assets whose value cannot be separated from these technologies and to impose a permit requirement. The regulation aims to involve the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) in this process, thus encouraging the development of software architecture and related technological tools for creating block-chain.





With the enactment of the regulation on crypto assets and the start of licensing of crypto asset service providers, it is envisaged that the criticisms brought within the scope of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) technical standard No. 15 will be eliminated and Turkey will leave the “partially compliant” category.

What is cryptocurrency insurance, and how does it work?

                            Cryptocurrency insurance, explained                                        Cryptocurrency insurance acts as a safety net for various stakeholders in the digital asset market, including individuals, companies and institutional investors.The purpose of cryptocurrency insurance, also known as digital asset insurance or crypto coverage, is to reduce the risks involved in trading, storing or possessing cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Individuals, companies and institutional investors are financially protected against losses brought on by a variety of incidents, such as theft, hacking, fraud, operational mistakes and legal actions, with cryptocurrency insurance.Traditional insurance solutions frequently fall short of providing adequate coverage given the particular risks connected with cryptocurrencies, such as scams and regulatory difficulties. By providing specialized solutions made especially for the ecosystem of digital assets, cryptocurrency insurance fills this gap.                                                                    How does cryptocurrency insurance work?                                        Cryptocurrency insurance mechanics involve evaluating the risk profile of the insured party, tailoring plans to their needs, underwriting to assess insurability and assisting in processing claims.An evaluation of the risk profile of the insured party is the first stage in cryptocurrency insurance mechanics. The value of retained digital assets, security measures put in place, trading activity and regulatory compliance are just a few of the factors that insurers consider. Insurers tailor plans based on this evaluation to the insured’s particular requirements and risk tolerance. After that, premiums are computed using multiple factors, including market conditions, past data on breaches, asset valuations, coverage limits and security measures.When establishing the terms and conditions of coverage and evaluating whether a risk is insurable, underwriting is essential. Crypto insurance underwriters conduct due diligence to assess the insurability of the risk and set terms and conditions for coverage. This involves analyzing the security infrastructure, operational protocols, regulatory compliance and financial stability of the insured party.When a covered loss or incident occurs, the insured notifies the insurer of the claim and provides supporting documents and evidence. The insurer assists the insured in overcoming the financial impact of the loss by paying the agreed-upon amount after verification.                                                                    Types of cryptocurrency insurance coverage                                        Cryptocurrency insurance offers various types of coverage tailored to address specific risks — e.g., theft, fraud, bankruptcy, etc. — faced by stakeholders in the digital asset ecosystem. Some common types of crypto insurance coverage include:Crypto theft insuranceCryptocurrency theft insurance offers protection against the loss of digital assets due to hacking, illegal access, phishing scams or other malevolent acts.Crypto custody insurance Crypto custody insurance offers protection against theft, bankruptcy and operational errors for assets kept in the care of third-party service providers, including exchanges, wallets and custodial platforms.Cybersecurity insurance for cryptocurrencyFinancial protection against losses arising from theft, hacking or cybersecurity breaches involving users’ digital assets is provided by cybersecurity insurance for cryptocurrencies. It can compensate for expenses associated with misplaced funds, investigations, efforts to retrieve them and any legal obligations. For people and companies with sizable cryptocurrency assets, this specialist insurance is crucial. Policies can differ, so it’s important to thoroughly consider your options for coverage.Insurance for cryptocurrency exchanges and digital asset holdersInsurance coverage against financial losses brought on by theft, fraud, hacking, disruptions to operations and legal liabilities specific to cryptocurrency exchanges helps protect digital asset holders.Additionally, these are insurance solutions tailored to protect blockchain-based assets, smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and tokenized assets against various risks.Custodial insurance for digital assetsThis protects institutional investors and asset managers against the loss, theft or mishandling of crypto assets under their custody.                                                                    Key considerations for cryptocurrency insurance policies                                        Stakeholders should carefully consider the essential criteria listed in the “Key considerations for cryptocurrency insurance policies” section before choosing a cryptocurrency insurance policy. These factors ensure that their digital assets are adequately covered and protected by the selected policy. It places emphasis on determining the maximum amount of coverage, comprehending exclusions and limitations, complying with security specifications set by the insurers, analyzing premium costs, getting acquainted with the claims procedure, and choosing reliable insurers with a track record in the cryptocurrency insurance market. These actions are essential for reducing potential risks connected with cryptocurrency ownership and trading and for helping users make well-informed decisions. Furthermore, preserving eligibility and enhancing overall security necessitate conforming to strict security criteria enforced by insurers, such as putting in place strong security measures and following industry best practices. Optimizing the cost-effectiveness of the insurance investment is made possible by assessing how affordable premiums are in relation to the amount of protection provided. Comprehending the claims procedure, which encompasses the necessary documents and dispute resolution processes, promotes effective correspondence with insurance providers and ensures prompt claim settlement.                                                                    Traditional insurance vs. cryptocurrency insurance                                        While traditional insurance policies may offer some degree of coverage for digital assets, they often fall short of addressing the unique risks and complexities of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conventional or traditional insurance offers less transparency and a slower resolution since it relies on intermediaries like established companies, centralized governance and third-party custody. On the other hand, cryptocurrency insurance provides great transparency and expedited settlement times, frequently within minutes or hours, through the use of user-controlled wallets, blockchain technology and decentralized governance.Here’s a comparison between traditional insurance and cryptocurrency insurance:                                                                    Strategies to protect against cryptocurrency insurance fraud                                        Protecting against crypto insurance fraud in the context of blockchain requires a multipronged strategy. Performing thorough due diligence on insurers is crucial and should involve evaluating their financial stability, adherence to regulations, past claims experience and their reputation in the industry. Strong security protocols must also be put in place to protect digital assets. Identifying and neutralizing possible threats entail using encryption mechanisms, using multisignature wallets, using cold storage systems and continuously monitoring transactions and network activity.Creating and putting into practice thorough risk management protocols is also essential. The protocols ought to cover the recognition, evaluation and alleviation of risks related to cybersecurity, operational hazards and compliance that are inherent in the blockchain environment. An integral part of this strategy is the regular auditing and evaluation of security controls as well as compliance with industry standards and regulations.In addition, it is crucial to carefully examine insurance plans’ terms, conditions, exclusions and coverage limits to make sure they are in line with stakeholders’ financial goals and risk management strategies. Hiring impartial outside specialists, like cybersecurity companies, forensic auditors and attorneys, can offer important confirmation and insights into insurance coverage, security measures and adherence to industry norms.

SEC Says Ripple Victory Ruling for XRP Holds No Weight for Other Cases


							

SEC questions the legal influence of Ripple’s favorable ruling in its argument against Coinbase’s appeal.



The regulator claimed Ripple’s non-security status for XRP sales remains unendorsed by other courts.



A legal expert confirms Ripple’s ruling could be an isolated win in the industry.




The U.S. SEC has thrown shade on the decision of Judge Analisa Torres in the Ripple lawsuit, saying “no court has followed the ruling.” This critique was part of the SEC’s argument against Coinbase’s request for an interlocutory appeal. 



For context, in the SEC vs Ripple case, Judge Torres ruled in July 2023 that programmatic sales of XRP tokens through exchanges did not constitute securities offerings, thus not violating securities laws. This ruling affirmed that XRP is not a security, and token sales on exchanges do not constitute investment contracts.



However, the SEC’s recent complaint against Coinbase alleges that the cryptocurrency exchange has been acting as an unregistered intermediary for “crypto asset securities.” The SEC believes that the digital assets listed on Coinbase’s platform are securities, and sales through the platform are investment contracts. This view directly conflicts with Judge Torres’s ruling that tokens like XRP sold on exchanges are not securities.









Now, in their latest filing against Coinbase’s appeal, the SEC remarked that “no court has followed Ripple.” The argument implies that other courts have not echoed the legal reasoning or precedent established in the Ripple case and thus cannot apply in Coinbase’s case. 



This statement suggests that the SEC views the Ripple decision as an outlier, potentially lacking in legal influence or validity.



Reacting to the development, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan suggested that if other courts do not adopt the SEC vs. Ripple case ruling and the SEC wins its other major crypto lawsuits, Ripple’s victory regarding programmatic sales would stand in isolation. 







Essentially, it would mean that Ripple could continue its programmatic sales unregistered. However, the ruling may not necessarily serve as a legal precedent for other entities in the crypto industry.

XRP set to rally as investors gear up for CPI data release

Technologists, investors, and owners of XRP eagerly look forward to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release, as the announcement could cause a potential rally for the price of XRP CPI data publication day draws near According to Matthew Dixon, the CEO of Evai, a crypto rating platform, a scooping drop in CPI may be the push needed to facilitate a significant positive climb in the price of XRP. Many market makers, participants, and even crypto sphere casual observers are waiting for the publication of the consumer price index (CPI) the data for which will be moved on May 17th.  Thus the economic indicator is a subject of speculation concerning its potential intrusion into different types of assets including cryptocurrencies. Among many analysts, including Dixon, the fact that a weak CPI number (latest CPI data) can potentially trigger an XRP price rally is a major factor that drives some market participants as well. Dixon’s bullish case for XRP is grounded on the unparalleled potential of digital assets, which present an innovative way to secure a decentralized financial system and support the accelerated development of smart contracts. He has mentioned that XRP is going to be a sleeping giant and soon it, is, going to, awaken. He said that if the surprising dip from CPI was less than expected, this could be the catalyst for XRP to reach new highs. The Federal Reserve is driven by this statement because the Fed takes a snapshot of the American inflation data.  If the data is then reflected to be rising, the Fed may think of a rate cut. Market trends and possible consequencesDixon’s bullish case is founded on the inverted link between interest rates and asset prices, which exists between the traditional markets and the digital currencies as well. If the Fed’s monetary stance tends to support the low interest rates approach due to a loss in momentum of inflation, investors could invest in speculative investments such as cryptocurrencies since they offer higher returns than low-risk assets. Hence, XRP, being known for its potential to assist with international transfers, would likely have more people acquiring it and, in return, push its price upwards.  Despite Dixon’s prediction having drawn recognition from crypto community members, some industry veterans are skeptical and still treat the cryptocurrency market as a speculative trading instrument. Nonetheless, the idea of a ripe XRPdrop has interested enthusiasts in investors while they are watching for the total value of the Consumer Price Index Data Release to be made public.

Bitcoin Crashes Below $61K as Altcoins Take Massive Beating (Weekend Watch)


																The past 24 hours haven’t treated the cryptocurrency market well, with most coins trading well in the red.
Bitcoin plummeted below $61K, while the majority of altcoins are also charting considerable losses. Let’s have a closer look.
Bitcoin Price Crashes Suddenly
BTC was trading relatively flat throughout the week, failing to break out in either direction and maintaining its stance at around $63K.
This all changed yesterday when the cryptocurrency took a massive hit and plunged rather suddenly toward $60K.
Source: CoinGecko
The volatility induced over $200 million worth of liquidated positions over the past 24 hours and seemed to have been triggered by a statement from a representative of the US Federal Reserve.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!


Speaking at a conference in New Orleans, the President of the Dallas Fed – Lorie Logan – suggested that it may be “too early to think about rate cuts.”
I need to see some of these uncertainties resolved about the path that we’re on, and we need to remain very flexible.
The market didn’t take this well, and all the charts are painted in red.
Altcoins Bleed Out Heavily
Trading at $60,800 at the time of this writing, BTC’s price is down 3.5% in the past 24 hours.
If that sounds bad, don’t look at the following heatmap.
Source: Quantify Crypto
ETH lost 4.1%, SOL is down 6%, and DOT crashed by almost 6% as well – similar to a lot of other coins such as BCH, AVAX, and UNI.
Although prices have stabilized throughout the past few hours, market analysts are monitoring the action closely to determine whether the bears are done or if another assault is inbound.
Theta Network (THETA), alongside THORChain (RUNE) are the coins that lost the most during the past 24 hours, down 10.8% and 9.2%, respectively.
On the other hand, Cheelee (CHEEL) and Akash Network (AKT) were able to curb the damage, increasing by around 3% throughout the same period.

How Will November's US Presidential Election Affect Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies? Bullish or Bearish? - Bitcoin Sistemi

QCP Capital, a leading cryptocurrency analysis firm, recently discussed the potential impact of the upcoming US elections on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The firm stated that historically markets have shown an upward trend towards elections.
However, according to analysts, this year's elections may experience a unique dynamic due to the increasing interest in cryptocurrencies among voters.


Former President Donald Trump is making moves towards the crypto community, which could influence his rival Joe Biden to take a similar stance. Trump's appeal to crypto enthusiasts marks a significant shift from his first term, when he was more critical of the industry. Trump's direct embrace of cryptocurrencies is seen as a turning point for the industry, which has lobbied heavily in Washington and invested heavily to influence the outcome of the 2024 elections.
At an event where he introduced his own non-fungible token (NFT), Trump urged crypto supporters to vote for him, citing regulatory crackdowns on the industry under the Biden administration. “They are against cryptocurrencies,” he said, referring to the Democrats' approach to cryptocurrencies.






The Republican party has become increasingly friendly towards Bitcoin and other digital assets in recent years. By contrast, key Democrats are divided on whether to legitimize the industry after a series of scandals.
“President Trump's statements signal a shift in the importance of digital assets this election cycle,” said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a top crypto industry lobby group.


The firm also stated that markets will likely continue to price in rate cuts unless the FED explicitly rejects rate cuts or gives hints of rate hikes. This could have significant impacts on the crypto market, which is often influenced by broader economic trends.

Whales Accumulate Nearly $1 Billion Worth of Bitcoin in Just 1 Day Despite Price Drops ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
In a surprising turn of events during the recent price correction, Bitcoin whales have demonstrated a strong vote of confidence in the leading cryptocurrency by accumulating nearly $1 billion worth of BTC within a mere 24-hour period. This massive accumulation, totaling 15,121 BTC, marks the highest level of whale activity in two weeks and suggests a significant shift in market sentiment.



Bitcoin’s Movements and Impact of Whale Activity



Bitcoin’s price has been more volatile than usual in recent weeks. It’s been ranging from $60,000 to $64,000, and whales have taken the opportunity to increase their holdings. This accumulation wave follows after selling and profit-taking activities from investors, which shows conviction even at higher prices.



Santiment, a leading blockchain analytics platform, views this move as a clear signal of whales’ confidence in Bitcoin as an asset. Moreover, industry experts cite this surge in accumulation as the beginning of a re-accumulation phase, potentially paving the way for a bullish reversal soon.



Increased Bullish Sentiment



The timing of this accumulation is interesting because inflows into the Bitcoin network have been steadily increasing. About a week ago, Bitcoin Whales acquired a staggering 47,000 BTC in a single day, valued at almost $3 billion. This influx of capital into the market led CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju to suggest that this may start a new chapter for Bitcoin.



Further reinforcing the bullish sentiment, prominent Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo recently observed renewed interest from BTC investors. While he mentioned that it may take some time to confirm this trend reversal, the underlying data suggests a growing appetite for Bitcoin among institutional players.

Reduced Selling Pressure



Additionally, on-chain metrics looked at by analysts from Bitfinex show a potential weakening of selling pressure for Bitcoin. This, coupled with positive flows in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market, further highlights the growing conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential.



The recent whale accumulation of nearly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin in just one day is a clear bullish signal for the crypto market as a whole. Despite short-term price fluctuations, institutional and large-scale investors remain certain in their belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. As the market enters a re-accumulation phase, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s trajectory, with many anticipating its next move.

What is BounceBit: Liquid Restaking on Bitcoin


																The concept of liquid restaking, a topic that has gained significant popularity in recent quarters, offers users the exciting possibility to extract additional value from their staked tokens.
Predominantly, however, this has been applied throughout a variety of Ethereum-based applications.
BounceBit, on the other hand, is delivering a BTC restaking infrastructure designed to provide a foundational layer for various restaking products.
In the following guide, we take a closer look at how BounceBit works, the tokenomics behind its native cryptocurrency, and more. Let’s dive in.
Quick Navigation

What is Liquid Restaking?
Before we explain what BounceBit does, it’s important to understand the concept of liquid restaking that we mentioned above.
You might be familiar with liquid staking protocols and their liquid staking tokens (LSTs). It’s a mechanism that came to prominence with protocols like Lido. Users are able to stake their ETH into Lido (or other protocols) and receive a synthetic representation of this ETH. This is a new token that’s supposed to be pegged to the value of ETH 1:1. They could then use this synthetic ETH to carry out various operations with other protocols that support it.
Liquid restaking, on the other hand, is a process aimed at increasing the economic security of external systems. In essence, you can take your synthetic ETH (your LST) and restake it, receiving another token called a liquid restaking token.
As mentioned above, most of the LRT protocols are increasingly focused on Ethereum because of its Proof of Stake architecture.
BounceBit, on the other hand, is building a BTC restaking infrastructure that’s designed to provide a layer for restaking products on the Bitcoin network.
How do they do it? Well, let’s find out.

What is BounceBit?
In a bid to reimagine Bitcoin’s value, BounceBit proposes an infrastructure designed based on the conviction that Bitcoin should be predominantly asset-driven at the infrastructure level.
BounceBit differentiates itself as a Proof of Stake layer one ecosystem where validators are required to stake BTC and the native BounceBit token. This establishes a dual-token security system that’s aimed at strengthening the network itself but also at improving the intrinsic value of Bitcoin by providing its holders with an active role in validating the BounceBit network.
The goal is to provide a symbiotic relationship between BounceBit’s native token and BTC in an attempt to create a versatile and resilient network.
BounceBit also leverages interoperability with other networks that are EVM-compatible, incorporating staked assets such as BTCB on the “Build ‘N’ Build” (BNB) Chain and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).
Now, it’s worth noting that when t comes to generating yield on BTC – there is a very unique challenge that’s inherently different from yield-generation protocols associated with Ethereum. The Bitcoin protocols can’t yield returns when the BTC is held within multi-signature wallets. This is what BounceBit confronts by integrating a centralized finance (CeFi) approach, taking advantage of Mainnet Digital’s custody services, as well as Ceffu’s MirrorX technology stack.
This essentially allows Bitcoin to maintain its presence on-chain, while also engaging in trading activities on centralized exchanges.
What Problems Does BounceBit Solve?

Tackling Lack of Transparency

Those who were around in 2022 remember the transparency issues that plagued the industry through the likes of Celsius and others.
BounceBit incorporates on-chain proof-of-reserve (PoR), while also maintaining transparent activities in a bid to restore the trust and deliver a secure platform that allows BTC holders to earn interest.

Undoutedbly, BTC holders face the challenge of their assets being underutilized. BounceBit seeks to tackle this challenge by providing them with a means of actively engaging their assets in the thriving sectors of decentralized finance and NFTs.

Improving Bitcoin Utility by Enabling Additional Use Cases

By extension of the above, BounceBit also commits to expanding the overall utility of BTC and Bitcon’s network as a whole. The goal is to broaden the scope of opportunities for BTC holders and leverage the cryptocurrency as a major asset.

Unifying BTC Across Chains

BounceBit identifies the absence of a smart contract platform within Bitcoin’s ecosystem as limiting the overall development of dApps and works to provide one.

Understanding BounceBit’s Infrastructure
BounceBit is building a network that leverages the well-known Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to rethink conventional staking models that focus on a single token. They call this approach Dual-Token Proof of Stake (PoS).

In light of the above, it’s worth explaining that the protocol’s architecture incorporates a number of node operators. These can be selected as validators. These are parties that have to stake BB (the native token of BounceBit) and/or BBTC (staked BTC on the BounceBit chain). Their job is to record and verify the transactions on the network and as a reward – they receive transaction fees. As it’s a hybrid model, validators can choose to accept BBTC and/or BB tokens.
The purpose of accepting BTC, albeit staked, in the consensus mechanism, is to bootstrap the protocol with the deep liquidity that Bitcoin’s network has to offer, while also taking advantage of its relatively lower volatility.


Sustainable Validator Economics


In a bid to balance the requirements for operating the network, BounceBit empowers its validators to charge a commission on the staking rewards. This is an approach that attempts to ensure that validators are compensated appropriately for the important role that they play in maintaining the robustness and functionality of the network.

BounceBit’s chain is fully compatible with both the Ethereum Virtual Machine and with Solidity. The latter is the programming language that’s predominantly used to create smart contracts for Ethereum. This ensures that the migration for developers would be seamless while also leveraging the proven security and abundant ecosystem of Ethereum.


BounceClub: For Owners and Members


The BounceClub takes inspiration from Apple Inc.’s strive for innovation. It is an on-chain Web3 world where users are empowered to customize, launch, and engage with various dApps.
For BounceClub Owners -> If you meet the criteria to own a BounceClub, you will be able to select desired protocols from the BounceBit App Store and customize the space seamlessly and in a very user-friendly way. There’s a complete guide on it that you can find here.
For BounceClub Members -> Say you’re not interested in operating a BounceClub, you can still browse the various clubs that are created by other users and engage in different Web3 activities. You would only need to get your wallet connected.

The main purpose of the BTC bridge within BounceBit’s ecosystem is to provide a secure way of transferring BTC between Bitcoin’s network and other EVM Chains, including BounceBit.
It is a critical component of the functionality and the completion of BounceBit’s vision and purpose.
It’s important to note that network validators are responsible for maintaining the security of the bridge. Each validator also operates a bridge node. They contribute to the signing of cross-chain messages, taking the multi-signature approach multiple steps further. You can find out more about the BounceBit BTC bridge here.
The Liquid Staking Tokens
BounceBit has a native liquid staking smart contract. If users opt-in to stake their BB or BTC, they will receive an LST (liquid staking token). These are:

stBB – derived from staking BB
stBBTC – derived from staking BBTC (BTC staked on BounceBit)

These can be later restaked to Shared Security Clients with the aims of aggregating security and unlocking liquidity of staked assets. LSTs can be redeemed here by simply unstaking. Following the redemption request, users have to wait for 24 hours before they can claim.
BounceBit Economy: Everything You Need to Know About BB Tokenomics
First things first, BounceBit’s economy is primarily composed of three types of actors, all of which are relatively self-explanatory:

Users
BB Holders
Node operators

BB is the native token that powers the BounceBit platform. The total supply is capped at 2.1 billion (paying homage to the number of 21 million – Bitcoin’s capped supply.)
BB tokens can be used in multiple ways, so we will list a few of them:

Use BB to take part in the on-chain governance process
Stake BB to participate in the PoS Dual-token mechanism (read above)
BB is paid out as a reward for validators who secure the network
It’s the denomination of gas fees on the network

Here’s what the token release schedule looks like:

This is the BB token distribution:
Testnet & TVL Incentive: 4%
Investors: 21%
Team: 10%
Advisors: 5%
Binance Megadrop: 8%
Market Making: 3%
BounceClub & Ecosystem Reserve: 14%
Staking Reward & Delegation Program: 35%

The Binance Megadrop: Step by Step Guide
As you can see, the Binance Megadrop has 8% of the total supply reserved for it. It is a new token launch platform that’s designed to integrate Binance’s Simple Earn and the Web3 Wallet of the company.
It aims to provide users with early access to certain Web3 projects well before they are listed on the exchange.
The following is a step-by-step guide on how to participate in the Binance Megadrop for BounceBit.
There are two ways to participate, and both require a Binance account.
You can register one using this link and also earn a $600 welcome bonus as an exclusive deal for CryptoPotato readers!
Now that your account is ready, the first thing you can do is navigate to the Megadrop section and lock your BNB to earn scores. From there, you can subscribe to your BNB and lock it for a certain period of time, thus earning a score.

As you can see, the longer the subscription period, the higher the multiplier is.
The next thing you can do is complete Web3 quests. To do so, you will need the Binance Web3 Wallet. You can create one from your Binance mobile application. Navigate to your “wallets” tab at the bottom and then tap on the “Web3” at the top.

From here, simply follow the instructions, and your Web3 wallet will be generated. Now that your wallet is complete, navigate back to the Megadrop section and hit the “Start Quest” at the bottom – you will have to stake with BounceBit.
From there on, you can follow the instructions, which will guide you toward quest completion.
The total score you receive will be a combination of your Locked BNB score, your Web3 quest multiplier, and will also add your Web3 quest bonus. So the formula looks like this:
Total Score = (Locked BNB Score * Web3 Quest Multiplier) + Web3 Quest Bonus.
If you fail to finish all the quests, you will receive a multiplier of just 1.

MarginFi To Launch Solana LST-Backed Decentralized Stablecoin This Month - The Defiant

MarginFi said XBY will be the first major decentralized stablecoin on Solana.MarginFi, the sixth-largest DeFi protocol on Solana by TVL, announced it expects to launch XBY, its yield-accruing decentralized stablecoin, this month.Speaking during the Solana Crossroads 2024 conference, MacBrennan Peet, the co-founder of MarginFi, said his team is in the process of wrapping up the second audit for XBY and aims to launch the stablecoin before June.Peet said XBY will be entirely collateralized by SOL-based liquid staking protocols (LSTs), providing Solana with a decentralized stablecoin that can offset the network’s reliance on USDC, the second-largest centralized stablecoin.“Solana DeFi as a whole right now is completely reliant on USDC,” Peet said. "If USDC depegged like it did a year ago and stayed depegged, Solana DeFi would be in a really rough spot — USDC underlines all major trading pairs."He added that the project has already secured roughly $12 million in initially committed liquidity, and hopes to attract more than $100 million before launching.The news of XBY’s impending launch comes one month after MarginFi’s co-founder and CEO, Edgar Pavlovsky, abruptly resigned from the project. The move appeared to result from an apparent disagreement over whether the project should launch a governance token despite early users already accruing points — which typically qualify holders for future airdrops.Many MarginFi users rushed to remove their assets from the protocol in response to Pavlovsky stepping down, with more than $300 million or close to half of MarginFi’s TVL leaving the protocol over just a few days.However, Peet said Pavlosky’s exit was not due to differences over whether the project would launch a token, instead attributing the decision to the stress demands placed on Pavlovsky as CEO.“There wasn’t really any disagreements over a token,” Peet said. “It’s really stressful — this is a 24/7 job, there’s no weekends in building an on-chain finance protocol.”Peet also confirmed that MarginFi will launch a governance token in the future and is quietly working on building out its governance token."MarginFi is designed to be decentralized, to have a token,” Peet said. “The Margin Foundation isn’t as interested in putting out a token just for the sake of putting out a token. We’re interested in having a token where it means something and where it has embedded real governance weight."Peet added that the heavy withdrawals comprised robust “stress-testing” for MarginFi, with the protocol continuing to operate smoothly despite the heavy withdrawals.XBY stablecoinXBY will comprise a rebasing stablecoin, meaning users’ balances will increase as yield is accrued to the token.XBY yields will initially come from the staking rewards generated from the token’s LST collateral, with holders also set to earn MarginFi lending yields at a later date. Peet noted that MarginFi users have already deposited “hundreds of millions of dollars in LSTs” onto the protocol that can be used as collateral for XBY minting from the moment the protocol is live.Peet said that “major protocols and DEXes” within Solana’s DeFi ecosystem plan to support XBY, providing additional opportunities for users to generate yield.Peet acknowledged that XBY’s market cap will be constrained by the capitalization of SOL-based LSTs, adding that MarginFi intends to expand its supported collateral in the future.“We’re very focused on starting with LSTs, but that doesn’t mean doesn’t mean we can’t expand outside of that,” Peet said. “There's a lot of other options outside of USDT or USDC, for example, in terms of forms of collateral.”Peet also revealed that MarginFI plans to launch the first “integrated stableswap” feature following XBY’s deployment. The product will allow users to trade between stablecoins using the existing liquidity deposited in MarginFi, meaning users will simultaneously earn lending yields and swap fees.

How Solana dApps can help SOL in Q2 2024 - AMBCrypto



Solana ecosystem witnessed an uptick in activity and development activity.
Interest in Solana’s DeFi and NFTs declined.

Solana [SOL] attracted large amounts of activity on its network due to the recent popularity of its meme coins.
However, it’s not just the meme coins that have been attracting users to the Solana network – dApps on the Solana network have also played a crucial part.
Taking a look at Solana’s ecosystem
Popular dApps such as Wormhole, Jupiter and Pyth network have managed to gain a large number of active addresses over the past few weeks.
Development Activity on these dApps also grew, which suggested that the new updates and upgrades might be on the way. These new developments could help attract even more users to the network.
Source: Santiment
Over the past few weeks, the number of daily transactions occurring on the Solana network had grown from 20 million to 30 million.
However, the number of daily active addresses on the network had remained the same.
This indicated that the high number of transactions on the network were not being driven by new addresses but the same old ones.
Source: Artemis
Some challenges ahead
In the DeFi sector, the Solana network faced some problems. The DEX (Decentralized Exchange) volumes on the network fell significantly over the last few days. Coupled with that, the TVL (Total Value Locked) began to stagnate.
Source: Artemis
Solana was also observed to be seeing a decline in interest in its NFT sector. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Solana Floor’s data indicated that the total floor value of Solana NFTs had fallen significantly over the last few days.
The volume of NFTs being sold on the Solana network had also declined during this period.
Source: SolanaFloor
These factors could impact the Solana ecosystem negatively and prove to be a hindrance in the growth of the ecosystem, going forward.

A waning interest in Solana’s ecosystem may have adverse impacts on the price of the SOL token as well. At press time, SOL was trading at $146.24 and its price had declined by 4.84% in the last 24 hours. 
The volume at which SOL was trading at had also fallen by 9.53% during this period.

Tron DeFi On Fire: Ecosystem Surges Past $21 Billion Milestone


								The Tron decentralized finance (DeFi) space is on fire, exceeding a staggering $21.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to recent reports. This surge signifies a robust and flourishing DeFi ecosystem on the Tron blockchain. However, investors should be aware of a potential short-term dip in the price of Tron’s native token, TRX.

Tron DeFi: A Haven For Crypto Investors
The TVL metric serves as a crucial indicator of DeFi activity, reflecting the total value of crypto assets deposited within DeFi protocols. Tron’s surpassing of the $21.7 billion mark signifies a significant influx of user funds and a growing appetite for Tron-based DeFi offerings.
This positive trend is further amplified by the success of leading projects like Just Cryptos, boasting a TVL of $7.1 billion, and JustLend DAO, a lending and staking platform with a TVL of $6.4 billion. Both protocols have witnessed impressive growth in recent times, highlighting the vibrancy of Tron’s DeFi landscape.


Beyond The Headlines: A Stellar Q1 For Tron
Tron’s success story extends beyond its thriving DeFi ecosystem. Recent data from Messari reveals a stellar first quarter of 2024 for the network. Tron witnessed positive growth across various key metrics, including market cap, revenue generation, and user base.

TXR is now trading at $0.12. Chart: TradingView
Notably, Tron’s Q1 revenue reached a record-breaking $128 million, solidifying its position among the top revenue-generating blockchain networks. Furthermore, March saw a significant surge in daily active addresses (DAAs) on the Tron network, surpassing a remarkable 2 million mark.
This surge in user activity underscores the network’s growing popularity and user adoption. Additionally, Tron celebrated a significant milestone by exceeding 200 million total accounts, signifying a continuously expanding user base.
Short-Term Jitters In TRX Price
While Tron’s DeFi and overall network performance paint a rosy picture, investors should be mindful of a potential short-term price dip in TRX. Over the past 24 hours, the price of TRX has experienced a slight decline of 1%.

Over the past week, TRX has demonstrated resilience with a 1.32% increase, even outperforming the global cryptocurrency market.
The Road Ahead
Tron’s DeFi ecosystem is experiencing phenomenal growth, attracting significant user investment and fostering a thriving community. The network’s overall performance in Q1 2024 was impressive, with positive growth across multiple metrics. However, investors should be aware of a potential short-term price dip in TRX, as suggested by technical indicators.

Avalanche (AVAX) Price Dips As Market Turbulence Persists


																AVAX is the native utility token of the Avalanche blockchain. The token is currently ranked 12th by market cap, with a total supply of 440,043,419 AVAX and a total trading volume of over $396,250,098 in the last 24 hours. Since its recent pullback at $36.15, AVAX has continued to move downward.
Currently, the general cryptocurrency market is bearish. This has led to the price of AVAX dropping below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the price might continue to drop in the next couple of days. As of the time of writing, the price of AVAX was trading around $33.52 and about 0.22% down in the last 24 hours.
Technical Indicators Point Toward A Sustained Downtrend For AVAX
To figure out where the AVAX price might be headed next, the following indicators can be used to examine the chart.
4-Day MACD: A technical look at the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, the MACD histograms are trending below the zero line, and both the MACD line and the Signal line crossed each other while trending below the MACD zero line, indicating a continuous movement on the downside. This can be seen in the below image.

4-Day RSI: The formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the above image also suggests a downward continuation movement as the RSI signal line is seen to have moved above the 50% level and then dropped below it. This suggests that sellers are still very much active in the market therefore overpowering the strength of buyers.
Alligator Indicator: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that AVAX is trading below the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth have both successfully crossed above the alligator jaw. It can also be seen that the price tried to move above the alligator lines but failed to do so, suggesting that the price might continue to move in its downward direction.

The Coin Could Form A New Low
Conclusively, from the previous downward movement, AVAX has formed two resistance levels of $39.94 and $36.15 and a support level of $30.34. Currently, AVAX is moving toward this support level and if it breaks above this level, the price might drop even further to create a new low. 
On the contrary, if the price fails to break above this support, it will reverse and start an upward movement toward its previous resistance level of $36.15. Should AVAX manage to break above this resistance level, the price might move further to test the $39.94 resistance level.

Ethereum ETFs: Here Are All the Applications Awaiting SEC Approval - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFollowing the historic approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, industry observers are now wondering when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could give the green light to an Ethereum equivalent. For those who don’t know, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a popular investment vehicle that trades on a stock exchange. It allows investors to buy shares that track the price of an underlying asset—which could be anything from gold and foreign currencies to crypto and tech stocks. If approved, a spot Ethereum ETF—just like a Bitcoin one—would mean a fund manager would take care of buying and storing the ETH digital coins, and invite people to buy shares that track their value. This would give people exposure to the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Several prestigious financial firms have filed S-1 forms with the SEC. In short, companies file such forms to alert the regulator that they plan to offer securities to the public, and to provide a detailed breakdown of their business. Here are the filings currently sitting on the SEC’s desk awaiting approval. The SEC decision deadline for the proposed products varies from end of May to early August.BlackRockBlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, filed an S-1 form for its proposed iShares Ethereum Trust back in November. The SEC delayed making a decision on the fund manager’s potential product earlier this year and now has until August 7. The firm’s CEO, Larry Fink, is seemingly enthusiastic about the cryptocurrency and its network, and has said that there is “value in having an Ethereum ETF.” He has also talked about “tokenization” being inevitable. GrayscaleCrypto asset manager Grayscale is awaiting an answer from the SEC after filing a proposal in October to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF. The current trust right now operates like a closed-end fund; the idea is that as an ETF, it would be easier for investors to redeem shares. Its Bitcoin Trust converted into an ETF in January, so there’s already precedent for how such a crypto vehicle can transition over to a spot ETF.Grayscale is a big part of the reason why Bitcoin ETFs are trading in the U.S. right now. In a landmark moment for the crypto industry last year, a judge sided with the firm in a lawsuit, agreeing with the firm that Wall Street’s biggest regulator lacked a coherent explanation for denying its proposed conversion to a Bitcoin ETF after years of denials.The ruling paved the way for the SEC to give the green light to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Despite this, the SEC doesn’t appear to be in a hurry to say yes to the latest approval—it pushed back on giving a decision in January. The regulator now has until June 18 to say yes or no. And just last month, the firm filed for a “mini” Ethereum Trust as well. The idea with the fund is that it would have lower fees for shareholders. Ark Invest/21SharesCathie Wood’s heavyweight tech investment management firm, ARK Invest, filed a proposal with the SEC for an Ethereum ETF back in September. The ETF is in partnership with crypto ETF issuer 21Shares and names Coinbase, America’s biggest digital asset exchange, as its custodian—meaning that the recognized company would hold and store the ETH in the product. The decision deadline for the product is May 24. FidelityFinancial services giant Fidelity made it clear that it wanted to drop an Ethereum ETF back in November when Cboe—the exchange where the product would trade—filed a 19b-4 on behalf of the firm. Then, in March, the massive firm filed its S-1 with the SEC for its Fidelity Ethereum Fund. The SEC will make a decision on the product on August 3. VanEckAsset manager VanEck was the first fund manager to file a proposal for an Ethereum ETF with the SEC back in 2021. It later that year withdrew its proposal and has since filed again. The firm’s Bitcoin ETF has been a successful product, and VanEck even waived its fees to better compete with the other funds on the market. On May 23, the SEC is due to give a decision on the product. HashdexThe Nasdaq in September filed a proposal on behalf of Brazilian fund manager Hashdex for its Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF. Hashdex has several crypto ETFs already trading in Brazil. In the U.S., its Hashdex Bitcoin ETF was given the green light by the SEC in January but isn’t yet trading on a stock exchange. It said in March that it would convert its Bitcoin futures ETF into the spot ETF at a later date. The SEC will give a decision on May 30. Franklin TempletonWall Street giant Franklin Templeton entered the race in February when it filed a proposal with the SEC. Its filing for the proposed Franklin Ethereum Trust mentions staking, the process of locking up digital coins or tokens to keep a blockchain ticking along. Its proposal says that it “may, from time to time, stake a portion of the Fund’s assets through one or more trusted staking providers.” The SEC will make a decision on the product on June 11.Invesco/Galaxy DigitalAsset management giant Invesco submitted a proposal with Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital for an ETH ETF back in September. The S-1 form mentions that Invesco would be the sponsor for the product, while Galaxy Digital would work as its “execution agent”—selling ETH to pay the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF’s expenses. The SEC will approve, deny, or delay the product on July 7.BitwiseDigital asset investment firm Bitwise filed its S-1 form with the SEC to offer a spot Ethereum ETF back in March. Like Franklin Templeton’s filing, Bitwise also mentions staking, noting that its Bitwise Ethereum Trust may stake a portion of the fund's assets through trusted staking providers to earn additional rewards. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, has said that he expects ETH ETFs to launch in December—and predicted they would be more successful if approved later in the year anyway. Edited by Andrew HaywardStay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Like Bitcoin Founder Satoshi, Pi Creator Turns Into Myste...


                                Pi's Creator Nicolas Kokkalis Missing for an Extended Period                                Before the Pi Network Mainnet goes live people on social media platforms have invented trends that taking place. Before the network goes live, miners mine massive amounts of Pi coins hoping to make money by selling their tokens. Thus, the trend carries on and the Pi team ensures that the network and Pi Coin are being informed regularly about these activities. However, something about Pi is different. The founder of Pi Network, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis has allegedly been absent from the company for a lengthy period and has recently resigned. Plenty have commented on the fact that Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis's absence now has become a significant mystery. People on social media develop their hypothesis which they spread on the internet. Nicolas Kokkalis's Mystery is creating RumorsSome people even guess if Nicolas Kokkalis is still alive or dead. Many individuals debated the validity of the Pi Network, once the contents of this software were publicized. Some people are asking for the verification of the Pi Network while others don't trust it and this has led to the concerns being raised in the social media circles. So far, the Pi Network team has not made any of this supposed story about Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis official but remained silent on the matter.This situation has given the owners of Pi another reason to live in fear. Nevertheless, one of his old comments has shown up in the media, giving the perception of sensational news.  This could be an attempt to get people to discover his trustworthiness. Yet, the chief question concerning the reason for the founder's disappearance is implied by him.Pi Creator's story Sounds similar to the Bitcoin Founder's Story                  The question of why Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis, the founder of Pi, has gone missing makes us think of the Satoshi Nakamoto story—the one about the person who invented Bitcoin. After the charity of 2008, the Bitcoin white paper was released in 2008, thus one year later in 2009, Bitcoin was distributed. In 2010, Bitcoin held the spotlight of mainstream media as the general public started to recognize and utilize it. Finally, in 2012 or so, a looming silence replaced Satoshi Nakamoto’s name and he stated that he would be concentrating on other things. Now, after almost a decade, no one has seen or heard of Satoshi Nakamoto, and he is still a mystery. This is the case with the disappearance of Nicolas Kokkalis, the founder of Pi Network, who adopted such a mysterious move as the toll of his protagonist's fictional character.Some think that maybe it is just a mere coincidence, instead of it being something more. It implies that maybe he is also working on some sort of marketing or preparations for the launching of the Pi Network on June 28th. Inviting clarification here may be on the wise, Wait till Pi Network begins to serve. This way, people will be able to learn the main idea and fat consistencies faster.Also Read: U.S. Contemplates Digital Asset Oversight Through FIT21

Crypto Analyst Says These Memecoins Could Be the ‘Largest Narrative’ Amid the November US Elections - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto trader says that the build-up to the US presidential election in November could send two memecoins soaring.
Pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,000 followers on the social media platform X that meme tokens MAGA (TRUMP) and Jeo Boden (BODEN) could outperform due to election year excitement.










TRUMP is inspired by former president Donald Trump, who is running for president again. BODEN is inspired by US President Joe Biden, who is running for re-election against Trump and refers to a misspelling of his name.
“Current meme strategy for me: concentration in one sector, USA politics. I own TRUMP and I want to buy BODEN. Should be the largest narrative when the election stuff really gets going later this year. Trump is going to constantly be in the news and doing his normal antics.” 
Meanwhile, blockchain analytics platform Santiment is noticing an apparent correlation between the two memecoins’ price action and the behavior of the two candidates.
“Much of the attribution to these latest memecoin rises are going to Donald Trump and his pro-crypto endorsements. As shown, mentions of Trump soared near the cryptocurrency local bottom, along with Biden, who traders fear anti-crypto policies.”
Source: Santiment/X
TRUMP is trading for $5.40 at time of writing, down more than 7% in the last 24 hours. BODEN is trading for $0.303 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

Ethereum's Price Impending Drop to $2500


The crypto market has recently witnessed a downturn, marked by significant price drops in major assets like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
Particularly, Ethereum (ETH) seems to be grappling with pronounced bearish trends, leading many crypto analysts to predict further declines for the second-largest crypto by market capitalization.
Ethereum Risks Falling to $2500
According to a recent investor advisory by crypto research firm 10X Research, Ethereum’s potential descent to $2500 is a concern due to its weakened fundamentals. They noted Ethereum’s inconsistent performance in the current market cycle, a departure from its role as a catalyst for bullish runs in previous cycles.
The firm emphasized Ethereum’s impact on Bitcoin’s growth in this cycle, highlighting a strong correlation between the two, with an R-square of 95%. Ethereum’s declining fundamentals are seen as a hurdle to widespread fiat inflow into the crypto ecosystem, thereby impeding Bitcoin’s rise.


“Ethereum: the No.2 token in the world continues to disappoint both from the fundamental and technical perspectives. The below Daily Chart looks particularly weak to me. If 2950 breaks, we will easily see 2500-2600 range in a crash,” Daniel Yan, the Founder and CIO at Kryptanium Capital said.

Meanwhile, the poor price forecast may stem from reduced network activity on the mainnet, leading to record-low average transaction fees. According to blockchain analytical platform IntoTheBlock, an increasing number of transactions are now settled on Ethereum Layer 2s, with the three largest L2s accounting for a record 82% transaction share of all Ethereum transactions last month.

This coincides with developments concerning spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. On May 10, Ark 21 Shares revised their spot Ethereum ETF proposal, dropping staking plans. 
Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that the alteration might aim to refine application documents based on SEC feedback, though there have been no comments on the application.

“While it may seem like this is them getting their docs in shape based on SEC comments (which would be good news) there hasn’t been any comments. So its prob either a Hail Mary or maybe trying to give SEC one less thing to use in their rejection. Not sure (yet),” Balchunas said.

Despite this, the amendment seems to have increased the likelihood of spot Ethereum ETF approval on Polymarket, an on-chain predictions protocol. Data on the site indicated that the approval chances nearly doubled to 14% as of May 10 following the applicants’ move.
Nevertheless, expectations for approval remain subdued due to the SEC’s reserved stance on Ethereum ETF applications.

Short squeeze alert for the week: Two cryptocurrencies with potential to skyrocket


Cryptocurrency short-sellers have benefited in the last two months amid a short-term downtrend for the crypto market since March. Conversely, Finbold has spotted two cryptocurrencies signaling potential short squeezes and price surges for next week.
In this context, bullish diverges appeared in the price charts and among notable technical indicators, signaling a trend reversal. This fuels the usual short-squeeze alerts: negative funding rates, short-position volume increases, and leverage liquidations accumulation at higher levels.
Moreover, a rising optimism in India with reopened doors for offshore crypto exchanges validates the market potential for the following weeks from a regulatory and fundamental perspective.


As a result, cryptocurrencies that hold significant imbalances in the derivatives market could be the first to skyrocket.
Short squeeze alert for Avalanche (AVAX)
Avalanche (AVAX) is one of the likely cryptocurrencies to suffer a short squeeze next week, potentially sending its price skyrocketing. In particular, considering a relevant weekly open interest for short positions among cryptocurrency traders.
This has increased the negative funding rates for AVAX, with short-sellers paying a 5.8% APR to long-position traders. Finbold retrieved this data from CoinGlass on May 11, alongside other relevant indicators.
Funding Rate Heatmap: AVAX. Source: CoingGlass
Notably, Avalanche’s 1-month liquidation heatmap shows a critical liquidity pool at $40 per token, which could become a short-squeeze target. A rally to this level would reward AVAX traders with over 17% quick gains from current prices at $34.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price skyrocketing potential
Similarly, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has a notable negative funding rate of 10.06%, with the 10th highest open interest in the market.
Funding Rate Heatmap: BCH. Source: CoingGlass
Meanwhile, BCH could go as high as $625 after hitting the previous liquidation target of $500 in two short-squeeze events. This would result in gains from 16% to 45%, considering Bitcoin Cash currently trades at $430.

However, other factors could prevent the forecasted trend reversal and short squeezes for AVAX, BCH, or other cryptocurrencies. Traders must remain cautious while opening leveraged positions and speculating in this volatile landscape.

Here’s Why US Election Will Determine Future of Ethereum ETFs


							

Analysts argue that Ethereum spot ETFs may be delayed until the end of 2025. 



They cite the SEC’s lack of engagement and ETH’s uncertain regulatory standing.



However, Donald Trump becoming president could be a game-changer given his pro-crypto stance.




The fate of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States appears to hang on the outcome of the upcoming presidential election. This outlook comes as expectations grow that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will deny current applications for Ethereum spot ETFs on May 23. 



Experts such as Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas have voiced pessimistic views about ETH ETF approvals this month, citing SEC’s lack of engagement with issuers and Ethereum’s uncertain regulatory standing.



Moreover, they argued that the SEC’s ongoing investigation into the Ethereum Foundation further bolsters the skepticism. Balchunas believes that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs may be delayed until at least the end of 2025. 



Upon denial this month, prospective issuers, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest, are left with two tough choices: to follow in Grayscale’s footsteps and sue the SEC over the rejection or to wait and refile later.



Meanwhile, the U.S. election could be a game-changer, with the potential return of Donald Trump to the presidency. During an interview with CNBC in March, Trump asserted that his administration will allow Americans to pay for goods with Bitcoin. Additionally, Trump promised his government would not crack down on cryptocurrency.



Given Trump’s pro-crypto stance, Balchunas remarked, “If there’s a new president, you file again. Maybe you get approved. Or you sue. Either way, that will take a whole other year to play out.” Essentially, the upcoming election presents a critical juncture for the future of Ethereum ETFs.



Regarding taking legal action, despite Grayscale’s successful lawsuit against the SEC for Bitcoin spot ETFs, a similar legal battle for Ethereum ETFs seems unlikely. Grayscale has already faced over $12 billion in outflows after converting its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. 









As a result, the firm may not be eager to engage in another costly legal confrontation. Besides, other issuers are hesitant to antagonize the SEC, with the Bloomberg analyst stating, “None of these other firms want to piss off the SEC. Nobody else will step up.” 



With Trump as president, the crypto community expects that he would appoint a more favorable SEC chairman than Gary Gensler. If a new SEC chair is appointed by mid-2025 and filings are promptly resubmitted, the approval process could extend to December 2025.

Interpol Nigeria boosts cybersecurity with virtual asset training

The Nigerian Interpol, cybersecurity experts, and other members of the local intelligence community met to brainstorm ways to tackle the rising waves of cybercrime in the country.The brainstorming, which took place in the nation’s capital, Abuja, under the training platform organized by A&D Forensics in partnership with the Africa Stablecoin Consortium, was said to have been designed to position the Nigerian Interpol on how to mitigate crimes involving virtual assets, particularly stablecoins.According to blockchain specialist Chioma Onyekelu, the training session aimed to empower Interpol agents with the skills to leverage blockchain intelligence and analysis in tracing and prosecuting cybercriminals involved in cryptocurrency transactions, specifically those using Bitcoin and stablecoins.Source: Africa Stablecoin ConsortiumOnyekelu stated that cybercrime has evolved beyond traditional fiat currency, with criminals now exploiting virtual assets to commit various cyber offenses. As Nigeria’s Interpol receives cybercrime requests from international partners, it is crucial to enhance their capabilities through targeted training sessions. Given Nigeria’s growing involvement with virtual asset exchanges, Onyekelu explained that the training will enable officers to effectively address cybercrimes involving virtual assets, particularly stablecoins.Adedeji Owonibi, Senior Partner at A&D Forensics, told the press that the training was imperative due to the rising cybercrime trends in the country. He pointed out that, “A significant gap exists between the evolving cybercrimes and the capabilities of law enforcement agencies in Nigeria. As responsible corporate citizens, we recognized the need to bridge this gap and support our law enforcement agencies in staying updated and effectively combating cybercrimes.”Regarding the controversies generated by the recent introduction of the cybersecurity Levy, Owonibi argued that while cybersecurity may be controversial, the government has the authority to make decisions on matters that impact national security, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing the nation’s security interests.Related: Ghana’s crypto stamps honor king’s Silver JubileeOn Monday, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) mandated banks and other payment service providers to begin deducting 0.5% of the total value of electronic transactions and remit to the National Cybersecurity Fund to be managed by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA).Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on cryptocurrency, banning peer-to-peer exchanges that use the naira, signaling a significant regulatory shift.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently recommended that Nigeria embrace crypto adoption through licensing global cryptocurrency exchanges as a part of its economic reformation measures.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Led by Bitcoin, Ethereum, here's why the crypto market is down today - AMBCrypto



The crypto market is down today due to a significant correction phase.
Bitcoin struggles around the $56,000 support level, with technical indicators suggesting a potential reversal.

Checking the crypto market today, you will see nothing but red. The entire market seems to have tumbled, with Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] taking most hits, dropping far below their critical support levels.
Bullish sentiments in the community seem to be almost completely gone. Once again, investors are panicking, possibly at the edge of giving up. So, what is going on? Why is the crypto market down now?
2024 is generally expected to be a highly bullish year for the markets. And it has. But we are currently dealing with a strong case of the corrections. 
Data from Coinglass shows us that both tokens have seen more inflows than outflows in the past twenty-four hours. Also, liquidations are relatively low.
On the 10th of May, titans of the U.S. banking sector, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, made headlines with their disclosures of holding spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
Yet, this revelation has barely made a ripple in the overall market dynamics. Bitcoin, for one, seems stuck in a prolonged correction cycle, stubbornly testing investor patience.
Source: Coinglass
Why is the crypto market flailing?
The immediate support level for BTC now is somewhere around $56,000, for traders. Breakout is still imminent, as is widely expected by the community.
 Data from TradingView tells us that this is where fear and optimism collide, where traders hover between hope for a breakout and dread of further decline.
Bitcoin is retesting its former all-time high resistance levels, now as new support zones. 
This activity shows a typical case of RSI Bullish Divergence on the 4-hour chart, hinting that the downtrend’s momentum is losing steam and might soon reverse. 
Yet, the currency is still navigating through the perilous falling wedge pattern—a technical indicator suggesting that while the end of the tunnel may be near, the road remains filled with fear and uncertainty.
The community’s consensus leans towards an eventual breakout, which could catapult Bitcoin’s value to new heights, potentially reaching as high as $78,000 in the bullish surges to come. 
Source: TradingView
As for Ethereum, its current trajectory is slightly different from Bitcoin’s. The Ethereum derivatives market is showing signs of increased activity and investor interest, according to Glassnode. 
Open Interest has surged by 50%, indicating a strong engagement with Ethereum’s financial products.
However, despite these positive indicators in derivatives, Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin this cycle is much slower. 
The lag in speculative interest, particularly from the Short-Term Holder group, is a cautious approach among these investors. 
Meanwhile, Long-Term Holders seem to remain on the sidelines, eyeing more lucrative opportunities for profit-taking in future rallies. 
Source: Glassnode
At press time, Ethereum was worth $2,897.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

Even as it battles through the current market downturn, the growing interest in its derivatives suggests that these holders may soon see the favorable conditions they are waiting for.
All in all, the reason for the retreat is that the market is still consolidating, and experts expect a breakout regardless. Investors are advised not to give up. 2024 is still crypto’s year.

PEPE Coin Gains Momentum, Eyes Continued Growth | Bitcoinist.com


								Despite the current downturn of the crypto market, PEPE coin has been one of the tokens that is still holding strong as its price is still trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the trendline.
The token whose total liquidity is valued at over $38 million and a 24-hour trading volume of over $4.9 million once dropped below the moving average, touched the trendline, and is currently trending above the moving average once again.
As of the time of writing, PEPE is still trending above both the 100-day SMA and the trendline. The price is currently trading at $0.00000872, indicating about 3.57% increase in the last 24 hours.
Technical Indicators Reveal Signs Of Continued Upward Movement For PEPE
4-hour RSI Indicator: Looking at the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, it can be observed that the RSI line is trending above the 50 level. This indicates the price is still bullish at the moment. Also, there is a divergence between the price action and the RSI line as indicated by the red lines in the image, which suggests a future potential drop in price.

4-hour MACD: Looking at the formation of the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe in the above image, we can also see that both the MACD line and the signal line crossed above the MACD zero line suggesting a continuation of the uptrend. On the other hand, the MACD histogram is already trending above the MACD zero line, suggesting that the price of PEPE is still bullish.
4-hour Alligator: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that the price of PEPE is trading above the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth are both above the alligator jaw. It can also be observed that the price dropped below the alligator line and then moved above the lines again, suggesting that the price might continue to move in the upward direction.

Final Note
Currently, the price of PEPE is moving toward the resistance level of $0.00000916 and if it manages to break past this level, it might move further up to retest its all-time high.
On the contrary, if the price fails to break above this resistance level, it will start to move downward toward its previous support level of $0.00000756. And if it breaks below the support level, it might even move further towards the $0.00000591 support level.

Here's why you should closely watch these 2 cryptocurrencies in May


In the short term, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a prevalent trend of trading in the red zone following the Bitcoin (BTC) halving. Bitcoin, in particular, is at the forefront of uncertainty as it struggles to maintain its price above $60,000.
As May progresses, attention is directed towards whether historical post-halving patterns will manifest. Amidst this uncertainty, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies worth monitoring for their potential to stand out.
XRP
In May, XRP investors are closely monitoring the ongoing Ripple and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) case, which is nearing its conclusion. XRP stakeholders anticipate that the case’s resolution will trigger a rally in the token, which has been labeled a “crypto zombie” due to its lack of significant movement.


In the latest development, the SEC filed its final reply in the lawsuit’s remedies stage, disputing Ripple’s assertion of non-recklessness and contesting “widespread uncertainty” regarding XRP’s legal status. Despite the court’s prior dismissal of Ripple’s “fair notice” defense, XRP’s value declined.
The SEC continues to question whether Ripple may engage in similar actions in the future despite no rule violations since the 2020 XRP lawsuit began. Additionally, the SEC rejected Ripple Labs’ $10 million settlement offer for allegedly selling XRP to institutional investors, insisting on a $2 billion penalty and deeming Ripple’s offer insufficient.
Positive developments favoring Ripple could potentially boost XRP, targeting a rally towards $1, with market attention focused on the token’s ability to maintain strength above the $0.50 support level. 
According to Evai CEO Matthew Dixon, the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, scheduled for release on May 15, could awaken XRP, which he described as a “sleeping giant.” Dixon believes a weaker-than-expected CPI reading could be a bullish catalyst, potentially propelling XRP above the $0.60 mark.

Furthermore, market participants will closely monitor Ripple XRP token unlocks, which could impact the token’s valuation.
By press time, XRP was trading at $0.50, experiencing a 24-hour loss of over 2%. On the weekly chart, XRP has declined by over 6%.

Toncoin (TON)
Despite prevailing bearish market sentiments, Telegram-linked Toncoin (TON) stands out as one of the cryptocurrencies exhibiting significant gains. Recent data from Santiment revealed that Toncoin has achieved the fastest network growth among leading cryptocurrencies over the past six months.
During this period, the network saw a more than doubling of non-zero wallets to 16.8k. In contrast, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) experienced growth rates of 10% and 11%, respectively.

In the short term, TON is trading in a bullish zone, attracting investor attention for May as it seeks to sustain its gains. Notably, TON’s recent upward momentum can be attributed to the increasing popularity of the Telegram game community token, Notcoin (NOT).
The integration of Notcoin into top crypto exchanges like Binance has bolstered its visibility among crypto investors.
Toncoin may continue to rally as May progresses, fueled by growing interest in the Notcoin listing. Many platforms require investors to stake their TON tokens to acquire Notcoin.
At the time of reporting, Toncoin was trading at $6.69, marking a nearly 17% increase over the past seven days.

However, it’s essential to note that these highlighted cryptocurrencies remain susceptible to overall market sentiment despite these positive fundamentals.

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) to Surge 8,000% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gensler Devil (GENDEV), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gensler Devil presents a similar opportunity.



Gensler Devil has a market cap below $14,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Gensler Devil could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Gensler Devil can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gensler Devil on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gensler Devil by entering its contract address – GwoY3GpqrSmws6QW88CyDaJkkTNfrQLGN2zZ1rSbJ6z9 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GENDEV.

FTX's Bear Refunds | Bankless


1️⃣ FTX's Bear Market Claim RecoveryIn an unexpected turn, claims from the FTX bankruptcy have surged above 100 cents on the dollar, according to a draft recovery plan estimating most creditors could see a recovery rate of 118%. In tandem, claim buying — where people’s claims are sold on secondary markets — continues to increase over concerns about tax implications and the ability to cash USD checks. As a result, FTX claims now trade between 101% and 112% — a seller’s market. Of course, these percentages still aren't making claimants jump for joy; remember claims have been sized against Bitcoin’s price as of Dec. 2022, when the asset was priced at around $16k ☠️2️⃣ Bitcoin Continues to StumbleDespite a solid start to the week, Bitcoin erased the gains that brought it to a high of $63.5K. Friday morning, It fell sharply to trade at~$60K following disappointing U.S. economic data, hawkish comments about inflation and monetary policy, and >$56M of liquidations in the previous 24 hours. The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Survey, indicating a drop in consumer confidence, did not help. Next Wednesday, May 15th, April’s Consumer Price Index data will be released, most likely impacting Bitcoin’s price — hopefully to the upside. 3️⃣ Trump's Crypto Embrace, Biden's VetoCrypto found a spotlight moment in the Presidential campaign, this time with Trump. During the former president’s NFT trading card event, he stated he was “fine with crypto” — sending TREMP on Solana and TRUMP on Ethereum soaring 187% and 43%, respectively, over the next 24 hours. Trump's comments offered a stark contrast to President Biden's recent action of a veto on legislation easing capital requirements for banks handling crypto. This stance by Trump has ignited discussions within crypto, where many see his potential re-election as a positive shift for the industry.4️⃣ Nigeria Detaining Binance ExecThis week, Binance CEO Richard Teng called for the release of Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive detained in Nigeria for over two months. In a statement, he explained that Gambaryan was one of two detained executives, though the other executive managed to escape the country. The detentions occurred during a regulatory discussion, sparking international concern about the treatment of foreign business representatives. Additionally, the Nigerian government's recent decision to ban crypto trading in the local currency, which they believe harms the Naira, has increased tensions. Added to this are claims from Binance of ransom requests from Nigeria, alleging they asked for $150M in crypto for the release of Gambaryan.5️⃣ Robinhood Hit with Wells NoticeThe SEC's weaponization of Wells Notices continues; this week, they hit Robinhood over its crypto division. In response, Dan Gallagher, Robinhood's Chief Legal, Compliance, and Corporate Affairs Officer, expressed disappointment over the SEC's approach, emphasizing the company's position that the listed assets do not classify as securities. Gallagher also stated that the company had met with the SEC over a dozen times to try to register as a Special Assets Broker, although the SEC did not reciprocate the efforts and cut the process short. This latest announcement follows other Wells Notices sent to Uniswap and MetaMask over the past few months.

Dogecoin’s ‘golden cross’ could spark a 100% price rally for DOGE


Dogecoin (DOGE), the leading meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is signaling a possible bullish trend with the emergence of a “golden cross” pattern in its technical charts.
This pattern previously foreshadowed a significant price rally in early 2021. Currently priced at $0.1438, DOGE has declined by 4.70% over the past day but has shown robust year-to-date (YTD) growth of 60.32%, significantly outpacing Bitcoin (BTC), which has seen a YTD increase of 43.565%.
The 50-week simple moving average (SMA) of Dogecoin’s spot price is trending upwards and is projected to surpass the 200-week SMA soon, potentially forming a “golden cross”.


This bullish technical pattern, which hasn’t occurred since early 2021, previously preceded a significant price rally where Dogecoin soared to its all-time high of over $0.73, following a nearly 8,000% increase.
A golden cross suggests that new buyers are gaining ground more quickly than long-term holders, marking a potential shift from a bearish to a bullish market phase.

The path to this upcoming golden cross began when Dogecoin broke above its 200-week SMA in March with a dramatic 70% price increase in just one week, revitalizing the long-term moving average. This forthcoming golden cross would be the first in over three years.
However, the last golden cross in 2021 led to significant volatility, resulting in a massive surge followed by a 90% decline, with prices eventually stabilizing between $0.05 and $0.10 from May 2022 to February 2024. 
This highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments, especially in meme tokens like DOGE, which are highly susceptible to market sentiment and speculative trading.
Current market conditions and analyst perspectives 
Unlike the favorable macroeconomic conditions of 2021, today’s financial environment presents higher interest rates and increased geopolitical tensions, which might affect speculative investments differently.
Dogecoin descending trendline. Source:  World Of Charts/X
Renowned crypto analyst, World Of Charts, suggests that despite these challenges, Dogecoin is approaching a critical descending trendline, with a potential breakout that could trigger a 100% surge in its price, aiming for a target of approximately $0.29.
This optimistic forecast aligns with momentum traders who regard moving average crossovers as pivotal indicators. As Dogecoin’s 50-week SMA continues to rise, it signals potential opportunities for those seeking short-term gains.
While the impending golden cross offers a hopeful outlook for Dogecoin, the volatile history following such events advises caution. 
Investors are advised not to rely solely on technical indicators but to also consider the broader economic conditions and personal risk tolerance. A balanced investment strategy is crucial, acknowledging both the potential upsides and downsides. 
Dogecoin’s journey toward another golden cross could indeed ‘kick-off’ another 100% rally, as suggested by World Of Charts. 
However, given the speculative nature of the market, participants should approach with caution, keeping in mind that past performance is not indicative of future results.

We’re thrilled to announce the launch of DAO Staking Pool v2, an upgrade that brings significant improvements and added flexibility to our staking platform. Here’s a closer look at what’s new and how you can seamlessly migrate to this enhanced version.



Round 1 Datetime: Monday, May 13th, 2024, 14:00 UTC – Thursday, May 16th, 2024, 14:00 UTC.Who: Current yZF HoldersWhere: https://zkswap.finance/earn/staking



✨ Notes:



1. There will be 5 migration rounds, each lasting 3 days. There will be a one-day interval between rounds to prepare for the next round.



2. After Round 1, the ZF rewards for the current DAO Staking Pool (v1) will cease, and the new DAO Staking Pool (v2) will receive these rewards (5% max supply of ZF over 3 years). DAO Staking Pool (v2) still maintain a 1% unstaking fee distributed to other stakers in the new pool.



3. Users who stake yZF (v1) into the migration pool will receive the new yZF auto airdropped to their wallet within a maximum of 6 hours after the migration pool ends.



4. During the migration period, your Boost will remain the same as if you still hold your yZF, thanks to the temporary myZFi1 token. However, you won’t be able to swap with zero fee using Paymaster until you receive the new yZF.



✨ What’s New in DAO Staking Pool v2:



1. Flexible Unstake Fee Allocation: One of the key enhancements in DAO Staking Pool v2 is the introduction of a more flexible policy regarding the unstake fee.

2. Burning Mechanisms: The flexibility in the unstake fee allocation opens up possibilities for implementing burning mechanisms for our native $ZF token, enhancing its utility and value.



3. Precise Unstake Fee Setting: Unlike its predecessor, DAO Staking Pool v2 enables the setting of unstake fees with greater precision, allowing for percentages with more digits. For example, users can now set an unstake fee of 0.12345%, providing finer control over fee structures.



4. Enhanced User Experience: With DAO Staking Pool v2, users gain visibility into both their original staking amount of ZF tokens and their earnings. This transparency improves the staking experience, empowering users with a clearer understanding of their investment performance.



5. Heightened Security: While DAO Staking Pool v1 was already secure, v2 raises the bar even further, ensuring that your assets are safeguarded with the highest standards of security protocols.



✨ How to Migrate to DAO Staking Pool v2:

The following outlines the reality of what will happen, encompassing both team and user activities:1. Stake your current yZF (v1) tokens into the migration pool and receive an equivalent amount of myZFi1 tokens (1:1 ratio), which serve as temporary placeholders during the migration period.2. At the end of the migration period (typically 3 days), our team will withdraw the yZF tokens staked by users from the Migration Pool.3. We’ll swiftly set the penalty fee for the DAO Staking Pool v1 to 0.4. Exchange yZF for ZF tokens (unstake) from the DAO Staking Pool v1.5. Deposit ZF tokens into the new DAO Staking Pool v2 and receive the equivalent new YZF (v2) tokens.6. Airdrop the new yZF (v2) tokens back to users based on the amount of myZFi1 tokens they possess.



Option 2: Alternatively, users can1. Unstake from DAO Staking Pool v1 themselves, paying the 1% unstake fee.2. Stake into DAO Staking Pool v2.



Don’t miss out on the enhanced features and benefits of DAO Staking Pool v2. We recommend choosing Option 1 and joining us in this exciting new phase of the DAO Staking Pool. Happy staking!🌟

Justin Sun Received Millions of Dollars in Airdrops from This Altcoin - Here's the Hard-to-Believe Number - Bitcoin Sistemi


An interesting development took place in one of the wallets of Tron founder Justin Sun, one of the most controversial figures in the cryptocurrency world.
2.08 million EIGEN tokens were airdropped to the “Justin Sun 4” wallet, one of the wallets tagged as belonging to Justin Sun, minutes ago today.


According to the data, Justin Sun was the second wallet that staked the most Ethereum on EigenLayer. Sun staked 104,000 ETH directly to EigenLayer and 58,000 ETH through Puffer before March.

However, in the current situation, although the EIGEN tokens in question have been airdropped, their transferability feature has not been opened yet. However, on some pre-launch markets, EIGEN tokens are trading at $7.84 at the time of writing. This shows that Justin Sun was paid approximately $16 million thanks to his stakes. Sun had staked a total of $470 million of ETH to EigenLayer.





Officials said that these tokens will become transferable at a date to be determined later. The Eigen Foundation said in a Telegram message that they are targeting September 30.

Dogecoin price prediction: Is DOGE at risk of falling below $0.128? - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin was down by more than 7% in the last seven days. 
Technical indicators and metrics looked pretty bearish. 

Dogecoin [DOGE] bears stepped up their game as the world’s largest meme coin’s daily chart turned red.
 Concerns for the meme coin were far from over, as a bearish pattern emerged on its price chart, which could cause trouble in the near future. 
Dogecoin’s bearish move
According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE’s price had dropped by more than 7% in the last week. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the meme coin’s price declined by 5.5%. 
At the time of writing, the meme coin was trading at $0.1433 with a market capitalization of over $20.6 billion. While the price dropped, it continued to move in a bearish pattern.
 AMBCrypto’s look at DOGE’s chart revealed a bearish descending triangle pattern.
Source: TradingView
DOGE’s price entered this pattern in April and had tried to break above the upper trendline a couple of times.
 Unfortunately, it got rejected, which increased the chances of a southward bearish breakout if its price drops below $0.128. A few of the metrics also supported this outcome. 
For instance, DOGE’s velocity had dropped, meaning that the meme coin was used less often in transactions within a set timeframe. Its MVRV ratio was also in the negative zone. 
Additionally, DOGE did not witness an influx of new investors of late as its total amount of holders’ chart remained flat. 
Source: Santiment
DOGE’s Social Dominance plummeted last week, suggesting a drop in its popularity. Moreover, bearish sentiment remained dominant in the market, which was evident from its low Weighted Sentiment.

Dogecoin price prediction 
To see whether a bearish breakout is inevitable, AMBCrypto analyzed DOGE’s market indicators. We found that DOGE’s price remained under its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), as per the Bollinger Bands.
 Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was resting under the neutral mark at press time. The meme coin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a downtick, further hinting at a continued price decline. 
Source: TradingView
AMBCrypto then checked Hyblock Capital’s data to find out whether there were any other support levels before $0.128 from which DOGE could rebound. 
Our analysis found that DOGE had strong supports near $0.143 and $0.139 marks.

Going further south, DOGE also has support near $0.13. If the coin manages to change the trend after hitting any of these levels, then its value might touch $0.146 soon.
 However, if a bearish breakout takes place under $0.128, then Dogecoin might shed the majority of its March gains.

How is the US Inflation Situation Doing, Which is Critical for Cryptocurrencies? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Consumer confidence in the United States has taken a hit as inflation expectations rise despite strong economic indicators, according to a survey released Friday.
The University of Michigan Consumer Survey revealed that the sentiment index for May recorded a significant decline, falling from 77.2 in April to 67.4. This figure falls short of the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 76, indicating a 12.7% monthly decline. But it still represents a 14.2% year-over-year increase.


In addition to the pessimistic sentiment measure, inflation expectations rose for both one- and five-year periods. The one-year outlook rose 0.3 points from a month ago to 3.5%, reaching its highest level since November. Similarly, the five-year outlook rose slightly by 0.1 points to 3.1%, reversing the downward trend in recent months and reaching the highest level in November.
Survey director Joanne Hsu noted that consumers now acknowledge negative trends on several fronts. “They expressed concerns that inflation, unemployment and interest rates may move in a negative direction next year,” Hsu said.





Other indexes in the survey also reported significant declines: The current conditions index fell more than 10 points to 68.8, while the expectations measure fell 9.5 points to 66.5. Although both indexes were higher than a year ago, they were down more than 12% on a monthly basis.
This report comes amid a strong stock market rally and fuel prices falling slightly, though still at high levels. Although jobless claims last week reached their highest level since late August, most labor market indicators remain strong.


Paul Ashworth, Chief North American Economist at Capital Economics, expressed concern about the significant decline in confidence. “The magnitude of the decline in confidence is significant and cannot be satisfactorily explained by geopolitical factors or the stock market sell-off in mid-April,” Ashworth wrote.

Inflation data pose a significant challenge for policymakers as the Fed considers the near-term path of monetary policy. Jeffrey Roach, Chief Economist at LPL Financial, warned: “Uncertainty about inflation could weigh on consumer spending in the coming months. The Fed is on a difficult path to balance both its price stability and growth mandates.”





FED officials said at their meeting last week that they needed “more confidence” that inflation was “sustainably” returning to their 2% target before cutting interest rates. Policymakers see expectations as key to containing inflation, and the outlook from the Michigan survey has risen in consecutive months after falling significantly between November and March of this year.
Market pricing points to a strong expectation that the Fed will begin reducing the key borrowing rate in September, which it has held at its highest level in more than 20 years since July 2023. However, the outlook varies, although FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated in the post-meeting press conference that the central bank's next move will not be an interest rate increase.
The next important data point for inflation will come on Wednesday when the U.S. Labor Department releases its April consumer price index report. Most Wall Street economists expect the report to show a slight moderation in price pressures, but the widely followed CPI index was running at 3.5% annually in March, well above the Fed's target.

Ethereum Competitor NEAR Protocol Looks ‘Extremely Bullish,’ Says Analyst Jamie Coutts - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								Real Vision crypto analyst Jamie Coutts says that key indicators for one Ethereum (ETH) competitor are flashing bullish.
The former Bloomberg analyst tells his 14,100 followers on the social media platform X that NEAR Protocol (NEAR) could soar more than 47% from its current value.










“Absolute price momentum: has been consolidating since March. The technical pattern looks extremely bullish if it breaks this resistance around $7.60 which is where a cluster of volume has traded these past months. This is a high conviction set up if it breaks the pattern neckline, producing a target above $10.50 (+30%).”

Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests NEAR is printing an inverse head and shoulders pattern (I-HNS). An I-HNS is a bullish technical formation with the right shoulder suggesting bulls are willing to accumulate the asset without waiting for the price to drop to its previous low.
The analyst also predicts that NEAR’s bullish trend against Bitcoin (NEAR/BTC) and Solana (NEAR/SOL) will continue.
“Relative price momentum: NEAR versus SOL and BTC are positive and ready to break higher.”

According to the analyst, NEAR is also experiencing huge daily active user (DAU) growth on the network compared to other smart contract platforms, which is another bullish signal.
“Absolute active user momentum: NEAR’s Daily active users have grown from 50,000 to 1.76 million in the past year. Ex-NEAR that number has grown from 5.4 million to 8.75 million.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
He says the user growth rate far exceeds the combined growth rate of the other layer-1 and layer-2 projects.
“Relative active user momentum: that’s growth of 33x vs 0.6x for the rest of the L1/L2 ecosystem.”
Source: Jamie Coutts/X
NEAR is trading for $7.14 at time of writing, down 3.6% in the last 24 hours.

Dear Bankless Nation, The most technologically-savvy analytical tools in traditional industries has its limits.Why? For the simple reason that data is proprietary.Whether it’s a dataset from a Wall Street quarterly report, or data you extracted from Facebook — it’s data the company wants to reveal.That puts a ceiling on how in-depth the analysis can get.But in web3, virtually all of the data is publicly viewable.On-chain sleuthing is an actual thing anyone can do.Evidence?Every time there’s industry drama, dozens of anonymous analysts on Crypto Twitter leaping ahead of each other to offer their post-mortem.And you can too.Today, William shows us 5 must-have web3 analytical tools you can use to upgrade your game today.- Bankless teamEthereum and other top smart contract blockchains are teeming with data.If you can parse that data well in real-time, there’s plenty of alpha — and even job opportunities — to unlock.Accordingly, this Bankless tactic will walk you through the best resources you can use to level up your crypto analytics skills.Goal: Learn about top crypto analytics toolsSkill: BeginnerEffort: 1 hour to get startedROI: Knowing the best ways to “read” blockchainsA “blockchain data flow” output I created with Stable DiffusionWhy crypto analytics?I first discovered crypto in the spring of 2017.I studied as much about the space as I could that summer, and then that fall I landed my first gig in the field.It was a crypto news writing job at a small-time outlet, CryptoAnalyst.The catch? I still didn’t know much about crypto, and the blockchain analytics sector was very primitive and sparse at the time.I’ve stuck around the ecosystem ever since, and over the past few years one thing has particularly stuck out to me, which is how crypto analytics plays have surged, both in quantity and quality, in recent times.That’s good news for all of us, because knowledge is power.Or rather in crypto, knowledge is power and money.That maxim was as true in 2017 during the ICO ERC20 token boom as it is today in 2022 amid the Cambrian explosion of DeFi and NFTs.But again, one of the biggest differences between then and now has been the surge in quality contemporary crypto analytics tools that have made it exponentially easier to come by actionable web3 knowledge.Interested in making the most of these advancements and leveling up your crypto research game like never before? Then it’s time to double down on the best analytics tools around.Let’s explore 5 platforms you can use to step up your crypto research today. ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️Via CoinGeckoA few years back, it seemed like everyone used CoinMarketCap to check crypto prices, market caps, volume, etc.Then Binance acquired CoinMarketCap in April 2022, which many felt the platform had been “captured.”The community started looking for alternatives. The platform that saw the most success in recent years has been CoinGecko, who quietly out-built its competitor during the bear market, and is now currently the world’s largest independent crypto data aggregator.What I like most about CoinGecko besides its independence is that it feels like the platform is always ahead of the curve.Whenever I want to check the price action or trade volume of some new obscure coin, CoinGecko seems to always have the basic data on that token ahead of everyone else.Part of the reason for this impressive responsiveness?CoinGecko’s reach is downright massive — the platform currently tracks key stats for over 13,000 different crypto assets across over 600 crypto exchanges!Via GeckoTerminalSo if you’re looking to track crypto trends in real-time for the biggest projects and for categories like New Coins and Big Gainers & Losers, CoinGecko is as solid as solid gets.But that’s not all — the project’s also recently launched GeckoTerminal.GeckoTerminal is a DEX aggregator.Remember how I said CoinGecko’s reach is massive?The same is true for GeckoTerminal — if there’s a token you want to trade, whether it’s on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain or a non-EVM chain, GeckoTerminal likely has the charts and the pools you’re looking to directly analyze!Via DeFiLlamaAs a DeFi power user, DeFiLlama is a treat to use.Why?Because DeFiLlama accurately and quickly tracks total value locked (TVL) data and volume data across +150 chains and tons of different protocols, meaning the platform is a fantastic way to “see the cryptoeconomy from above” at any given time, so to speak.However, DeFiLlama is so much more than a plain DeFi stats hub.The project also provides real-time yield metrics, stablecoin charts, liquidation activities, airdrop opportunities, hack info, and beyond.In other words once you go ‘Llama, you never go back’. 🦙

Over the past couple of weeks, Reddit NFTs have popped off.Yet a few weeks ago I didn’t know anything about them at all!When I saw activity around these digital collectibles starting to surge, I knew I needed to write a Metaversal post to explain the basics of what was going on, so I did.Where’d did I go to catch myself up before teaching others?The answer is Dune Analytics.Dune Analytics is a platform that lets anyone create crypto analytics dashboards anyone else can review using SQL.For example, I researched my Reddit NFTs post mentioned above using an analytics dashboard created by Dune user petertherock, and it covered everything I needed, like number of NFT holders, sales volume, and more.The cool thing about Dune is that it covers these sorts of stats for DeFi and NFT projects alike across a variety of chains, like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and beyond.I recommend Dune as an important part of any on-chain analysts info diet accordingly.

If someone gave me a challenge to make $1 million in the cryptoeconomy in one year’s time with the stipulation that I only use one tool, that tool would be Nansen.That $1M mark is an arbitrary number in a hypothetical example, but the results Nansen can help you achieve are very real.I noted as much in one of my June 2022 Metaversal posts, Free-to-Mint NFTs, where I detailed a personal anecdote of how I used Nansen’s Mint Master tracker to mint WAGDIE NFTs before their floor prices initially exploded.At the time, I said:“I found WAGDIE via Mint Master by noticing on Friday that nearly 40 ‘Smart Minters’ had participated in the project’s mint. I was then able to accumulate a few before the project exploded, and now the floor price at the time of this post’s writing is 1.5 ETH each, so my subscription’s been covered multiple times over at this point.Of course, it’s not that every mint will be a win, but Nansen makes it simpler to surface signals in real time.”Via NansenThat’s still true today.It won’t lead you to constant wins, but it will help you surface notable “1 in 100” or “1 in 1,000” plays in real-time in ways that other projects can’t.For instance, Nansen provides the following awesome services:Wallet Profiler — metrics on any wallet addressHot Contracts — a dashboard for tracking trending smart contractsDeFi Paradise — a complete overview of the DeFi economyNFT Paradise — a complete marketview of the NFT economy, including trending collections and new mintsSmart Money — a dashboard for tracking the activities of prolific crypto and NFT tradersToken God Mode — a one-stop search engine for all the main info around a token, e.g. volume, transactions activity, etc.Via Token TerminalToken Terminal is one of my favorite crypto analytics platforms because it arguably has the best fee and revenue stats around for both blockchains and protocols.Want to know just how profitable a given crypto project is at any given time?Token Terminal has you covered, whether you’re researching projects across a certain vertical — e.g. lending markets — or across entire chains.Becoming A Better Crypto AnalystIf you learn how to navigate the 5 crypto analytics projects listed above, you will become a better crypto analyst than most everyone else right now.The good news is that these platforms make navigating key blockchain data simple, so it doesn’t take a particularly specialized knowledge base to get adept at them.Explore and use the projects, and who knows?You might just start pulling out on-chain victories that you didn’t know were previously possible!Action steps🔭 Check out the best crypto analytics tools:  CoinGecko + GeckoTerminal  DeFiLlama  Dune Analytics  Nansen  Token Terminal

Crypto's Red Relapse | Bankless


Trending down. Crypto assets shook the downturn and managed to eke out a green candle last week, but are at risk of relapsing into the all too familiar red pattern that has afflicted price since April. What happened this week in markets, and where is the outsized upside? With BTC yet again pressed against the bottom of its local range and funding rates remaining at relatively healthy levels, bulls can get comfortable entries here if markets are to maintain their uptrend, but should remain cognizant that a break of $60k support will extend the downside.Source: TradingViewWhile gains made by the total crypto market lagged behind those of BTC last week, Bitcoin dominance fell slightly this week, which can clearly be observed through strength from a smattering alts amid the broader down week.Two of the leading projects enabling decentralized compute sharing, Akash and Render Network, managed to decouple themselves from Nvidia’s performance this week, ranking among the best performing coins despite relatively flat performance from the AI heavyweight.Additionally, The Open Network (TON), a blockchain originally created by popular messaging application Telegram, was a top performer, rallying over 22% off crypto fund Pantera’s May 8 announcement that it had made the token its largest investment ever.
Unfortunately for Ethereans, their chosen asset sat out on the altcoin rally this week, with the token not only plunging over 10% from its weekly high in dollar terms but also losing relative strength in the ETH/BTC ratio.News that ARK Invest had removed staking from its pending spot ETH ETF application – a feature not considered in the approval process for spot BTC ETFs and one whose inclusion could derail an application’s approval – caused the odds of approval to surge to 18% on Polymarket.Although some traders interpreted the move as an indication that approval for non-staking applications may be imminent, it seems participants in more liquid markets continue to brace for denial, considering the relatively unchanged nature of the ETH/BTC ratio following the news and the continued slide of the pair ahead of the SEC’s first final decision deadline on May 23.

Even if this weekend's solar storm destroyed civilization, Bitcoin would survive

The sun can produce massive flares of particles and radiation that can have a significant impact on Earth. Scientists have studied these flares for 150 years, focusing on what’s considered the largest such event of all time: the Carrington Event of 1859, named after British astronomer Richard Carrington.The sun erupted and pumped enough energy into our planet’s magnetic field to ignite a massive geomagnetic storm and auroral display. Telegraph lines burst into flames, and the event was reported globally. Back then, electronic systems were not the center of daily life. Today, a Carrington-sized event could completely alter the complexion of daily life.Mississippi State University professor David Wallace wrote on Astronomy.com the potential ramifications could be disastrous:“It is only a matter of time before Earth is hit by another geomagnetic storm. A Carrington Event-size storm would be extremely damaging to the electrical and communication systems worldwide with outages lasting into the weeks. If the storm is the size of the Miyake Event, the results would be catastrophic for the world with potential outages lasting months if not longer.”That time could be this weekend. A huge solar storm is barrelling into Earth, bringing the threat of possible disruptions to satellites and power grids. As the world faces a “severe” geomagnetic storm, according to NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, infrastructure operators are on edge due to the possible fallout of the solar event, which has significant implications for the crypto industry.As the first of six solar waves hit, the Earth was already experiencing a G4 electromagnetic storm–the highest in 19 years. The present storm affecting electronics, etc. would not be entirely unprecedented, as geomagnetic storms rated as “extreme” led to blackouts in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa in October 2003.Scientists warn that these events happen at higher frequencies than believed and could be catastrophic. For instance, tree rings studied by scientists revealed two solar solid proton events that happened in 7176 and 5259 BCE, which were not previously known.Solar storms of increasing frequency have implications for the electronics on which crypto depends. Geomagnetic storms can disrupt satellite communications and power grids. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) could damage computer hardware. These sudden bursts of energy can release radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, including X-rays and ultraviolet light.The high-energy particles induce electric currents in the components of a computer, possibly causing damage or data corruption. The Central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), and hard disk drives are most at risk due to their electromagnetic interference, possibly causing them to malfunction or fail altogether. Electromagnetic radiation can disrupt the communication between hardware components, leading to system crashes or errors.At the very least, disturbances can cause crypto exchanges and wallet downtime. Even a little bit of downtime could lead to significant financial losses for market participants. Multi-signature wallets and strict authentication protocols can also protect companies against disruptions caused by space weather.With that said, sufficiently decentralized blockchains–like the Bitcoin blockchain–would persist.Bitcoin has been broadcast over radio and MESH networks, though the use of its blockchain would be very slow. Even Lightning payments have been sent over the radio.CMEs would, in the worst-case scenario, take out electronics on the side of the planet facing the sun at the time of the explosion. That part of the planet, however, would face some serious setbacks. Power lines, consumer electronics, and medical devices would all be rendered useless.Solar storms with the potential to disrupt life on Earth make a great case for a decentralized financial system. A blockchain would carry on with blocks being produced and transactions validated by all the nodes that happened to be on the dark side of the earth when the solar storm hit.Crypto’s decentralized nature would prove superior to the mainstream banking system’s centralized structure. The internet was designed in a distributed fashion with enough redundancy so as to survive a nuclear attack. Bitcoin, for instance, has thousands of Bitcoin nodes, which means it’s actually more likely to survive a catastrophic event than a financial system based on centralized data servers. If even one node survives, the entire system can be reconstituted from that seed.

JPMorgan’s Onyx to industrialize blockchain PoCs from Project Guardian

Wall Street giants are looking at how to industrialize proofs-of-concept developed within the blockchain experiment Project Guardian. According to Stephanie Lok, product manager of JPMorgan’s blockchain platform Onyx, one of the company’s “very big focus area” is turning the learnings of the pilot program with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) into products. Lok shared these details during the TokenizeThis event in Miami on May 10:“We want to see how we can take it forward. Investment fund tokenization is where we’re really focusing a lot of our time. [...] That’s a very big focus area: how can we kind of productionize, industrialize what we built out as a proof-of-concept?”Another traditional firm “really focusing on the blockchain-enabled finance migration” is the asset manager WisdomTree. Speaking at the event, Maredith Hannon, head of business development for WisdomTree, said the company is targeting portfolio personalization in addition to blending portfolios with checking accounts. “Think about if you could do 10,001 different variations of different types of allocations, different types of risk profiles,” said Hannon about the potential benefits of real-world asset tokenization for investors’ portfolios. Related: Tokenization to unlock interoperability across payments, investmentsTokenizeThis 2024. Source: Sam Bourgi/CointelegraphAlso tied to tokenization, WisdomTree is exploring how to offer different on-chain services under the same interface for its clients. According to Hannon, the bank is working on an application that will integrate a range of financial services, including tokenized portfolios and regular banking services. Hannon noted:“It’s just enabling those to be on-chain. Deliver that end value of being able to use your money more effectively. Being able to be in the market, in a money market fund earning 5% versus earning pretty much nothing in your checking account. That’s really the ethos that we’re going after here. And we think that from a distribution perspective, that’s a huge need in the market and a problem to solve.”WisdomTree is one of the asset managers behind Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF). The Project Guardian is an initiative that explores the feasibility of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and asset tokenization in wholesale funding markets. Launched in May 2022, its primary focus is on developing open and interoperable networks, institutional-grade DeFi protocols, asset tokenization, and trusted infrastructure. Project Guardian’s main participants include JPMorgan, DBS Bank, SBI Digital Asset Holdings, and WisdomTree. Magazine: Memecoins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Crypto Hiring: Monad is using its $225M haul to load up on talent - Blockworks


A month ago, Monad raised $225 million on the promise of a high-throughput Ethereum-compatible layer-1 blockchain. It’s now putting those funds to use on the hiring front.
Kevin Canlas announced he joined the protocol as a senior designer. Canlas has previous experience in similar roles at the NFT collection Isekai Meta and smart contract security firm Cyfrin. 
At Monad, Canlas will be “leading internal designs and helping startups build on the Monad ecosystem,” he said on X.

Also this week, SungMo Park joined Monad as its APAC lead and head of Korea. Park previously served as head of business for Asia Pacific and for Korea during a nearly two year stint at Polygon Labs.
Park also becomes Monad’s first hire in the APAC region, he said on X.

Monad isn’t done hiring yet either. Charlie Noyes, of lead Monad investor Paradigm, advertised an open role for a senior crypto economics researcher at the protocol. Monad currently lists twelve job openings in total, mostly in its engineering department. 
Mini-Q&A: What crypto firms are looking for
Blockworks spoke with Stephen Moskowitz, founder and managing partner of Web3 recruiting firm Pyxis, about his recent observations on the crypto labor market. 
Keep reading for excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Moskowitz, edited for brevity and clarity.
_________________________________________________________________________________________
Blockworks: What sorts of roles are most in-demand at the moment?
Moskowitz: Almost every single company in crypto right now is trying to hire either a head of marketing or a [chief marketing officer], and there’s a huge supply-demand imbalance there. There’s just a lack of crypto-native marketing talent. 
What I am seeing happen is that there’s a lot of title inflation in crypto, so people can go out with a head of marketing title, and they end up hiring someone that is coming from maybe a marketing manager or marketing lead type of role, or maybe they’ve got a couple of years of experience, and those people also might be more crypto-native, like someone coming out of school who spent a couple years in marketing. 
I think that those people are gonna be the next crop that kind of rises up as opposed to very senior Web2 people moving into Web3. Maybe at the CMO level that might happen if they don’t need someone quite as native, but if they want somebody who’s tweeting and more like an [individual contributor]-level role, I think that it’s gonna have to be the junior talent that steps up into these more senior titles because there just aren’t enough of these people that exist. 
Other notable hiring news

Wyatt Lonergan, the head of Circle Ventures, departed the firm.
Polygon Labs head of DeFi Jack Melnick announced he’s left the company.
Elisha Aswani left a growth role at Binance.

                        Erik Voorhees, the founder of popular cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift, has unveiled his latest venture called “Venice AI.”The new platform introduces a privacy-focused generative AI chatbot, addressing the growing concerns surrounding privacy in both the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) industries.In the announcement, Voorhees expressed his worries about the direction of AI, stating that he observed a trend where large tech companies, closely aligned with governments, are gaining control over AI technologies.He said that this could lead to a dystopian future and advocates for open-source decentralization as a countermeasure.Voorhees aims to provide users with an alternative choice by offering open-source AI solutions.Voorhees Shifts Toward AI
Back in 2014, Voorhees launched the ShapeShift cryptocurrency exchange.However, in July 2021, the exchange announced its transition into an open-source decentralized exchange (DEX), with control being transferred to the ShapeShift DAO.Following a battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ShapeShift agreed to pay a fine and comply with a cease-and-desist order, leading Voorhees to shift his focus towards building a permissionless, decentralized AI model.Venice AI, the latest product from Erik Voorhees, prioritizes user privacy. It does not store user data or have access to user conversations.Instead, user input is sent through an encrypted proxy server to a decentralized GPU, which runs the AI model and returns the answer.This process ensures security and anonymity, as the GPU only sees the specific prompt and not the user’s entire conversation.Venice AI’s model is designed to be substantially better than the current status quo, where centralized companies store and retain user conversations tied to their identities.The AI industry’s top players, such as Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Meta, have made efforts to improve the perception of generative AI by promoting responsible AI practices.However, Voorhees argues that once a company has access to user information, it cannot be trusted to delete it permanently.Venice AI addresses this concern by avoiding central repositories altogether. Chat history is stored locally in the user’s browser and can be deleted at any time, even without creating an account.Venice Pro Offers More Features
While creating an account offers certain advantages, such as higher message limits and the ability to modify prompts, users can also access additional features by subscribing to a Venice Pro account.Currently priced at $49 annually, Venice Pro provides unlimited text prompts, removes watermarks from generated images and document uploads, and allows users to turn off Safe Mode for unrestricted image generation.Although Venice AI does not yet accept digital currencies for Venice Pro subscriptions, Voorhees confirmed that this feature is coming soon.In the meantime, users holding the Morpheus token will be rewarded with a free Pro account indefinitely.The platform integrates with MetaMask wallets, offering users a seamless experience.While Venice AI is built on the decentralized Morpheus network, Voorhees acknowledges concerns regarding its performance.He noted that it is important that AI solutions are on par with centralized companies to ensure user adoption.

Mark Cuban: 'Crypto voters will be heard this election' - Here's why - AMBCrypto



SEC-crypto clashes affect election dynamics, industry growth, and voter sentiments.
Trump’s and Biden’s crypto stances shift support among voters, revealing a political divide.

The upcoming United States election appears to have a unique dynamic, notably due to the ongoing regulatory battles between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto entities. 
In contrast to previous years, 2024 is making headlines due to ongoing SEC scrutiny over firms like Ripple [XRP], Uniswap [UNI], Binance [BNB], Coinbase, Robinhood, and others.
Mark Cuban’s insights 
Delving deeper into the matter, crypto maximalist Mark Cuban responded to Donald Trump’s newfound support for cryptocurrencies, foreseeing their significant impact on the upcoming election. He said, 
“If @joebiden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank @GaryGensler and the @NewYork_SEC.” 
This highlights Cuban’s concerns about potential risks to the crypto industry development and America’s global image. 
Criticizing SEC Chair Gary Gensler for neglecting investor protection, he noted, 
“Gensler HAS NOT PROTECTED A SINGLE INVESTOR AGAINST FRAUD.”  
Cuban believes that Gensler’s actions have significantly hindered the operations of legitimate crypto companies. This has resulted in the potential closure of numerous businesses and countless entrepreneurs. 
Reflecting a shared viewpoint, Hayden Adams, Uniswap’s CEO, in a separate interview with the “Bankless” podcast, noted,
“The SEC is essentially taking very aggressive stances and basically trying to shut down crypto.” 
Should Congress step in? 
Trump’s openness to crypto donations contrasts Biden’s resistance, shifting crypto voters’ support towards Trump.
Remarking on the same, Cuban noted,

 Needless to say other execs including Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer of Variant in a recent stream on “Unchained”, shed light on the disagreement between the SEC and Coinbase and claimed, 
“I think it really is time for Congress to step in and decide what the law should be instead of leaving us all in this sort of haze of regulatory uncertainty.”

Trump’s Pro-Crypto Bluster at NFT Gala Lacked Policy Substance

"Biden doesn’t even know what it is. If you ask Biden, 'Sir, are you for or against crypto?' he’ll say, 'What’s that? Get me off the stage.' He has no idea," Trump said. Whether or not that somewhat plausible presumption is true, Trump followed up with an attack on Gensler, an official well-versed in crypto.

A Crypto Startup Founder’s Diary - Decrypt

For years, I told myself that I’m not the founder type. Instead, I try to be that strong operator who makes founders’ dreams come true. Perhaps the avoidance of being a founder comes from my Chinese upbringing. As my mother often says: “A gun shoots the first bird that sticks its head out.”She didn’t want me to be that first bird. So until recently, my career was defined by the idea of working hard toward someone else’s vision—until I stumbled into crypto. Crypto is self-sovereignty, starting from custodying one’s own keys. The crypto community encourages ownership via participation. Yes, we all love to see magical internet money going up, but the industry has profound financial, social and technological implications to our society. Crypto is a once in a lifetime opportunity for a generation to express raw talent while owning a piece of it. I was extremely lucky that my first job in crypto was in business development at Consensys. The job gave me a perspective on the full crypto stack: from the base layer (Linea), to middleware (Infura), to the user interface (MetaMask).I was having fun. People started to know me not as Shuyao Kong, the global head of BD at ConsenSys, but as “Brother Bing,” a Decrypt columnist and founder of Hot Pot DAO. But a small voice began to grow louder in my head wondering: Can you do something on your own? Many people have entrepreneurial itches but most don’t scratch them. I knew that I was driven primarily by three missions: (1) working at the cutting-edge of crypto tech; (2) welcoming young talent to crypto; and (3) incubating tangible crypto products for emerging markets. As I was exploring, my good old Consensys network played the magic. Not only has ConsenSys incubated multiple well-known products (including Decrypt), but also inspired a class of crypto founders, operators, investors and rebels who are still pushing the boundaries.When my former colleague Yi Tang messaged me in January, I knew he was up for something solid. Yi and I were at the front lines in 2018 trying to bring Asian Pacific governments and big businesses on-chain. He’s now a prominent crypto investor at Qiming Venture, one of the largest funds in the world. “We have a pretty solid portfolio company that’s looking for a business cofounder,” he messaged me on Telegram, and sent me MegaETH’s twitter handle. Looking through the Github repo, I couldn’t help but wonder who would be so dumb as to call themselves “MegaETH.” I mean, I like having ETH in the name, but Mega gave a 2017 ICO vibe. I was not over the moon. But I was curious to learn about the tech, so I scheduled a call with Yilong, who had started MegaETH after completing his PhD from Stanford’s computer science department. In his typically calm, steady voice, Yilong walked me through his motivation, system-design philosophy, and vision. Simply put: He wanted to build a scalable base layer so devs can create easy to use, fast, cheap crypto-native dapps.  The thesis is simple and clever. After a decade, no one has succeeded in scaling a blockchain that’s as user friendly as Web2. Solana, which was a step in the right direction, still faces scaling challenges and is still in beta. And the Ethereum L2s collectively only scale the mainnet by a factor of 10, which is pretty meager.Since no blockchain is scalable enough, dapps offer inferior performance resulting in poor user experience. I often joke that developers are cheating the blockchain because they’d rather put data off-chain than on-chain due to poor performance issues. These are the problems that MegaETH will attempt to fix.MegaETH, Rust in Prod. Image: MegaETHAs Yilong explained the thinking behind MegaETH, there was a charming, quiet confidence in his voice. Within an hour, I went from “cool tech but so what” to “this thing will Make Ethereum Great Again.” My mind was 80% mega-aligned after the call. The next day, I met Lei Yang, who would become our third co-founder and CTO. Lei is already a well-known blockchain researcher at MIT. His ability to explain complicated blockchain concepts in the most normie-friendly way was the finest I’ve seen in crypto. The MegaETH Team began to take shape, virtually, and I signed on in March to lead all the business and marketing efforts.There was a lot of work to do, obviously. But there was also the fun of a startup. Since we lived all over the world, the founding team met in person hardly at all—once at ETH Denver and later in Boston, when everyone traveled to Lei’s PhD thesis defense. These in-person hangouts were wonderful moments. For instance, we learned that Lei is a fan of rabbits. He actually goes to a park near MIT and feeds bunnies every week. In his spirit, we are designing a MegaETH logo of a lighting-fast bunny rabbit. Along the way, we are learning about each other’s communication style, diet, and even family members. Now, as I write these words in the middle of the night in Dubai, it strikes me that while my entrepreneurial journey might have started from some sort of vague instinct, it really took off when I met the right people. Lots of things are keeping me up at night. We have yet to receive funding. We desperately need a developer evangelist who can nerd-snipe devs to our ecosystem. And we don’t even have a website yet. But so far, despite what my mother taught me, it feels really good to stick my head out. And I haven’t gotten shot yet. Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Wells Fargo Employee Sanctioned After Allegedly Stealing Funds From Customers, Refusing To Cooperate With Investigation - The Daily Hodl


								The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is barring a former Wells Fargo broker who’s accused of stealing funds from clients.
In a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent (AWC), the regulator says ex-Well Fargo employee Andrew J. Egber violated two FINRA rules when he deliberately ignored requests to cooperate in an investigation.










Last month, Wells Fargo amended Egber’s Form U5, stating that the banking giant had started an internal review over “allegations of possible theft of client funds.”
FINRA requires member firms to file a Form U5 to explain the reasons behind a former employee’s exit.
On March 29th, FINRA says it sent Egber a request to produce information and documents to shed more light on Wells Fargo’s amended U5 filing. The regulator also says that on the same day, it sent a request to Egber to appear for an on-the-record testimony.
But FINRA says Egber chose to reject both requests.
“During a call with FINRA staff on April 9, 2024, in email correspondence with FINRA staff on April 11, 2024, and by this agreement, Egber acknowledges that he received FINRA’s Rule 8210 requests, he will not produce the information and documents requested at any time, and he will not appear for on-the-record testimony at any time.”

For refusing to cooperate, Egber has been barred from working with any FINRA member organization “in any capacity,” including clerical or ministerial roles.
The AWC will also become part of Egber’s permanent disciplinary record and the document will be made available through the regulator’s public disclosure program.

Buy signal for two oversold cryptocurrencies this May


The cryptocurrency market has seen a significant downturn, with the total market capitalization dropping from $2.49 trillion to $2.21 trillion over the past month. Over the week, Bitcoin (BTC) fell 4.6% to $60,844.77, while Ethereum (ETH) dropped by 7.19% to $2,903.84.
However, the overall 1-week relative strength index (RSI) standing at 48.70 indicates that not all assets are equally impacted. Moreover, some may be approaching oversold territories, hinting at potential buying opportunities according to data from CoinGlass. 
From an optimistic perspective, Finbold identified two cryptocurrencies that are notably oversold on a short-term basis, as evidenced by their 1-week RSI readings, and may offer good buying opportunities amidst the market crash.


MANTA (MANTA)
MANTA emerges as a standout among oversold assets. Currently priced at $1.66, MANTA has experienced a significant decrease of 38.10% over the past month.

This is coupled with an RSI of 28.02 over the week and 38.27 over the past 24 hours, suggesting that MANTA is deeply oversold. These technical indicators, combined with MANTA’s strong fundamentals, suggest a potentially undervalued asset that may be poised for a rebound.
Frax Share (FXS)
Another cryptocurrency showing similar patterns is Frax Share (FXS), currently priced at $4.26, down by 35.39% over the same period. RSI levels of 29.21 weekly and 38.06 over the past 24 hours indicate that FXS is approaching oversold territory.

This technical assessment points towards a possible price recovery, making FXS an attractive investment option for those considering entering the market during this downturn.
The current market landscape presents a challenging yet opportunistic scenario. Both MANTA and FXS show significant price reductions accompanied by low RSI values, classifying them as potentially oversold. 
For technically inclined investors, these cryptocurrencies provide notable buy signals based on their current market valuations and technical indicators. However, it’s crucial to remember the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, where market conditions can rapidly change

Bitcoin emerges as the winner as the dollar tanks - Report

In the last 4 years, the US dollar has been the subject to two wars and a global pandemic (Covid-19). While all this was taking place the dollar has been weakened, leaving United States economic government arms to figure out ways to strengthen the weakening dollar.Amid plans to strengthen the USD, Bitcoin has risen to strength all by itself. Analysts report the BTC has been on the winning side of the de-dollarization agenda pushed by the BRICS economic block.Bitcoin takes the win as the dollar collapsesBased on TradingView data, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which evaluates the dollar’s performance against a selection of major global currencies, experienced a 0.45% decrease from its peak of 105.73 as the week closed at 105.25.On the other hand, following the announcement of the U.S. unemployment figures, the S&P 500 remained remarkably close to its all-time high, trading within a 1% range. At the close of trading in the week, the Dow Jones experienced a positive increase of 0.85%, with the S&P 500 also showing a gain of 0.51% and the Nasdaq Composite seeing a rise of 0.27%. In the last 24 hours, the price of bitcoin saw a 2.5% increase and was trading at $62,927 at 9:06 a.m. ET.According to market analysts, the recent increase in U.S. jobless claims has had a negative impact on the dollar. This suggests that the overbought dollar is still susceptible to weaker U.S. data releases. As a result, investors may now be more confident in their belief that the U.S. jobs market is weakening.Last Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department released the weekly jobless claims report, which revealed an increase in new claims for unemployment benefits. This surge in claims marks the highest level seen in over eight months.The data was released following a disappointing U.S. jobs report last Friday, which showed that employers added only 175,000 jobs last month, falling short of economists’ expectations for a 243,000 increase.In the past 24 hours, the GM 30 Index, which tracks the performance of the top 30 cryptocurrencies, has seen a 2.53% increase, reaching a value of 131.96.Currently, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) stands at $61,412.51, reflecting a 0.8% rise in the past hour and a 0.6% increase since yesterday. The current value of BTC is 3.9% lower than its value a week ago.The current global crypto market cap stands at $2.38 Trillion, with a slight decrease of -0.78% in the last 24 hours and a significant increase of 105.06% compared to one year ago. BTC’s market cap currently stands at $1.2 Trillion, indicating a 50.45% Bitcoin dominance. On that note, stablecoin’s market cap stands at $161 Billion, representing a 6.75% share of the overall crypto market cap.Dollar dominance dwindles as BRICS take overChina and Russia are exerting significant influence to reduce the dominance of the US dollar on the global stage. In a recent press meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed his belief that the era in which the United States exerted dominance over the world was drawing to a close.The alliance is empowering developing countries to make trades using their own currencies, thereby bolstering their domestic economies.The increasing influence of the US dollar is prompting developing countries to shift away from the currency and align themselves with BRICS. Furthermore, the imposition of sanctions by the US has resulted in a significant outflow of funds from developing economies, with a preference for conducting transactions using local currencies. The development is just the beginning, and BRICS will carry it forward for many more years and decades to come.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC/USD) recently crossed the $60,000 threshold, only to face new challenges from Federal Reserve sentiment. The cryptocurrency, currently trading around $60,800, experienced a modest drop of about 1.50% over the last day, keeping the bitcoin price prediction bearish.This market movement aligns closely with remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, as reported by financial journalist Walter Bloomberg, indicating that rate cuts are not seen as necessary this year.These comments from a Fed official have injected a note of caution into the market, moderating expectations that had been buoyed by the possibility of looser monetary policy.With this backdrop, investors are closely monitoring further economic updates to gauge potential shifts in Fed strategy that could influence Bitcoin’s market dynamics in the upcoming months.Bitcoin Price Prediction
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $60,800, marking a decline of around 1.50% over the last 24 hours. Given this slight decline, the market seems concerned about Bitcoin price prediction.Yet, BTC continues to be the most valuable cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about $1.2 trillion. The trading volume within this period has reached a substantial $22 billion, reflecting the high level of activity in the Bitcoin market.From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s key pivot point is $60,975. Immediate resistance is found at $63,400, with further barriers at $65,050 and $67,160. These levels will need to be surpassed for Bitcoin to regain bullish momentum.Conversely, immediate support lies at $59,075. If this level fails to hold, subsequent support levels at $56,640 and $54,400 will become the focal points for potential bearish pressure.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 38, suggesting a potential oversold condition but also indicating that there might be further downside if market sentiment does not improve. Moreover, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), positioned at $62,151, is providing significant resistance.In summary, Bitcoin currently shows a bearish trend as it trades below the critical pivot point of $60,975. Maintaining this position might result in additional decreases, potentially reaching the support level of $59,075.Last Chance to Buy Dogeverse Before Launch – Over $15M Raised

Bitcoin volatility plunges below Tesla, Nvidia stocks amid $100K price prediction

Bitcoin's (BTC) volatility in the annual timeframe has dropped below that of top tech stocks, including Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia, signaling its growth toward becoming a more mature and stable asset class.Bitcoin becomes more stable than many S&P 500 stocksAs of May 11, Bitcoin's 1-year realized volatility, which represents the standard deviation of returns from the mean return of a market, was at around 44.88%.

Source: GlassnodeBitcoin's recent volatility patterns closely resemble gold's in its early trading years. Like gold, Bitcoin has undergone a period of price discovery, marked initially by high volatility, which gradually subsides as the market matures. Gold prices surged with inflation after its decoupling from the U.S. dollar in 1971 and the legalization of its private ownership in 1974. As a result, the precious metal's volatility reached over 80 during the early 1970s—almost twice that of Bitcoin in April 2024.Gold price and historical volatility.

Coinbase Pushes for Clearer Crypto Regulation, SEC Says No - DailyCoin


        
Coinbase has been locked in a battle with the SEC over how cryptocurrency should be regulated in the US.



Coinbase has argued for new, crypto-specific rules, while the SEC has maintained that existing laws are sufficient.



This disagreement has escalated into legal challenges, with accusations of unfairness being levied by both sides.
The simmering tension between cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has erupted into a full-blown battle over the regulatory framework governing digital assets. At the heart of the dispute lies Coinbase’s insistence on a more crypto-specific regulatory approach, which the SEC has vehemently rejected.Coinbase Fights for Crypto Specific RulebookCoinbase argues that the current regulatory landscape, designed for traditional securities, is ill-suited for the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. They believe these outdated rules hinder innovation and create uncertainty within the industry. The exchange has been pushing for a dedicated set of regulations tailored to the unique characteristics of digital assets.
However, the SEC remains firmly entrenched in its position. The Commission maintains that existing securities laws are perfectly capable of regulating cryptocurrencies, pointing to past court decisions that applied these laws to digital assets. They argue that their current regulatory approach effectively balances investor protection with market stability, fostering healthy capital formation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This disagreement has escalated further with Coinbase’s legal challenge against the SEC. Is the SEC Targeting Crypto Unfairly?The exchange claims the lack of clear crypto-specific regulations creates unfairness, as the SEC’s enforcement actions seem to operate under a different set of rules. They argue for more transparent and predictable regulations to ensure a stable environment for the industry.The SEC counters this claim, insisting that its enforcement authority remains consistent, and the existing laws provide sufficient guidance. They view the rulemaking process and enforcement actions as separate functions, with the latter not requiring changes to the regulatory framework. Coinbase CLO Challenges SEC InconsistencyThis stance has been met with strong criticism from Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, who accuses the SEC of inconsistency and unfair treatment, particularly in regards to their lawsuit against the exchange.Coinbase further bolsters its case by highlighting the SEC’s seemingly contradictory approach in other ongoing legal battles, such as the lawsuit against Ripple Labs. This perceived inconsistency further fuels their argument for a more transparent and definitive regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry.With both sides unwilling to budge, the battle between Coinbase and the SEC is far from over. The outcome of this dispute will have a significant impact on the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States, shaping the landscape for both investors and businesses in the digital asset space.On the Flipside
In the SEC’s defense, creating unique crypto regulations could result in a patchwork of rules across different countries, which could complicate international operations for crypto businesses.



Clear legal precedents established through ongoing cases like the one against Coinbase could provide some level of certainty without needing entirely new regulations.
Why This MattersThe clash between Coinbase and the SEC isn’t just about one company; it’s a fight that will define how the entire cryptocurrency industry in the US is regulated. The court’s decision will determine whether clear, crypto-specific rules are established, or if the industry remains tangled in the uncertainties of applying traditional securities laws to a constantly evolving asset class.Cryptocurrencies can be volatile, but Coinbase is a major player in the industry.

JPMorgan Reports $760K Spot Bitcoin ETF Holdings Even As CEO Jamie Dimon Called For Shutting Down Crypto Industry - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) - Benzinga

The largest bank in the United States, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, has disclosed a significant investment in Bitcoin BTC/USD exchange-traded funds (ETFs) despite its CEO Jamie Dimon's persistent criticism of cryptocurrencies.What Happened: JPMorgan has invested approximately $760,000 in spot Bitcoin ETFs on behalf of its clients, according to recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The bank’s holdings are spread across several ETFs, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.In addition to this, JPMorgan purchased 25,021 shares of crypto ATM provider Bitcoin Depot Inc. worth $47,415 and 34,662 shares of Bit Digital Inc. worth $99,480.See Also: Trump Pledges To ‘Make Sure You Can’ Donate Using Crypto To His 2024 CampaignThis announcement follows a similar disclosure by rival bank Wells Fargo & Co WFC, which revealed its holding of 2,245 GBTC shares worth $121,207.Dimon previously referred to Bitcoin as a “pet rock” used by criminals and speculators.Why It Matters: This move by JPMorgan, despite Dimon’s criticism, is indicative of the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin within traditional financial institutions.In December, Dimon reiterated his long-standing opposition to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, suggesting that the government should shut down the industry.In January, following the SEC’s approval of a Bitcoin ETF, Dimon’s stance appeared to soften. He said, "I defend your right to do Bitcoin," eliciting a strong reaction from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.Read Next: Here’s How Much $1,000 Invested In Dogecoin Would be Worth If You Invested When Elon Musk First Tweeted About DOGEDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo courtesy: Flickr

Former Digitex Futures Exchange CEO Pleads Guilty to Violating Bank Secrecy Act


																Founder and former CEO of Digitex Futures Exchange, Adam Todd, has pleaded guilty to willingly leading the firm to fail to establish an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program.
Notably, the former CEO’s plea was issued in a federal court in the Southern District of Florida on May 7.
Former Digitex CEO Pleads Guilty
The U.S. Attorney’s Office stated that Todd pleaded guilty to “willfully causing” Digitex to violate the Bank Secrecy Act. Indicted earlier this year, Todd was accused of overseeing an unregistered futures platform targeting U.S. customers from 2018 to 2022, allegedly neglecting vital Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols.
In 2020, Todd announced that there would be “no KYC identity verification requirements of any kind” following a data breach at Digitex. It was reported that a former exchange employee stole information from user’s passports and driver’s licenses.
At the time, Digitex claimed to be blocking U.S. IPs and requested users to confirm that they were not based in the United States. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) then filed a lawsuit against Todd and Digitex in 2022. The following year, they won their case, resulting in an order for $16 million in disgorgement and penalties.




According to Todd’s LinkedIn profile, he resigned as Digitex CEO in October 2022 and has been the lead developer at Digitex Games since February 2023.
Todd is facing up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for his actions. However, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has not yet announced Todd’s sentencing hearing date.
Crypto Exchange CEOs Face Legal Challenges
Digitex’s legal challenges add to the ongoing series of legal issues surrounding exchanges in the crypto industry, which also includes FTX and Binance.
In 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, was arrested and extradited to the United States. Initially entering a plea of not guilty, he was placed under house arrest but subsequently remanded to jail due to allegations of witness intimidation. After a six-week trial, he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.
Conversely, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, faced charges in 2023. He pleaded guilty and was granted bail, allowing him to remain free. Last month, he was sentenced to four months in prison.
Bankman-Fried faced seven felony charges related to defrauding investors and misusing customer funds. In contrast, Zhao faced one charge related to failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance.

SEC Throws Shade at Ripple Lawsuit Ruling in Coinbase Appeal - DailyCoin


        
The SEC and the crypto industry have been clashing as the SEC downplays a key ruling in a previous lawsuit.



The SEC has downplayed the significance of the Ripple ruling in its case against Coinbase.



Experts have been closely watching the SEC lawsuits, as the outcomes could impact the entire industry.
The ongoing battle between the SEC and the cryptocurrency industry has reached a new boiling point as the SEC attempts to downplay a key ruling in the Ripple lawsuit. This move comes amidst the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase, a major cryptocurrency exchange.Does Ripple Case Set Precedent for Crypto Securities?The SEC’s argument hinges on the notion that a previous court decision doesn’t hold weight in the current case. Let’s break down the situation. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple in their lawsuit against the SEC. 
The crux of the case centered on whether XRP, Ripple’s native token, constituted a security. Judge Torres determined that XRP sales through exchanges did not qualify as securities offerings, thereby exempting them from securities regulations.Fast forward to the present, the SEC is locked in a legal battle with Coinbase. The SEC alleges that Coinbase has been facilitating the trading of unregistered securities in the form of certain cryptocurrencies on its platform. This directly contradicts Judge Torres’s ruling in the Ripple case.In a recent filing against Coinbase’s appeal request, the SEC argued that “no court has followed the ruling” in the Ripple case. This implies that the SEC views the Ripple decision as an isolated event and doesn’t set a legal precedent for other cryptocurrency-related cases.Will Ripple’s Win Be a One-Off?This argument has legal experts watching closely. Pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan suggests that if the SEC prevails in its lawsuits against other cryptocurrency companies, Ripple’s victory regarding XRP sales could be a standalone case. In simpler terms, Ripple might be able to continue its XRP sales without registering them with the SEC, but this wouldn’t necessarily extend similar protections to other players in the cryptocurrency industry.
The SEC’s attempt to downplay the Ripple case ruling adds another layer of complexity to the already intricate regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrency. With both sides armed with legal muscle, the outcome of these cases will likely have a significant impact on the future of cryptocurrency in the United States.On the Flipside
Judge Torres’s decision only applied to XRP sales through exchanges, not Ripple’s overall sales of XRP.



Regardless of the immediate outcome, the SEC’s actions could prompt further legislative efforts to clarify cryptocurrency regulations in the US.



The SEC may argue that the Ripple case is unique due to the specific characteristics of XRP. They might highlight factors not present in the Coinbase case to justify their different approach.
Why This MattersThe SEC’s dismissal of the Ripple ruling creates uncertainty for cryptocurrency companies. If the SEC wins its case against Coinbase, companies could face security registration requirements even if their tokens share characteristics with XRP, potentially hindering innovation and growth within the US crypto market.If you’re interested in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, you’ll also want to read this article about a lawyer’s prediction on the outcome of the case:Lawyer Predicts Ripple Win in SEC Case: Good News Looming?This article discusses the SEC’s objection to Ripple’s plan to launch a stablecoin.

Jack Dorsey Predicts Bitcoin Will Skyrocket to ‘At Least $1,000,000’ by 2030: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Billionaire and tech entrepreneur Jack Dorsey expects big things from Bitcoin (BTC) in the next six years.
In a new interview with tech-focused news site Pirate Wires, the Twitter co-founder predicts that the top crypto asset will skyrocket to “at least” $1 million by 2030.










“I do think it hits that number and goes beyond. But I think the price is only interesting… The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves – everyone who puts any effort in to make it better – is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up. It’s a fascinating ecosystem and movement, more than anything else. It taught me a lot.”
Earlier this month, Dorsey’s fintech conglomerate Block announced it is investing 10% of its gross profit from Bitcoin products directly into BTC itself.
At the end of March and before the new Bitcoin purchase program was initiated, Block had 8,038 BTC on its balance sheet, according to a document shared by the firm. The Bitcoin trove represented approximately 9% of the company’s total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
BTC is trading at $60,529 at time of writing and is down more than 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

This Week in Coins: Bitcoin Is Boring But Bizarre Meme Coin Antics Continue - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.Most cryptocurrencies are down this week, as the price of Bitcoin and other major coins and tokens struggled to gain ground for another depressing week. Bitcoin is now trading for $61,275, according to CoinGecko—a seven-day drop of more than 3%.For a market known for its rollercoaster volatility, things are... well, boring. That's the verdict of analyst and Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards, who said on Twitter Thursday that the lack of movement for the top cryptocurrency is part of the normal cycle.The biggest digital asset, which exploded in value following the historic approval of U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETF) on stock exchanges, has struggled to gain ground after plunging below its 2021 record high of $69,044 in early April.The exhaustion of ETF hype fears that the Federal Reserve won't cut interest rates stunted the coin's seemingly unstoppable rise.Things might be picking up, though: for three days this week, money flowed into the Bitcoin-based TradFi products.It might be a while until Bitcoin touches its all-time high again. A Friday report by CoinShares said that, ultimately, it will come down down to what the U.S. central bank does.Meme coin mania continued, as developers continued to do weird and wacky things to get their assets noticed, but more established cryptocurrencies that made big gains last week still suffered, the frothy activity ultimately not lifting the needle. Solana-based Bonk, for example, is down nearly 15%, trading for $0.00002342.Dogwifhat, which also runs on Solana, took a dip of more than 7% over seven days. It's now priced at $3.12.Finally, Dogecoin—the Elon Musk favorite and 10th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap—enters the weekend down over 10% at $0.145. But It isn't all bad news: the original meme coin looks set to reward long-term holders as it approaches a "golden cross."Elsewhere, Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, struggled more than other major cryptocurrencies, dropping by close to 7% over the week. It's now priced at $2,927.The asset has been gradually declining since a high-profile lawsuit by software company Consensys alleged that the SEC was deliberately trying to make things difficult for those in the Ethereum sphere.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Shark Tank's Mark Cuban slams SEC: 'Trying to destroy crypto'


The cryptocurrency industry has taken multiple regulatory hits in the last two years. In 2024, particularly, the scrutiny intensified led mainly by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Gary Gensler’s leadership. This approach has raised criticism among crypto enthusiasts like the renowned billionaire and investor Mark Cuban – from the “Shark Tank” television show.
In a scathing X (formerly Twitter) post on May 11, Mark Cuban accused the SEC and its chairman, Gary Gensler, of attempting to destroy the cryptocurrency industry. Cuban asserted that the SEC’s current approach makes it nearly impossible for companies to comply with registration rules.

The entrepreneur stated that he now rejects investment opportunities involving token releases due to the SEC’s recent behavior. Cuban emphasized that his decision is based not on the companies but on the SEC’s restrictive policies.


Mark Cuban believes the SEC is making it ‘impossible to comply’
Moreover, he argued that the SEC’s actions have created a prohibitively expensive and time-consuming process for companies seeking to operate legitimately. Cuban also expressed concern that companies attempting to operate outside the USA to avoid SEC regulations are not viable investment options for him.
The billionaire suggested that the SEC could easily remedy the situation by implementing measures to increase compliance and protect investors. He pointed out that the crypto industry is eager to find ways to register, comply, and reduce speculative noise.
However, Cuban claimed that the SEC’s current approach fails to distinguish between legitimate companies and “junk tokens,” leaving investors unable to differentiate. He directly blamed SEC Chairman Gary Gensler for creating a legacy that hinders good companies from doing the right thing.

“This is the legacy of Gary Gensler. He has made it impossible for good companies to do the right thing.”
– Mark Cuban

In conclusion, Cuban highlighted the small number of operating companies that have successfully registered their tokens with the SEC and continue to operate in the USA. His critique underscores the ongoing tensions between the cryptocurrency industry and regulatory bodies.

Bold Statement from the Famous Founder: "May 23rd Will Be A Turning Point In The Cryptocurrency World, Here's Why" - Bitcoin Sistemi

According to BitOoda founder Vivek Raman, May 23 will be a turning point in the cryptocurrency world. “On May 23, we will see all spot Ethereum ETFs approved,” Raman said in a bold statement.
Despite the current cyclical low in ETH sentiment and the SEC's ongoing lawsuits against major ecosystem participants such as Uniswap, Coinbase, and Consensys, Raman remains optimistic. He outlined five key reasons why he believes approval is imminent:


ARK and 21Shares Removed Staking from Their Applications
ARK and 21Shares, whose Spot ETH ETF decisions will be made on May 23, have amended their filings to remove staking. Raman argues that no issuer would preemptively leverage this potential source of free revenue without guidance from a regulator that provides a way forward.
Grayscale Withdraws ETH Futures ETF Application
Grayscale, known for its perseverance in the face of regulatory obstacles, has withdrawn its application for ETH Futures ETF. Raman suggests that Grayscale won't shy away from a winnable fight unless it knows the spot ETH ETF is close.






SEC Approval of ETH Futures ETFs
The SEC has already approved ETH Futures ETFs, which implies that ETH is in the same boat as BTC and is considered a commodity under the CFTC, according to Raman. This confirmation was made after the Merge, meaning proof of stake ETH remains a commodity.
Gensler's Statement regarding ETH
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler stated that ETH is a non-security asset. Despite the current political debate, Raman believes that the ETF decision will force clarification of ETH's status.


SEC Exceeding Its Authority
The SEC has been described as “arbitrary and capricious” by the courts. Raman argues that given the current situation, rejecting the spot ETH ETF would result in another embarrassing loss for the SEC. He suggests that the only move left is to quietly approve ETH ETFs.

Bloomberg Strategist Presents Warning for Crypto per Bitcoin/Gold Cross

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



Mike McGlone, a Bloomberg intelligence strategist, has recently highlighted an intriguing trend that could have significant implications for the crypto market, particularly concerning the relationship between Bitcoin, gold and S&P 500.In a recent analysis, McGlone highlighted the slumping Bitcoin/gold cross, particularly to the S&P 500 and its broader implications for risk assets. The analysis also reflects on Bitcoin's rally post-SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.According to McGlone, the January U.S. ETF launches boosted inflows, strengthening Bitcoin's status as a leading indicator. It was a near-perfect storm as Bitcoin attained all-time highs in Q1, but it did not make new all-time highs versus gold and S&P 500, failing to surpass peaks set in 2021. Given that the inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs have relatively slowed, the hangover may have implications for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.McGlone explained that Bitcoin was climbing against gold the last time the S&P 500 e-mini future crossed above its 50-week moving average in November, but now the Bitcoin/gold cross is falling.The slumping Bitcoin/gold cross, in contrast to the S&P 500's performance, might indicate a potential reversal in risk assets that could have far-reaching consequences.Bitcoin price actionAt the time of writing, BTC was down 3.29% in the last 24 hours to $60,779 as the crypto market faced selling pressure. According to crypto analyst Michael Van De Poppe, Bitcoin currently trades at a crucial level; failure to hold at $60,000 may result in selling to $55,000 or $52,000, after which the rising trend continues.In late April, Bitcoin experienced its halving event, which has historically been a chopping sell-the-news event in the immediate term. The fourth halving was no exception, with the Bitcoin price falling shortly after and trading near $57,000. This is the lowest price in the past two months, and the market has been flat since the halving date.Measured from the above $73,000 all-time high reached in mid-March, Bitcoin prices fell by nearly 20%, which is the deepest correction on a closing basis since the FTX lows in November 2022. Howbeit, Glassnode deduces that this macro uptrend might be one of the most resilient in history, with comparatively shallow corrections thus far.

BlackRock makes the conversation in crypto AGAIN!! Is it controlling Bitcoin?

In contrast to some spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, BlackRock, an investment management firm, holds a relatively small $5.5 million stake in iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitcoin has been around for over 15 years now, and an increasing number of companies and brands have started accepting the crypto as a form of payment. BlackRock BTC holdingsBitcoin is intentionally designed to be scarce. It’s highly regarded as a dependable store of value, which is why people are eager to have the opportunity to use it. As bitcoin is being used less for everyday transactions, it is gaining popularity as a means of exchange in alternative ways. This includes strategic investments in startups by funds, VCs, and angel investors. Market investors have observed an increasing number of startups seeking service providers to convert bitcoin into fiat currency for their operational needs.Investors have also observed a rise in the number of major institutional investors acquiring bitcoin as an alternative investment. They are seeking ways to diversify their portfolios and find returns that can protect against market volatility.  According to reports, BlackRock has submitted its 13F filing. The filing provides a measure of institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. In this filing, the company disclosed its $5.5 million exposure to its IBIT Bitcoin ETF, which is considered moderate.This offering is significantly different from the large investments made by other issuers that have been approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It’s worth mentioning that BraceBridge holds the top position as the largest IBIT holder, with a significant stake of $86 million. Given the relatively small size of BlackRock’s IBIT stake, there are suspicions among certain crypto analysts.JPMorgan recently revealed its investments in Bitcoin ETFs. According to the firm’s portfolio, they currently hold 11,000 IBIT shares valued at $445,170, along with an additional 797 shares worth $32,255. This disclosure was made following Wells Fargo’s announcement of its spot Bitcoin ETF exposure, which generated optimism in the market.Is BlackRock stealing BTC’s growth potential?At this point, BlackRock is slowly bouncing back with a significant influx of $14.2 million, which reflects investor confidence in the IBIT ETF. In general, the price of Bitcoin has not shown a positive response to the increasing ETF holdings.Approval of additional financial products that use different digital assets (such as the upcoming decision on the Ethereum ETF) could potentially alleviate some of the buying pressure on ETFs. Additionally, exploring the possibility of licensing and approving additional fiat to bitcoin payment and exchange systems could potentially increase the availability of bitcoin in the market beyond just traditional brokerages.In the Web3 ecosystem, an increasing number of investors are using crypto assets to support promising startups. Several impressive projects and initiatives have already received funding through BTC or other stablecoins, and we can expect to witness an increase in such endeavors moving forward.In order to achieve this, it is crucial to ensure a sufficient circulation of bitcoin in the market. In order to meet these requirements, it is necessary to have a wider range of financial products with multiple purchasing models and diverse digital currency support. Additionally, there should be increased accessibility to mediums of exchange to ensure that investors and companies using BTC for funding can continue to thrive.Furthermore, it is worth noting that major financial institutions, such as BlackRock, have shown a strong interest in this plan. The increasing demand for digital currency investment products, as evidenced by the popularity of their bitcoin ETFs, further supports this notion.

More Bitcoin bleeding ahead; BTC faces significant rejection as bears take control


Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market are grappling with bearish pressure. Notably, the maiden digital asset is experiencing difficulty sustaining trading levels above $60,000, and some market participants anticipate further downside.
In this line, in a TradingView post on May 10, crypto trading expert TradingShot indicated that, according to technical indicators, Bitcoin might encounter additional losses as it contends with rejection at critical levels.
The analyst observed that repeated rejections at the one-day moving average 50 (1D MA50) around the $65,000 position had marred Bitcoin’s recent price action around the $65,000 position. This movement marks the third rejection almost a month since the bearish breakout on April 13.

Therefore, this failure to sustain momentum above this key moving average raises concerns among traders and analysts.
Implication of Bitcoin’s setbacks 
Additionally, the analyst noted that Bitcoin’s latest setback has seen it break below the 1D MA100 by around $61,000, a crucial support level. According to TradingShot, this development is far from ideal, potentially paving the way for a lower low in Bitcoin’s price action.

“The technical structure since April 08 is a Channel Down nonetheless, so such feat is certainly possible on the short-term. As you can see from past 1D MA50 bearish break-outs, BTC tends to get more than 2 rejections and excluding January 2024, it has stayed below the 1D MA100 for longer,”  the expert said. 

What makes the current situation particularly noteworthy is the potential for Bitcoin to experience a significant decline. The expert pointed out that should a lower low be established; Bitcoin would not only test the 1D MA200, around the $50,000 mark, but also approach a nearly 30% decline from its recent record high of above $73,000. 
TradingShot underscored that such a decline is not uncommon during bull cycle rallies, suggesting that Bitcoin’s current woes may be part of a broader market correction. However, for investors and traders, the implications of these technical indicators point towards further downside potential for Bitcoin in the near term.
Bitcoin’s bullish sentiments 
It’s worth noting that Bitcoin remains entrenched below the crucial $65,000 resistance level as the market anticipates the onset of the post-halving rally. Despite short-term bullish sentiments, Bitcoin has struggled to gain momentum, failing to capitalize on positive news, such as the revelation of banking giant JPMorgan Chase’s (NYSE: JPM) exposure to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 
Notably, the dynamics surrounding ETFs, including inflows and outflows, have influenced Bitcoin’s recent price trajectory.
Despite the prevailing cautious sentiment, an underlying bullish outlook persists within the market. Notably, Jack Dorsey, former CEO of Twitter (now X) and a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, voiced optimism, projecting a potential surge for Bitcoin to $1 million by 2030. 
Moreover, optimism is bolstered by expectations of the traditional post-halving rally, which historically has injected bullish momentum into Bitcoin’s price.
Bitcoin price analysis
At the time of reporting, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $61,050, registering a marginal correction of less than 0.1% over the past 24 hours. However, Bitcoin has experienced a decline of nearly 4% every week.

As Bitcoin navigates through a period of consolidation amidst bearish conditions, investors should also monitor developments in Federal Reserve monetary policies, as they are poised to exert significant influence on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC) Will Rally 11,000% Ahead of Exchange Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 11,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DONBTC will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Donald Bitcoin.



Currently, Donald Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DONBTC on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 7nErZV74Y8L7zz1thKUczBniWMnLc74gQMdzbWnhr95e – in the receiving field.



DONBTC currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Toncoin Surges Ahead of Notcoin Game Launch, Outshines Broader Crypto Market with Robust Growth



                    

Toncoin has recently demonstrated notable outperformance in the cryptocurrency market, which overall increased by 15% in the same period. 



This performance is indicative of Toncoin’s strong and specific growth catalysts, despite its general alignment with the broader crypto trends.




As we approach the launch of Notcoin, a new play-to-earn game, on May 16, Toncoin’s price has seen a significant increase. 



Notcoin, which will be integrated within the Telegram app, is a social clicking game where players interact with a bot and are encouraged to invite others to join. 



The game centers on players tapping a golden coin to earn ‘Notcoin,’ a virtual currency. This engaging format has already attracted over 34.5 million players involved in the “mining” of Notcoin tokens.




In line with this, the Notcoin team plans to airdrop a new native cryptocurrency, NOT, to its 34.5 million token holders, which will be operational on the TON Blockchain from May 16. 



This blockchain is a part of the Open Network’s layer 1 proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystem. Additionally, NOT is set to begin trading on prominent crypto exchanges like Binance and Bybit on the same day.



The anticipation surrounding the NOT launch has sparked a rise in the total value locked (TVL) on the TON blockchain, reaching 40.58 million TON by May 10, marking a 33% increase within the month and a sevenfold growth throughout 2024. 



This increase highlights the robust demand for Toncoin.




This rising demand coincides with the recent integration of Tether (USDT) stablecoins on the TON blockchain.

Furthermore, an investment from Pantera Capital in the Open Network—citing the April integration with the Telegram messaging service as a key reason—has propelled Toncoin’s value further. 



This partnership has the potential to position the Open Network among the largest crypto networks, especially considering Telegram’s vast user base of 900 million monthly users.



Since these developments, Toncoin’s value has surged by approximately 46%, demonstrating a positive market reaction to these strategic enhancements. 



The cryptocurrency’s resilience is also evident from its recovery points, notably after reaching a key support confluence involving an ascending trendline, the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), and the 0.618 Fibonacci level, highlighted by a red circle on related charts.



Moreover, a similar resurgence in TON’s price occurred following a drop in the daily relative strength index (RSI) to 37.45, a reminder of a comparable recovery in February. 



These indicators, alongside the fractal analysis of Toncoin’s price behaviors around these support levels, suggest potential upward movement. 



Predictions indicate that TON’s price could climb over 20% in May, testing resistance at the 0.236 Fibonacci line at $7.17 and potentially reaching the 0.0 Fib line at approximately $8.77. 



Conversely, a pullback could see prices descending toward $6.19 and possibly further to $5.40, aligning with the ascending trendline and the 0.5 Fib line.

Ethereum Spot ETFs Approval Delayed Until 2025: Report



	

Key Points:




The SEC may reject Ethereum spot ETFs applications until 2025 due to Ethereum’s unclear regulatory status.



If Trump wins a second term, the SEC may adopt a more crypto-friendly stance, potentially benefiting Ethereum spot ETFs.



If Biden wins, issuers may pause and reassess their strategies post-election.




According to DLNews, The SEC might reject Ethereum spot ETFs until 2025 due to regulatory concerns, says Bloomberg analyst. The US election outcome could impact this, with a Trump win potentially favoring crypto.





Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has forecasted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may reject applications for Ethereum spot ETFs on May 23, with potential approval not expected until 2025.



Possible Rejection of Ethereum Spot ETF Applications



The lack of engagement with prospective issuers and Ethereum’s unclear regulatory status have contributed to this pessimistic outlook. This view has been further influenced by a recent SEC investigation into the Ethereum Foundation.



Upon rejection, prospective ETF issuers, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, or Ark Invest, have a choice to either follow Grayscale’s path and sue the SEC or to refile their applications at a later date. 




Notwithstanding, the upcoming US election could be a game-changer. If Donald Trump wins a second term, the SEC may face a leadership change, potentially leading to a more crypto-friendly stance.

Impact of Upcoming US Election on Crypto Regulations



However, the likelihood of repeated lawsuits against the SEC, especially for Ethereum ETFs, seems slim. The thereof is mainly due to the financial and attention costs associated with lawsuits and the potential risk of alienating the SEC. 



Balchunas further suggests that if Trump wins the election, it could bring about a friendlier environment for crypto and spot ETFs. But, if Joe Biden wins, issuers may take a break and reassess their strategies after the election.

"Crypto voters will be heard in the 2024 election" - Mark Cuban

In a recent social media post, billionaire Mark Cuban shared his thoughts on former 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s interest in crypto. According to Cuban, the digital asset market is expected to have a significant impact on the upcoming 2024 election.“If Joe Biden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank Gary Gensler and the SEC,” stated Cuban on the social media platform X. “Crypto is a mainstay with younger and independent voters.”Mark Cuban warns Joe Biden on crypto and the 2024 political frameIn a recent statement, the American businessman and television personality suggested that if Joe Biden were to lose the presidential election, Gary Gensler and the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) might deserve some credit.“Crypto is a mainstay with younger and independent voters,” he stated, expressing his concern that SEC Chair Gensler has not taken sufficient measures to safeguard investors from fraudulent activities.The entrepreneur expressed their strong opinion, stating that the actions of the SEC have severely hindered the ability of crypto companies to function in the United States. They believe that this has resulted in the closure of several companies and the detriment of countless entrepreneurs.On the other hand, the Biden administration has made it clear that they will oppose any attempts to reverse the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which has been met with disapproval by many in the industry. On the other hand, the Biden administration argued that reversing the decision would hinder the SEC’s ability to protect investors in the digital assets market.These actions have caused dissatisfaction among digital assets stakeholders who view them as potentially harmful to Biden’s chances of being reelected.Imagine risking losing control of the most powerful nation in human history [because you allowed] a rogue regulator try to outlaw ‘internet money,’ which 40% of the adults in your country already owns. And the regulator is going to lose in court anyway.
Uniswap creator Hayden Adams wrote.Crypto makes it to the ballot paperAccording to the business man, if Biden fails to secure another term as president, there could be potential consequences for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and its Chair, Gary Gensler, who is known for his strong opposition to cryptocurrencies. He emphasized the importance of crypto voters making their voices heard in the upcoming election.“This is also a warning to Congress,” Cuban continued. “Crypto voters will be heard this election. You could solve this problem for Biden by passing legislation that defines registration that is specific to the crypto industry just as other industries have registration that is defined for them. Or you could do the better option and assign all crypto to be regulated by the CFTC.”According to a poll carried out in January 2024, the majority of voters in the crypto community expressed a preference for Trump as the U.S. president, with a significant percentage also favoring Biden.On the other hand, a significant portion of the population, 46%, expressed their preference for Democrats in the Senate and House, while 42% indicated their inclination towards Republicans in Congress. A small portion of these voters remained undecided.It has been reported that President Trump has expressed his willingness to accept donations in digital assets for his presidential campaign. In addition, memecoins inspired by former President Trump and current President Joe Biden experienced significant rallies on May 9, with gains of 44% and 22% respectively.

JPMorgan Chase Blocks $100 Chocolate Purchase, Approves $49,000 Illicit Wire Transfer - Here's Why the Bank Is Refusing To Reimburse - The Daily Hodl


								A couple in Atlanta says one phone call led to their entire life savings being drained from their JPMorgan Chase bank account.
Gloria and Gary Moss tell FOX 5 that they felt secure after Chase blocked a $100 purchase for chocolate months ago, requiring confirmation for the transaction to go through.










But on February 16th, the couple says they received two text messages that also appeared to be from Chase’s fraud department, telling them that one of their debit cards had been compromised.
The texts came from the same six-digit short code as every other alert from Chase’s communications system, so the message seemed legit.
Gloria called the number and says she unknowingly spoke to a scammer who sounded professional and asked for a one-time pin (OTP) code that was text messaged to her phone, claiming it was needed to cancel her card.
Gloria confirmed the OTP code, which gave the criminal the power to drain the couple’s life savings – about $49,000 – in around 20 minutes while they kept her distracted on the phone.
The Mosses say the massive transfer went through without any further contact or concern from Chase, and the money was cleared via wire transfer to Wells Fargo – which was only able to return about $700 back to the couple.
In a letter, Chase defended its security systems and refused to reimburse the account, stating that the bank did call the Mosses and that someone who answered the phone verified the wire was valid.
Local police say they’re now investigating the incident and exploring whether or not someone was able to gain control of Gloria’s cell phone.

'Jeo Boden' Meme Coin Soars 25% After Trump Diss - Details


																The memecoin “Jeo Boden” has taken the crypto world by storm, riding on the back of a lukewarm comment from former US President Donald Trump. The whimsical cryptocurrency, a playful misspelling of President Joe Biden’s name, experienced a huge increase after Trump mentioned it at an NFT event in Florida.
What was once a subject of amusement has now become a serious investment, as Boden surged 20% following Trump’s offhand remark.

	Related Reading



Trump Rally Or Fleeting Frenzy? Analysts Divided
The cryptocurrency community has been divided over the impact of Trump’s mention of Boden. Some analysts, such as Samantha Wilkins, believe that any mention from a prominent figure like Trump is positive for the memecoin. They contend that Boden has shown to be a tenacious and astute investment, and that the excitement around it has only grown as a result of Trump’s remark.

However, some experts remain skeptical. They caution that Boden’s value is built on hype rather than utility, making it susceptible to swift market shifts. A single negative tweet from Trump or a change in market sentiment could cause Boden to come crashing down as quickly as it rose.
Will Trump Re-Boden The Market?
Adding another layer of intrigue to the Boden saga, the prediction platform Polymarket has created a contract speculating on the likelihood of Trump mentioning the memecoin again before July. Currently, the contract’s “yes” shares are trading at $0.05, indicating an 11% chance that Trump will utter the word “Boden” in the coming months.
Source: Polymarket
This unique situation presents an unusual scenario where the value of a memecoin hinges on the whims of a former president. If Trump revisits Boden in a future speech or tweet, it could trigger another surge in price.
However, if he remains silent, the current hype surrounding Boden may fizzle out, leaving investors holding a depreciating digital punchline.

Boden: A Gamble On Speculation
The rise of Boden serves as a cautionary tale for memecoin enthusiasts. While these tokens can offer explosive returns, their value is often tied to fleeting trends and external factors beyond their control. With the enigmatic Trump as a wildcard influence, the future of Boden remains uncertain.

Investors eagerly await the next chapter in this bizarre crypto story, as the saga of Boden continues to unfold. It is a gamble on speculation, where the coin’s value dances on the edge of uncertainty. The Boden phenomenon highlights the unpredictable nature of memecoins and the risks associated with investing in such volatile assets.

Here’s What Volatility Says About Where Dogecoin Price Is Headed


								Dogecoin now finds its current price movement moving with a peculiar lack of action. In this case, the lack of action points to low volatility, especially in the last few days. Notably, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock has revealed that the crypto is now at its lowest point in the last 30 days. 

In the crypto world, low volatility typically means lower interest from short-term speculators and traders, which in turn could lead to DOGE trading in a sideways movement in the short term.
Volatility Points To Stagnant Price Action
At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1430 and is down by 5.22% in the past 24 hours. This decline has seen the meme coin reversing some of its gains earlier in the week. Interestingly, this reversal and failure to keep up its price gains means DOGE has largely bounced between the upper end of $0.172 and the lower end of $0.12 since the middle of April. 
According to the data from IntoTheBlock, this sideways movement can be attributed to a lack of volatility from the meme coin. 
DOGE’s price action is primarily influenced by a limited number of factors, given its meme coin status and lack of a clearly defined real-world utility. One of these factors involves the movements of whales, while another is the increased demand fueled by trader hype. This surge in demand, in turn, leads to heightened volatility and a quick increase in prices. 

Dogecoin is now trading at $0.14. Chart: TradingView
On the other hand, when a crypto like Dogecoin experiences a period of low volatility, it usually means the price isn’t moving up or down very much. 
In other words, the market has temporarily reached an equilibrium. During these lulls, the Dogecoin price tends to move sideways, trading within a narrow range. The low volatility indicates a lack of strong sentiment in either direction. Neither the bulls nor the bears have taken control, so the market is indecisive.
What’s Next For DOGE?
At the time of writing, DOGE could continue trading around the $0.14 price level in the coming days. The crypto is also at risk of revising $0.12 at the downside if the $0.14 support level fails to hold. However, DOGE is still one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, meaning this period of low volatility could end as soon as it began. 

A factor that could return bullish momentum is the recent reports of Tesla adding Dogecoin as a payment method according to a FAQs section on the company’s official website. 
The lackluster action presents a good opportunity for Dogecoin traders to load up their holdings while anticipating a price increase in the longer term.

Shiba Inu burn rate spikes over 50%: What does it mean for SHIB? - AMBCrypto



While the burn rate increased, SHIB’s price fell by 3.86%.
A decrease in circulation and social dominance indicated a possible entry for the token.

The number of Shiba Inu [SHIB] tokens burned in the last 24 hours has increased by 56.16%, data from Shibburn showed. A day before this figure decreased, and was less than 40 million tokens.
The major aim of Shiba Inu burning is to increase the value of the tokens in circulation by creating scarcity. This way, SHIB can tackle inflationary pressure.
Therefore, the recent increase suggests that SHIB might avoid another plunge. However, it is not all the time that the token price rises when the burn rate jumps.
In some instances, SHIB moves sideways. Other times, the price declines.
Source: Shibburn
SHIB fails to go with the trend
As of this writing, SHIB’s price has lost 3.86% of its value. This happened within the same period the number of burned tokens increased, indicating a next-to-nothing effect on the memecoin’s value.
However, AMBCrypto checked Shiba Inu’s social dominance to see if there had been any changes. Social dominance measures the rate of discussions about a project when compared to other top 100 assets.
At press time, on-chain data from Santiment showed that the metric dropped slightly to 0.677%.
This decline was a testament to the fact that traders might be overlooking SHIB and concentrating on other projects for now.
From a price perspective, this presents a potential buying opportunity before the price jumps. Should the price of the token begin to rise, social dominance might also increase, and this could be a case of FOMO.
FOMO stands for Fear Of Missing Out. It happens when attention moves to a project after the price must have appreciated by a significant percentage.
Those who engage in this might either get burnt by a correction or be left with crumbs of gains.
Source: Santiment
Price may lay back for a while
But AMBCrypto does not expect the big move to happen in the next few days. However, a surge in buying pressure could confirm the upswing.
If this is the case, SHIB might begin a race that sets it above $0.000030. Furthermore, the one-day circulation dropped to 447.71 billion.
Two days before that, the metric was over 1 trillion. Circulation measures the number of tokens used in transactions within a given period.
With the decline, SHIB might not have to deal with intense selling pressure. Hence, this could offer some stability for the price.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s SHIB’s market cap in DOGE terms

In a bullish scenario, the decrease could cause SHIB’s price to go on a steady uptick, meaning the potential move to $0.000030 could be possible.
However, activity on the Shiba Inu network has been decreasing, indicating that the potential rally could take some time. But if the 24-hour active addresses begin to rise again, the price of SHIB might follow.

$44 billion company’s CEO makes a stand for Bitcoin in letter to shareholders


Block Inc. (NYSE: SQ), Square’s and Cash App’s parent company, and valued at $44 billion has raised its earnings forecast for the year and unveiled significant plans to expand its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. The announcement led to a 7.9% surge in Block’s shares in post-market trading.
In a letter to shareholders, CEO Jack Dorsey stressed the importance of an “open protocol for money“ aligning with broader movements towards cryptocurrency acceptance.

“We believe the world needs an open protocol for money, one that’s not owned or controlled by any single entity,” Dorsey said in the note.



This approach is further validated by recent green lights from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for several Bitcoin ETFs, marking a  shift towards institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies
To solidify this commitment, Block plans to allocate 10% of its gross profits from Bitcoin-related products to additional Bitcoin acquisitions each month. Currently, less than 3% of Block’s resources are invested in Bitcoin-related initiatives, a figure set to grow substantially.
This strategic pivot is underscored by Block’s robust financial performance. The company has revised its annual adjusted core earnings forecast upwards from $2.63 billion to at least $2.76 billion, buoyed by strong U.S. consumer spending that defies fears of an economic slowdown. In the reported quarter, Block notched a 19% jump in total net revenue, reaching $5.96 billion.
Operational and financial highlights
Financially, Block reported a substantial increase in its operations, with gross profit rising to $2.09 billion, a 22% increase from the previous year. The company’s net income was notably robust, reporting $472 million, or 74 cents per share, a significant increase from $98.3 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier.
The Cash App segment of Block’s business, a widely used mobile payment platform, reported a gross profit of $1.26 billion, marking a 25% year-over-year increase. The platform’s monthly active users for the Cash App Card rose to 24 million in March, with the total number of monthly transacting activities reaching 57 million, a 6% year-over-year increase.
Moreover, Block has been focusing on integrating Afterpay, the buy now, pay later company it acquired for $29 billion in 2021. Although Afterpay experienced significant losses post-acquisition, this integration is a critical part of Block’s strategy to enhance its suite of financial products and services.
Wall Street’s mixed views on Block’s valuation
SQ Analyst ratings. Source. tipranks
The investment community has expressed mixed views on Block’s financial outlook. According to 30 Wall Street analysts providing 12-month price targets in the last three months, the average price target stands at $90.42, with a high forecast of $100.00 and a low of $62.00. 
This range indicates a potential upside of 26.80% from the current share price of $71.31. These projections reflect varying degrees of confidence in Block’s strategic direction and its potential impact on the company’s future profitability and market position.
As Block continues to innovate and expand its financial products, the strategic emphasis on Bitcoin could not only redefine its growth trajectory but also influence broader market trends in digital currency and financial technology.
This bold move could very well shape the future landscape of how technology giants engage with cryptocurrency, marking a pivotal moment in Block’s history.

LayerZero Sybil User Analysis: Only 30k Users Admit To Sybil Activity



	

Key Points:




LayerZero’s 5 million addresses made 1-5 transactions each, 4.24 million costing less than $10.



Out of 6 million users, only 400k to 600k are real, with 30k identified as Sybil.



LayerZero incentivizes Sybil users to self-report, offering 15% of their initial tokens.




LayerZero Sybil user analysis revealed, CEO said that out of 6M users, just 400k-600k are genuine accounts. Currently, only 30k are identified as Sybil.

                        Solana (SOL/USD) is trading at $145.88, experiencing a minor decline of 1.50% in the last 24 hours. Amidst this fluctuation, CEO Anatoly Yakovenko shared a bullish outlook for Solana‘s role in the Web3 space at the Solana Crossroads 2024 conference.With the upcoming release of Firedancer, Solana’s new client, the network aims to enhance its transaction capabilities and efficiency significantly. This advancement could potentially elevate Solana’s market position, influencing the Solana price prediction as it prepares to lead in the Web3 era.Solana’s Future After Firedancer: Anatoly Yakovenko Reveals Vision at Crossroads 2024
At the Solana Crossroads 2024 conference, Anatoly Yakovenko, CEO of Solana Labs, shared his vision for the network’s advancement beyond its “mainnet beta” phase with the impending release of Firedancer. This new client, developed by Jump Crypto, is set to boost Solana’s transaction capabilities and overall efficiency by introducing an alternative to its existing single-client system, aiming to bolster network stability.VIDEOYakovenko stressed the benefit of diversifying client development to reduce bug risks and expressed optimism about Firedancer’s deployment before the Solana Breakpoint conference in September.Despite facing challenges like network outages and centralization critiques, Solana continues to handle a high volume of transactions. The network’s endurance through rigorous testing by various applications, including memecoins and NFTs, has been instrumental in fine-tuning its operations.Yakovenko also detailed ambitious plans for Solana to host over $1 trillion in stablecoins within five years, underscoring a commitment to scaling at the base layer of the blockchain, in stark contrast to Ethereum’s multi-layered scaling strategy.He highlighted ongoing hardware innovations from companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Nvidia as crucial support for Solana’s scalability goals, positioning it for a significant role in the future of blockchain technology.Key Takeaways:
Firedancer Launch: Aiming to enhance reliability and efficiency, it is set for a potential launch before September.
Network Challenges: Past issues are viewed as critical stress tests, paving the way for future scalability.
Future Goals: Solana plans to host over $1 trillion in stablecoins, focusing on scalability through hardware advancements.
Solana Price Prediction
From a technical perspective, Solana’s pivotal price point is $140.89. Should the price ascend, the immediate resistance level is at $155.33, followed by higher barriers at $166.83 and $175.83. These levels could curb upward movements unless significant buying pressure emerges.Conversely, the support framework begins at $132.31, with further floors established at $122.20 and $112.48. These markers are crucial for Solana, as they represent potential reversal zones if the price trajectory dips.Solana Price PredictionThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 42, reflecting a bearish momentum. Additionally, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), located at $146.39, is slightly above the current trading price, reinforcing it as a resistance level.In summary, Solana faces a testing market environment. A decisive move above the $146.39 level could alter its course towards bullishness.“Let’s move from Solana’s ecosystem to the WienerAI presale in the AI-driven trading space.”Join WienerAI Presale Now: Secure Your Stake Before Prices Rise

Kraken Asks Court To Dismiss SEC Claims Alleging the Crypto Exchange Operated As Unregistered Securities Broker - The Daily Hodl


								The crypto exchange Kraken is pushing back against claims made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In November, the SEC charged Kraken with operating its crypto trading platform as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer and clearing agency.










Earlier this year, Kraken filed in US District Court to dismiss those charges, and the company provided additional arguments in support of that motion on Thursday.
The exchange’s lawyers argue that the SEC’s argument would widen the definition of investment contracts and expand the regulator’s jurisdiction outside of its delegated responsibility.
“When pressed to identify the securities in question, the SEC points to things that Kraken does not and could not trade, broker, or settle. Instead of identifying an investment contract, the SEC asks the Court to accept an ‘investment concept’ as sufficient. Instead of identifying an enterprise, the SEC asks the Court to accept an ‘ecosystem.’ But Kraken does not trade, broker, or settle ‘concepts’ or ‘ecosystems.’
The SEC never plainly alleges that what actually is traded, brokered, and settled on Kraken is itself an investment contract. This failure spotlights the fundamental problem with the SEC’s case. The only things that are alleged to be traded, brokered, or settled on Kraken are digital assets – which are not investment contracts.”
The SEC has argued that Kraken hawked 11 different “crypto asset securities” on its platform and was required by law to register with the regulator.
“The Supreme Court’s decision in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. compels a contrary conclusion. The Howey Court defined an ‘investment contract’ under the Securities Act and Exchange Act to mean ‘a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.'”

Pepe Doge to Skyrocket 7,600% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Doge has market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,600% in the coming two days, and Pepe Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Pepe Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Doge by entering its contract address – 7s7VZhFWTez5ykSr214AxnqRTMdcKu5rd77YFAx2DGG1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEDOGE.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Struggles with Investor Outflows Despite Brief May Influx



                    

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), experienced a brief resurgence in investment inflows in early May, following a substantial period of financial hemorrhaging since its inception. 



Despite this, the fund quickly reverted to outflows within just a few days, reflecting its ongoing struggles in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.




GBTC debuted on January 11 and suffered consistent outflows for 78 consecutive days, resulting in a total loss of over $17.5 billion. 



A temporary reversal occurred in early May, with inflows recorded on May 3 and May 6, totaling $63 million and $3.9 million respectively. 



This influx of investment briefly suggested a potential stabilization or renewed investor interest in the fund.




However, this trend did not sustain. By May 7 and May 9, GBTC reported outflows of $28.6 million and $43.4 million respectively, effectively negating the gains made in the previous days. 



This pattern of rapid reversal is indicative of the challenges faced by GBTC, marking it as the only spot Bitcoin ETF issuer to report outflows during that period while other funds under the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) saw positive or neutral investment flows.



In contrast, other Bitcoin ETFs have fared significantly better. 



For instance, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust attracted substantial investment, totaling nearly $15.5 billion.

Other notable funds include Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, and Cathie Wood’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, which reported net inflows of $8.1 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.2 billion respectively.



Despite these fluctuations, the average daily loss for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust since its launch stands at a stark $211 million. 



Nonetheless, the overall Bitcoin ETF market in the U.S. has maintained a positive net balance of $11.7 billion due to robust inflows into other funds.



Adding insight into the investor demographics, Jan VanEck, CEO of VanEck, commented during the Paris Blockchain Week in April that “You’ve had some Bitcoin whales and some other institutions move some assets in, but they were already exposed to BITCOIN.” 



He further noted the predominant retail investor contribution, which accounts for 90% of Bitcoin ETF inflows. 



Despite this, there is an anticipation for significant institutional investments from banks and traditional firms as projected around May.

Speculation heats up on this cryptocurrency as Citi speaks at private meeting


New speculation is swirling within the cryptocurrency market regarding Citi’s (NYSE: C) potential involvement with the Hedera (HBAR) Governing Council.
This speculation gained momentum following a reportedly private meeting held by Hedera in New York. Discussions centered on tokenizing real-world assets and other related topics, as crypto trading analyst CrediBull reported in an X (formerly Twitter) post on May 11.
According to the analyst, speculation escalated when a now-deleted picture, initially shared by the Hedera account, surfaced, showcasing a slide titled “Building the Future of Finance on Hedera.” Citigroup’s Head of Strategy and Partnerships for digital assets was nestled between two known Hedera Governing Council members.


The immediate deletion of the image has prompted many to question whether Citi might be the next addition to the Hedera Governing Council. While neither party has officially confirmed these rumors, the possibility of Citi’s involvement could significantly impact Hedera and the general crypto market.

Indeed, Hedera’s move to delete the image could potentially be likened to a possible accidental leak, as Citi’s participation in the Hedera Governing Council, or at the very least, its collaboration on an undisclosed use case, seems plausible.
HBAR price prediction
Against this backdrop of anticipation, AI-driven price prediction tool CoinCodex offered a glimpse into HBAR’s potential trajectory. According to the tool, HBAR is poised for a bullish run in the coming months as it moves close to breaching a key resistance level, with the $0.5 mark being the next possible target. 
CoinCodex forecasts that HBAR could surge to $0.14 within the next month, signaling a notable uptick in value. Looking further ahead, the prediction extends to a year, projecting a substantial increase to $0.43 per token.

Key price levels to watch 
At the same time, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, in an X post on May 8, highlighted three significant price levels for HBAR as potential opportunities: the previous all-time high at $0.63, the range between $1 and $1.30, and the broader range of $2 to $3.
Notably, the analyst urged investors to stay vigilant amid market changes and emphasized the need for HBAR investors to prepare for volatility.

It’s worth noting that HBAR has recently experienced bullish sentiment, diverging from the general market trajectory. This surge in the token’s price followed speculation regarding the potential tokenization of BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK) U.S. Treasury money market fund on the Hedera blockchain. However, the token retraced some gains as investors realized BlackRock’s indirect involvement.
Overall, the HBAR community continues to rely on the input of institutional investors like Citi to drive the token toward new levels, in addition to the overall market trajectory.
Meanwhile, as of press time, HBAR was valued at $0.108, showing daily gains of almost 2%. The token appears poised to rally towards $0.15, although bullish momentum must overcome the $0.12 resistance level.

Here’s when Bitcoin (BTC) could hit $72,000


The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has been trading between $60,000 and $72,000 for over two months. Now, bullish indicators suggest BTC could revisit the range’s top after more than a month of trading at its support.
Notably, Bitcoin entered the current range on February 28 in a remarkable bull rally before reaching its previous all-time high. As developed, BTC made new highs at $73,805 in the first deviation from the range in mid-March. Later, another deviation happened on May 1—this time, downwards.
The maiden cryptocurrency briefly lost momentum in early April and started a downtrend that ended with the mentioned deviation. Since then, BTC has traded below its 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA), and Bitcoin short-sellers have dominated a bearish market.


Should Bitcoin break out from its 30-EMA, currently at $63,360, it could seek the range highs at $72,000.

Short squeeze alert for Bitcoin (BTC) to $72,000
Interestingly, derivatives data from CoinGlass on May 11 further validate a short-term forecast of $72,000 for Bitcoin.
On that note, the one-month liquidation leverage heatmap shows two meaningful liquidity pools upwards due to increased open interest for short positions against BTC during this bearish last month.
In particular, the $67,000 and $71,000 are key levels with billions of dollars in short liquidations. If the sentiment changes for Bitcoin, these could become easy targets, potentially triggering two short-squeeze events that would drive the price to hit $72,000.

This sentiment shift could happen in May, as bullish divergences started surging for all cryptocurrencies, signaling an incoming trend reversal. Recently, Jack Dorsey sent a letter to Block Inc’s (NYSE: SQ) shareholders making a stand for Bitcoin.
In conclusion, the popular digital asset could be getting ready for an 18% rally from $61,000 to $72,000. However, trading BTC is an uncertain activity, and it is impossible to predict Bitcoin’s price movements accurately.
Investors must remain cautious and avoid high exposure despite the growing optimism in the space as India reopened its market to offshore crypto exchanges.

Token Unlock Alert: 20% of Large Cap Crypto Could Impact Market


A recent study on the top 300 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization reveals that over 20% of these coins have a large portion of their tokens yet to be unlocked.
This finding is crucial for investors and market analysts, given the potential impact on market prices and investor sentiment.
Most New Crypto Projects Will Unlock Significant Supply
Utilizing data from CoinGecko as of May 8, 2024, the analysis excluded stablecoins and wrapped assets. It focused on the market cap to fully diluted valuation (FDV) ratio.

“For the purpose of this study, low float crypto was defined as having a market cap to FDV ratio of 0 to 0.49, high float crypto had ratios of 0.50 to 0.99, and only crypto with a ratio of 1 were considered as fully diluted,” CoinGecko explained.


Significantly, low-float cryptocurrencies account for 21.3% of these top 300 coins. This suggests a large upcoming supply set to enter the market. Among them, Worldcoin (WLD) has the lowest ratio at 0.02, followed by Cheelee (CHEEL) at 0.06, Starknet (STRK) at 0.07, and Saga (SAGA) at 0.09. 
These cryptocurrencies, all launched in either 2023 or 2024, represent the newer additions to the market.

This trend of low float is predominantly seen in cryptocurrencies introduced in the last four years. Indeed, 54 out of the 64 low float large-cap cryptocurrencies were launched during this period. This influx of new projects indicates a dynamic expansion within the crypto space and signals potential market shifts as these tokens become available.
Looking at the near future, the market faces immediate impacts from scheduled token unlocks. 
For example, according to data from Token Unlocks, on May 12, Aptos will release 11.31 million APT tokens, worth nearly $100 million, which represents 2.64% of its circulating supply. Moreover, on May 16, Arbitrum will unlock 92.65 million ARB tokens, worth over $96 million, 3.49% of its circulating supply. 

These releases might create significant selling pressure on the respective tokens.
Additionally, BeInCrpto reports that around $3.58 billion worth of tokens will be unlocked this month across various projects. This substantial amount highlights the scale at which these unlocks could influence the broader market, potentially increasing volatility.

In contrast to newer cryptocurrencies, older ones generally have higher FDV ratios. Notable examples include Maker (MKR), Aave (AAVE), and Near Protocol (NEAR), with ratios of 0.95, 0.93, and 0.90, respectively. This indicates that most of their potential supply is already circulating, differing sharply from less than half of the newly launched cryptocurrencies achieving full dilution.

J.P Morgan, Wells Fargo hold Bitcoin now: Why are they interested in BTC? - AMBCrypto



Banks shift to Bitcoin investments, signaling changing views.
US House passes bill easing SEC guidelines, showing crypto acceptance.

In a new Form F13 filing, J.P. Morgan revealed an investment of $731,246 in spot Bitcoin ETF on behalf of its clients. 
They allocated the majority, $477,425, to IBIT in BlackRock, alongside investing in Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC.
Joining the fray was US banking giant Wells Fargo, holding 2,245 shares of GBTC valued at $121,207.
At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $60,864 after seeing a 3.34% decline but still, there has been a notable shift among investors. 
More banks join in
In early April, Europe’s second-largest bank, BNP Paribas, purchased 1,030 IBIT shares for $41,684.10. In Q1 2024, each was priced at $40.47, significantly lower than the current value of a single Bitcoin.
Interestingly, just like Dimon, Sandro Pierri, Head of the fund management group BNP Paribas Asset Management, too refuted BTC’s potential back in September 2022 and said, 
“We are not involved in cryptocurrencies and we don’t want to be involved.” 
These developments signify a notable shift in the stance of several banks, indicating a growing interest and openness toward BTC as an investment vehicle.
The tides are turning
In January, J.P. Morgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon made a bold stance against Bitcoin [BTC] during a conversation on ‘Squawk Box’. He said, 
“There are cryptocurrencies that do something, that might have value. And then there’s one that does nothing, I call it pet rock. The Bitcoin, or something like that.” 
However, he did note, 
“It has some use cases. Everything else is people trading among themselves.”
Bitcoin: What are the metrics saying? 
An increase in cumulative spot BTC ETF volumes reinforced the confirmation, representing the total trading activities of spot BTC ETFs within a defined timeframe.

The US House passed a bill to ease SEC guidelines, signaling the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies despite banks’ historical resistance to digital assets.
Elaborating on the same, the Biden Administration pledged to veto the legislation should it clear the Senate.
“Inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets including financial stability.”

Will Ethereum ETFs Be Approved? Possibility Jumps After Interesting Development! Bloomberg ETF Analyst Responds - Bitcoin Sistemi

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to reject the applications on May 23, which will determine the fate of Ethereum spot ETFs. The lack of significant interaction with potential issuers and Ethereum's unclear regulatory status led analysts to predict a negative outcome.
Following the removal of the staking feature in Ark Invest's application yesterday, the probability of approval of ETH Spot ETFs suddenly rose above 50% in some prediction markets.


The SEC's recent investigation into the Ethereum Foundation further complicates matters. As a result, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggests that spot Ethereum ETFs may not be approved until the end of 2025.
When faced with rejection, potential ETF issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity or Ark Invest have two options: follow Grayscale's example and sue the SEC or re-apply at a later date.





The upcoming US elections could significantly impact the future of Ethereum ETFs. If former President Donald Trump wins a second term, there could be a leadership change at the SEC. A new president could adopt a more cryptocurrency-friendly stance than current president Gary Gensler.
“If there is a new president, you reapply. Maybe you get approval. Or you file a lawsuit. Either way, it will take another year for this to be finalized,” Balchunas said. said.


In 2022, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC after years of rejections of Bitcoin spot ETF applications. A judge ruled in September that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting applications. Four months later, Bitcoin ETFs were launched.
However, this strategy is unlikely to be repeated for Ethereum ETFs. Balchunas suggested that Grayscale, which experienced significant outflows when its Bitcoin trust was converted into an ETF, may not aggressively pursue the conversion of its Ethereum trust.





Other potential issuers are unlikely to follow Grayscale's lead and sue the regulator. “None of these other firms want to anger the SEC. Grayscale was unique in that it wasn't a major ETF issuer. The rest of these firms have other businesses and are more afraid. No one else will step in,” Balchunas said.

The US presidential elections in November could potentially solve this problem. With Trump leading in some polls, the likelihood of a new SEC chairman being appointed is higher than previously anticipated.
“Trump isn't necessarily pro-crypto. Remember the previous SEC chairman, Jay Clayton, didn't allow ETFs either. So he's not going to say 'let's go crazy.' But it's still probably going to be better for crypto and spot ETFs,” Balchunas said.

Assuming a new president will be appointed in April or May and applications will be submitted soon after, the deadline for approval or rejection could be around December 2025. Issuers may also try to file as soon as the election is over, or even before the results are announced, to speed up the process.
If Joe Biden wins the election, Balchunas predicts a cooling off period similar to past periods when spot Bitcoin ETFs were rejected. “My guess is that issuers will go through the summer, lick their wounds, be upset, and then see what happens with the election,” Balchunas said.

Ethereum Gas Fees Plummet to Lowest Levels in Years - DailyCoin


        
Ethereum gas fees have recently plunged to lows not seen since 2020, but will it be sustainable?



A recent network upgrade and a downturn in activity have likely contributed to the significant drop in fees on Ethereum.



The decrease in fees has made performing transactions on Ethereum significantly cheaper.
The Ethereum network has witnessed a dramatic shift in its gas fee structure, with intraday averages plummeting to a mere 6 Gwei, the lowest point since January 2020, according to data from Etherscan. This translates into significantly cheaper on-chain operations for Ethereum users, raising questions about the long-term implications of this trend.Ethereum Gas Fees Plummet 93%Analysts attribute the decline to a confluence of factors. The recent Cancun-Deneb upgrade is believed to have played a role in optimizing network efficiency. Additionally, a downturn in overall network activity coincides with a period of relative calmness in the broader cryptocurrency market. 
This has led to a decrease in usage metrics, with Ethereum’s supply even relinquishing its recent deflationary status. The immediate impact on users is undeniable. Simple asset swaps on Ethereum now come at a fraction of the previous cost, often around $5. Similarly, cross-chain bridging services have dipped to a nominal $2 fee, making interoperability between blockchains more accessible. Even the minting of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a popular use case on Ethereum, has become significantly cheaper, with current costs hovering around $9.These figures represent a dramatic shift from just six months ago, with November 2023 marking the last comparable instance of such low gas fees. Data from BitInfoCharts reveals a staggering 93% decrease in transaction costs, dropping from a peak of $30 to a current average of $2.This development comes amidst ongoing discussions about the future of Ethereum’s gas mechanism. Vitalik Buterin, the platform’s founder, recently proposed a significant upgrade introducing the concept of “multi-dimensional gas.” Are Low Fees Here to Stay?This upgrade aims to provide Ethereum with greater flexibility in managing various resources, potentially improving transaction throughput without sacrificing network security. The substantial drop in gas fees is undoubtedly positive news for Ethereum users, enabling them to interact with the network at a much lower cost. 
However, industry experts like Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis, question the sustainability of this trend. The near-zero “blob fee” suggests a lack of demand for block space, raising concerns about potential future periods of high congestion and surging fees.As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, the recent gas fee developments highlight the ongoing efforts to optimize the network’s scalability and affordability. While the current situation offers a welcome respite for users, the long-term sustainability of these low fees remains to be seen. The proposed multi-dimensional gas mechanism serves as a testament to the ongoing pursuit of solutions that can ensure Ethereum’s long-term viability in a dynamic and ever-evolving blockchain landscape.On the Flipside
Lower gas fees could lead to decreased profitability for miners who secure the Ethereum network.



If low gas fees persist, it could become more economical for large players to dominate block space, hindering decentralization.



The current drop in fees might not translate to significant long-term scalability improvements. The network could still experience congestion during periods of high activity.
Why This MattersThis dramatic drop in Ethereum gas fees makes the network significantly more accessible for everyday users and developers, potentially attracting new projects and fueling further innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Donald Trump champions crypto, accuses Biden of ignorance | Cryptopolitan

Donald Trump just made it clear that he’s the pro-crypto candidate. At a Wednesday night bash at Mar-a-Lago, he rallied supporters with a bold statement, “If you’re in favor of crypto you’re gonna vote for Trump because they want to end it,” pointing his finger at the Democrats and President Joe Biden. The former president, once a critic of cryptocurrencies, has flipped his stance and is now pitching himself as the champion for the crypto community. He even promised to accept crypto donations for his campaign, making a strong pivot from his previous skepticism.Trump’s Crypto FlipBack when Trump was in office, he wasn’t shy about his disdain for digital currencies, famously tweeting that they were “based on thin air.” But fast forward to now, and he’s selling NFTs and backing crypto like it’s the future. During the event, Trump took the stage, dripping with sweat alongside his supporters, some of whom shelled out $10,000 for Trump Trading Card NFTs just to be there.Amid the Florida heat, Trump spoke for nearly an hour, turning the niche issue of crypto into the night’s main focus. He admitted he’s no crypto guru but claimed he’s good at selling them, deciding that makes him the right guy to push crypto forward.As Trump sees it, despite what critics say, crypto has made it big, and he’s all in. While he chatted about central bank digital currencies and government blockchains, which many crypto fans don’t like, he shrugged it off saying, “I think it all has its place.” His pitch was clear: he may not know everything about crypto, but he supports it and that should count for something.Biden vs. Trump on CryptoThe same day Trump was rallying at Mar-a-Lago, Biden was promising to fight against crypto-friendly changes in SEC rules. Trump didn’t miss a chance to throw jabs at Biden, claiming the President doesn’t even grasp what crypto is. “If you ask Biden, ‘Sir, are you for or against crypto?’ he’ll say, ‘What’s that? Get me off the stage,'” Trump mocked. Then he hit at SEC chairman Gary Gensler, suggesting he’s part of the problem too.But Trump’s event wasn’t just talk. He argued that with 50 million crypto holders in the U.S., his pro-crypto stance could win him a lot of votes. The crowd at Mar-a-Lago, a mix of VIPs and regular attendees who paid hefty sums to hear him, seemed to agree. Trump even brought Ryan Selkis, CEO of the crypto platform Messari, on stage, hinting at big support from the crypto community.The debate over crypto isn’t just a technical one; it’s political. Trump made it a point to declare that Democrats are the enemy of crypto, just hours after some Democrats had shown support for the industry by voting against the SEC rule.Trump positioned himself as crypto’s only hope against a backdrop of hostile policies that, in his view, could drive the industry out of the U.S. “We’ll stop it, because I don’t want that,” he vowed, promising to keep the crypto industry thriving in the states.“We Made NFTs Hot Again” was another key message from the night. Trump boasted about the success of his NFTs, which feature muscular depictions of him in patriotic scenes, claiming they revived the market.Despite pondering whether to launch another NFT series, he questioned if that would dilute the value of the existing collections. The response from the crowd? Mixed, but it showed they were thinking like investors. Trump laughed it off with a joke about economists in the room, keeping the mood light but focused.

VC funding flows back to professor-led crypto ventures | Cryptopolitan

Venture capitalists are throwing money at crypto startups again, especially those run by professors. We’re seeing fresh cash go to companies like Sahara, CheckSig, and NEBRA. Yet, the real stars here are the “professor coins” like EigenLayer and Babylon.EigenLayer, cooked up by Sreeram Kannan of the University of Washington, bagged $100 million from Andreessen Horowitz in February. Babylon, from Stanford’s David Tse, scooped up $18 million last December. Both are diving deep into this new crypto trick called “restaking.”What’s This Restaking Buzz?Restaking lets new crypto projects use established blockchains like Ethereum to get up and running fast. Here’s the deal: normally, blockchains need to build their own security from scratch which is slow and pricey. By restaking, they borrow Ethereum’s security, skipping the grunt work. Babylon does something similar but spices it up by using Bitcoin’s setup, which is a bit more complicated.David and Sreeram aren’t just throwing darts in the dark. These guys have been knee-deep in blockchain research. They’ve been writing papers together since 2015, cranking out ideas that are now at the core of their startups. Their work is pulling a lot of weight in the current crypto scene, especially when it comes to making these new projects fruitful.Controversies and SetbacksBut it’s not all smooth sailing. Emin Gun Sirer, a big brain from Cornell and now CEO at Ava Labs, mentioned that many professor-led projects crash and burn because they focus too much on clever tech without solving real market needs.And speaking of troubles, EigenLayer recently stumbled big time. They had said “no” to launching their own crypto token but flipped a U-turn and announced a massive token release in April. This ruffled a lot of feathers, sparking worries about them possibly gaming the system for their own gain.This move pissed off a bunch of early backers, especially when EigenLayer decided to lock up these tokens, stopping them from being traded right away. They claimed this was to better the project, but not everyone’s buying that.And guess who’s reaping the benefits? Justin Sun, the dude behind Tron. He pocketed over 2 million EIGEN tokens from their first airdrop, making him one of the top holders. This has got everyone’s eyes on EigenLayer, wondering what’s going to happen next.To top it off, Sun had already poured a monster amount of Ethereum into EigenLayer, making his stakes even juicier. With over $469 million worth of Ethereum under his belt, he’s not just a casual player. This kind of big-shot move has people talking and watching EigenLayer’s every step.The whole crypto industry is now watching EigenLayer like hawks, especially with rumors that their total market value could hit a staggering $15 billion. But for now, their new tokens aren’t going anywhere, and that’s got everyone on edge. What’s next for EigenLayer? Only time will tell, but it’s clear they’re not just another drop in the crypto ocean. They’ve got plans and the backing to make some waves.

Wall Street explore industrializing blockchain experiment findings | Cryptopolitan

Wall Street is seriously getting into turning blockchain tests into real money-making products. Big names like JPMorgan and WisdomTree are in on this game, pushing what they’ve learned from Project Guardian.Turning Tests into ProductsStephanie Lok from JPMorgan’s blockchain group Onyx says it’s all about making those pilot programs into something you can actually use. Speaking at TokenizeThis in Miami, she got into how JPMorgan, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, is all over investment fund tokenization. “We want to see how we can take it forward. Investment fund tokenization is where we’re really focusing a lot of our time,” Lok stated. This isn’t just small-time stuff; they’re talking big league plans to bring their blockchain dreams to life.WisdomTree isn’t sitting this out either. Maredith Hannon, their head of business development, talked about how they’re diving into blending investment portfolios with everyday bank accounts. Imagine changing up your investment plans as easily as you check your bank balance. Hannon is hyped about the possibilities, “Think about if you could do 10,001 different variations of different types of allocations, different types of risk profiles.”Not stopping there, WisdomTree is also working on bringing different financial services under one digital roof. This means you could manage your investments and your bank stuff all in one spot, and even better, make it grow faster than your regular bank account. “It’s just enabling those to be on-chain. Deliver that end value of being able to use your money more effectively,” Hannon explained.New Financial HorizonsThe whole thing about Project Guardian is to see if DeFi and tokenizing assets can really mix with big money dealings. This project got started in May 2022 and has big names like JPMorgan, DBS Bank, SBI Digital Asset Holdings, and WisdomTree working together. They’re trying to build something where everyone can play along, whether you’re a big bank or a newbie.Tokenization could mean paying for dinner with shares from your investment fund. Rob Durscki from the Stellar Development Foundation thinks this is where things are headed. He shared this at the same Miami event, “What we’re seeing now with partners like Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and others issuing this new round of assets on-chain is that they want to unlock yield, but they also want to make it almost seamless to use as a payment tool as well.”This idea could shake up how we think about money and investing. You could literally pay for a meal using bits of your investment, and at the same time, that investment keeps growing money. “Nothing prevents us here from splitting the check on the dinner, and I’ll pay with Franklin Templeton funds because I can send you $20 in 3.6 seconds on Stellar. If you forget about that, you’re still getting 5%, 6% a year on that dinner. This is a positive blur between investment and payment because it’s ultimately value, right? And we’re unlocking the movement of value,” Durscki pointed out.And it’s not just about cool new tech. Ripple’s VP of engineering, Bradley Chase, says it’s also about giving businesses what they want. More and more are asking to handle stablecoin payments and keep tokens on-chain to make extra cash. “Those customers now have their own customers that want to pay in stablecoins and they want to hold those stablecoins. So that’s kind of the simplest on and off-ramp gateway for them into the space,” said Chase.So yeah, Wall Street is betting big on blockchain, and from the looks of it, they’re just getting started.

SEC, Ripple case nears conclusion, Grayscale withdraws ETF filing, and more: Hodler’s Digest, May 5-11 - Cointelegraph Magazine


            
Top Stories This Week



​​SEC files final response in Ripple XRP case



The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a remedies brief challenging Ripple’s position over penalties in their ongoing legal battle. The SEC seeks substantial fines against Ripple following Judge Torres’ ruling that XRP isn’t a security in programmatic sales. Ripple contends that any fines shouldn’t exceed $10 million, citing the absence of fraudulent intent. On the other hand, the agency insists Ripple misinterpreted the court’s order and downplayed its liability. Both parties are now awaiting a final ruling. Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty criticized the SEC, arguing that its reputation continues to decline.



Grayscale withdraws its Ether futures ETF application



Grayscale has withdrawn its 19b-4 application for an Ether futures exchange-traded fund just three weeks before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was set to decide on it. On May 7, the cryptocurrency asset manager filed a notice of withdrawal for the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust with the SEC, which was scheduled to make a decision on May 30. Traders rushed to short Ether after the announcement. Analysts believe the futures ETF application was a “trojan horse” to corner the agency into approving its spot Ether ETF proposal. As May 23 approaches, analysts are more skeptical about the SEC’s approval of a spot Ether ETF.



Satoshi-era dormant Bitcoin address wakes up after 10 years



A dormant Bitcoin address containing 687 BTC ($43.9 million), dating back to the era when Satoshi Nakamoto was still active, has woken up after 10 years. On May 6, it transferred its holdings to two different wallets, sparking curiosity among the crypto community. While speculation often links these wallets to Satoshi themself, experts believe they are more likely owned by early miners or buyers. Notably, 1.75 million Bitcoin wallets have remained inactive for over a decade, holding approximately $121 billion worth of BTC at current prices.







FTX proposes ‘billions in compensation,’ but not everyone’s happy



FTX has proposed a new plan to compensate creditors affected by its 2022 collapse, offering to repay all claims plus additional compensation for the time value of their investments. This plan, which needs approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, offers a 118% recovery for claims under $50,000, covering 98% of its creditors. However, the compensation is based on the value of assets at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy in November 2022, not current prices, despite a significant 280% rise in Bitcoin’s price since then. The proposal has upset some investors, who are arguing for reimbursement at current market prices.



Nigerian officials proposed secret crypto settlement, claims Binance CEO



Binance was allegedly pressured by Nigerian officials to enter into a $3-million settlement regarding compliance issues. Reports reveal that a Nigerian official demanded crypto payments to resolve matters related to Binance’s adherence to Nigerian crypto regulations. The exchange is said to have declined the payment demand through its local legal representation and to have continued the settlement negotiations. The relationship between the exchange and local authorities has recently escalated with the detention of Binance executives.

Renowned Economist Reveals "The Date the Bull in Bitcoin Will End" and "The Peak Level BTC Will See" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Famous economist Timothy Peterson made some interesting predictions about the future price of Bitcoin in a recent statement. Known for his illuminating analyzes of cryptocurrency markets, Peterson based his predictions on Bitcoin's historical price behavior.
According to Peterson, Bitcoin price experiences a pullback from the moment it reaches its all-time high, and on average it consistently breaks the all-time high record again after 320 days.


Based on this historical trend, Peterson predicts that the current bull market will end in January 2025.

But Peterson didn't stop there. He also made a bold prediction about Bitcoin's peak value this cycle. “Based on adoption and previous declines, we can predict that the peak value of this cycle will be between $175,000 – $350,000 within the next 9 months,” he said.





But Peterson was careful to qualify his predictions. “That is, if the future is anything like the past,” he added, acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in predicting market trends.
BTC price reached an all-time high in March this year.

Franklin Templeton CEO says all ETFs and mutual funds will be on blockchain

Jenny Johnson, the CEO and President of Franklin Templeton, a financial firm with $1.6 trillion in assets under management, recently reiterated her pro-blockchain stance during an interview with Bloomberg anchor David Westland during the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California. Among the hot topics discussed by the two, Johnson had plenty to say on the subjects of tokenization and generative artificial intelligence. TokenizationWhen asked how Franklin Templeton benefited from tokenizaiton, Johnson was quick to reply. “First of all, I am a huge fan of blockchain and the technology.”She described a situation where the company ran a side-by-side experiment to process account records using both traditional methods and blockchain for a period of six to eight months. As Johnson put it, the results were quite positive. “We were astonished by how much less costly it was to run it on blockchain.”Johnson added:“It’s a very efficient technology, and we think it’s going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities. And, honestly, eventually, I think ETF and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain.”She attributed this prediction to the “huge costs” associated with verifying data between disparate systems — a problem which blockchain was intentionally designed to solve. Johnson further pointed out that once data is reconciled in-house, financial institutions and stakeholders still need to verify data between external parties. “In the case of blockchain,” she stated, “there’s only one source of truth.” The savings, both monetary and temporal, can lead to more diversified investment opportunities, according to Johnson. She cited the use case of pop superstar Rhianna, who released a series of 300 NFTs that afforded their owners a tiny percentage of royalties for one of the artist’s songs via smart contract. This is a reference Johnson has made in the past. As Cointelegraph reported back in October of 2023, the CEO relayed the Rhianna story during an interview with CNBC’s Delivering Alpha wherein she discussed tokenization as “securitization done on steroids.”Source: @FTI_Global on X. Generative AIThe conversation then shifted to generative artificial intelligence. Johnson acknowledge the usefulness of generative AI systems but also warned that it was “kind of like the kid who gets an ‘A’ in English and an ‘F’ in math.”The CEO noted that Franklin Templeton had recently partnered with Microsoft to build an AI-powered sales assistant, later adding that there were investment opportunities in the space. She also lauded the potential for AI-powered translation services to bridge language barriers in finance. Related: Base set for ‘material share’ of SocialFi activity: Franklin Templeton

Coinbase's Interlocutory Appeal Bid Opposed by SEC


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in its opposition to Coinbase’s motion for an interlocutory appeal, criticized Judge Analisa Torres’s decision in its case against Ripple.
In a filing dated May 10, the SEC contended that the court should not entertain Coinbase’s bid to reassess the application of securities law to digital assets.
SEC Says Coinbase Does Not Like Howey Test
Coinbase, in its plea for an Interlocutory review, contends that the SEC’s application of the Howey test to cryptocurrency assets has muddled the definition of securities. The exchange heavily leans on Judge Torres’s ruling in the Ripple case. At the time, the judge deemed the XRP token non-securities and its programmatic sales on exchanges not constituting investment contracts.
However, the SEC rebuffs Coinbase’s motion, stating that no court has followed Judge Torres’s decision. The regulator asserts that Coinbase’s attempt to frame an interlocutory appeal around a “controlling question” is a bid to manipulate the interpretation of the issue.

“Coinbase’s attempts to manipulate the question for an appeal to shoehorn it into a certifiable question under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) are self-defeating. Parties cannot manufacture a certifiable issue by jettisoning and then rescuing the questions at issue in the original order,” SEC wrote.

The SEC further argues that an interlocutory review is not justified merely because Coinbase proposes a new legal standard. Furthermore, the Gary Gensler-led agency posits that Coinbase may simply dislike the longstanding answer the courts provide. According to the regulator, Coinbase might have structured its business in ways that could now pose challenges to complying with established securities regulations.


“Despite the Order’s unassailable conclusions that Coinbase’s proposed reading of Howey has not been adopted by anycourt and, critically, that there is no lack of fair notice as to the framework that applies to its conduct, Coinbase continues to insist, as grounds for interlocutory review, that ‘[t]he digital asset industry labors under an intolerable cloud of uncertainty’ or under a ‘cloud of legal uncertainty,'” the SEC stated.

Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, responded that the SEC’s motion contradicts itself. Grewal shared screenshots showing differing arguments presented by the SEC in a similar appeal against Ripple Labs.

“Let’s at least have an honest conversation. Forget about a split across agencies, circuits and elsewhere. There’s not even a consensus about Howey and digital assets among the district judges in the same courthouse at Foley Square,” he added.

Meanwhile, the ongoing legal dispute between the regulatory agency and the cryptocurrency exchange takes another step forward with this filing. Previously, the agency accused Coinbase of operating as an unregistered exchange and raised concerns about its staking program potentially violating securities laws.

Sam Bankman-Fried Maintains Innocence While Subsisting On Rice And Beans In Prison


								Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the once-revered wunderkind of the cryptocurrency world, has traded his penthouse for a prison dorm. Following his conviction for orchestrating a multi-billion dollar fraud at FTX, Bankman-Fried is facing a harsh reality far removed from his former life of luxury.

SBF Subsists On Rice And Retro Games
A recent interview conducted within the walls of the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) Brooklyn paints a stark picture of SBF’s new normal. Gone are the days of lavish meals and bespoke suits.
Here, he shares a dormitory with 35 fellow inmates, surviving on a diet primarily of rice and beans procured from the prison commissary – a place where bartering skills are just as valuable as cash.
In his first jailhouse interview with Puck News, the 32-year-old fallen crypto king stated that rice “has become one of the currencies of the realm within MDC.”
While the interview depicts the former billionaire attempting to adjust by watching movies and playing video games, the shadows of his past and the uncertainties of his future loom large.


Sam Bankman-Fried Blames Market Forces, Not Fraud
Despite his conviction, Sam Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence. He blames a combination of unfortunate market conditions and “poor legal advice” for the catastrophic collapse of FTX.
In his narrative, the company’s downfall was a tragic consequence of a liquidity crisis, exacerbated by a bank run and the machinations of competitors. He asserts his belief that FTX could have been saved had he remained at the helm.
The interview also reveals a hint of finger-pointing towards Caroline Ellison, his former romantic partner and co-conspirator at Alameda Research. SBF claims he reluctantly placed her in charge due to pressure from lawyers concerned about conflicts of interest. However, he maintains he was unaware of any illegal activity taking place.
Sam Bankman-Fried Appeals Conviction, Vowing To Clear His Name
SBF isn’t going down without a fight. The 25-year prison sentence he received is far from the end of the story. His legal team is currently preparing an appeal, arguing the conviction was based on an incomplete picture and a rushed bankruptcy process.

Bitcoin is now trading at $60.660. Chart: TradingView
They point fingers at Sullivan & Cromwell, FTX’s former legal counsel, alleging undue influence and a role in unfairly targeting Sam Bankman-Fried. Only time will tell if these appeals will succeed, but it’s clear SBF is determined to clear his name.
The Fallout From FTX: A Crypto Winter And Regulatory Chill
The ripple effects of FTX’s collapse continue to reverberate throughout the cryptocurrency industry. The exchange is currently auctioning off assets in a desperate attempt to repay creditors and users who lost millions in the fallout.
FTX’s once-bright future has been overshadowed by accusations of fraud and mismanagement, leaving investors wary and the entire crypto market facing a period of uncertainty.

Furthermore, the FTX debacle has triggered a global wave of regulatory scrutiny. Governments worldwide are scrambling to implement stricter frameworks to prevent similar disasters from happening again.

WIF crypto price prediction: Will the memecoin hit $10 amidst recent dip? - AMBCrypto



A breach above the $3.25 resistance might send WIF to $6.50.
The stablecoin supply showed that market participants had the purchasing power to drive the price higher.

Solana-based memecoin dogwifhat [WIF] has lost 16.36% of its value in the last 30 days.
This performance was in contrast to the price action which saw WIF produce a stunning 1,650% increase on a Year-To-Date (YTD) basis.
Not many cryptocurrencies can boast of this showing this year. But with a solid community, WIF has been able to outperform almost every other popular memecoin this cycle.
As of this writing, WIF’s price was $3.02. But before this recent decrease, the token got close to hitting $5. However, the attempt was rejected at $4.84 which is its all-time high.
Bulls have the upper hand
Despite the fall, many market participants are confident that the token will tap a new high soon. For some, the crypto might reach $10. For others, a 5x increase to $15 remains a plausible price prediction.
If WIF hits $10, then it means the market cap of the project might surpass $10 billion. However, it is important to look at the possibility before concluding.
The first indicator AMBCrypto considered was its Funding Rate. If funding is positive, it means that the perp price of an asset is trading at a premium compared to the index value.
In this case, most bets tilt toward the bullish side. On the other hand, negative funding means that the perp price of a cryptocurrency is at a discount to the spot value.
This also indicates a broader bearish sentiment in the derivatives market.
At press time, WIF’s Funding Rate was 0.008%— lower than it was seven days ago. But one thing we observed was that WIF’s price has been moving higher within the last hour.
Source: Santiment
A suitable inference for this movement is that a chunk of the spot volume were buy orders. As such, the price of WIF could be set to bounce.
WIF needs to break $3.25
Validation of this bullish prediction could send WIF toward $3.65 for a start. In terms of the long-term targets, AMBCrypto analyzed the token from a technical point of view.
On the 4-hour chart, the Supertrend flashed a buy signal (green) at $3. However, there was a sell wall (red) at $3.25. Previously, WIF has attempted to cross this resistance,
However, bears rejected the move, leading the price back to being on the verge of a decline to $2.76. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) showed that WIF might not drop that low.
This was because the MFI reading was close to 60.00, indicating that a good amount of liquidity has flown into WIF’s side of the crypto market.
If this reading continues to increase, the bulls can successfully break through the $3.25 resistance. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was below the midpoint.
But the reading showed signs that it could rise past 50.00, to validate the bullish momentum. Should this be the case, WIF could be a move that sets it toward $6.50.
However, a highly bullish situation could drive the price of WIF to $10 in the long term.
Source: TradingView
For some, this might happen before the end of 2024. However, others believe that the price of the memecoin might not hit double digits this year.
Open Interest drops but it is not the end
Furthermore, WIF’s Open Interest (OI) was $251.38 million at press time. OI increases or decreases based on net positioning. If the indicator increases, it implies an increase in liquidity allocated to contracts.
In this situation, buyers are aggressive. Conversely, sellers are aggressive when the OI decreases. According to data from Santiment, WIF’s OI was almost two times lower than the value in March.
If traders decide to open more positions, WIF’s price might recover. However, it would take a lot of capital to take the token toward its previous high.
But AMBCrypto observed that it might not be difficult to achieve. This was because of the stablecoin supply, held by WIF whales, and valued at over $5 million.
Source: Santiment
As of this writing, this metric had begun to rise, indicating that WIF large investors were armed enough to push the price higher.

Should the stablecoins be deployed toward buying the token, a significant price increase might occur.
However, it might be impossible for WIF to repeat its 883% 90-day increase. Nonetheless, an increase to $10 is a possibility for the token. If (when) it would happen is something that AMBCrypto cannot guarantee.

Shiba Inu Community On High Alert: Scam Warnings Issued Amidst Exciting New Developments



                    

The Shiba Inu community faces an urgent alert as exciting developments in the cryptocurrency landscape unfold. “Shibarmy Scam Alerts,” a handle dedicated to protecting SHIB holders, has issued a critical warning about fraudulent activities aimed at the community. 



Scammers, often impersonating official channels on platforms such as Telegram and X, create fake accounts to disseminate deceptive information, lure users to fraudulent websites, and gather personal details for malicious purposes.




These impersonators have particularly targeted Treat token accounts, posing significant risks to unsuspecting SHIB enthusiasts. 



The alert from “Shibarmy Scam Alerts” emphasizes that no official team member will contact users through private messages, request wallet synchronization, or ask for sensitive personal data.



As anticipation mounts, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is gearing up for major advancements. 




The introduction of the Shiba Eternity play-to-earn version on Shibarium and the upcoming launch of the TREAT token are set to expand the ecosystem’s reach and utility significantly. 



These developments promise to enhance adoption, scalability, and usability, heralding a new era for blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Additionally, the community’s excitement is palpable, with Shiba Inu’s social dominance witnessing a significant surge of 46,339%.



The backdrop is ripe with speculation about potential partnerships that could further augment SHIB’s utility and market position. 



Amidst this growing excitement, Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama tantalized the community with an “Evita” teaser, sparking discussions and anticipation about what lies ahead.



Overall, while the Shiba Inu community is on the brink of potentially transformative advancements, vigilance against scams is paramount to safeguard the interests and security of its members.

Mark Cuban Urges CFTC Regulation of Cryptocurrencies, Suggests Impact on 2024 Election



                    

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban recently voiced strong opinions about the need for clearer regulatory frameworks within the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, urging the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to oversee all crypto-related activities. 



In a post directed to his 8.8 million followers on X on May 10, Cuban emphasized the urgency of legislative action prior to the 2024 presidential election, suggesting that it could influence the re-election of President Joe Biden.




Cuban stated, “You could solve this problem for Biden by passing legislation that defines registration that is specific to the crypto industry just as other industries have registration that is defined for them.” 



His comments reflect a broader concern within the crypto community about the need for tailored regulatory measures that can foster both innovation and consumer protection.



Highlighting the potential political repercussions of regulatory decisions, Cuban pointedly mentioned Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), known for his stringent stance on cryptocurrencies. 




Cuban argued that Gensler’s approach could alienate crypto voters, implying that this could be a decisive factor in the upcoming election. 



“If Joe Biden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank Gary Gensler and the New York SEC,” Cuban said, suggesting that a more crypto-friendly regulatory approach could be more advantageous.



He proposed a more effective alternative, advocating for the CFTC to take charge of all crypto regulations.



This idea aligns with the growing consensus among younger and independent voters who perceive crypto as a significant part of their financial interaction and are critical of the SEC’s handling under Gensler’s leadership.

Cuban harshly criticized Gensler’s record, saying, “Crypto is a mainstay with younger and independent voters. Gensler HAS NOT PROTECTED A SINGLE INVESTOR AGAINST FRAUD.”



Data from litigation consulting firm Cornerstone Research indicates that the SEC undertook 46 enforcement actions against crypto firms in 2023 alone, underscoring the aggressive regulatory landscape. 



Meanwhile, Rostin Behnam, Chair of the CFTC, anticipates another wave of enforcement within the next six to 18 months, hinting at ongoing challenges for the sector.



The discourse around cryptocurrency regulation is poised to be a significant issue in the 2024 U.S. election. 



A recent poll reported by Cointelegraph on May 7, conducted among 1,201 registered voters, found that over two-thirds resonate with the sentiment that “crypto is for people like them, and more equitable than the financial system.”



This unfolding narrative captures the complex interplay between politics, regulatory actions, and the vibrant dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, reflecting a critical juncture in the regulatory oversight of digital assets in the U.S.

Book of Shiba Inu (BOSHIBA) to Surge 9,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Book of Shiba Inu (BOSHIBA) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Book of Shiba Inu (BOSHIBA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 9,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because BOSHIBA has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Book of Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Book of Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Book of Shiba Inu on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Book of Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 24YoPq1drHd7Xs7NbYhU3HvBCMsGZqmSefD7FYeZ6W5D – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BOSHIBA.

US Treasury Accused of Spying on Americans' Bank Transactions in Secret Surveillance Program As Secretary Yellen Confirms 'Communications Took Place' - The Daily Hodl


								US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is responding to accusations that the US government and more than a dozen financial institutions have teamed up to spy on Americans’ private bank transactions.
The House Judiciary Committee recently published a memo accusing the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of urging banks to surveil their customers’ transactions and flag a list of keywords “without legal process” as part of the investigation into January 6th, 2021 riot on Capitol Hill.










Now, in new testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee, Secretary Yellen has answered a direct question on whether FinCEN emailed search term suggestions like “MAGA” and “Trump” to financial institutions.
“I am now aware that there were communications that took place. In some cases, I believe financial institutions suggested to this group search terms they had used that had been helpful in identifying potential perpetrators of January 6th…
It’s a way of trying to narrow the scope of search for individuals who, based on other information available to the financial institutions, may have been guilty of illegal behavior.”
Secretary Yellen says the search – which allegedly scoured through banking customers’ Zelle payments and messages – happened after the riots, but before President Biden was sworn in on January 20th, 2021.
Ohio Republican and Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan tells the Daily Mail that the searches were conducted without any warrants or pending charges against specific individuals.
“Through our work at the Weaponization Committee, we have uncovered that financial institutions are sending Americans’ information directly to the FBI, without a warrant.
The FBI and FinCEN are using banks to engage in fishing expeditions without any link to criminal conduct. This should worry everyone, no matter the party, and Secretary Yellen should disavow this practice.”
According to the Daily Mail, a total of 13 financial institutions assisted the Treasury with the search, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, Citibank, Truist, Charles Schwab, HSBC, MUFG, PayPal, Santander, Standard Chartered and Western Union.

Ethereum Faces Underperformance and Volatility Concerns as Ether Prices Fluctuate, Glassnode Reports



                    

Ethereum’s cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), has experienced weaker performance compared to Bitcoin in the recent market cycle, according to analytics firm Glassnode.



In their May 7 newsletter, “The Week On-Chain,” they discussed the impact of speculators on ETH prices, highlighting the ongoing challenges facing Ethereum following Bitcoin’s block subsidy halving in April.




Post-halving, both Bitcoin and Ether saw a decline in prices.



The fall in BTC/USD was particularly significant, marking one of its largest since the FTX collapse in late 2022. Ethereum exhibited a similar trend but with less severe corrections, suggesting a level of resilience. 



Glassnode noted, “For Ethereum, we can see a similar drawdown structure, with notably shallower corrections since the FTX lows. 




This hits to a degree of resilience during pullbacks, as well as a net reduction in volatility across the digital asset space.”



Despite this resilience, Ethereum’s deepest drawdown this cycle reached -44%, which is over twice as severe as Bitcoin’s -21% dip. 



This underperformance relative to Bitcoin over the last two years is also evident in a weakening ETH/BTC ratio.



Currently, ETH’s price drawdowns are lessening, but this offers little solace to new investors, particularly Ethereum’s short-term holders (STHs)—those who have held their coins for 155 days or less. 




READ MORE: Ether Prices Drop Amid SEC Uncertainty and Technical Corrections, Despite Bullish Patterns



These investors face the possibility of falling into losses, with their aggregate cost basis hovering around $3,000, close to ETH’s current market price.



Glassnode’s analysis of the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which assesses unrealized profit and loss at current prices, indicates potential panic among these new investors if prices fall further. 



They stated, “Ethereum’s STH-MVRV is trading at a very slight premium at the moment, which could suggest that spot prices are very close to the cost basis of recent buyers, who may panic should the market experience downside volatility.”



The broader market is also closely watching regulatory developments in the U.S., particularly the decisions regarding the approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Meanwhile, Ethereum’s long-term holders (LTHs) seem more patient, showing reluctance to sell despite having profitable positions. 



Glassnode elaborates, “If we examine the Spent Volume in Profit for LTHs, we can see that the cohort of BTC holders who have held for between 6 months and 2 years increased their divestment during the ATH rally. 



From this lens, Ethereum’s Long-Term Holders once again appear to still be waiting for better profit-taking opportunities.”

Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC) Will Rally Over 11,000% Ahead of MEXC Exchange Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Donald Bitcoin (DONBTC), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 11,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DONBTC will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Donald Bitcoin.



Currently, Donald Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DONBTC on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 7nErZV74Y8L7zz1thKUczBniWMnLc74gQMdzbWnhr95e – in the receiving field.




DONBTC currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Decentralized Cloud Computing Altcoin Skyrockets in Price After Completion of Successful Mainnet Upgrade - The Daily Hodl


								A decentralized cloud computing altcoin has surged by 44% since it completed a mainnet upgrade on May 2nd.
Akash Network (AKT) is trading at $5.76 at time of writing, up from around $4.00 prior to rolling out its “Mainnet 11” version earlier this month.










The 73rd-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up nearly 35% in the past seven days alone.
Akash Network is a decentralized open-source cloud network that supports decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and organizations, as well as machine learning, blockchains and artificial intelligence (AI).
The project says the new upgrade improved the management and tracking of authorized AKT and simplified the grant process for deployments.
House of Chimera, a blockchain research firm, notes that Akash Network witnessed a surge in ecosystem growth in the first quarter of the year, logging more than $140,000 in revenue in Q1, compared to $100,000 in Q4 of 2023 and less than $20,000 in Q3.
Explains the firm,
“Increasing interest in DePin, coupled with growing developer demand, results in higher usage of AKT.”
Source: House of Chimera/X
DePin stands for decentralized physical infrastructure. DePIN projects involve the use of crypto assets and blockchain technology to incentivize the building of real-world infrastructure.
Despite its recent gains, AKT remains nearly 29% down from its all-time high of $8.07, which it set in April 2021, according to CoinGecko.

Can Ethereum Maintain Momentum? Key Levels To Watch


								Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, has been on a rollercoaster ride lately, dipping below the psychologically important $3,000 threshold only to claw its way back, Ethereum’s price action has been a confusing mix of bullish and bearish signals.

Bullish Whispers: New Investors And Short-Term Spikes
A glimmer of hope emerged for Ethereum bulls with a recent surge in new addresses on the network. According to Glassnode data, the number of new Ethereum addresses has skyrocketed, surpassing 160,000 – a stark contrast to the lows of under 100,000 witnessed in January.
This influx of new users suggests growing interest and potential investment in Ethereum, even amidst its recent struggles.
Source: Glassnode
Furthermore, technical indicators on the 4-hour chart hint at a possible short-term upswing. Analysts at NewsBTC point towards increased volatility, signified by the widening Bollinger Bands, which could pave the way for a temporary price hike. This strategic move by the market might be aimed at luring in buyers before the prevailing downtrend resumes.
Bearish Shadow Looms: Market Sentiment And Technical Trends
However, the jubilation may be short-lived. The overall market sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies remains decidedly negative, a trend persisting since the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event in April failed to deliver a significant market surge, data from Santiment shows, suggesting investor caution despite the brief price recovery.


Adding fuel to the bearish fire, Ethereum’s daily chart continues to paint a hazy picture. Technical analysts point towards sustained breaks in price structure to the downside, indicating a potential continuation of the downtrend. Even the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at a low 40, further reinforcing the bearish sentiment gripping the market.

Ethereum is now trading at $2,904. Chart: TradingView
Chart Patterns And Breakout Potential: A Neutral Take
Amidst the conflicting signals, seasoned trader Peter Brandt offered a more neutral perspective. Analyzing Ethereum’s price chart, which he described as “intriguing,” Brandt identified two potential technical patterns: a flag and a channel.


While a flag typically signifies a continuation of the current trend after a brief pause, a channel allows for price movement within a defined range. The ambiguity surrounding the exact pattern suggests a potential breakout in either direction, leaving Ethereum’s immediate future uncertain.

Ethereum: The Road Ahead
With conflicting technical signals and a market shrouded in negativity, Ethereum’s future trajectory remains shrouded in uncertainty. While short-term price spikes are a possibility, the long-term trend appears to be leaning bearish.
The coming weeks will be crucial for Ethereum, as it navigates these turbulent waters and attempts to chart a clear course in the coming weeks or months.

Bitcoin repeats '2016 history perfectly' amid $350K price prediction - Traders

Bitcoin (BTC) is replicating the same path as it did after the 2016 Bitcoin halving event, with one indicator signaling it may be nearing its local bottom and another indicating it reaching $350,000 during "the peak" of this cycle, according to crypto traders.“Bitcoin has repeated 2016 history perfectly, offering a downside wick below the bottom of its current re-accumulation range within a three-week window after the Halving,” pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital declared in a May 11 post on X.Rekt indicates that the re-accumulation range at this point of the cycle is any price below $61,081— which Bitcoin is currently trading below that at $60,901, according to CoinMarketCap data.Source: Rekt CapitalFurthermore, Rekt highlighted Bitcoin is currently in the "last pre-halving retrace" stage, which, once it passed in 2016, saw a 48% spike just six months later on Dec. 30, to $973.However, the price drawdown from all-time high (ATH) chart — which measures the decline from Bitcoin's peak to its lowest point over a specific time frame — suggests a much more ambitious price, according to founder and investment manager at Cane Island Alternative Advisors Timothy Peterson.Referencing the chart, Peterson estimates that Bitcoin's current price may rise nearly sixfold by the beginning of 2025.“Based on adoption and prior drawdowns, we can guesstimate that the peak value of this cycle would be between $175,000 - $350,000 in the next 9 months,” he explained in a May 11 post on X.“Based on history, we can say that this bull market will end in January 2025,” Peterson added.Source: Timothy PetersonMeanwhile, the daily 100 moving average — a key technical indicator for predicting long-term Bitcoin price trends measured by adding up the past 100 days and dividing the total by 100 — signals that Bitcoin’s price may be “hovering around” its local bottom, according to pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto traders.Related: Bitcoin halving 'danger zone' has 2 days left with BTC price retesting $60KIn a May 11 post, they emphasized the key zone by drawing parallels to a comparable formation seen after the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in January. Just a month later, its price rose by 32% to $51,730 on Feb. 25."Support until it isn't, but bulls need to put in some work," they added.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?

Ethereum's Ether Supply Turns Inflationary for First Time Since Merge Following Dencun Upgrade



                    

Two months after the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade, Ethereum has seen a shift in its Ether supply dynamics, no longer exhibiting deflationary characteristics. 



According to CryptoQuant data, the total supply of Ether grew slightly from 120 million on March 12 to 120.1 million by May 7, marking the first inflationary trend since the Merge transition in September 2022.




The Merge was a significant shift for Ethereum, moving from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus model. 



This change included a mechanism for burning transaction fees, which initially led to a deflationary supply of Ether. 



Since the implementation of the Merge, over 419,713 ETH has been permanently removed from circulation, based on data from ultrasound.money.




The recent Dencun upgrade, however, has reduced the median transaction fees by up to four times, despite maintaining the same level of network activity. 



This reduction in fees has resulted in a decrease in the amount of Ether being burned, contributing to the increase in total supply. 



READ MORE: U.S. Regulators Increase Scrutiny on Crypto Firms Amid Rising Market Manipulation Concerns



As noted in a CryptoQuant report from May 8, “The Dencun upgrade has made ETH inflationary again, potentially killing the narrative of ‘Ultra sound’ money as a structurally lower amount of transaction fees burned on Ethereum have had the corresponding effect of not decreasing the total supply of ETH to keep it deflationary.”




Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, emphasized on May 9 that the loss of deflationary status is not particularly critical for Ethereum’s broader ecosystem. 



He stated in an X post, “Post-Dencun upgrade, ETH lost deflationary status with reduced fees, departing from ‘ultrasound money.’ Ethereum’s strength lies in DApps; it’s wiser not to compare it to Bitcoin’s sound money narrative.”



This development signals a shift in the economic dynamics of Ether but does not undermine the foundational benefits of the Ethereum network, particularly its application in decentralized applications (DApps). 



While the narrative of ‘ultra sound’ money may be diminishing, Ethereum’s core utility and innovation in decentralized solutions continue to hold strong.

Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin to $1M by 2030 - What 'makes the price go up'? - AMBCrypto



Dorsey sees $1M by 2030, but Schiff warns of an upcoming downward pressure.
Market sentiment hints at a short-term rise amidst price uncertainty. 

After the highly anticipated Bitcoin [BTC] halving event, the leading cryptocurrency appears to be on a downward trajectory. 
As of the latest update, BTC was trading at $60,708 after experiencing a significant drop of 4.20% in the past 24 hours.
Execs’ optimistic stance on Bitcoin 
Amidst this declining performance, Jack Dorsey, former CEO of Twitter and a prominent figure in the tech and cryptocurrency worlds, predicted that BTC would reach $1 million by 2030.
In the latest interview with the ‘Pirate Wire’, Dorsey said, 
“The most amazing thing about Bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves — everyone who puts any effort in to make it better — is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up.” 
Dorsey’s remark highlighted how the collaborative and open nature of the Bitcoin community can yield broader benefits when individuals work to improve the network or engage with it positively.
In fact, Dorsey is not the only one to view this period as the perfect buying opportunity, Layah Heilpern, Host of The Layah Heilpern Show added,

ARK 21Shares Update ETH ETF Proposal: No More Staking - DailyCoin


        
The SEC has consistently delayed comments or decisions regarding ETH ETFs.



Ark Invest and 21Shares take a bold gamble by removing staking from their proposal.



With days left until the deadline, 21Shares hopes to prompt a response from the SEC.
Major asset managers in the US are locked in a heated race to launch a spot ETH ETF, but their pursuit faces a major roadblock– an SEC that isn’t a fan of crypto. While the regulator approved the first spot Bitcoin ETF this year, after much delay, it has maintained radio silence on the prospects of an ETH ETF, leaving issuers in the lurch. Faced with mounting pressure, issuers are scrambling to finetune their proposals, hoping the SEC will break its silence and provide some much-needed guidance. With the countdown to the deadline only weeks away, Ark Invest and 21Shares are rolling the dice with a bold move in their amended proposal.21Shares’ Bold GambleCathie Wood’s Ark Invest and 21Shares have cut staking out of its latest spot Ether ETF proposal, hoping to provoke a response from the SEC. 
In an updated filing submitted on Friday, May 10, the clause stating 21Shares’ plans to stake a portion of the fund’s assets through third-party providers was removed. Previously, the filing said, “Sponsor may, from time to time, stake a portion of the Trust’s assets through one or more trusted Staking Providers.”With staking becoming an integral part of the Ethereum network, 21Shares anticipated receiving ETH as a reward for staking. The issuer sought to classify the resulting earnings as income generated by the fund. However, 21Shares has to shelve these plans for now. Still, their proposal addresses potential losses due to slashing penalties, temporary inaccessibility of funds during bonding and unbonding, and potential impacts on the price of Ether.
According to Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas, 21Shares is getting its proposal “in shape” for the SEC’s comments. He adds that the issuer’s move could be a bold gamble or an attempt  “to give the SEC one less thing to use in their rejection.” Still, with the countdown nearing the deadline for a decision on 21Shares’ proposal, hopes of a potential approval appear slim.Will the SEC Come Around to Approve the ETH ETF? Ark Invest and 21Shares threw their hats in the ring for a spot ETH ETF last September. With their deadline looming, the SEC’s deafening silence hints at another potential rejection.The SEC has been continuously stalling on comments or decisions regarding ETH ETFs, recently extending deadlines for proposals from major players like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, BlackRock, and others.Their radio silence could be attributed to the current SEC administration using up the entire 240-day window to provide a final decision, as they did with the Bitcoin ETF. However, for most issuers, that window closes in May.Adding to the uncertainty, the ongoing investigation into the Ethereum Foundation raises concerns. Major figures like MicroStrategy’s founder Michael Saylor speculate that regulators are plotting to classify the post-merge proof-of-stake Ethereum as a security, leading to a blanket rejection of all proposals.However, everything remains speculative until the SEC breaks its silence and offers comments. Market participants will continue to be on edge, and the market will likely move sideways until there’s clarity—whether it’s an approval or a rejection.On the FlipsideWhy This MattersThe SEC’s silence is causing considerable unease among issuers, causing them to scramble for hints or indications from the agency. Until the SEC provides comments, issuers will remain in flux, hastily adjusting their proposals to strike the right balance for potential approval of an ETH ETF.Mark Cuban blasts the SEC for its probe:Mark Cuban Blasts SEC Chair Gensler’s Hostile Crypto ProbeUS lawmakers move to vote for FIT21:FIT21 Clear For Vote?

US Mega Banks JP Morgan And Wells Fargo Unveil Bitcoin Exposure As BTC Drops To $60,000


																JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, two of the largest banks in the United States, have announced their investments into Spot Bitcoin ETFs, unveiling their exposure to BTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. This significant development comes amidst the persistent downturn in the crypto market, resulting in BTC’s price dipping slightly above $60,000. 
US Financial Banks Expose Spot Bitcoin ETF Holdings
American financial services companies, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan, have revealed their exposure to BTC by disclosing their adoption of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in a recent filing. This decision to invest in BTC ETFs marks a notable change from the banks’ previous cautious approach to cryptocurrencies. 

	Related Reading



Wells Fargo revealed in its new filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it currently holds 2,245 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), valued at $121,207, which it has since converted into an ETF. Additionally, the American bank holds 37 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), valued at $1,195. 
On the other hand, JP Morgan, which holds about $2.9 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), has revealed its total Spot BTC ETF holdings in an SEC filing. The bank reported that it had purchased about $760,000 worth of shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). 
Moreover, JP Morgan also owns about 25,021 shares valued at $47,000 in cryptocurrency ATM provider, Bitcoin Depot. The investment company also unveiled its exposure to Spot BTC ETFs just hours after Wells Fargo’s announcement.
Despite the regulatory uncertainty and the market’s continuous volatility, institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly BTC, has been growing rapidly. Bloomberg senior analyst, Eric Balchunas also forecasted that more financial services companies would likely follow JP Morgan and Wells Fargo’s footsteps to unveil holdings in Spot Bitcoin ETFs as market makers or Authorized Participants (APs). 
BTC Price sUFFERS More Declines
Despite the increasing interest from traditional financial institutions seeking exposure to BTC, the price of the cryptocurrency has shown a surprising lack of bullish momentum. Since its halving event on April 20, BTC has been trading sideways, witnessing continuous declines that have pushed its price down to around $57,000 previously. 

The cryptocurrency, which recorded an all-time high above $73,000 in March, has seen a 14.20% drop over the past month. Additionally, Bitcoin gave up a large portion of its gains before the halving and is currently trading at $60,494, according to CoinMarketCap. 
Blockchain analytics platform, Santiment, revealed that the ongoing lack of interest in BTC and the broader market sentiments could be a strong sign that the cryptocurrency is getting close to its bottom.

JPMorgan Chase Warns Bank's Assets May Be Seized in Russia After $1,460,000,000 Write-Off: Report - The Daily Hodl


								JPMorgan Chase is preparing for the prospect that its assets in Russia will officially be seized, according to a new report.
In a new filing, the bank says lawsuits in Russian and US courts may trigger an incoming seizure of the firm’s assets in the country, reports Reuters.










Two weeks ago, a Russian court sided with state-run lender VTB Bank in its push to recover $439.5 million that JPMorgan Chase allegedly froze in New York due to US sanctions.
The court ordered the seizure of JPMorgan’s accounts in Russia as well as all “movable and immovable property.”
Although it has not placed a dollar value on its assets in Russia, JPMorgan says the size of VTB’s claim exceeds the amount of capital that the US bank has in the country.
In April of 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and wave of sanctions from the West, JPMorgan decided to write-off $1.46 billion in assets tied to Russia, along with assets that were “negatively exposed” to inflation.
Per the Associated Press,
“The bank said most of the Russian exposure was in its investment banking division as well as its asset management business…
JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said most of the Russian write downs were ‘name specific’ Russian companies and assets, as well as some Russian-related derivatives.”

Runes Protocol Fees Rapidly Decline After Nearly 1 Month Of Launch - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Bitcoin’s Runes protocol fees hit $135 million in its first week of launch.



Despite the initial hype, activity on the Runes protocol has dwindled since its launch, with May 10 recording particularly low engagement levels.



However, Runes remains a significant player in the blockchain space, with several Rune collections boasting market capitalizations in the hundreds of millions.




Bitcoin’s latest halving event on April 19 coincided with the launch of the Runes protocol, a novel addition to the blockchain landscape.





Runes Protocol Fee Faces Slowdown After Initial Surge



Developed by Casey Rodarmor, also behind the Ordinals protocol, Runes protocol fees quickly made headlines by generating a staggering $135 million within its inaugural week, as per Dune analytics.



Runes stands out for its utilization of Bitcoin’s UTXO model and OP_RETURN opcode, offering a more efficient tokenization solution than the BRC-20 standard. This enables users to mint tokens, predominantly memecoins, atop the Bitcoin network itself.



Despite the initial Runes protocol fee hype, activity on the protocol has seen a noticeable decline since its blockbuster launch. May 10 marked a particularly sluggish day, with minimal new mints and wallet interactions recorded. Only twice in the last twelve days has the protocol generated over $1 million in fees.

Sustained Interest Amidst Declining Activity Signals Future Potential



Nevertheless, Runes remains far from obscure. Various Rune collections boast market capitalizations of hundreds of millions, according to Magic Eden data. This sustained interest indicates potential for growth and development within the protocol.



For Bitcoin miners, the rise in fees is a welcome relief amidst dwindling revenues post-halving. Daily-earnings have plummeted to under $30 million, prompting miners to invest in upgraded technology for improved efficiency and profitability.

Bitcoin Plummets Over $2,000 in an Hour, Triggering $175 Million in Liquidations Amid Market Volatility



                    

On May 10, the Bitcoin market experienced a significant drop, plunging over $2,000 in just an hour amidst a wave of volatility. 



Before this sudden decline, Bitcoin had been relatively stable, with prices hovering around $63,494. However, the cryptocurrency soon fell to an intra-day low of $60,308, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.




This sharp decline resulted in substantial losses for leveraged long traders who had not anticipated the drop. 



Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, commented on the situation, noting that Bitcoin had been showing “low volatility” and choppy price action since February 29.

He regarded the drop as part of a “final accumulation” phase, suggesting that if the support level was not maintained, prices could potentially fall further to between $52,000 and $55,000 as the final stage of correction.



Adding to the insights, Daan Crypto Trades mentioned that the previous day’s flash crash to $60,000 was a quick market movement meant to “punish those longs that aped in above $63K.” 



This sentiment was echoed by the fact that the downturn on May 10 resulted in the liquidation of $127 million in long positions. 



This contributed to a larger total wipeout of $175.17 million in a 24-hour period, as reported by Coinglass.




In just the last hour, $9 million worth of BTC leveraged positions were liquidated, which included $6.36 million from long positions alone. 



This reflects the high stakes and rapid changes in the Bitcoin trading market, underlining the volatility and the dramatic impacts it can have on traders.

Bitcoin ETFs Holding Now Accounts For 4.5% Of The Total Bitcoin Supply - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Bitcoin ETFs holding is close to 950,000, equivalent to 4.5% of total supply, with U.S. spot ETFs acquiring 1,318 Bitcoins this week.



BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust accumulates over 274,000 Bitcoins, attracting investments from major institutions.



Accelerated adoption of Bitcoin ETFs globally, aided by approvals in Hong Kong, reflects increasing institutional interest.




According to data from HODL15Capital, as of May 10, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worldwide collectively held 949,756 Bitcoins.





Bitcoin ETFs Holding Approach 950,000 Globally



The Bitcoin ETFs holding is constituting 4.5% of the total Bitcoin supply. U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs acquired 1,318 Bitcoins throughout the week, with GBTC experiencing outflows.



Glassnode highlighted that Bitcoin reached a pivotal phase three months ahead of Ethereum, with the news surrounding ETFs significantly impacting this acceleration. Recent inflows into leading Bitcoin ETF holdings have spurred a surge.



The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong has further bolstered this momentum, with prominent platforms striving to bolster the adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs.




Rapid Adoption of Bitcoin ETFs Signals Mainstream Acceptance



BlackRock, a global investment management firm, emerged as a major player in the Bitcoin market. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust amassed over 274,000 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $16 billion as of May 2024. The trust’s popularity attracted interest from various organizations, including BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe, which disclosed a $41,684 investment in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF.



JPMorgan Chase, another American banking giant, acknowledged their Bitcoin ETFs holding in several funds, including offerings from Grayscale, ProShares, Bitwise, BlackRock, and Fidelity, amounting to approximately $760,000. Wells Fargo, a major U.S. bank, also divulged Bitcoin ETF holdings in a recent regulatory filing.



The growing adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with significant investments from institutional players, underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class.

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) to Explode 8,000% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gensler Devil (GENDEV), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gensler Devil presents a similar opportunity.



Gensler Devil has a market cap below $14,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Gensler Devil could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Gensler Devil can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gensler Devil on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gensler Devil by entering its contract address – GwoY3GpqrSmws6QW88CyDaJkkTNfrQLGN2zZ1rSbJ6z9 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GENDEV.

Bitcoin Unable to Recover Decisively, Ethereum Consolidates Below $3K (Weekend Watch)


																The cryptocurrency market has calmed down considerably in the past 24 hours, halting the bearish assault and finding some consolidation in the process.
Bitcoin’s price is trading at around $61K on Sunday morning, while Ethereum is now firmly below the pivotal $3K level.
Are the Bitcoin Bulls Regrouping?
As CryptoPotato reported yesterday, Bitcoin’s price experienced a sudden correction, dropping below $61K and losing around 3.5% in a single day.
This seemingly had to do with a statement from a representative of the US Federal Reserve, who said that it may be too early to think about rate cuts.
The market has calmed down since then, and it seems that the worst is behind us.


Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!

The bulls even attempted a recovery, but it was quickly halted at around $61.4K when sellers stepped in and pushed the price to $61K, where it currently trades.
It’s worth noting that despite the recent declines, the Fear and Greed index is still pointing out that the market is in a state of “greed.”
Altcoins Consolidate, Ethereum Below $3K
None of the major altcoins by means of total market capitalization has recovered from the crash the other day, but at least they are consolidating and charting ever so slight gains, as seen in the heatmap below.
Source: Quantify Crypto
Even though the market seems to be completely painted in green, that’s just the 24-hour heatmap. On a seven-day scale, most of the cryptocurrencies are trading in the red.
It’s worth noting that Ethereum is now consolidating below the critical psychological level of $3K, and it’s very interesting to see if the buyers will be able to reclaim it soon.
Meanwhile, today’s best performers are Immutable (IMX) – up 4.7%, and Ribbon Finance (RBN) – up 3.3%.
On the other hand, the cryptocurrencies that performed the worst are Zebec Protocol (ZBC) – down 7.8%, and Kaspa (KAS) – down 4.8%.

Is the altcoin market set for an ‘explosive rally?’ Analysts eye these 3 indicators

The altcoin market is currently at the "disbelief stage," which, if history repeats, could soon move on to an "explosive rally," according to crypto traders closely watching three techindicators for confirmation.“Altcoins market cap is currently at the disbelief stage, historically followed by an explosive rally,” crypto analyst Milkybull crypto told their 66,600 X followers in a May 11 post.The disbelief stage is when investors remain skeptical despite positive market indications, as reflected by a significant drop of 24 index points on the Fear and Greed Index over the past 30 days. The "Greed" score is currently 56.This comes alongside the total altcoin market cap  — which excludes the top 10 cryptocurrencies —  declining 17.55% over the past 30-days to $264.9 billion, as per TradingView data.Although, it is still holding above the $250 billion support level, and is "positioning itself for a future move to the upside," pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital told their 465,300 X followers in a May 12 post.The total altcoin market capitalization is down 17.55% over the past 30-days.

If the total crypto market cap “retests” the EMA20 while also “crossing bullish” on the Stochastic RSI — which measures the relative strength and weakness of the RSI indicator itself — it could lead to “rally time,” pseudonymous crypto trader Titan of Crypto stated in a May 11 post.Related: Altcoins will bottom in early summer before bull run — AnalystThe Bitcoin dominance chart — measuring Bitcoin's market share relative to the overall crypto market — stands as one of the oldest yet most referenced indicators. It can provides traders with the overall investor sentiment and risk appetite in the market.At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s dominance is 54.7%, down 0.56% over the past week.

Willy Woo Predicts $1,000,000 Bitcoin ‘Will Happen Easily,’ Says Multiple Signals Now Flashing Bullish - The Daily Hodl


								Popular on-chain analyst Willy Woo strongly believes that Bitcoin (BTC) will ultimately achieve a seven-figure price tag.
Woo tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that he’s convinced Bitcoin’s value will skyrocket to $1 million in the coming years.










According to the analyst, a $1 million BTC price will have enduring effects that would change the global landscape.
“What a time to be alive. BTC at $1 million will happen easily in the next 10 years. Follow-on impacts will be long-lasting… 
– BTC becomes a reserve currency 
– a purge of central bank corruption 
– wars become expensive 
– younger leadership building for a future they will live in.”

Earlier this month, Woo said that BTC’s fair value will soar to $1 million by 2035 based on increasing global adoption.
But for now, the analyst says on-chain indicators are flashing bullish for BTC. Woo first looks at BTC’s risk signal which compares network flows with price action. The analyst previously noted that it’s bullish for BTC when the risk signal is low.
“Bitcoin risk signal printed a lower high, this is nearly always bullish.”

Looking closer at network flows, Woo says the metric is turning green again for the crypto king.
“Early signs, if I squint *just right*, that flows into the Bitcoin network are picking up again. Probably needs another week to confirm this trend reversal properly.
Lighter blue is the net flows from US Spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds).”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $61,095.

Bitcoin Nears $60,000 Amid Post-Halving Volatility and Market Speculation



                    

Bitcoin‘s price recently approached the $60,000 support level as it faced the post-halving “danger zone,” causing concern among investors. 



On May 10, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView highlighted Bitcoin’s intraday lows reaching $60,190 on Bitstamp. 




The cryptocurrency experienced a sharp decline from around $63,000, sparking varied speculations about the cause of this drop.



Trader Skew, discussing the market dynamics on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out, “Monthly open has been swept again as well monthly buyers taken out. 



“If bulls want higher & want to break this downtrend its here imo,” indicating a critical juncture for Bitcoin bulls around the $60.8K to $61K range, which he identifies as a key area for potential bullish action.




Material Indicators, a trading resource, suggested that large-volume institutional players might be influencing the market, speculating, “that some institutional entity may not want to see Bitcoin breakout over the weekend while the BTC ETF market is closed,” reflecting concerns over market manipulation during off-hours.



An analysis of the order book on Binance showed a new sell block around $62,500, which was predicted to possibly adjust post-weekly close.

Material Indicators further speculated, “I won’t be the least bit surprised if this sell wall moves lower to push price down. 




I also won’t be surprised if we see a roof pull after the W candle closes on Sunday,” suggesting potential strategic moves in the market.



Rekt Capital, a popular trader and analyst, updated his views on Bitcoin’s behavior post-halving. He noted that the typical price drop following a halving event was nearing its end, marking a close to the “danger zone.” 



He recalled his prediction from the end of April about a significant downturn, which materialized as Bitcoin fell to two-month lows at $56,500. 



Reflecting on the market’s response, he concluded, “Bitcoin indeed downside wicked below the Re-Accumulation Range Low just like in 2016. 



Thus price-wise, the Post-Halving ‘Danger Zone’ purple has been satisfied,” yet he also noted, “Time-wise however, the ‘Danger Zone’ officially ends in 2 days.”

Bitcoin and S&P 500: Are Crypto and Stock Markets Still Unrelated?

BTC as source of diversificationCryptocurrencies have historically exhibited low correlations with traditional asset classes, offering a unique source of idiosyncratic risk in portfolios.Bitcoin is known for its extreme volatility, with significant price swings like a roller-coaster ride — plunging over 64% in 2022 and then rallying 160% in 2023. This volatility can be challenging for crypto traders.On the other hand, the S&P 500 offers more stable performance, averaging 9% to 10% annual returns and serving as a benchmark for the U.S. economy. Despite lower returns compared to Bitcoin, the S&P 500's consistency and reliability make it a favored choice for risk-averse investors seeking predictable investment outcomes.Allocations to cryptocurrency can diversify risk and enhance returns in traditional portfolios, according to Glassnode.For example, adding small allocations to the Coinbase Core Index (COINCORE), a market-cap weighted crypto index primarily composed of Bitcoin (70.9%) and Ether (21.9%), to a 60/40 portfolio (60% MSCI ACWI and 40% U.S. Agg) increased both absolute and risk-adjusted returns over a five-year period ending March 31, 2024.Strong Q1 performanceDuring the first quarter of 2024, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, altcoins and stablecoins, rose by 63%, driven by gains in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, alongside increased stablecoin issuance.Source: GlassnodeBitcoin (BTC) had an impressive first quarter in 2024, posting a 69% return and outperforming most traditional asset classes, according to Coinbase and Glassnode joint report.Despite the launch of BTC ETFs, which many thought would lead to a stronger correlation with traditional finance assets, BTC displayed minimal correlation with major asset classes, using data from a recent Glassnode and Coinbase Institutional report. This suggests its potential as a valuable component for diversification within a portfolio.Source: GlassnodeBTC/S&P 500 correlation remains lowBitcoin negatively correlated with the DXY index and gold, while its correlation with the S&P 500 was low at 0.11. This suggests that Bitcoin’s price movements are largely independent of traditional markets.However, at the start of Q2, BTC is down 15% from its highs, coinciding with the DXY index rising above 106, further highlighting the negative correlation between the two.The Q2 report also noted a decrease in Bitcoin’s volatility since January 2020, with peaks becoming less pronounced. Although volatility currently sits just under 60%, the report emphasizes a long-term downward trajectory despite occasional spikes above the trendline, mainly during 2020 and 2021.As Bitcoin continues to mature into a major asset class, its volatility is expected to continue to decline over time.Why stock market mattersWhile historically Bitcoin's correlation with the stock market has been low, recent years have seen a slight increase, with the correlation over the last five years rising to 0.41.According to Tastylive research, generally, there is little correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500, except during significant price movements of Bitcoin (+5% or more to the upside, or less than -5% to the downside).When Bitcoin's price movement exceeds 5%:Average change of the S&P 500: 0.42%.Median change of S&P 500: 0.19%.Standard deviation: 1.53%.When Bitcoin's price movement is below -5%:Average change of the S&P 500: -0.67%.Median change of S&P 500: -0.34%.Standard deviation: 2.31%.On other days:Average change of the S&P 500: 0.09%.Median change of S&P 500: 0.11%.Standard deviation: 1.11%.The increasing correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 can be attributed to factors such as declining inflation and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to pause interest rate hikes.This created a favorable environment for risk-on trading, leading to bull rallies for both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index despite the bearish sentiment following the 2022 correction.Source: CoinMarketCapAs Bitcoin's correlation with traditional equity markets like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq increases while its correlation with gold decreases, it suggests that Bitcoin is behaving more like a risk-on asset rather than a safe haven.When investors are feeling adventurous, they often gravitate toward stocks and digital coins for the potential of higher profits.The increasing involvement of institutional and retail investors in both equity and cryptocurrency markets could lead to simultaneous buy and sell decisions, aligning the price movements of these assets.

Horoscope crypto from May 13th to 19th

New week, new crypto horoscope dedicated to the upcoming week from May 13th to 19th.
This week will be characterized by the transit of Mercury entering Taurus on Wednesday 15/5.
For several months now we have been dedicating space to the crypto horoscope written by Stefania Stimolo, an expert in astrology and blockchain. It is a weekly column with the horoscope of each zodiac sign available every Sunday only on The Cryptonomist. 
In our slogan “We Tell the Future”, we wanted to delve deeper into the topic, jokingly speaking, with this entertainment column. 

The crypto horoscope
We call it crypto horoscope simply because industry terminology is used. 
Words like NFT, metaverse, and Over-The-Counter to describe actions and scenarios, but also trading terminology like bullish, bull run, bear market, or dump to identify the mood of each zodiac sign during the days of the week.
Obviously, the famous to-the-moon cannot be missing to indicate the mood of that sign! 
In general, you could experience a period of “hard-fork”, intended as an “inner split”, or pass your lightning torch to the next zodiac sign, meaning that the Sun is moving into the next sign. 
Or, simply, you need to reflect on some situations that go into “verify“, that is when the planet is in dissonance with the zodiac sign. Moreover, with each new change of guard of the Sun through the constellations of the zodiac, the roadmap of each sign will touch a new step. 
Obviously no investment advice is given, in fact, it is pure entertainment, just like any other horoscope. It must be said that there are many beginners in the sector who have understood the specific crypto terminology also thanks to the horoscope on The Cryptonomist. 
“Don’t Trust, Verify”
Astrology is not an exact science, but it aims to predict the future in its own way. So why not associate the typical phrase of blockchain “Don’t Trust, Verify” here as well. 
And in fact, what the author wants to propose is her interpretation of the planetary transits that occur during the week, describing the reaction of each zodiac sign, following the “logic” of traditional astrology. 
For those who are astrology lovers, they could stay updated just on the transits that are communicated weekly and somehow influence us. A Mercury Retrograde, or the days of the Full Moon. 
Others, on the other hand, could access the dedicated page, which is updated every Sunday, and read the horoscope of their zodiac sign, their rising sign, or why not, even the horoscope of friends and loved ones.

Crypto and blockchain games: what is it and how does Immutable's Web3 infrastructure work?

Immutable is a web3 development platform born in 2018, focused on creating simple and effective solutions to support the growth of the crypto gaming sector.
Composed of two main products, Immutable X and Immutable zkEVM, this infrastructure aims to become the home of blockchain games, offering low fee rates and high transaction throughput to users and an easy design framework to developers.
At the center of this ecosystem orbits the decentralized governance token IMX.
Let’s delve into the project details below.

What is the Web3 Immutable platform and how does it revolutionize the gaming world with crypto?
Immutable is a web3 gaming platform based in Sydney, focused on empowering digital players through the use of blockchain and crypto.
Founded in 2018 thanks to an invention by brothers James and Robbie Ferguson and Alex Connolly, it has quickly established itself as one of the most high-performing infrastructures in the industry, supporting the development of numerous successful projects including Illuvium, Gods Unchained, Metalcore, Shardbound, Wagmi, Kiraverse, Blocklords, PlanetQuest, and many others.
Immutable presents itself to the public as the “home of web3 games“, offering developers and game studios a powerful suite of products capable of solving some of the technical limitations that are slowing down the expansion of blockchain technology and at the same time able to bring digital ownership of games into the crypto world.
The company is funded and supported by important VC funds and cutting-edge investors such as Bitkraft Ventures, King River Capital, AirTree, Temasek, Coinbase, and others. 

From a more technical point of view, Immutable’s web3 platform provides the public with 2 layer-2 scaling solutions that offer decentralization and privacy, and key APIs for operators who want to use internal tools and build their own cryptographic game. 
Furthermore, developers can rely on several practical guides for the development of dapps, live support for their communities, and access to the vast gaming ecosystem of Immutable.
Immutable’s networks are specifically designed for ease of use, allowing developers to launch their games faster without compromising either security or gaming experience. 
By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain Ethereum inheriting security, and at the same time exploiting a simpler architecture, Immutable X and Immutable ZkEVM can be used by paying negligible fees and with very fast execution times.
This solves Ethereum’s main problem, which is being a network that is too heavy and inefficient to host gaming experiences in the crypto world, making it possible to trade NFTs at low cost, high-frequency trading, and in-game transactions.
It is important to remember that Immutable also benefits from the so-called “network effects” of Ethereum, where the most successful decentralized applications live and where there is greater attraction for emerging web3 products.
The company is valued at a whopping 3.5 billion dollars by blockchain gaming pioneer Animoca Brands, making it one of the most valuable private technology companies in Australia at the time.

Immutable X and Immutable zkEVM: the two flagship products of the project
The Immutable web3 platform, as mentioned, uses two different Ethereum layer-2 blockchains to support the development of games in the crypto world, namely Immutable X and Immutable ZkEVM.
The choice to rely on scaling solutions to navigate the world of cryptographic games, rather than opting for a proprietary layer-1, is driven by the desire to offer an unprecedented experience and high standards of security, while aiming for high performance.
The founders of the project, launching Gods Unchained in 2018, were struck by the high gas costs required to mint the NFTs in the collection, and they found a solution to the problem with layer-2.
At the end of 2021, the management of Immutable decided to collaborate with the provider Starkware (the same one responsible for the development of Starknet) to build the Immutable X scaling network.
Subsequently, in March 2023, the development of “zero-knowledge proofs” solutions pushed the group to create the second Immutable ZkEVM network, with the support of partner Polygon which helped make Web3 games faster, easier to develop, and less risky from development to launch.

The difference between the first and the second network is that Immutable zkEVM presents advanced features, such as the presence of dynamic NFTs, in addition to enjoying full compatibility with the EVM world and better interoperability with the rest of the web3 world.
Furthermore, the trend of zkrollup and its expansion thanks to the introduction of giants in the blockchain sector such as zkSync, Base, Blast, and Starknet, can help Immutable attract a new base of crypto users.
Regarding Immutable zkEVM, the project team announced that they have allocated 50 million dollars as an incentive to support the development of the new chain, which currently has a TVL of just 3 million dollars compared to the 38.4 million of Immutable X.
You can participate in the airdrop by downloading an Immutable Passport wallet, bridging assets from the Ethereum mainnet, and performing various operations.

According to Game7 Research, Immutable appears to be the richest L2 ecosystem in terms of games developed within it, ahead of Abitrum and Mantle.

The IMX crypto and its role within the web3 ecosystem
IMX is the governance token of the Immutable ecosystem, and serves as a token that guarantees voting power on proposals for the development of web3 gaming infrastructure.
This is an ERC-20 token, with a total supply of 2 billion units and a market capitalization of 3 billion dollars, making it the 36th currency according to CoinMarketCap’s ranking.
The utility of IMX does not stop only at governance: in fact, the currency is also used for network commission fees and staking.
The “proof of stake” consensus mechanism makes IMX a fundamental resource also to ensure the security and integrity of Immutable’s cryptographic networks.
The main markets where you can trade IMX are Binance, Coinbase, Bybit, Okx, Upbit, Kraken, and Kucoin. Among the DEX we also see the presence of Uniswap.
In the last few months the price action of this token has been very hot: from September 2023 to March 2024 IMX has grown by about 550%, going from 0.5 dollars to 3.5 dollars.
However, since March, bears have stumbled upon this coin, pushing the price up to the current $2.
Currently the crypto is in the middle of a dip, above the 50-period moving average on a weekly time frame, ready to resume its uptrend.

The decline of memecoins: investors prefer other cryptocurrencies

Within the crypto sector, it is clear that memecoins will not completely disappear. However, recently, the trading activity and overall market value of memecoins are decreasing. 
Although some “anomalous” coins have managed to stay afloat, most memecoins are struggling to keep up with the recent market change. 
It seems that investors are shifting their attention, and their money, towards more established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Let’s see all the details below. 

Crypto news: trading activity and the overall value of memecoins are decreasing
As anticipated, recently, cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) have had lower performances compared to the rest of the market. 
Showing a reversal of trend compared to the enthusiasm that had characterized the sector previously. 
According to data from CoinGecko, the overall market capitalization of memecoins has decreased in the last 24 hours, recording a 2.7% decrease and reaching 55.48 billion dollars.
Among the coins that have suffered the biggest losses, Bonk (BONK) has dropped by 6% in the last day. Floki (FLOKI) has lost 3.3%, while Memecoin (MEME) ranked third with a 3% decrease in the same period.
DOGE, the leading meme coin by market capitalization, has seen its price drop by 2.1% in one day, bringing its overall value to 22.74 billion dollars. 
Despite the drop, DOGE continues to represent almost 41% of the overall market of memecoins.
Even its main competitor, SHIB, experienced a decline on May 6, with a loss of 2.4% that reduced its market capitalization to 14.29 billion dollars. This consolidation firmly keeps it as the second most popular memecoin.
Even altcoins are falling: the persistent decline after the memecoin boom
Historically, bullish cryptocurrency markets tend to be driven by a boom in altcoins. 
However, in line with the current correction of memecoin prices, even Total3, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ether, has suffered a setback after the rally that started in October 2023.
Specifically, Total3 has dropped by 15% since the first week of April, reaching 661.41 billion dollars. This decline has led to the formation of a descending parallel channel on the weekly chart.
Operators took profit when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the weekly chart reached an overbought level, exceeding the value of 70, in the midst of the frenzy of memecoins based on Solana.
An RSI above 70 indicates that altcoins were overvalued, leading to a trend reversal or corrective pullback.
Altcoins continue to follow a downward trend, as confirmed by the downward movement of Total3 within this descending parallel channel. 
The RSI has dropped from 89 to 62 in the last seven weeks, suggesting that the market may still be bearish.
If Total3 fails to break through the upper limit of the descending channel at 660 billion dollars, it is possible that altcoins, including major memecoins, will continue to experience further fluctuations in the coming weeks.
Trading volume: 81% decrease since the beginning of March
The weekly trading volume of memecoins has been declining since March. According to Dune data, memecoin transactions on all blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, have dropped by 81%. 
Specifically, going from a peak of 998.55 million dollars in March to 191.88 million dollars in the week ending on May 3rd. This decrease suggests a loss of interest or confidence in the sector by traders.
If we consider the most important memecoins, CoinMarketCap data shows that DOGE’s trading volume has dropped by 50% between March 7 and May 6. 
Similarly, the volumes of SHIB and PEPE have dropped by 88% and 51% respectively in the same period.
Furthermore, the recent change in tone of the US Federal Reserve, with the statement from the Federal Open Market Committee on May 1st reducing the likelihood of interest rate cuts in 2024, has increased risk aversion in the cryptocurrency market. 
This change has had a particular impact on memecoins, which have been among the most profitable assets of 2024.
With the US economy seeming to strengthen, traders are shifting towards safe-haven assets like US Treasuries, preferring them over cryptocurrencies, which do not offer stable returns. 
This change in direction reduces the attractiveness of riskier investments, including memecoins. 
As a result, investors are likely taking profits from memecoins in the first quarter of 2024, reinvesting in other segments of the crypto ecosystem.

                        A victim who fell prey to a sophisticated ‘address poisoning’ attack has successfully recovered almost all of the stolen funds, amounting to a staggering $71 million. The incident involved the victim mistakenly sending wrapped Bitcoin tokens (WBTC) to an attacker who cleverly mimicked their wallet address.However, thanks to the efforts of blockchain cybersecurity firm Match Systems and the exchange Cryptex, the victim’s losses have been largely mitigated.What is Address Poisoning?
Address poisoning, also known as dusting attacks, occurs when an attacker inundates the wallet of a high net worth individual with transactions from a wallet that closely resembles the victim’s address.If the victim carelessly copies and pastes a wallet address from one of these spam transactions, a simple mistake can result in the transfer of millions of dollars into the attacker’s hands.Unfortunately, this is precisely what transpired in this case.Although the recovered funds currently amount to approximately $66.8 million in U.S. dollars, the slight depreciation in value can be attributed to the attacker’s conversion of most of the stolen WBTC tokens into ether following the theft.Match Systems’ CEO, Andrei Kutin, and Cryptex played pivotal roles in facilitating negotiations with the attacker, ultimately leading to the successful recovery of the funds, according to a press release.“At the moment, the victim has no complaints against the attacker,” the press release reads.Blockchain messaging data reveals that the victim initially attempted to contact the attacker, even offering a 10% bounty as an incentive, but received no response.However, just two days ago, the attacker unexpectedly reached out to establish contact with the victim.Detailed information regarding the recovery negotiations and the reasons behind the initial rejection of the bounty remains scarce.While multi-million dollar exploits in the crypto space remain commonplace, there are indications that illicit activities may be on the decline.Security firm CertiK recently reported that April recorded the lowest amount of funds lost to scams since March 2021.It is possible that attackers have become more cautious, especially in light of the conviction of Avraham Eisenberg on fraud charges related to the Mango Markets exploit.Eisenberg returned some of the looted funds but still faced legal consequences.April Records Lowest Crypto Hack Losses
The cryptocurrency industry experienced a major downturn in combined losses from hacks and scams in April.The month saw the lowest combined losses from crypto-related hacks and scams since 2021, with approximately $25.7 million lost to exploits, hacks, and scams.More specifically, only $25.7 million was lost in attacks throughout the month, marking the lowest amount since CertiK began tracking such data in 2021.Flash loan attacks accounted for $129,000 in losses, with the largest incident causing $55,000 in damages.This marked the lowest incidence of flash loan attacks since February 2022, and $4.3 million was lost to exit scams.As reported, the first quarter of this year has seen $336 million lost to Web3 hackers and fraud, with nearly half of the capital stolen in January alone.Nonetheless, the number represents a 23% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2023.It is also worth noting that $73,885,000 has been recovered from stolen Web3 capital in 7 specific situations.

Solana: Why $142 is a crucial support level for SOL's price - AMBCrypto



Solana was down by more than 5% in the last 24 hours alone. 
A few of the metrics and indicators hinted at a trend reversal. 

The market condition pushed most crypto prices down, and Solana [SOL] was not an exception. The price decline caused SOL’s price to dip to a critical level, which can determine the token’s future track. 
Solana approaches support
The last 24 hours witnessed a clear domination of the bears. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL was down by more than 5% over the last day. 
At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $144.80 with a market capitalization of over $64 billion, making it the fifth-largest crypto. The declining price action pushed the token’s Weighted Sentiment down.
 So, bearish sentiment around SOL was dominant in the market. Its Social Volume also declined, indicating a dip in the token’s popularity in the crypto market.
Source: Santiment
AMBCrypto’s analysis of SOL’s chart revealed that SOL was fast approaching a crucial support level of $142. If Solana manages to test that support, ten investors can expect a rebound.
 But a drop under that could be disastrous. 
Source: TradingView
Which way is Solana headed?
To understand what to expect from SOL in the near term, AMBCrypto analyzed Santiment’s data. We found that SOL’s Open Interest dropped along with its price. 
Whenever the metric sinks, it indicates that the chances of the ongoing price trend continuing are low, hinting at a trend reversal. 
Source: Santiment
However, SOL’s Funding Rate was high, which looked pretty concerning for the token’s price action. On top of that, Solana’s Long Short Ratio declined, indicating a bearish advantage in the market. 
If these metrics are to be believed, then SOL’s price might plummet under the $142 support. 
Source: Coinglass
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also remained in bears’ favor as it registered a downtick. Nonetheless, a few of the other indicators provided much-needed relief. 
For example, the MACD displayed a bullish upperhand in the market. On top of that, after a sharp decline, Solana’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick, which indicated a possible price increase. 
Source: TradingView
If SOL manages to test its support near $142, then investors might witness SOL once again approach its resistance near $160.

Realistic or not, here’s SOL’s market cap in BTC’s terms

AMBCrypto had reported earlier that the token had already approached that level twice last week but faced rejections. 
Worst-case scenario: if SOL fails to test the support, then its price could plummet to its next support, near $120-$125, within days.

A glossary of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency terms you need to know

Illustration: Benoit Tessier (Reuters)Tokens, cryptocurrencies, and digital assets are often used interchangeably but are different from each other.Digital asset is a broader term that refers to assets that exist in digital form and can be stored, transferred, and managed electronically. Examples include cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that relies on cryptography to facilitate secure financial transactions. It is decentralized and operates on a distributed ledger technology called a blockchain. Bitcoin is an example of a cryptocurrency.All cryptocurrencies are digital assets, but not all digital assets are cryptocurrencies.The token, on the other hand, is created on top of an existing blockchain network. For example, Shiba Inu, a popular meme-based coin, was created on the Ethereum blockchain network. It doesn’t have its own network.That means one blockchain network can support multiple tokens. Ethereum, for instance, is the foundation for several tokens.

999 BTC Transferred from Huobi to Unknown New Wallet! - Coincu



	

Key Points:




999 BTC worth approximately $60.85 million transferred from Huobi to unknown wallet. 



Transaction raises questions about recipient’s identity and intentions in cryptocurrency community.



Movement underscores continued activity and liquidity in dynamic cryptocurrency market.




999 bitcoins (BTC) valued at approximately $60,853,459 were transferred from the cryptocurrency exchange Huobi to an undisclosed new wallet. 





The transfer, which took place on the Bitcoin network, caught the attention of market observers due to its significant value and the anonymity of the recipient.







The movement of such a large sum of bitcoins from a major exchange like Huobi to an unknown wallet raises questions about the motives behind the transaction. While blockchain transactions are transparent and traceable, the identities of wallet holders remain pseudonymous, making it challenging to ascertain the intentions of the parties involved.



Speculation abounds within the cryptocurrency community regarding the potential reasons behind the transfer. Some analysts suggest that the move could be part of routine exchange operations, such as wallet maintenance or fund management. Others speculate that it may represent a large-scale investment or strategic move by an individual or entity seeking to accumulate or diversify their cryptocurrency holdings.

Huobi’s Transfer of $60.85M Worth of BTC





The anonymity of the recipient wallet adds an element of mystery to the transaction, leaving observers to wonder about the identity and intentions of the party receiving the bitcoins. Without further information, it is difficult to determine whether the transfer signals bullish or bearish sentiment in the market.



Despite the uncertainty surrounding the transaction, the movement of such a significant amount of bitcoins underscores the continued activity and liquidity in the cryptocurrency space. As the cryptocurrency market matures, large transactions like these are becoming increasingly common, reflecting the growing adoption and acceptance of digital assets as a legitimate form of value transfer and investment.



While the specific details and implications of the transfer remain unclear, the event serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the importance of monitoring blockchain transactions for insights into market trends and investor behavior.

Nigeria’s foreign investment at risk due to Binance bribery allegations

SBM Intelligence, an Africa-focused risk consultancy firm, has warned that Binance CEO Richard Teng’s bribery allegations against Nigerian government officials could impede the country’s foreign investment efforts.In its assessment of recent events and their economic implications, which was shared with media publications, SBM Intelligence noted that the circumstances surrounding the detention of Binance officials in Nigeria send a discouraging message to foreign investors, potentially undermining confidence in the country’s investment landscape.On Tuesday, May 7, Cointelegraph reported that Teng alleged that some unknown persons sought a cryptocurrency bribe from its executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, before their detention on Feb. 28, 2024.Despite the Nigerian government’s denial, SBM Intelligence emphasizes the importance of a thorough investigation to uncover the truth and hold any guilty officials accountable. The consulting firm said:“When government officials are perceived as corrupt or willing to engage in unethical behavior, it can deter foreign investment, undermine the rule of law, and hinder efforts to combat poverty and inequality.”Nigeria’s government has strongly opposed cryptocurrency, which contradicts its increasing popularity and acceptance among citizens. This highlights a gap between government views and public opinion.SBM Intelligence suggests that individual citizens are drawn to cryptocurrencies due to the investment and transaction possibilities they offer. However, the government and its agencies negatively view cryptocurrencies because they diminish their control over financial transactions and the economy. Related: Interpol Nigeria boosts cybersecurity with virtual asset trainingThe company pointed out that it has been over two months since the Nigerian government detained two Binance executives, with one managing to escape. SBM Intelligence also noted President Bola Tinubu has traveled to different countries to attract investors. However, it emphasized that detaining foreign business officials could make it challenging for the country to attract investors. SBM added:“No matter the allegations against Binance, it is essential to remember that the story of one foreign business will serve as a cautionary tale to others. If Nigeria is tagged as a country where company officials can be solicited for bribes and then detained indefinitely, convincing investors to invest will become exceedingly challenging.”The consultancy firm further mentioned that the ongoing narrative surrounding the arrest of the Binance executives reflects poorly on the Nigerian government. It highlighted that resolving the issue promptly, fairly and diplomatically would benefit the Tinubu administration.Magazine: What do crypto market makers actually do? Liquidity, or manipulation

How Will Ripple’s Major Developments Impact XRP? Coin Edition


							

JackTheRippler hails 2024 as a game-changing year for the XRP community.
Driven by four major events in the ecosystem, XRP is poised to reach a new all-time high in the year.
Ripple-SEC final judgment, XRP’s bank integration, Ripple IPO, and XRP ETFs can potentially drive XRP to new ATH.




JackTheRippler, a prominent voice in the crypto community, recently hinted at a potential surge in XRP. The analyst hails 2024 as a game-changing year for XRP holders and lists four major events that could drive XRP to new all-time highs.







As of the press time, XRP is set at a price of $0.5077, boasting a market cap of $28,104,614,848 that secures XRP at the 7th position on CoinMarketCap. While XRP has been moving downward over the last month with a significant dip of 17.33%, the recent surge of 0.53%, though marginal, has boosted the community’s optimism.



According to JackTheRippler, a new all-time high for XRP is “just a matter of time.” He posited that Ripple’s native token could see massive surges driven by four key events: final judgment, bank integration, Ripple IPO, and XRP ETFs.









Reportedly, the protracted Ripple-SEC lawsuit is nearing its final judgment. Both SEC and Ripple have filed their briefs, awaiting the final verdict. While the regulators demanded nearly $2 billion in penalty, the crypto platform argued for a maximum of $10 million.



The adoption of XRP by banks has been a topic of discussion over the past few months. Recently, Ripple collaborated with HSBC, one of the largest banks, hinting at a wider adoption of XRP and XRP Ledger (XRPL).



Ripple’s Initial Public Offering (IPO) is a much-awaited event. Though Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse signaled the delay in IPO, JackTheRippler remains optimistic about the imminent launch. In addition, the potential launch of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is also a positive factor that could push XRP into new highs.



Another prominent figure in the XRP community, the pseudonymous KingXRP, has projected price appreciations regarding these key developments. While he has predicted XRP’s hike to $18.57 following the lawsuit settlement, he foresees its surge to $257.21 with more bank integrations.







Meanwhile, KingXRP hinted at XRP’s rise to $3748.34 following Ripple’s IPO.  The most substantial hike projected is 59,873.18, expected after Ripple’s CBDC integration.

Book of Shiba Inu (BOSHIBA) Will Surge 9,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Book of Shiba Inu (BOSHIBA) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Book of Shiba Inu (BOSHIBA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 9,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because BOSHIBA has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Book of Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Book of Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Book of Shiba Inu on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Book of Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 24YoPq1drHd7Xs7NbYhU3HvBCMsGZqmSefD7FYeZ6W5D – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BOSHIBA.

Runes protocol sees significant decline in activity

The Runes protocol’s activity has decreased significantly since its first week of trading. On May 10th specifically, there was a notable decline in activity, with very few new mints and new wallets interacting with the protocol compared to previous periods.According to a Dune analytics dashboard compiled by Runes Is, the protocol’s fee revenue has been declining steadily. Although Runes still earns hundreds of thousands of dollars daily in fees on the Bitcoin blockchain, the total fees have only surpassed $1 million on two occasions in the last twelve days, indicating a significant downward trend.Runes is a new Bitcoin (BTC) token standard that allows users to create fungible tokens on the blockchain. They were created by Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, which enabled Bitcoin nonfungible tokens.The Runes protocol has been operational for three weeks since its debut on April 19, which coincided with the latest Bitcoin halving event. The launch of Runes triggered a frenzy among investors, leading to a surge in transaction fees and a record-breaking windfall for Bitcoin miners, with over $135 million generated in fees during the first week alone.Data from Dune Analytics shows that until April 24, Runes-related transactions made up the majority of the transactions on the Bitcoin network. On April 23, Runes claimed the highest transaction share, 81.3%, pushing the Bitcoin (BTC) transaction share down to 18.15%, with Ordinals and BRC-20 transactions at 0.1% each. Runes transactions dwindled consistently over the next nine days until May 2. From May 3, Runes began to recover. On May 4 and 5, Runes regained its transaction share above 60%.Related: Bitcoin’s Ordinals, Runes key to solving the mining subsidy problem: ViaBTCThe mining community welcomed rising fees as their earnings dropped significantly following the Bitcoin halving. However, In May, total revenue for Bitcoin miners dropped to under $30 million per day.Runes, like Ordinals, unlock new token standards on Bitcoin’s blockchain, offering a more efficient tokenization solution than BRC20. This has led to a surge in memecoin trading on Bitcoin, which recently processed its one billionth transaction.While many platforms face challenges in gaining initial traction, Runes has already achieved significant success, with several Rune collections boasting market capitalizations in the hundreds of millions of dollars, according to data from Magic Eden. Additionally, Casey Rodarmor recently hinted at an innovative audioreactive generative art project during an Ordinals event in Hong Kong, further showcasing the platform’s potential.Magazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto

Runes Protocol’s Network Activity Drops After Early Impact Amid Bitcoin Halving - Coin Edition


							

Runes protocol lost momentum three weeks after launching on the Bitcoin blockchain.
The protocol generated over $135 million in transaction fees in its first week of existence.
Onchain data shows Rune experienced its lowest level of activity on May 10 2024. 




Runes protocol has lost its original momentum three weeks after launching on the Bitcoin blockchain. The novel fungible token standard has dropped in many ways, including network activity, after dominating the cryptocurrency sector shortly after the last Bitcoin halving in April 2024.







Recallably, Bitcoin fees skyrocketed after Runes launched on the flagship crypto’s blockchain. Users attributed the fee hike to the actions of excited investors fighting for block space. Hence, Runes generated over $135 million in transaction fees in its first week.









Meanwhile, the hype surrounding the novel Bitcoin-based protocol has faded since the first week of trading, with all the main growth metrics dropping significantly. Data from Dunes Analytics, a platform that provides onchain data for blockchain protocols, showed Runes protocol experienced its lowest activity level on May 10.



According to information from the Dunes Analytics Dashboard, Runes protocol experienced the fewest number of new mints and interactions between new wallets on May 10. The analytics platform’s data further shows a decrease in fees generated by Runes. It also revealed that the sum of fees generated by Runes has breached $1 million only twice in the past twelve days, even though the protocol still generates hundreds of dollars in daily transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain.



Some analysts consider Runes’ current decline normal, as most platforms struggle with early adoption. However, it is essential to note that the decline does not suggest that Runes may be heading for obscurity. Observedly, several Runes collections have market capitalizations in the hundreds of millions of dollars, according to data from Magic Eden. 



It is essential to note that the decline in network activity after the Bitcoin halving is not peculiar to Runes. Various sectors of the crypto ecosystem have experienced a slowdown, including the ETF markets, which have reportedly experienced a significant drop in inflow.

BNB Chain DEX volume surges - Examining what it means for BNB's price - AMBCrypto



The increase showed that attention was shifting back to the chain.
BNB’s price might fall to $580 despite the rise in TVL.

For the first time since the 2nd of May, BNB Chain’s DEX trading volume climbed higher than $700 million. This was according to Artemis data.
For context, DEX is a short form for Decentralized Exchange. Artemis, on the other hand, is an analytics platform for crypto metrics.
Has a new race begun?
Before now, the DEX volume on the blockchain has been on a downward slope since mid-April. As such, the value has failed to hit or surpass $1 billion since that period.
However, the recent rise implies a growing user activity on BNB Chain. For those unfamiliar, Binance [BNB] is the cryptocurrency used for transactions on the network.
Therefore, a low DEX volume could imply a decrease in transaction activity on the chain.
Source: Artemis
A higher DEX volume suggests an increase in network participation, indicating an increase in the coin’s demand.
BNB’s price was $593.70 at press time, representing a slight 1.23% increase in the last 24 hours.  If the volume on the chain continues to rise, the price action could improve.
But the coin has not experienced significant buying pressure recently. If it does, then a return to $620 might be possible.
In terms of the on-chain volume, AMBCrypto observed that it has been declining since the 10th of May.
BNB’s move may be false
Rising volume and an increasing price indicate that an upswing might continue. However, BNB’s recent price rise, accompanied by the decreasing volume, suggests weakness in the uptrend.
Thus, the BNB might have witnessed a false breakout. If this is the case, a downward move to the $580 support could be next for the cryptocurrency.
Source: Santiment
Another area AMBCrypto analyzed was the Total Value Locked (TVL). TLV is an indicator of the health of a network. With this metric, one can tell if market participants are staking or locking assets on a protocol.
If the TVL increases, it is a sign of perceived trust for a project. In this case, the value of assets locked must have increased in anticipation of better yield.
However, a decreasing TVL suggests that assets are being taken out, and participants do not believe that the protocol involved can produce good rewards.
According to DeFiLlama, Binance Smart Chain’s TVL was $61.2 billion. A thorough look at the protocols under the chain showed notable increases within the past week.
Source: DeFiLlama
Hence, this rise across the board implies that participants are confident in the chain’s health and security. However, the metric remains far below the peak it hit in 2021.

Realistic or not, here’s BNB’s market cap in BTC terms

Should the TVL continue to increase, BNB’s price might also follow, However, the possible prediction of $1,000 might only happen if the metric rises past $10 billion for a start.
If not, that forecast might not come to pass. Still, it is important to remember that other factors might influence the price apart from this.

Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Nearing Historic Lows - What This Means For BTC Price


																The price of Bitcoin has continued to move within a consolidation range since hitting a new all-time high in mid-March. This sluggish price action has been a source of worry to most investors, especially when the premier cryptocurrency recently lost its support at the $60,000 level.
Interestingly, price is not the only Bitcoin metric that has cooled off since the first quarter of the year. Data analytics firm Santiment has revealed that on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network has also slowed down over the past few months.
How Historically Low On-Chain Activity Affects BTC Price
In a new post on the X platform, Santiment revealed that on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network is approaching historic lows. This revelation is based on the noticeable downtrend in various metrics, notably transaction volume, daily active addresses, and whale transaction count.

	Related Reading



According to the blockchain intelligence platform, investors have been transacting less with BTC since the premier cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high price. As a result, Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has dropped to its lowest level since 2019.
Breaking down the metrics, Santiment found that transaction volume on the pioneer blockchain is falling to its lowest in the past decade. The data analytics firm defines transaction volume as a metric that tracks the total amount of coins transacted for a given asset within a timeframe.
What’s more, Santiment mentioned in its report that the number of daily active addresses, which measures the number of distinct addresses that participated in a BTC transaction on any given day, has reached its lowest point since January 2019.

Source: Santiment/X
The blockchain intelligence platform also revealed that whale activity has slowed down on the Bitcoin network. The number of whale transactions (greater than $100,000) has fallen to the lowest point since the end of 2018, according to Santiment’s data.
On the surface, the decline in on-chain activity seems like a worrying trend and a symptom of an unstable market health. Santiment, however, noted that this dip might not necessarily be associated with imminent BTC price dips – as seen in the past weeks.
The analytics company said that the decline in on-chain activity is more indicative of “crowd fear and indecision” amongst traders. Ultimately, this underscores the connection between the on-chain activity and sentiment in the Bitcoin market.
Bitcoin Price At A Glance
According to data from CoinGecko, the price of Bitcoin sits just above $60,770, with a mere 0.2% price dip in the past day.

Bumble Founder Envisions AI-Powered Dating Concierge | Cryptoglobe


                                
In a thought-provoking discussion at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco, Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd shared her vision for the future of dating – one where artificial intelligence (AI) takes center stage. Herd proposed a scenario in which singles could rely on AI-powered dating concierges to interact with potential partners on their behalf, streamlining the process and reducing the need for individuals to engage with hundreds of people.



As NBC News reported, the idea of AI dating assistants has gained traction in recent months, with the emergence of profile enhancers like YourMove.AI and simulated chatbots like Volar. As generative AI continues to advance, the possibilities for its application in the romantic realm have sparked both excitement and concern.



The report went on to say that while some view AI as a potential solution to the growing disillusionment with traditional dating apps, others remain skeptical. The concept of AI-powered dating has drawn comparisons to dystopian scenarios depicted in the Netflix series “Black Mirror,” raising questions about the impact on human connection and the potential for increased isolation and loneliness.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Herd, however, maintains that the goal of incorporating AI into the dating process is to foster healthier and more equitable relationships. She envisions AI dating concierges as a tool to help people navigate their dating concerns and provide guidance on effective communication with new matches.



Bumble has already begun integrating AI-powered features into its app, such as the “For You” match recommendation page, spam profile detector, and lewd image blocker. A spokesperson for the company reiterated Bumble’s commitment to creating safe, kind, and authentic connections, emphasizing that AI can play a role in achieving this goal.



Looking to the future, Herd shared that Bumble aims to evolve beyond its current status as a dating app. The company’s vision is to become a comprehensive human connection platform, facilitating connections for various purposes, from finding a hiking buddy to a mahjong partner.

Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Warns Excessive US Spending Could Crowd Out Blockchain and AI Innovations - The Daily Hodl


								Billionaire hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller is warning that excessive government spending will stifle key technological innovations that could supercharge productivity in the US.
In a new CNBC interview, Druckenmiller says that the government is spending money like we’re back in the Great Depression.










According to the billionaire, the government’s demand for more debt to fund its undue spending will eventually lead to higher interest rates, making it more expensive for private firms innovating in tech fields such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to access fresh capital.
“I’ve studied the Great Depression, and you had a private sector crippled with debt with basically no new ideas, so interventionist policies were called for and were effective.
The private sector could not be more different today than it was in the Great Depression. Their balance sheets are fine. They’re healthy. And have you ever seen more innovative ideas that the private sector could take advantage of now? You’ve got blockchain, you got AI, you got the whole thing.
All the government needed to do was get out of their way and let them innovate. Instead, they’ve spent, spent and spent. My new fear now is that spending and the resulting interest rates on the debt that’s been created are going to crowd out some of the innovation that would have taken place. 
We have a 7% budget deficit at full employment. It’s unheard of.”
Druckenmiller says that blockchain, AI and other technological advancements could ignite a productivity boom in the country but laments that government spending is getting in the way of progress.
“I think we’re looking at one of the most exciting periods in terms of potential productivity-enhancing investments ever, and why we’re spending like we’re still in the Great Depression is beyond me.”

This past week, dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) witnessed a staggering 338% increase in burn rate, a strategic move that incinerated millions of SHIB tokens.According to Shibburn's recent hourly update, the burn rate of SHIB tokens has surged by an astonishing 338.77% in the last seven days with 200,591,910 SHIB incinerated. This uptick in token-burning activity underscores Shiba Inu's commitment to reducing its token supply and enhancing its long-term value proposition. Token burning, a common practice in the cryptocurrency space, involves permanently removing a certain number of tokens from circulation, thereby reducing the total supply.Shiba Inu has taken this strategy to heart with the community's dedicated efforts resulting in the obliteration of millions of SHIB, marking a 338% jump in the weekly burn rate. However, the daily burn rate was down 27.27%, with just 30,384,330 SHIB burned in the last 24 hours.SHIB large holders inflow jumps 225%On a seven-day basis, Shiba Inu has also experienced a remarkable 225% spike in a key metric that tracks the inflow of funds into whale addresses known as large holder inflows.As Shiba Inu remains focused on sustaining momentum and driving growth initiatives, from expanding utility through partnerships and integrations to fostering community engagement and innovation, Shiba Inu whales seem to have been taking note.At the time of writing, SHIB was down 0.14% in the last 24 hours to $0.00002256 as the crypto market persisted in lackluster trading.At the heart of the Shiba Inu price action is a key range where a substantial number of Shiba Inu addresses are holding 45 trillion SHIB.Around where Shiba Inu trades according to IntoTheBlock data, 45.37 trillion SHIB were bought by 54,410 addresses in the range of $0.000021 and $0.000023 at an average price of $0.000022.Maintaining the 45 trillion SHIB range remains key for the SHIB price as a loss of this key level might trigger a decline to the next support range of $0.000019 to $0.000021, while the next resistance range lies at $0.000023 to $0.000025 where 33,360 addresses are holding 13.09 trillion SHIB.

Why Best-selling Author Yuval Noah Harari Dislikes Bitcoin?


Yuval Noah Harari, a distinguished historian and best-selling author, recently voiced his concerns about Bitcoin at the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Innovative Summit 2024. 
Consequently, Harari’s opinions received widespread criticism from the crypto community.
What Did Harari Say About Bitcoin?
Harari noted that while the future might lean towards electronic money, historical trust in banks and governments to manage monetary flow has fostered societal trust. He believes it is a good idea to give central banks and the government the authority to create money.

“When I look at Bitcoin, as a historian, I don’t like it because this is a money built on distrust. We don’t trust the banks, the governments, so we don’t want to give them the ability to create as much money as they like, so we create this Bitcoin,” Harari said.

This perspective directly opposes the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. They operate without central authority oversight.

The historian’s critique did not go unchallenged. Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano, criticized Harari’s analysis on social media, describing it as “Dunning-Kruger on steroids.” This term refers to the poor judgment often shown by individuals who overestimate their competence.
Additionally, Bitcoin enthusiast Walker highlighted the controversial history of the BIS during World War II, suggesting a hypocrisy in trusting traditional financial institutions. 

“The BIS had directors from 1933 to 1945 who were convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity. But sure, trust the bankers,” Walker stated.

Furthermore, the discussion around Bitcoin and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) continues to intensify. In fact. approximately 90% of central banks are exploring or implementing CBDC pilot projects.

According to Walker, the BIS advocates for adopting CBDCs, which could lead to unprecedented surveillance and control over individual financial transactions. Hence, proponents of Bitcoin argue that it offers a decentralized alternative that could prevent such potential overreach.

8 Whales Simultaneously Take Massive Profits of This Altcoin After Incredible Surge - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to information provided by the cryptocurrency data platform Spot On Chain, 8 different whales made profit sales following the extraordinary rise of an altcoin.
According to the data, 8 whales made a profit sale of $ 3.56 million after the Tellor (TRB) altcoin increased by almost 100% in the last week.


Analysts added that these whales purchased the TRB tokens in question via Coinbase at $80.2 in early March. Whales sold the 82,849 TRB assets in question for an average of approximately 123 dollars and made a 53.6% profit after a period of 2 months.

At the time of writing this article, TRB price is trading at $133.





TRB is actually an altcoin that frequently comes to the fore with its speculative price decreases and increases. Andrei Grachev, founder of market maker company DWF Labs, which was recently accused of market manipulation by Binance, also frequently made posts implying the TRB price.

Bitcoin meltdown imminent? Expert warns start of BTC crash next week


A cryptocurrency trading expert has issued a cautionary warning to Bitcoin (BTC) investors, suggesting that a price crash might be imminent as the maiden digital asset struggles to break through the $65,000 resistance level.
In a May 12 TradingView post, analyst Alan Santana highlighted signs indicating a possible downturn in Bitcoin’s price. Santana pointed to Bitcoin’s technical indicators and recent price movements as evidence supporting the likelihood of a forthcoming crash.
The expert identified a troubling pattern reminiscent of a cap formation, suggesting a looming trend reversal. Compounding this observation, the all-time high and subsequent lower high sessions concluded with red candle closures below the critical Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 10, signaling a bearish trajectory for Bitcoin.


Furthermore, the expert noted that Bitcoin has sustained two consecutive weeks of trading below EMA10, further solidifying the prevailing bearish sentiment in the market.

How low will Bitcoin drop? 
Given these concerning indicators, Santana painted a grim outlook for Bitcoin in the upcoming week. He envisioned an initial downward plunge towards the EMA50, projected to be around $46,000, as the cryptocurrency faces increasing pressure from sellers.
The anticipated decline is poised to initiate a brief rebound, followed by a temporary lower high, as noted by the analyst. Subsequently, the analyst predicts that Bitcoin may further drop below $40,000.

“Expect something like this: First a drop toward EMA50 (~46,000) that will surely produce a bounce and short-term lower high, followed by a test of MA200 around $34,000. This is based on the weekly timeframe,” the expert noted

This projected scenario could significantly blow Bitcoin investors’ hopes that the leading cryptocurrency will maintain support above the $60,000 threshold. It’s worth noting that since its descent from the all-time high of $73,000 recorded in March, the market has been eyeing a potential price bottom before resuming its upward trajectory, with $100,000 remaining the next consensus target.
In the short term, a Finbold report indicated that Bitcoin technical indicators suggest that the crypto will likely revisit the $72,000 mark. 
Notably, Bitcoin’s current troubles come even as the asset records heightened institutional interest, as evidenced by major United States banking giants. For example, Wells Fargo disclosed its current ownership of 2,245 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), valued at $121,207.
Similarly, JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) disclosed its total holdings in Spot BTC ETFs through an SEC filing. The bank reported purchasing approximately $760,000 in shares in various Bitcoin trusts.
Bitcoin price analysis
By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $61,040 with daily losses of almost 0.3%. On the weekly chart, BTC is down 4%.

As things stand, Bitcoin can potentially realize Santana’s projection if it fails to hold the current $60,000 support.  Therefore, the level remains a crucial spot to watch.

Binance 3-Year Monitorship To Be Handled By FRA - Details | Bitcoinist.com


								According to the latest report, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has granted the three-year monitorship of Binance to consulting firm Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA). This appointment is part of the exchange’s plea deal with the Justice Department last year.
In November 2023, Binance entered into a plea deal with the DOJ related to money laundering violations, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in fines and appoint an independent compliance monitor. The company’s co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao also agreed to step down as CEO as part of the deal and was recently sentenced to four months in jail.
Here’s Why DOJ Chose FRA Over Sullivan & Cromwell
Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg recently reported that Forensic Risk Alliance was given the nod ahead of Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell to act as an independent monitor for Binance Holdings Ltd. A monitor is tasked with evaluating a company’s practices to eliminate misconduct and establish an effective ethics and compliance program.

Hence, if there is any truth in the latest revelations, London-based FRA will likely be able to access Binance’s internal records and documents, while ensuring that the exchange complies with the plea agreement over three years.
According to the report, New York-based Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C) was one of the front-runners for the monitor role. However, it appears that the controversy swirling around the law firm over its work for the now-defunct FTX exchange might have influenced the DOJ’s decision to go for FRA instead.
As Bitcoinist reported in February, FTX creditors launched a class action lawsuit against Sullivan & Cromwell, accusing the law firm of being complicit in the exchange’s collapse. FTX’s new management has always defended S&C while touting its recovery efforts for the company.
On Wednesday, May 8, FTX announced that its customers would be fully reimbursed for their losses due to the collapse. 
Binance To Pay $4 Million In Canada Due To Compliance Issues
Besides the United States, Binance has been facing significant pressure from regulatory bodies in other countries. Most recently, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange was fined $4.4 million (C$6 million) by Canada’s financial regulator, FINTRAC.

FINTRAC charged Binance for failure to comply with money-laundering protections. As reported by Bitcoinist, the company failed to register with the Canadian financial regulator and report large virtual currency transactions.
While Binance’s regulatory woes continue to mount, the exchange has maintained that it is committed to increasing compliance. The recent establishment of the company’s first-ever board of directors appears like a move in this direction.

"Professor Coins" Attract Fresh Funding: Bloomberg | Cryptoglobe


                                
According to Bloomberg, as digital asset funding gains momentum once more, venture capitalists are casting their gaze toward companies founded by professors, affectionately dubbed “professor coins” within the industry.



Among the recent success stories are Sahara, CheckSig, and NEBRA, all of which have secured fresh capital in the past two months. However, two startups have particularly captured the spotlight: EigenLayer and Babylon. Founded by former University of Washington associate professor Sreeram Kannan and Stanford University Professor David Tse, respectively, these projects have garnered significant attention and investment.



EigenLayer, which raised an impressive $100 million from Andreessen Horowitz in February, and Babylon, which secured $18 million in December, are both focused on the burgeoning field of “restaking.” This innovative concept allows new projects and blockchains to leverage the security infrastructure and resources of established networks like Ethereum or Bitcoin, providing them with a jumpstart in the competitive crypto landscape.



As Hannah Miller and Muyao Shen reported for Bloomberg News, the expertise of Kannan and Tse in restaking technologies has not gone unnoticed. Riad Wahby, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University and CEO of crypto startup Cubist, emphasized the significance of their research, stating, “They’ve thought about a lot of these kinds of restaking technologies. I mean, that’s sort of their baby, so it kind of makes sense. And I think more and more of this technology is going to come from research.”



However, the path to success for professor-led crypto projects is not without its challenges. Kate Laurence, CEO of Accelerate VC, noted that an academic background could sometimes be perceived as a detractor when it comes to entrepreneurship. “Professors tend to be focused on academics and the theory, not as much on the practice and business application,” she explained.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Despite these potential hurdles, the collaboration between Kannan and Tse, as evidenced by their extensive joint research and publications, has instilled confidence in investors like Bloccelerate VC. The firm invested in both EigenLayer and Babylon, recognizing the unique value proposition each project brings to the table.



Babylon’s focus on bringing restaking to the Bitcoin ecosystem presents an even more complex challenge, as Bitcoin utilizes a different validation mechanism than Ethereum. If successful, Babylon’s platform could address the long-standing issue of yield generation for Bitcoin holders, unlocking new opportunities for investors.



EigenLayer, despite attracting more than $15 billion in crypto assets to its platform, faced its own setbacks with the launch of its Eigen token. Critics argued that the startup misunderstood the broader digital asset market, raising concerns about potential self-enrichment and sell-off pressure.



The Bloomberg report goes on to add that supporters like Ayesha Kiani, chief operating officer of crypto hedge fund MNNC Group and an adjunct professor at New York University, believe that projects like EigenLayer and Babylon are more than just get-rich-quick schemes. She asserted that Kannan and Tse are at the forefront of efforts to improve the industry as a whole.

Altseason incoming? Three key indicators to watch for a potential surge


Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent surge to a record high of $73,750, followed by a pullback to $61,000, has sparked discussions among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and experts about the potential onset of an ‘Altseason.’
Traditionally, Bitcoin ignites market cycles with robust surges, but the real action often unfolds during its consolidation phases, when other cryptocurrencies typically take the lead. This pattern is expected to be more pronounced due to several factors that are driving broader adoption and enhancing the valuation of altcoins.
The integration of decentralized finance (DeFi), advancements in blockchain scalability, and the expanding use of smart contracts are key factors contributing to a potential altcoin rally, which could significantly alter the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.


Key market indicators to watch
Market analysts are closely monitoring a set of key indicators that could signal the start of an altcoin rally. 
The first of these is the exponential moving average (EMA) over 20 days which emphasizes recent price changes and is crucial for timing potential rallies. A bullish crossover in the total crypto market cap’s EMA20 suggests that a rally might be imminent.
Another critical indicator is the Stochastic RSI, which assesses the strength and weakness of the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) over a set period. A bullish crossing in this metric suggests that altcoins might be gearing up for significant price movements.
If the total crypto market cap “retests” the EMA20 while also “crossing bullish” on the Stochastic RSI, it could lead to a ‘rally time’ according to the pseudonymous crypto trader Titan of Crypto.

Furthermore, Bitcoin’s market share, measured by Bitcoin dominance, provides insights into overall investor sentiment and risk appetite. 
Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance stands at 52.92%. A decline in this figure could signal a shift in investor interest towards altcoins, potentially marking the start of an altseason. 
This comes alongside the total altcoin market cap — which excludes the top 10 cryptocurrencies — declining 17.55% over the past 30 days to $266.47 billion, as per the data from TradingView
Despite the decline, the market is still holding above the $250 billion support level, suggesting it is positioning itself for a future upward movement, highlighted trader Rekt Capital.
Expert predictions and market sentiments
Expert opinions on the potential for an altseason are mixed, with some analysts predicting the onset of the biggest altseason possibly reaching a $4 trillion market cap.
However, other analysts, such as Benjamin Cowen, have noted that the current market conditions are not strongly indicative of an imminent altseason, suggesting that Bitcoin may continue to dominate the markets for a longer period. 

This sentiment is echoed by the Altcoin Season Index by Blockchain Center, which declares an altseason if 75% of the top 50 coins outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days.

The index shows that only 41% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. As the index is below 75, it suggests that it is not yet officially altcoin season, providing a more cautious perspective amid the enthusiastic forecast.
While there are promising signs of an upcoming altseason, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently unpredictable. 
Investors should remain vigilant, staying informed about market trends and changes. It is crucial to thoroughly investigate and analyze altcoin projects when building investment positions to maximize potential gains while effectively managing risks.

Dan Morehead’s Hedge Fund Pantera Capital Says Largest Investment Can ‘Bring Crypto to the World’ - The Daily Hodl


								Hedge fund Pantera Capital says one project, which is the firm’s “largest investment ever,” has an opportunity to bring crypto to the masses.
In a new post, Pantera CEO Dan Morehead says that Toncoin (TON), the layer-1 blockchain network originally designed by the messaging platform Telegram, has a major advantage over other projects in building a large community.










“99.999% of blockchain projects are a tech idea trying to create a community – from nothing. According to CoinMarketCap, there are more than 23,000 cryptocurrencies. That’s a hard road for most. 
Telegram is a community integrating blockchain technology. That’s just got to be easier.”
According to Statista, Telegram has over 900 million monthly active users.
Given that Telegram has a built-in crypto wallet, the hedge fund argues it has an advantage in onboarding its large, already-existing user base into the digital asset ecosystem without the complexities of traditional self-custody wallets that include the use of seed phrases.
Based in Dubai, Pantera also says that Telegram is largely free from the regulatory hurdles that digital asset projects face in less crypto-friendly jurisdictions like the US.
“What about the other top messengers? Telegram is the only major platform that is free of regulatory hurdles to incorporate web3 for an open blockchain network. While [Facebook] Messenger attempted to incorporate crypto payments with Libra, they ultimately faced regulatory hurdles from the US that led to a complete shutdown. 
WeChat has attempted to integrate CBDC payments of digital yuan, but the system is limited in scope and builders don’t have the ability to create permissionless applications.
We believe Telegram is well positioned to bring crypto to the world because of its shared web3 ethos and large distribution.”
At time of writing, TON is trading at $6.94.

Ancient Bitcoin Whales Suddenly Awake After 10.7 Years With 49,274.2% Profit


Calm Sunday morning was disrupted, when two dormant Bitcoin (BTC) wallets, untouched for over a decade, have sprung to life, shaking the cryptocurrency market with their monumental activity.According to Lookonchain's latest findings, these wallets, inactive for precisely 10.7 years, have swiftly transferred their entire holdings of 1,000 BTC, currently valued at a staggering $60.9 million, within a mere 20-minute window.The wallets in question, identified as "16vRqA" and "1DUJuH," received their initial deposits of 500 BTC each back in September 2013, when Bitcoin was valued at a modest $124 per coin.Fast forward to today, and these addresses have witnessed an extraordinary surge in value, boasting an astronomical profit margin of 49,274.2%. In monetary terms, this translates to a jaw-dropping $60.8 million windfall, equating to an astonishing $5.7 million in profit accrued annually over the past 11 years.
 The sudden reactivation of these dormant BTC whales has sparked intense speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Many analysts posit that such a move could signify a pivotal shift in market sentiment.Bearish?Interestingly, despite the significant profit margins, the owners of these wallets have chosen not to cash out through exchanges but rather opted to transfer their assets to undisclosed wallets, adding a layer of mystery to their motives.Historically, the emergence of long-dormant Bitcoin holders has often been interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting a potential sell-off to lock in profits. However, the unique circumstances surrounding these ancient wallets leave the market eagerly anticipating their next move.

3 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading this week


Optimism is rising on the cryptocurrency horizon, fueled by a mixture of technical indicators, adoption news, and regulatory developments. Yet, three cryptocurrencies will experience inflationary events, and speculators should avoid trading them next week during likely sell-offs.
A massive token unlock event—worth over $1.4 billion — is incoming this week, far larger than the usual seven-day cliff unlocks. Finbold gathered data from TokenUnlocksApp on May 12 to provide proper risk management insights to cryptocurrency traders navigating the market.

Conversely, bullish divergences have surged in different indicators for most cryptocurrencies, creating good opportunities for savvy investors. Thus, focusing on tokens going through significant emissions exposes traders to colossal opportunity costs, requiring thoughtful analysis and planning.


Aevo’s (AEVO) $1 billion token unlock
First, Aevo (AEVO) will shockingly unlock 827.6 million tokens on May 15, worth $1.02 billion. This is one of the largest unlocks reported by the platform. Moreover, it represents nearly 8 times the token’s circulating supply of 110 million AEVO.
As a result, the project will suffer 752.4% inflation in a single hit. This could drastically impact Aevo’s price in the week of the unlock, making this a cryptocurrency to avoid trading in May.
The DAO treasury will receive $414 million in tokens. Next, the team will receive 215.04 million AEVO, worth $264.5 million, and initial private sale investors will receive $212.75 million to sell.

Avoid trading Aptos (APT) and Arbitrum (ARB)
The two other cryptocurrencies to avoid trading next week due to relevant token unlocks are Aptos (APT) and Arbitrum (ARB). Each project will release nearly $100 million worth of tokens, which is also a relevant amount from an economic perspective.
In particular, Aptos will unlock 11.31 million APT today (May 12), worth $94.55 million and representing 2.6% of its market cap. Receiving entities are the Foundation, community, core contributors, and investors.
Aptos (APT) token unlock. Source: TokenUnlocksApp
In closing, Arbitrum will inflate its supply by 3.5% on May 16, unlocking $92.44 million worth of tokens. The team, “future team,” and advisors will receive 56.13 million ARB, valued at $56 million, while investors will receive 36.51 million ARB, valued at $36.44 million.

However, despite significant supply inflation, these tokens could still display positive price performance in the next few days. The cryptocurrency market is unpredictable, and everything can happen, even in unfavorable economic conditions.
Therefore, the decision to avoid trading these cryptocurrencies this week assumes a solid risk management strategy, but nothing is guaranteed.

BTC, ETH Price Analysis: Indicators Point to Suprising Movement - Coin Edition


							

BTC and ETH lost a considerable part of their values in the last seven days.
Bitcoin’s price might increase to $65,521 where the 1.618 golden ratio was situated.
Declining CMF suggests another ETH decrease before a bounce off the lows.




Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices have failed to put up a good show in recent times. At press time, BTC changed hands at $60,967, ETH, on the other hand, lost its grip on $3,000 while trading at $2,914, according to CoinMarketCap.



With mid-month closing in, traders are concerned that the price would end May with a postive return or otherwise. Coin Edition looks at the possibility and price targets of BTC and ETH.









BTC Price Analysis



According to the BTC/USD 4-hour chart, a bounce could be in place for the coin soon. This was shown by the Fibonacci indicator.



On the chart, the 0.236 Fib level was at $60,935, indicating that Bitcoin might reached its lowest pullback point. On the upside, the 1.618 golden ratio was at $65,521, meaning that the short-term target of the coin could be around this region.



However, a highly bullish scenario could send BTC to $74,213 as indicated by the 4.236 Fib level. But this might not happen before the end of May considering that bears were not completely out of the market.



Coin Edition was able to deduce this after looking at the Elder Force Index (EFI). At the time of writing, the EFI reading was negative, suggesting a dearth of buying pressure. If this indicator falls, then BTC’s bullish outlook would be invalidated. 





This could take the coin price to $58,000. On the other hand, an increase in accumulation might help Bitcoin begin its journey back above $65,000.



ETH Price Analysis



For ETH, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed that the altcoin was previously oversold. However, the RSI reading has begun to increase again, indicating that bulls might be working on dictating the momentum.









Invalidation of this might occur if selling pressure returns again, and the price of ETH might fall to $2,860. This potential decline was also supported by the Chakin Money Flow (CMF) which was in the red zone.





But on the brighter side, the price of ETH could jump if bulls continue to drive the mometum higher. Should this be the case, ETH might change hands at $3,278 within a short period.

Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Awaken After 10.7 Years, Transferring $60.9M in 20 Minutes! - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Two dormant Bitcoin wallets, inactive for nearly 10.7 years, suddenly transfer 1,000 BTC ($60.9M) in 20 minutes. 



Wallets “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH” received 500 BTC each in September 2013 when Bitcoin was $124. 



Speculation abounds as cryptocurrency community puzzles over motives behind unexpected transactions.




Two long-dormant Bitcoin wallets, identified as “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH,” have suddenly sprung to life after nearly 10.7 years of inactivity. 







According to data from looksonchain, these wallets recently transferred all of their accumulated bitcoins, totaling 1,000 BTC, equivalent to approximately $60.9 million, in just 20 minutes.







The sudden activity from these dormant wallets has sparked curiosity and speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Given their extended period of inactivity, the sudden movement of such a significant amount of bitcoins has raised questions about the motivations and identities behind these transactions.

Decoding the Sudden Activity of Long-Inactive Wallets





What makes this development particularly intriguing is the history of these wallets. Both “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH” received 500 BTC each back in September 2013, when the price of Bitcoin was a mere $124. At that time, these transactions may have been relatively insignificant, but with the astronomical rise in Bitcoin’s value over the past decade, the bitcoins accumulated in these wallets have now become immensely valuable.



The decision to transfer all 1,000 BTC from these wallets after such a prolonged period of dormancy suggests deliberate intent on the part of the wallet holders. While the exact reasons behind the transfers remain unknown, theories abound regarding potential motives, including profit-taking, strategic portfolio management, or even the possibility of a long-forgotten individual or entity reclaiming access to their assets.



The timing of these transactions adds another layer of intrigue to the story. Coming at a time when Bitcoin’s price has been experiencing volatility and regulatory scrutiny, the sudden movement of such a large amount of bitcoins could have implications for market dynamics and investor sentiment.

Ripple CEO Warns of US Government Targeting Tether


Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has warned that the US government is targeting Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin by market capitalization.
Garlinghouse made this revelation while speaking on a new episode of the World Class podcast with Chris Vasquez.
US Government is Going After Tether
According to Garlinghouse, the US’s potential action against the stablecoin issuer could trigger a significant disruption in the crypto space.

“The US Government is going after Tether. That is clear to me. I view Tether as a very important part of the ecosystem and I don’t know how to predict the impact it would have on the rest of the ecosystem,” Garlinghouse said.


This assertion comes amid revealing finds about the exploitation of USDT by terrorist organizations and sanctioned countries to evade US financial restrictions. In April, Adewale Adeyemo, the US Treasury Deputy Secretary, testified before the Senate Banking Committee, highlighting Russia’s growing use of alternative payment methods such as Tether’s USDT to sidestep economic sanctions.

“We’ve seen Russia increasingly turning to alternative payment mechanisms—including the stablecoin tether—to try to circumvent our sanctions and continue to finance its war machine,” Adeyemo wrote.

Simultaneously, a UN report shed light on the widespread use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering, with USDT on the TRON blockchain emerging as a prominent vehicle, particularly within illicit online gambling platforms.

Despite these concerns, Tether emphasizes its adherence to compliance standards and collaboration with law enforcement to combat illicit financial activities. The company has taken proactive measures, including freezing addresses holding a substantial amount of its tokens involved in unlawful activities.
Tether’s USDT maintains its position as the leading stablecoin by market capitalization, boasting a circulating supply of approximately $110 billion. Notably, the company achieved a historic net profit of $4.52 billion in the first quarter.

Yet, despite the controversies surrounding the largest stablecoin issuer, Ripple has entered the sector. Last month, the company announced its intention to introduce its stablecoin. 

“Ripple’s move into stablecoins isn’t just about innovation; it’s about contributing to the XRPL ecosystem and setting the stage for a more robust and diverse crypto landscape,” Ripple said.

Since the announcement, the company has not provided additional details about the asset. However, Ripple CTO David Schwartz hinted that the stablecoin’s name could be disclosed in June.

Bitcoin “Danger Zone” In 2 Days: Crypto Expert Explains What This Means


								Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has dropped a peculiar analysis on when Bitcoin might resume its upward trajectory. According to a post on social media platform X by the popular analyst, Bitcoin could finally exit the “danger zone” in the next two days. 

This prediction has come amidst speculations on when and whether Bitcoin would continue a price surge as current price action shows the crypto is now ranging around the $68,000 price level.
Bitcoin Exiting Danger Zone: What Does This Mean?
Bitcoin has been subject to various price outlooks from different crypto analysts in the past few weeks, especially after the recent completion of the halving. While some analysts are predicting a price drop to as low as $52,000, others are still bullish. Rekt Capital’s recent outlook regarding the cryptocurrency puts him among the latter category of analysts who remain bullish.
Rekt Capital’s bullish prognosis regarding Bitcoin seems to be very intriguing, as he’s going by a peculiar term which he called the danger zone. His outlook on the danger zone is based on Bitcoin’s price action in 2016. The cryptocurrency, in his opinion, is currently mirroring its price movement in 2016. 
As he noted in a BTCUSD one-week time frame chart, Bitcoin has largely been in a correction phase after the halving, which he called the re-accumulation range. However, Bitcoin created a wick that extended below the low of the re-accumulation range just like it did in a three-week window after the 2016 halving. 
This wick extension refers particularly to Bitcoin’s break below the $60,000 price level early last week as it extended to the $56,000 price mark. According to him, the extension of this week means that Bitcoin has satisfied the Post-Halving danger zone and it could end in just the next two days.


Undoubtedly, Bitcoin’s breakout above this zone means it is now free from a strong move to the downside. From this point, all the roads lead to a price uptick if it continues to mirror the 2016 price action. Although Rekt Capital did not give a particular price target, his chart analysis indicates Bitcoin surging above $180,000, representing a 200% increase from the current price level.

Bitcoin is now trading at $60.926. Chart: TradingView
What’s Next For Bitcoin?
At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $60,728 and is down by 4.7% in the past seven days. The crypto is yet to return to the $70,000 price level since early April. It appears as if the supply and demand effect of the halving has yet to be factored into the price of BTC. 

Historically, Bitcoin has experienced price surges between six to nine months after past halvings. This means the cryptocurrency could still continue to dilly-dally around $60,000 for some time, giving investors more time to accumulate before a strong price increase.

Using the BTC/USD weekly chart, the renowned analyst revealed that BTC offers a downside wick below the bottom of its current re-accumulation range within a three-week window after the recent halving. From his shared charts, Rekt Capital showed that Bitcoin has completed its navigation across a three-week post-halving danger zone and is stepping into the next phase of the trend, the post-halving re-accumulation.









Notably, Rekt Capital’s shared image showed that while the post-halving danger zone lasted only three weeks, the post-halving re-accumulation could last longer. Furthermore, he revealed that the post-halving re-accumulation would trigger an upward movement, pushing Bitcoin back to the recently achieved all-time high (ATH).



In further explanation, Rekt Capital highlighted that Bitcoin experienced its first -18% pre-halving retrace approximately 30 days before the Bitcoin Halving. According to him, the 2024 pre-halving retrace mirrored that of 2016, which happened over 28 days, closely.



Following this correlation, the analyst thinks there could be a repeat of the 2016 Bitcoin trend pattern. He foresees a downside volatility around the re-accumulation range low occurring over the next ten days. According to him, the post-halving danger zone will end in ten days, but 2016 history suggests downside volatility at the $60600 Range Low is a possibility.



Bitcoin traded for $61,058 at the time of writing, reflecting a 17.3% pullback from the ATH of $73,794, according to data from TradingView.

AEVO, Arbitrum, Render token unlocks near as BitBot gains momentum



                    

                    Popular cryptocurrencies are on edge as investors wait for their upcoming token unlocks that will lead to more dilution. Arbitrum’s ARB token was trading at $1 on Sunday, down by over 58% from its highest point in 2023, and is near its lowest swing since December 1st last year. 
Top token unlocks ahead
AEVO, a newly launched token, has also tumbled to about $1.20, its lowest level on record. It has crashed by more than 68% from its highest level this year. 
Render Token (RNDR), on the other hand, has defied gravity as other cryptocurrencies slip. It jumped to a high of $11.5, its highest swing since March 27th. It has soared by over 75% from its lowest level in April, helped by the rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) assets. It is also nearing its highest level this year.
These cryptocurrencies will be in the spotlight this week as investors focus on their upcoming token unlocks. A token unlock is a situation where more coins are released to the market as part of their tokenomics. These unlocks lead to substantial dilution by introducing tokens to the market.
Data by TokenUnlocks shows that AEVO will release over 827K tokens on May 15th, a substantial amount since AEVO has 110 million tokens in circulation. If the figure is correct, it means that the network will have substantial oversupply.
Arbitrum, the biggest layer-2 network in the market, will have its token unlock event on May 16th. It will release over 92.6 million tokens, a substantial figure since It has over 2.6 billion tokens in circulation.
Render, a platform that offers decentralized GPU, will have its token unlock on Friday. It will release over 8.4 million tokens equivalent to 0.20% of its supply. 
The other popular networks that will have token unlocks soon are Aptos (APT), Pendle, ApeCoin, Manta, and Oasis Network.
BitBot token sale going on
Meanwhile, BitBot, an upcoming blockchain platform, is doing well as its token sale gains momentum.
Data shown on its website shows that it has raised over $3.3 million from global investors. This figure makes it one of the most popular tokens in the market. It has now entered its 13th stage, meaning that the token sale is nearing its end. The final part of the sale will be the 15th stage.
BitBot is a platform that seeks to become the leading player in the crypto trading industry. It will provide a Telegram bot that will help thousands or millions of people make money day trading these assets.
BitBot will be a unique Telegram bot for three main reasons. First, in addition to the normal technical analysis, it will have unique artificial intelligence features that are expected to boost its accuracy. 
Second, the network will be non-custodial, meaning that it will not have access to user data and funds. Third, it will be powered by $BITBOT, a crypto token that will have more features like revenue sharing and governance features. You can buy the $BITBOT token here.

Bitcoin Wallet That Hasn't Moved in Almost 11 Years Wakes Up - The Level It Bought and Current Value of BTC is Unbelievable - Bitcoin Sistemi


A Bitcoin wallet that has been dormant for almost 11 years has suddenly become active.
According to data provided by Lookonchain, the ancient whale in question transferred all 500 BTC in its wallet to another wallet after it became active. The total amount of this transaction for the whale was 30.4 million dollars.


According to the data, the whale wallet purchased all of the BTCs in question 10.7 years ago for 62 thousand dollars. On January 12, 2014, the date of the purchase, BTC price was trading at $124.
At the time of this writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at $61,300, which means that the whale has gained 500 times in 11 years.





It is not known exactly whether the whale wallet in question is a very patient investor or a person who managed to remember the wallet key after many years. In addition, it is not known whether the whale sent the BTCs he transferred out for sale or moved them to another cold wallet. Whale may have sold its assets via OTC method instead of central exchanges in order not to affect the market.

Here’s when the XRP price could hit $0.62


As Ripple Labs nears the conclusion of its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the cryptocurrency community is closely monitoring the potential impact on XRP‘s price. 
With the lawsuit drawing to a close and key economic reports on the horizon, analysts are optimistic that a favorable outcome could push XRP’s price to $0.62.
The culmination of Ripple’s prolonged SEC lawsuit, paired with the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on May 15, is poised to play a critical role in shaping XRP’s market valuation.


As stakeholders anticipate the legal resolution and economic indicators, the market is speculatively poised for a shift from the current price range of $0.46 to $0.57, potentially reaching a higher stable level amidst regulatory clarity and economic stimuli.
Technical analysis and price movements

Currently, XRP trades in a range between $0.46 and $0.57. This price band indicates a delicate equilibrium of supply and demand.
A crucial observation was made on May 7 when XRP’s price dipped below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $0.52, signaling potential bearish dominance in the market. 
The next significant support level is at $0.46, where a robust defense by buyers could stabilize the price and prevent further declines.
For a bullish scenario to emerge, XRP needs to sustain a breakout above the $0.57 resistance level. Such a movement would suggest that the market correction might be concluding, potentially setting the stage for an ascent towards the $0.62 target.
The role of CPI data in XRP’s price trajectory
The upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, scheduled for May 15, is another critical factor to consider. Matthew Dixon, CEO of the crypto rating platform Evai, highlights that a weaker-than-expected CPI could act as a catalyst and awaken XRP, which he described as a “sleeping giant.” 

Dixon believes this could be a bullish catalyst, potentially propelling XRP to the $0.62 mark. The anticipation is that subdued inflation figures might lessen the pressure on monetary policy, encouraging investment in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.
Furthermore, market participants should closely monitor XRP token unlocks, which could negatively impact the token’s valuation.
The convergence of Ripple’s legal developments and economic indicators like the CPI data is setting the stage for a potentially significant price movement for XRP. 
Investors and market observers are closely monitoring these events, which are expected to determine the direction of XRP’s price in the near term. 
A favorable legal outcome and a positive economic report could indeed be the twin engines that propel XRP to the anticipated $0.62 target and beyond.

Whale alert: 10-year inactive Bitcoin wallets move 1,000 BTC


Bitcoin (BTC) long-term holders suddenly activated two dormant wallets on May 12, moving 1,000 BTC worth over $60 million. These whale addresses remained inactive for 10.7 years since September 2013, when this stash was valued at $125,000.
Notably, the Whale Alert account on X posted each transaction with an interval of 20 minutes. According to the alerts, these holdings were valued at $62,890 and $63,565 when the addresses first acquired them.

On that note, the Lookonchain account also reported the dormant whales’ activity, identifying that one address acquired 500 BTC on September 13, 2013, and the other on September 14, 2013.



The short interval between each receiving and, later, spending suggests that both 10-year Bitcoin wallets belong to the same entity. This recent activity could mean simple wallet management or that this whale intends to sell the 1,000 BTC.
Bitcoin dormant whales activity and BTC price analysis
Interestingly, Finbold retrieved data from Santiment showing that increased dormant whale activity usually correlates to BTC’s price top formation. The chart shows that most spikes on this metric were close to a trend reversal, typically bearish.
However, despite the recent two, there is currently significantly low 5-year dormant whale activity in the Bitcoin network.

As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $61,000, and only 1,056 BTC have been moved within this category instead of over 10,000 units during top formations. Moreover, technical analysis, derivatives liquidations, and on-chain metrics suggest Bitcoin could soon rally to $72,000, for over 18% gains.
Conversely, analysts warned of an imminent BTC meltdown, while others are optimistic about an altcoin season potentially surging.

Bitcoin Lightning Network for global corporate transactions? - Let's see... | Cryptopolitan

David Marcus, once the big boss at PayPal and a key player at Facebook, recently made a bold claim: the Bitcoin Lightning Network could soon be the world’s top payment network. Leading his team at Lightspark, he emphasized the growing trend of cryptocurrency becoming a staple in mainstream finance. Quick and Cheap: The Lightning PromiseAt Lightspark, Marcus and his team are all-in on Bitcoin’s potential as a global settlement platform. He talks about Bitcoin being neutral — ideal for hassle-free transactions worldwide. This neutrality is crucial for its widespread acceptance. The Lightning Network, a layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, is designed to speed up transactions and cut costs. This could be a big deal, making it easier and cheaper for both people and businesses to handle money.Marcus believes these changes could greatly improve how we handle money, making crypto more accessible globally. His thoughts come at a time when the mix of digital and traditional finance is getting more attention, showing a move towards more connected financial tech.Coinbase, a top U.S. crypto exchange, has already jumped on the Lightning Network bandwagon, showing the industry is keen on faster, more efficient blockchain tech. Before this, Bitcoin transactions at Coinbase would take 10 minutes to two hours and cost a lot during busy times. The Lightning Network changes the game by handling transactions off the main blockchain, allowing for almost instant transactions with very low fees.Global Reach and Technological SynergyViktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at Coinbase, is excited about what the Lightning Network means for Bitcoin’s future. He thinks this step will make Bitcoin transactions faster and make Bitcoin more useful and reachable worldwide. This marks a major point in the crypto world’s timeline.Previously, Marcus praised Bitcoin’s potential as the go-to currency for Artificial Intelligence systems. This view places Bitcoin at the forefront of tech advances, showing it could lead to new ways to handle transactions and boost Bitcoin’s role in the tech world.Lightning Labs, under CEO Elizabeth Stark, is pushing new features built using Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade from late 2021. Speaking at FT Live’s Crypto and Digital Assets Summit, Stark talked about how they’re working to make stablecoins and other digital assets a reality on Bitcoin’s platform. They’ve started testing transactions with these new assets on the Lightning Network:“We released an early part of the code in October and recently showed off the first-ever transaction on Lightning with an asset. We’re aiming to have crypto dollars and stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain,” Stark said. She pointed out that while digital assets usually run on other blockchains that can have high fees and other problems, Bitcoin’s network is super secure and decentralized, making it ideal for stablecoins.Stark discussed how Bitcoin and stablecoins are good options for people in countries facing inflation and currency problems. She noted a big uptick in stablecoin use since the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in developing countries.“People who need a reliable store of value are really sticking with this. Some are choosing Bitcoin, others go for stablecoins, and some use both,” Stark explained.With the growing importance of the stablecoin market, Stark said it’s essential to have the right setup to allow issuing of stablecoins and real-world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.That’s why Lightnight Labs is building this tech now. Their vision is to create the infrastructure for it. Asset issuers will use the tech to put out real-world tokenized assets.Financial institutions might soon issue gold assets, stablecoins, and other fiat-backed assets on Bitcoin and then make transactions over the Lightning Network.Stark highlighted how this could be a cheaper alternative to traditional finance methods like Visa, where fees can be over 3% in the U.S.:Transacting with stablecoins on Lightning could cost just a cent or even less. That’s a massive drop from what traditional systems charge.

zkSync Mainnet v24 Upgrade Delayed, Sepolia Testnet Restoration Imminent! - Coincu



	

Key Points:




zkSync Developers delay v24 mainnet upgrade to ensure stability of Sepolia test network. 



Issues with eth_sender service and proof submissions resolved, full restoration imminent. 



Investigation ongoing for Sepolia test network issues, impacting mainnet v24 release.




zkSync developers have provided updates regarding the zkSync Era Sepolia testnet, aiming for full restoration in the next few hours. 





The v24 mainnet upgrade, however, faces postponement until late next week to ensure thorough stability evaluation.







Issues plaguing the testnet have been identified and addressed by the zkSync team. The first issue stemmed from instability with the eth_sender service, which disrupted L1 commit block submissions for approximately 24 hours. This was attributed to differences in the gas market for blob pricing on Sepolia. The second issue involved delays in withdrawals due to a failure to submit proofs for over two days, caused by discrepancies between the in-circuit VM and the out-of-circuit VM.

Can Tellor (TRB) Reach $232 Despite $5.46 Million Whale Sell-Off?


In a noteworthy series of moves by crypto whales, a total of $5.46 million worth of Tellor (TRB) tokens were recently moved to centralized exchanges.
This indicates potential sales impacting the token’s market dynamics. The Tellor whales’ activities coincide with TRB’s significant price volatility, suggesting potential profit-taking.
Can TRB Hit $232 Despite Crypto Whales Selling?
Spot On Chain, an on-chain analysis platform, tracked a significant transaction where a crypto whale wallet 0xf2b deposited 10,582 TRB (approximately $1.32 million) to Coinbase. The crypto whale made the transaction at a price of around $124. 
Previously, this wallet withdrew the tokens at an average price of $57.7. Hence, he will realize an estimated profit of $706,000—a 116% gain in nearly two months.

Additionally, several other crypto whales replicated this pattern of buying low and selling high between early March and May 2024. 

“Lastly, please note that this is the sixth whale that withdrew TRB from Coinbase between early March and May and then deposited all tokens back to the CEX for profits in the past 3 days after the price surged up to 108%,” Spot On Chain said.

For instance, another crypto whale wallet, 0xeb1, deposited 10,486 TRB (valued at about $1.38 million) to Coinbase. The crypto whale withdrew TRB at an average price of $76.59. He held the tokens for over two months, securing a profit of $581,000, representing a 72.4% return.

Moreover, a third crypto whale wallet, 0xb4b, engaged in a similar strategy, selling TRB tokens worth approximately $1.4 million to achieve a profit of $488,000 (54.5%). Also, another crypto whale – 0xfac, deposited 10,375 TRB ( ~ 1.36 million) to Coinbase to realize an estimated profit of $461,000.
These strategic trades underscore a common approach among crypto whales to maximize returns within relatively short trading periods.
Despite these substantial sales, TRB’s market performance has demonstrated resilience. The token recently experienced a breakout from a bull flag pattern, a bullish continuation pattern characterized by a swift price movement followed by a consolidation phase resembling a flag. 

This breakout indicates that TRB might extend its uptrend, with crypto analysts like Emre suggesting a potential target of $232.

However, this bullish forecast would be invalidated if TRB falls below a critical support level of $115.As TRB continues to show robust market movements, stakeholders should closely monitor these developments.

Cryptocurrency and SEC Statements by Billionaire Mark Cuban - Bitcoin Sistemi


Billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, recently accused Gary Gensler and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of trying to hinder the developing cryptocurrency industry.
Cuban argues that the SEC's decision to regulate through litigation rather than encouraging compliance creates a hostile environment for new participants. Cuban says:



“They make it impossible to comply with the registration rules. The cost in terms of time and legal fees of trying to register and comply makes it impossible to operate realistically.”

Cuban also explains that the SEC's approach discourages him from investing in companies that plan to issue tokens. Cuban stated:

“If I get an investment opportunity to issue tokens, I say no now. It's not because of the company itself, but because the SEC will not allow the company to operate.”

The entrepreneur also criticizes the SEC for creating a “destructive environment” when the industry could have been improved to increase compliance and protect investors. Cuban believes the cryptocurrency industry is eager to find a way to register and comply and separate legitimate tokens from “junk tokens.”





But Cuban argues that because the SEC's approach makes compliance so expensive and time-consuming, it's difficult for companies to distinguish themselves from less reputable entities. “Junk tokens sit side by side with real companies, and investors have no way of knowing what is junk and what is real,” he says.

U.S. Scrutiny of Tether Raises Concerns for Stablecoin Industry - DailyCoin


        
A major investigation into Tether, the leading issuer of stablecoins, has rocked the cryptocurrency industry.



Concerns have been mounting over Tether’s reserves and potential misuse, raising questions about transparency.



The outcome of the investigation could have a significant impact on the future of stablecoins.
The cryptocurrency industry is on edge as the U.S. government intensifies its investigation into Tether, the world’s leading issuer of stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a steady price, typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. Tether Faces Questions About ReservesThey act as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, allowing users to easily move in and out of crypto positions without enduring the wild price swings common in the market. 
This increased scrutiny stems from concerns that Tether might not have adequately backed its tokens with real-world dollar reserves, raising questions about its transparency and stability. Additionally, allegations have surfaced suggesting Tether could have been used by sanctioned nations and groups to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions.“It’s evident the U.S. government is closely examining Tether,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, a major player in the blockchain and payments industry. “Given their vital role within the crypto space, the potential consequences for the broader industry are difficult to predict.”Tether has maintained it’s actively working to comply with regulations. However, the lack of clarity surrounding its dollar reserves continues to fuel doubts.Ripple Wants to Enter the RingRipple’s recent announcement to launch its own stablecoin in April 2024 underscores the growing acceptance and potential of stablecoins. This move by a prominent industry player highlights the significance of stablecoins within the cryptocurrency landscape.
The coming months are likely to bring further developments in the U.S. investigation. The outcome could have a significant impact on the future of stablecoins and the overall cryptocurrency environment. Increased regulation could bring more stability and legitimacy to the market, but it could also stifle innovation and growth. The industry will be watching closely as this situation unfolds.On the Flipside
Tether argues their reserves are adequate, and the ongoing audits will provide the necessary transparency.



The investigation could encourage the rise of other well-regulated stablecoins, fostering competition.



The launch of new stablecoins indicates the market is adapting and innovating.
Why This MattersThe US investigation into Tether, the dominant stablecoin, throws uncertainty over a financial tool crucial for crypto market stability and user activity. Unraveling Tether’s legitimacy could trigger a domino effect, impacting investor confidence, stablecoin adoption, and potentially the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem’s growth trajectory.Crypto giant Tether is taking on Google in the tech world with a new phone!  This article dives into Tether’s plan to release a decentralized smartphone:Tether’s “Pear Phone” to Battle Google as Tech Giant StrugglesCurious about Tether’s recent profit boom?

Economist taunts Bitcoin replacing fiat is like ‘a sideshow in Las Vegas’


As Bitcoin (BTC) matures, proponents have maintained that the digital asset has the potential to replace fiat currencies, having already found use cases as a legal tender in El Salvador.
However, Professor of Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University, Steve Hanke, has reiterated his longstanding view on Bitcoin, noting its incapacity to take on fiat currencies or precious metals such as gold. He made these remarks during an interview with David Lin, published on May 12.
Hanke likened the possibility to what he termed a ‘sideshow in Las Vegas.’ His sentiments coincide with a period in which institutional investors have increased their allocation in Bitcoin, especially with the rollout of exchange-traded funds (ETF).



“We’re talking about a sideshow that occurs in some places like Las Vegas. As I’ve said since day one, Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset with zero fundamental value,” he said. 

It should be remembered that Hanke was highly critical of El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender, warning that the move could lead to an economic collapse. As reported by Finbold, the renowned economist suggested that countries involved in approving Bitcoin are closely related to corruption. 
Bitcoin is a ‘non-event’
Hanke’s comments were echoed by fellow economist Peter Schiff, who also participated in the interview. Schiff dismissed Bitcoin as a “non-event,” labeling it a sideshow with little relevance in the broader financial landscape.

“It’s important to the people who have bought it, and they’re going to end up losing a lot of money if they don’t sell it. But somebody’s got to get caught holding the bag because somebody’s going to own it when the music stops,” Schiff said. 

Schiff’s skepticism extended to Bitcoin’s potential to replace traditional assets like gold or fiat currencies.

“Central banks are not going to buy it,” he asserted. “It’s not going to replace gold, let alone any of these fiat currencies,” he added. 

Notably, Schiff has also been critical of Bitcoin, questioning its true value and terming it a failure based on factors such as transaction costs. 

VIDEO

The gold bug has noted in the past that Bitcoin might face a “catastrophic crash” due to large amounts of BTC entering into spot ETFs, making it more vulnerable, as BTC ETF buyers are unlikely to be true believers.
In the meantime, Bitcoin is facing bearish pressure and resistance at $65,000. By press time, BTC was trading at $61,183.

Pepe Doge to Skyrocket 7,500% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Doge (PEPEDOGE), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Doge presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Doge has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 7,500% in the coming two days, and Pepe Doge could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Pepe Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Doge on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Doge by entering its contract address – 7s7VZhFWTez5ykSr214AxnqRTMdcKu5rd77YFAx2DGG1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEDOGE.

Technicals Suggesting Altcoins May Be on the Verge of a ‘Massive Move,’ According to Glassnode Founders - The Daily Hodl


								Technical signals are hinting at an explosion in altcoin prices approaching over the horizon, according to veteran crypto analysts.
Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 62,800 followers that altcoins are likely on the verge of a “massive move.”










The analysts say that ALTS (TOTAL3), which represents the total market cap of crypto assets excluding Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins, appears ready to move up now that both its monthly relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators have potentially bottomed out.
“BTC has recovered some ground after the decline of the last couple of weeks – and has broken higher.
SP&500 and Nasdaq look like they are on the move higher as well.
So – what about ALTS?
Technicals say that we may be standing right in front of a massive move. RSI and MACD suggest the bottom is in – and that a large push higher may set in soon.
How many percentage will we see this time in the possible rally to new highs in ALTS?”
 
Source: Negentropic/X
The RSI and the MACD are momentum oscillators used to spot potential areas of trend reversals.
Looking at Bitcoin, the analysts say that BTC is still inside a large pennant pattern, which traditionally suggests a gradually narrowing consolidation before the next move to the upside.
“BTC still looks like it is about to BLOW higher!
Last week’s candle was a Reversal Candle – a Hammer with a long Wick. Price moved back into the Pennant Structure.
This candle still dominate the structure.
This week’s pullback hence seems like a healthy correction before higher. Correction often pulls back either 50% or 61.8% of the previous impulse move.”

If You Bought Your Mom $100 In Bitcoin, Dogecoin And Ethereum Last Mother's Day, Here's How Much She'd Have Today - Benzinga

Roses are red, violets are blue, flowers are overrated, does Mom want crypto from you?If you're struggling with what to get your mom for Mother's Day, a gift of cryptocurrency is an option.Here's a look back at the historical returns of several cryptocurrencies on Mother's Day last year.What Happened: The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC earlier this year has brought more attention to the cryptocurrency sector and led to rebounding prices.This means that, if you bought you mom crypto for Mother's Day last year, she might be extra happy to see you this year.Certainly, flowers and a card are always a thoughtful option for Mother’s Day and offer a more stable gift choice compared to the periods of high volatility often seen in the cryptocurrency market.Mother's Day was designated an official holiday by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914 and is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. Last year, Mother's Day was celebrated on May 14, 2023. Here's a look at how an investment and gift in three leading cryptocurrencies at that time would be worth now.Related Link: Mother’s Day 2024: Heartfelt Ways To Make Mom’s Day Special, No Matter The DistanceInvesting $100 in Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum: Here's how much a $100 investment in each of Bitcoin BTC/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD could have bought on May 14, 2023.Bitcoin: 0.0037 BTCDogecoin: 1,377.75 DOGEEthereum: 0.0548 ETHInvesting $100 in each cryptocurrency last Mother's Day would be worth the following based on prices at the time of writing:Bitcoin: $226.33Dogecoin: $199.60Ethereum: $160.67A $300 gift consisting of the three well-known cryptocurrencies would be worth $586.60 today, a gain of 95.5%.Compare that return to a loss of 33.4% from Mother's Day 2022 to Mother's Day 2023 and a loss of 51% from Mother's Day 2021 to Mother's Day 2022.Of course those who bought their moms cryptocurrency back on Mother's Day 2020 would have a different story to tell.A $100 investment each in Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum on Mother's Day 2020 would have been able to buy the following amounts and now would be worth the following:Bitcoin: 0.0104 BTC, $636.16Dogecoin: 38,270.19 DOGE, $5,544.28Ethereum: 0.4727 ETH, $1,385.89The $300 investment or gift to mom on Mother's Day 2020 would be worth $7,566.33 today and up 2,422.1%.

Web3 Watch: Reebok jumps into digital wearable game - Blockworks


If you’ve been pining for the opportunity to have your favorite photos replicated onto a digital Reebok sneaker, you are in luck. 
On Friday, the sports brand announced a new feature in partnership with Futureverse called “Reebok Impact” — an AI-powered tool where users can send a photo via Instagram direct message and in return receive “a custom sneaker in the colors and style of the image.”
Users can create up to four pairs for free and send the file to games like Fortnite and Roblox. 
Leveraging AI creates an easy-to-navigate user experience that meets sneaker fans where they are. The future of fashion has arrived, and this is only the beginning,” Futureverse co-founders Shara Senderoff and Aaron McDonald said in a statement. 
Reebok is the latest to jump into the digital fashion game. Parent company Adidas announced a “long term collaboration” with move-to-earn app STEPN last month, intended to bring Adidas sneaker NFTs to the platform. 
Corporate rival Nike this week also announced new developments in their digital wearable business. .SWOOSH, Nike’s NFT platform now allows users to create their own designs and enter a competition to make their digital shoe real. 
Reebok is not offering users the ability to purchase physical pairs of their “Reebok Impact” sneakers, but the company said using Reebok Impact will come with an “incentive” to make some real-life purchases.

Use of Fake Money Reported Across US After Secret Service Seizes $21,800,000 of Counterfeit Cash in One Year - The Daily Hodl


								Reports of people trying to use counterfeit cash are spreading across the US.
Headlines on various attempts to pay with fake money are popping up around the country, with ABC News declaring counterfeiting is “making a comeback.”










Police in Hilo, Hawaii say someone has been bleaching the ink off of $1 bills and printing $100 marks on top, reports the Fox-affiliated news station KHON.
Police captain Rio Amon-Wilkins says authorities are looking at several persons of interest in connection with the crime.
“Because it’s being printed on original US currency notes, the pen still works properly and doesn’t identify it as counterfeit. This is the first time, to my knowledge, we’ve had this type of case where they’re using the original U.S. currency notes.”
The report is one of several on various attempts to use phony money around the US in the last few weeks alone:
• In Brownsville, Texas, a man is accused of manufacturing counterfeit dollar bills and using them to pay for groceries, hotels, gas and food.
• In Boardman, Ohio, police say counterfeit money was used to enter a community baseball stadium in an ongoing investigation.
• In North Carolina, a man has admitted to bleaching $1 bills and trying to print $100 graphics on top.
In addition, police in Germany say they just confiscated piles of fake cash with a face value of $103 million, as reported by the Associated Press.
Investigators believe the bad bills came from Turkey and were being sent to the US for illicit purposes.
“The bills, known as ‘prop copy or ‘movie money,’ could be recognized as fakes when scrutinized closely, but Germany’s central bank and US authorities believe they could be mistaken for real money in everyday life, police said in a statement.”
The US Secret Service says it seized $21.8 million in fake currency last year, triggering 197 arrests. Although the dollar value of its seizures has dropped in recent years, the agency warns counterfeiting techniques are evolving along with advances in technology.
“The threat of counterfeit U.S. currency to the financial system of the United States continues to evolve. Advances in technology, the availability of scanning and printing devices and the adoption of the U.S. dollar by nations as their legal tender have exacerbated the global threat.”

Render's [RNDR] 20% surge halts: Is the AI token's bull run over? - AMBCrypto



RNDR’s price only moved up marginally in the last 24 hours.
Selling pressure on the AI token has increased of late. 

After a massive weekly rally, Render [RNDR] had a setback as the entire crypto market somewhat turned bearish. But the last few hours were in investors’ interest as the token’s chart turned green. 
Does this mean that RNDR will soon resume its bull rally? 
RNDR pushes the brake 
According to CoinMarketCap, RNDR investors had a gala time last week as the AI token’s price surged by nearly 20%, only to face a correction on the 11th of May. 
The declining price trend didn’t last long, as the token’s daily chart again turned green. At the time of writing, Render was trading at $10.90 with a market capitalization of over $4.2 billion. 
To check whether this was the sign of RNDR resuming its rally, AMBCrypto analyzed its metrics. It was surprising to find that, despite the massive weekly rally, RNDR’s Social Volume declined last week. 
Its Weighted Sentiment also went negative on the 11th of May, which indicated that bearish sentiment was dominant in the market.
Source: Santiment
In fact, while the token’s price remained bullish, investors might have thought it to be a market top as they started to sell. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that RNDR’s supply on exchanges increased substantially last week. 
Meanwhile, its Supply outside of Exchanges dropped, further establishing the fact that selling pressure was high. 
On top of that, Render’s supply held by top addresses declined slightly, suggesting that the top players in the crypto market were selling. 
Source: Santiment
Render’s bull rally is ending
Though these aforementioned metrics looked bearish, things might turn out to be different. Popular crypto analyst Crypto Tony recently posted a tweet mentioning how he expects an AI tokens season to arrive. 
To check whether that possibility is likely to happen in the short-term, AMBCrypto then took a look at RNDR’s daily chart. As per our analysis, the MACD displayed a clear bullish upperhand in the market. 
Its price was also resting well above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), which can be inferred as a bullish signal. 
Source: TradingView
Nonetheless, the rest of the indicators suggested otherwise. For example, the token’s price touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, which often results in price corrections.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a sharp downtick and was headed under the neutral mark at press time. 
These two indicators hinted that Render bears were stepping up and might push the token’s price down in the near term.

                        Leading financial institutions on Wall Street are shifting their focus towards industrializing proofs-of-concept (PoCs) developed within the blockchain experiment known as Project Guardian.JPMorgan’s blockchain platform, Onyx, is particularly keen on converting the insights gained from its pilot program with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) into tangible products.During the TokenizeThis event held in Miami on May 10, Stephanie Lok, product manager of JPMorgan’s Onyx, said the company is focused on investment fund tokenization as a key area of focus.“That’s a very big focus area: how can we kind of productionize, industrialize what we built out as a proof-of-concept?” Lok stated.WisdomTree Highlights Interest in RWA Tokenization
Another traditional firm heavily invested in blockchain-enabled finance migration is WisdomTree, an asset manager.Maredith Hannon, head of business development for WisdomTree, highlighted the company’s interest in portfolio personalization and blending portfolios with checking accounts.Hannon further elaborated on the potential benefits of real-world asset tokenization for investor portfolios, envisioning the ability to create a myriad of allocation variations and risk profiles.WisdomTree is also exploring the provision of different on-chain services through a unified interface for its clients.The company aims to integrate various financial services, including tokenized portfolios and traditional banking services, into a single application.“Deliver that end value of being able to use your money more effectively. Being able to be in the market, in a money market fund earning 5% versus earning pretty much nothing in your checking account.”As a prominent asset manager involved in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), WisdomTree brings its expertise and experience to the Project Guardian initiative.Launched in May 2022, Project Guardian seeks to explore decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and asset tokenization in wholesale funding markets.The initiative focuses on developing open and interoperable networks, institutional-grade DeFi protocols, asset tokenization, and trusted infrastructure.JPMorgan, DBS Bank, SBI Digital Asset Holdings, and WisdomTree are the main participants in Project Guardian, collaborating to assess the feasibility of DeFi and asset tokenization on a larger scale.Tokenized Funds Continue to Gain Popularity
In a report earlier this year, Moody’s, a leading investment risk assessment firm, revealed the value of tokenized funds surged from $100 million at the beginning of 2023 to approximately $800 million, driven by the rising tokenization of U.S. treasuries.The report highlighted that both public and private blockchains are witnessing the inclusion of various assets.Some of the more notable examples include Franklin Templeton’s U.S. Government Money Fund expanding from Stellar to Polygon, Backed Finance launching a tokenized short-term U.S. treasury bond exchange-traded fund (ETF), and UBS Asset Management deploying a tokenized money market fund (MMF) on the Ethereum blockchain.According to Moody’s, the tokenization of MMFs offers the potential to combine their stability with the technological advantages of stablecoins.Just recently, DigiFT, a Singapore-based fintech company, also announced the launch of its US Treasury bill depository receipt (DR) tokens.Likewise, Turkey’s Misyon Bank has announced its partnership with Swiss firm Taurus to leverage its digital asset custody and tokenization technology.

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) Will Rally 8,000% After Solana Launch, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Gensler Devil (GENDEV) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Gensler Devil (GENDEV), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gensler Devil presents a similar opportunity.



Gensler Devil has a market cap below $14,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $200,000-$500,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 5,300% in the coming two days, and Gensler Devil could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Gensler Devil can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Gensler Devil on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gensler Devil by entering its contract address – GwoY3GpqrSmws6QW88CyDaJkkTNfrQLGN2zZ1rSbJ6z9 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GENDEV.

                        Shiba InuShiba Inu’s trading price of $0.000023 shows minor fluctuations, yet there’s buzzing speculation about its future growth. Given a marginal 1.7% surge over the past 24 hours, the fervor around Shiba Inu price predictions escalates, with discussions centering on the potential of the token reaching a $1 valuation.Supported by substantial trading activity and a significant market cap, SHIB continues to capture the attention of the cryptocurrency community.Shiba Inu Sees 338% Surge in Token Burns: Millions of SHIB Vanish
Over the past week, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced an impressive 338% increase in its token burn rate, resulting in the permanent removal of 200,591,910 SHIB tokens from circulation.This significant uptick in burning activity reflects the cryptocurrency’s strategy to diminish its supply and potentially boost its value. The dramatic rise in burns, detailed in Shibburn’s latest update, is part of ongoing efforts to enhance Shiba Inu’s market dynamics.
Burn Rate Increase: 338.77% over the past week.
SHIB Tokens Burned: 200,591,910 tokens permanently removed.
Purpose: To decrease supply and improve token value.
Shiba Inu Price Prediction
Shiba Inu present a key pivot point at $0.000024, having an immediate resistance at $0.000025, with subsequent hurdles at $0.000026 and $0.000028.Conversely, support levels are currently found at $0.000022, $0.000021, and $0.000018. A breach below these could lead to a further dip in price, potentially targeting the $0.000018 mark in a more extensive bearish scenario.From a technical standpoint, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 41, indicating a slight bearish bias but not fully oversold, suggesting potential for either movement depending on market inputs.The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.000023 also hints at bearish sentiment, as the current price hovers below this indicator.Shiba Inu Price PredictionShould Shiba Inu’s price sustain below its pivot of $0.000024, it could confirm the bearish outlook. However, any upward movement past this pivot could invite a reversal to bullish conditions. This intricate balance between bearish and bullish signals offers traders a complex landscape to navigate.In conclusion, traders should monitor these levels closely, as a break above $0.000024 could signal a shift towards bullish tendencies, while continued trading below could further cement its current bearish path.Last Chance to Buy Dogeverse Before Launch: Over $15M Raised

Are Altcoins Set for the Moon? Analysts Watch These 3 Key Indicators - Coin Edition


							

Analysts anticipate explosive altcoin rallies, citing the market’s current disbelief stage.
Key indicators watched include the 20-day EMA, Stochastic RSI, and Bitcoin dominance.
Altcoin cap holds above $250B despite a recent 17% drop, signaling a potential upside.




The altcoin market, often overshadowed by the behemoth Bitcoin, might be on the cusp of a significant rally, according to multiple market watchers. These experts closely monitor technical indicators that could signal an impending surge in the value of alternative cryptocurrencies.



In a recent post on X, widely followed crypto analyst Milkybull suggested that the altcoin market is currently in the “disbelief stage.” This phase is characterized by investor skepticism despite positive market trends. 



Historically, this stage has been a precursor to a robust rally, the analyst observed. Milkybull pointed out instances in the 2016 and 2020 cycles where such occurrences were followed by explosive gains for altcoins.







According to TradingView, the total valuation of altcoins has declined 17.55% over the past 30 days to $264.9 billion. Notably, this valuation excludes the market cap of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. 



Despite this downturn, the market cap has managed to stay above the critical $250 billion support level. In parallel, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital asserted that the market is “positioning itself for a future move to the upside.”



The three indicators under scrutiny by prominent traders include the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), the Stochastic RSI, and Bitcoin dominance. The EMA provides a weighted average price over the last 20 days. 



Titan of Crypto, another pseudonymous trader, highlighted that a bullish crossover on the Stochastic RSI, combined with a retest of the EMA20, could signal the start of rally time.



Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance stands at 54.7%, having decreased by 0.56% over the past week. According to technical analyst Yoddha, a further decline in Bitcoin dominance could trigger the beginning of an altcoin season, a period where altcoins outperform Bitcoin.

Gas Gone Cheap! Ethereum Fees Plunge 93% To Rock Bottom Prices


								Ethereum users are rejoicing over a dramatic drop in gas fees, with the network experiencing its lowest point since early 2020. This translates into significantly cheaper transactions, making the platform more accessible for everyday users and developers. However, experts caution that this fee fiesta might be temporary, raising questions about the long-term health of the network.

Ethereum Gas Prices Hit Rock Bottom
Data from from BitInfoCharts shows intraday gas fees dropping 93% from the peak of $30 just six months ago. This translates to a significant cost reduction for various activities on the Ethereum blockchain. Simple asset swaps now cost around $5, while minting NFTs has become a much more affordable endeavor at roughly $9.
This newfound affordability is attributed to a confluence of factors. The recent Cancun-Deneb upgrade is believed to have played a role in optimizing network efficiency. Additionally, a general downturn in network activity coincides with a calmer period in the broader cryptocurrency market.

A Boon For Users, But A Challenge For Miners
While users are celebrating the lower fees, concerns linger about the long-term sustainability of this trend. The near-zero “blob fee” suggests a lack of demand for block space, raising the specter of future congestion and fee spikes. Additionally, lower fees could negatively impact the profitability of miners who secure the Ethereum network.
According to analysts, this situation is a double-edged sword. While lower fees are great for users, they could make it more economical for large players to dominate block space, hindering decentralization.

The Quest For Scalability: Enter Multi-Dimensional Gas
The recent gas fee developments highlight the ongoing struggle to optimize Ethereum’s scalability and affordability. In response to these challenges, Vitalik Buterin, the platform’s founder, has proposed a significant upgrade introducing the concept of “multi-dimensional gas.”

This upgrade aims to provide Ethereum with greater flexibility in managing various resources. By taking a more nuanced approach to resource allocation, the network could potentially improve transaction throughput without compromising security.
A Look Ahead: Will Ethereum Maintain Its Momentum?
The dramatic drop in gas fees serves as a welcome respite for Ethereum users. However, the long-term viability of these low fees remains uncertain. The network’s ability to handle future surges in demand and maintain a healthy balance between user experience, miner profitability, and decentralization will be crucial for its continued success.
The proposed multi-dimensional gas mechanism embodies the ongoing efforts to address these challenges. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, its ability to adapt and innovate will determine its position in the ever-changing landscape of blockchain technology.

Hong Kong Police In Search of Four After Crypto Investor Abduction: Report


																The Hong Kong police force is in search of four men who abducted a crypto investor on Tuesday at Tai Lau Leng Village off Po Shek Wu Road in Sheung Shui district.
According to a report by the South China Morning Post, the suspects stopped the 55-year-old woman while she rode in a car with her husband and attacked him with a stun gun when he tried to prevent them from taking her.
Four Abduct Crypto Investor
The unidentified woman was freed around 9:45 pm, roughly an hour after she was taken away in a seven-seater vehicle. She works as a crypto investor, while her 43-year-old spouse owns an information technology firm.
People familiar with the matter said the attack was tied to a HK$15 million (U.S.$1.9 million) crypto investment dispute in which the victim was involved.
Police officers eventually got to the incident scene after receiving a report from the victim’s husband. When the woman was released in Ta Kwu Ling, about 4.3 miles from the crime scene, she went to seek help at the nearest police station.




Further investigation revealed that the captors were between the ages of 30 and 50, and the woman did not know them. She incurred minor arm and leg injuries while her husband sustained wounds on his head, neck, and limbs.
While the police treat the case as unlawful detention and assault, the couple has been sent to a hospital for treatment. The force has made no arrests so far, and the case was the second abduction the city witnessed within 32 hours.
Hong Kong Sees Rise in Crypto Crimes
Hong Kong is currently experiencing a surge in crypto crimes, mostly from financial disputes over digital asset investments.
Last month, CryptoPotato reported that the Hong Kong police force rescued a 19-year-old who had fallen victim to a harrowing ordeal, apprehending three teenagers who were responsible for the assault and unlawful detention.
The victim was subjected to threats and brutal assault with baseball bats over a dispute regarding $23,000 in crypto trading profits. There are nine suspects, but only three were arrested at the crime scene. The police are still in search of the remaining six, comprising four males and two females.

A recent tweet by Elon Musk has garnered significant attention from the Bitcoin (BTC), XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) communities. In his characteristic style, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made a tweet on X prompting speculation and interpretation among his followers.The tweet, which offered a perspective on the workings of the Federal Reserve, has sparked a reaction from the crypto community. In a compelling tweet, Musk drew an analogy between the United States Federal Reserve and the popular board game Monopoly.Musk compared the Federal Reserve's ability to create money to the Monopoly game's rule that allows the bank to never go bankrupt, implying that, like the game, the Fed can always print more money. This metaphor emphasizes concerns about the Fed's quantitative easing (QE) program and its impact on inflation and currency value. In the aftermath of Musk's X post, cryptocurrency communities like Bitcoin, XRP and Dogecoin responded in a variety of ways, offering their perspectives.In response to Musk's post, financial analyst Michaël van de Poppe advocates Bitcoin, silver and gold, predicting that QE might be reintroduced.Some members of the Bitcoin community interpreted Musk's post on how the Federal Reserve works as a recognition of the need for sound monetary policies and the potential benefits of a deflationary digital asset like Bitcoin. "Bitcoin fixes this," they said. This belief stems from the idea that Bitcoin is sound money due to its supply cap and predictable issuance schedule.Some Dogecoin community members replied, including co-founder Billy Markus, also known as "Shibetoshi Nakamoto" on X. Prominent Dogecoin community member "Sir Doge of the coin" also noted, "Dogecoin fixes this."XRP influencer "XRP crypto wolf" said, "Save yourself with XRP and crypto."

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionIn the latest Bitcoin price prediction, the flagship cryptocurrency hovers around $61,154, reflecting a slight 0.60% increase within 24 hours. With a robust trading volume exceeding $13 billion and a market cap nearing $1.2 trillion, Bitcoin demonstrates resilience as bulls strive to maintain the $61,000 support level.Bitcoin Price Prediction
At present, Bitcoin‘s price action revolves around a pivotal point set at $60,975, suggesting a bearish Bitcoin price prediction as long as BTC hold below this level.If the price can sustain itself above this level, it might challenge immediate resistances placed at $63,400, $65,050, and potentially $67,160. If convincingly breached, these resistance levels are critical markers that could lead to further bullish momentum.Conversely, Bitcoin’s support levels are $59,075, $56,640, and $54,400. A dip below these could signal a bearish downturn, intensifying selling pressures and potentially leading to more significant price drops.The technical indicators offer a mixed view. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 45, which lies in neutral territory, hinting at an equilibrium between buying and selling pressures.However, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,875, which is slightly above today’s price, suggests a bearish undertone. This indicates that Bitcoin might struggle to maintain upward momentum unless it can consistently close above this moving average.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewIn summary, while there’s potential for an upside if Bitcoin can overcome key resistance levels, the price’s proximity to the 50 EMA and the neutral RSI pose challenges.Traders should watch for whether Bitcoin can maintain support above the pivotal $60,975 or if it will succumb to bearish pressures, potentially revisiting lower support levels.Mega Dice Presale Nears Completion with $913K Raised: Last Chance Before Price Increase
The Mega Dice presale is close to achieving its target, having successfully raised $913,229 with over 13.23 million $DICE tokens sold out of an available 14.7 million. This surge in investment underscores the growing interest in crypto-integrated iGaming platforms within the Web3 space, where Mega Dice is making significant strides.Layer 2 solutions, while primarily enhancing Ethereum’s scalability, reflect the market’s fluctuations. However, as Ethereum maintains a dominant 63.42% market share with $54.3 billion in total value locked, its performance directly influences Layer 2 outcomes.In the burgeoning sector of GambleFi, Mega Dice stands out by leveraging its native $DICE token to revolutionize the online gaming experience. Players use $DICE for gameplay, reaping benefits such as entry into exclusive competitions and access to a loyalty program that promises generous rewards and VIP experiences.Additionally, Mega Dice has announced a buyback and burn strategy to maintain the token’s scarcity and bolster its market value. With the presale drawing to a close and the next price stage imminent, now is a pivotal moment for potential investors.Stay updated with the latest from Mega Dice on platforms like X/Twitter and Telegram, and consider joining the presale before the price increases to $0.069 per $DICE token.

US House Financial Committee Criticize SEC's Crypto Approach


The US House Financial Committee has aligned with billionaire Mark Cuban’s critique of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach to the crypto industry.
In a May 11 social media post, the Committee explained why Congress must pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act.
US House Committee Believes FIT21 Act Will Solve Crypto Regulatory Issues
This weekend, Cubans took to social media to express concerns about how the SEC’s stance against cryptocurrencies might affect President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. Cuban continued his criticism of the financial regulator in a May 11 social media post, saying the commission and its chair, Gary Gensler, were “trying to destroy the crypto industry.”

“The crypto industry wants a way to register and comply. It wants a way to keep the speculative noise out. Instead the SEC makes it so expensive, time consuming and difficult for those who want to comply, that the junk tokens are side by side with real companies and investors have no way to know what is garbage and what is real,” Cuban added.

In response, the US House Financial Committee acknowledged Cuban’s concerns, noting that the SEC’s current approach hampers the industry’s ability to comply. So, the Committee is pushing the FIT21 Act to address these regulatory gaps. 
The committee believes the legislation would provide much-needed clarity and consumer protections. The law would also end the SEC’s regulation by enforcement approach and enable the US digital asset ecosystem to flourish.

Furthermore, the forthcoming legislation aims to clearly define the responsibilities of both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC. Under the proposed legislation, the CFTC will extend its oversight to encompass crypto commodities, while the SEC’s regulatory domain will be clarified concerning cryptocurrencies offered as investment contracts.

“The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act is the culmination of years of bipartisan efforts to finally provide clarity…This legislation will cement American leadership of the global financial system for decades to come and bolster our role as an international hub for innovation,” said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry.

Notably, efforts to advance the FIT21 Act have been ongoing since its committee approval in July 2023, with a push for a floor vote expected in the coming weeks. Interestingly, the bill has garnered support from major crypto stakeholders. Bitcoin ETF issuer Grayscale said the proposed law “is a welcome effort to achieve regulatory clarity for the crypto ecosystem.”

Similarly, Matt Corva, the General Counsel at Consensys, said that the regulation would help clear the regulatory messes created by federal agencies.

“Regulation could be timely to clean up the mess created by agencies outside their authority and the APA who have been left unchecked for too long. It won’t be [without] compromise, but sensible regulation will move the ball forward for market participants, innovators, and consumers,” Corva remarked.

This Week on Crypto Twitter: Fantasy Top Tops the Charts, Trump Courts Crypto - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for DecryptThis week, a gamified competition among Crypto Twitter influencers generated a frenzy of posts and millions in profits while major public figures like Tom Brady and Donald Trump waded back into crypto waters. Fantasy Top—an Ethereum NFT game that pits social media fan bases against each other in a fantasy football-like competition—made waves this week as tribes of Crypto Twitter users furiously commented and reposted to support their chosen influencers. The game paid out $1.25 million to creators this week, plus potentially millions more in Blast Gold, as a cut of the game’s success. As the first round of the game concluded this week, influencers took victory laps alongside their followers; several accounts shared their bounties with the fans who pushed them over the top.  While most of the buzz surrounding Fantasy Top was positive, given its incredible profitability, others were more skeptical given the long history of “SocialFi” projects with no apparent use case other than generating speculative interest, which typically collapse after stalling.Meanwhile, in the real world, Tom Brady caught some rough jokes at his Netflix roast earlier this week over his current commitment to crypto and former ties to the failed FTX exchange. Many crypto users still welcomed the brief mainstream moment in the spotlight as a sign that crypto can still climb higher.The biggest mainstream news to impact crypto came on Wednesday, however, when former president Donald Trump hosted a dinner party for holders of his NFTs at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. At the gathering, Trump declared his intent to embrace crypto in the United States if re-elected, sending many crypto users into a frenzy. At the same event, another NFT holder asked Trump about BODEN, a meme coin mocking President Joe Biden. Simply by making a quip about it—saying he didn’t think the coin sounded like a good investment—BODEN surged the following day.Remarkably, users of the crypto betting site Polymarket had already waged nearly $100,000 on whether Trump would reference the coin by July. But read the fine print: Trump had to say the word ‘Boden,’ which he failed to. So close, yet so far. For all the frivolity, Trump's event was a stark contrast to Pres. Joe Biden backing the SEC at the start of the week, and many commentators saw a serious election wedge issue developing. “Crypto voters will be heard this election,” former TIME and Bloomberg tech journalist and MoonPay exec Keith Grossman tweeted. “What is really needed is not division but rather a clear regulatory framework that is NOT politicized.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Crypto wallet adds pay-per-use access to premium subscription AIs


The popular crypto wallet, Cake Wallet, has added support to a pay-per-use artificial intelligence (AI) platform that allows access to premium APIs like ChatGPT-4, Dall-E 3, Claude 3 Opus, and more. Finbold exclusively talked to the companies’ founders about using cryptocurrencies for payments in their services.
Vik Sharma, founder of Cake Wallet, announced the implementation of NanoGPT in a post on X on May 12. The AI application is available on Cake’s Marketplace, below the Cake Pay service for pre-paid gift cards.

Now, Cake Wallet users can pay-per-use premium AI chatbots directly from their cryptocurrency self-custody address with Nano (XNO). Moreover, it is possible to swap other supported cryptocurrencies in-app, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Monero (XMR), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Polygon-based USDT, USDC, and others.



“AI chatbots have become very popular and, in Cake Wallet, we believe cryptocurrencies like the ones supported by the app can be a great way to open up access for them [AI chatbots], more efficiently and privately – as we are fully committed to these attributes as a company. Also, nano is perfect for this micropayment use case due to having zero fees.”
– Vik Sharma, for Finbold

What is NanoGPT?
NanoGPT is a cryptocurrency service connected to multiple artificial intelligence APIs bridging crypto payments to a pay-per-use model. This allows users to avoid keeping numerous premium subscriptions to access different AIs according to their specific needs.

Notably, Finbold reported about the tool when it was first launched as a simple Telegram bot that supported only ChatGPT-4. Thus, we again talked to NanoGPT’s founder, Mira Hurley, about the recent partnership with Cake Wallet.

“NanoGPT has improved a lot since it was a simple Telegram bot. We’ve moved from a single model to users being able to select from a range of text and image models; you can continue any old conversation at any time; users can now track their usage to see to what extent our service is cheaper than subscription; we’ve added support via discord, email, and Twitter; and have added just a ton of quality of life improvements.”
– Mira Hurley, for Finbold

As of this writing, Hurley was giving away small amounts of XNO for new Cake Wallet users to try the tool for free.

Subscriptions vs. pay-per-use services using crypto wallets
Interestingly, pay-per-use services are increasingly becoming preferred alternatives to the popular subscription models broadly used by many industries. This model looks at feeless and instant crypto payments as a natural way to make it possible.
In particular, access to premium AIs like ChatGPT-4, Dall-E 3, Claude 3 Opus, and others has earned the attention of developers and companies like Cake Wallet, NanoGPT, and PayPerQ. The latter offers a similar pay-per-use service while taking Bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network, as reported by Finbold in April.
Should users start preferring this new model, companies will need to adjust their offerings and payment options to adapt. However, it is still soon to tell where the pay-per-use concept will lead the AI industry and if crypto payments will be part of that change.

Funding Wrap: Arbelos raises $28M for derivatives-focused exchange - Blockworks


Crypto’s love affair with derivatives drags on. 
In the week’s largest funding round, Arbelos Markets raised $28 million for a principal trading firm specializing in crypto derivatives. Dragonfly led the seed round, which also drew participation from FalconX, Circle Ventures, Paxos and Deribit, among others.
Derivatives are financial contracts that base their value on an underlying asset. Put and call options are examples, as are futures contracts. DeFi pioneered the concept of perpetual futures, a crypto-native innovation that lets futures contracts be traded without an expiration date. Huge leverage, huge risk. 
But Arbelos is less degen and more institutional. In a press release, co-founder and CEO Joshua Lim called it a “smart principal risk-taker with a strong balance sheet and a flexible product.” Former FTX.US CEO Brett Harrison is building a product in a similar vein.

But Arbelos is not a brokerage. It’s a firm that provides liquidity and infrastructure for the trading of assets including derivatives. The firm will use the fresh funds to “improve its quant trading infrastructure, hire top talent, and expand its access to new markets and its range of products,” Arbelos said in a press release.
Arbelos seems to be pitching itself as more trustworthy and grown-up in contrast to the crypto firms that played fast and loose with risk controls and blew up the market in 2022. 
“Post the collapses of last cycle, Arbelos is rebuilding the DNA of the modern primary dealer, and in the process they’re returning trust & transparency to the space at large,” Dragonfly’s Omar Kanji wrote on X.
Founders Fund backs zero-knowledge proof startup
Peter Thiel-backed Founders Fund led a $13.2 million round in Lagrange. Archetype Ventures, 1kx, Maven11, Fenbushi Capital, Volt Capital, CMT Digital and Mantle Ecosystem Fund also contributed.
Lagrange says it’s building a “hyper-parallel ZK coprocessor.” In plainer terms, Lagrange is trying to apply privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs in a way that can handle tons of data — as blockchains tend to do. 
Lagrange has launched zk light clients for Ethereum rollups as an actively validated service on EigenLayer. 
Other notable funding news

AgriDEX, a platform for the tokenization of agricultural commodities, disclosed a $5 million raise. 
Blockchain data access protocol Lava Network announced a strategic $11 million raise. 
Solana-based game developer Seeds Labs raised $12 million.

Hacker returns $71 million worth of crypto to phishing victim


A whale lost 1,155 Wrapped BTC (WBTC), worth $71 million, due to a phishing attack on May 3. Surprisingly, the attacker returned all the funds to the victim a week later.
On May 2, the whale spent $29.6 million DAI to buy 502 WBTC at $58,951. Later, on May 4, the victim created a new address and transferred 0.05 ETH for testing—a usual practice when moving large amounts.
As reported by Finbold, the attacker generated phishing addresses in advance and monitored users’ on-chain activities. When the victim whale was about to transfer WBTC, the attacker sent 0 ETH using a phishing address.

A specific phishing: Address poisoning attack
Interestingly, this attack used a technique known as “Address Poisoning,” as it poisons the victim’s transaction history. The phishing address had the same starting and ending letters as the whale’s new address.
This attack is particularly hard to spot because many crypto wallets hide the middle part of the address with “…” to improve the user interface. Moreover, users often copy addresses from transaction histories and only check the starting and ending letters.
Therefore, the whale mistakenly copied the phishing address and sent 1,155 WBTC to the attacker.
Attacker returns stolen $71 million to phishing victim
On-chain data shows that the attacker immediately converted the stolen WBTC into 22,960 ETH, possibly for money laundering purposes. Lookonchain reported the entire development of these events and summarized it in a post on X on May 12.
Attacker’s swap history. Source: Etherscan / Lookonchain
Notably, the whale tried to contact the attacker, offering a 10% bounty for returning 90% of the funds. Initially, the attacker did not respond, but as the cybersecurity company Slow Mist tracked the attacker’s IPs, possibly from Hong Kong, the attacker replied and returned all the funds.
To prevent such attacks, users should carefully check the entire address when making transfers. Saving trusted addresses in the address book and copying from there is recommended. Enabling small transaction filtering in wallets can also help filter out phishing transactions, further preserving the funds.

How To AI: Fine Tune Your Chatbot Privacy Settings - Decrypt

It may be easy, even comforting, to imagine that using AI tools involves interacting with a purely objective, stoic, independent machine that knows nothing about you. But between cookies, device identifiers, login and account requirements, and even the occasional human reviewer, the voracious appetite online services have for your data seems insatiable.Privacy is a major concern that both consumers and governments have about the pervasive spread of AI. Across the board, platforms highlight their privacy features—even if they're hard to find. (Paid and business plans often exclude training on submitted data entirely.) But any time a chatbot “remembers” something can still feel intrusive.In this article, we will explain how to tighten your AI privacy settings by deleting your previous chats and conversations and by turning off settings in ChatGPT, Gemini (formerly Bard), Claude, Copilot, and Meta AI that allow developers to train their systems on your data. These instructions are for the desktop, browser-based interface for each.ChatGPTStill the flagship of the generative AI movement, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has several features to improve privacy and alleviate concerns about user prompts being used to train the chatbot.In April, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT could be used without an account. By default, prompts shared through the free, account-less version are not saved. But, if a user does not want their chats used to train ChatGPT, they still need to toggle the “Temporary chat” settings in the ChatGPT dropdown menu at the top left of the screen.If you have an account and subscription to ChatGPT Plus, however, how do you keep your prompts from being used? GPT-4 gives users the ability to delete all chats under its general settings. Again, to make sure chats are also not used to train the AI model, look lower to “Data controls” and click the arrow to the right of “Improve the model for everyone.”A separate “Model improvement” section  will appear, allowing you to toggle it off and select "Done." This will remove the ability of OpenAI to use your chats to train ChatGPT.There are still caveats, however."While history is disabled, new conversations won’t be used to train and improve our models, and won’t appear in the history sidebar," an OpenAI spokesperson told Decrypt. "To monitor for abuse—and reviewed only when we need to—we will retain all conversations for 30 days before permanently deleting."Claude“We do not train our models on user-submitted data by default,” an Anthropic spokesperson told Decrypt. “Thus far, we have not used any customer or user-submitted data to train our generative models, and we’ve expressly stated so in the model card for our Claude 3 model family,”“We may use user prompts and outputs to train Claude where the user gives us express permission to do so, such as clicking a thumbs up or down signal, on a specific Claude output to provide us feedback,” the company added, noting that it helps the AI model “learn the patterns and connections between words.”Deleting archived chats in Claude will also keep them out of reach. “I do not retain or have access to any previously deleted chats or conversations,” the Claude AI agent helpfully answers in the first person. ”My responses are generated based on the current conversation only.”Like ChatGPT, Claude does hold on to some information as required by law.“We also retain data in our backend systems for the amount of time specified in our Privacy Policy unless required to enforce our Acceptable Use Policy, address Terms of Service or policy violations, or as required by law,” Anthropic explains.As for Claude's collection of information across the web, an Anthropic spokesperson told Decrypt that the AI developer’s web crawler respects industry-standard technical signals like robots.txt that site owners can use to opt-out of data collection, and that Anthropic does not access password-protected pages or bypass CAPTCHA controls.GeminiBy default, Google tells Gemini users that “your conversations are processed by human reviewers to improve the technologies powering Gemini Apps. Don't enter anything that you wouldn't want to be reviewed or used."But Gemini AI users can delete their chatbot history and opt out of having their data used to train its model going forward.To accomplish both, navigate to the bottom left of the Gemini homepage and locate “Activity.”Once on the activity screen, users can then turn off “Gemini Apps Activity.”A Google representative explained to Decrypt what the “Gemini Apps Activity” setting does.“If you turn it off, your future conversations won’t be used to improve our generative machine-learning models by default,” the company representative said. “In this instance, your conversations will be saved for up to 72 hours to allow us to provide the service and process any feedback you may choose to provide. In those 72 hours, unless a user chooses to give feedback in Gemini Apps, it won’t be used to improve Google’s products, including our machine learning technology.”There is also a separate setting to clear out your Google-connected YouTube history.CopilotIn September, Microsoft added its Copilot generative AI model to its Microsoft 365 suite of business tools, its Microsoft Edge browser, and Bing search engine. Microsoft also included a preview version of the chatbot in Windows 11. In December, Copilot was added to the Android and Apple app stores.Microsoft does not provide the option to opt out of having user data used to train its AI models, but like Google Gemini, Copilot users can delete their history. The process is not as intuitive on Copilot, however, as previous chats still show on the desktop version’s home screen even after being deleted.To find the option to delete Copilot history, open your user profile at the top right of your screen (you must be signed in) and select “My Microsoft Account.” On the left, select “Privacy,” and scroll down to the bottom of the screen to find the Copilot section.Because Copilot is integrated into Bing’s search engine, clearing activity will also clear search history, Microsoft said.A Microsoft spokesperson told Decrypt that the tech giant protects consumers’ data through various techniques, including encryption, deidentification, and only storing and retaining information associated with the user for as long as is necessary.“A portion of the total number of user prompts in Copilot and Copilot Pro responses are used to fine-tune the experience,” the spokesperson added. “Microsoft takes steps to de-identify data before it is used, helping to protect consumer identity,” adding that Microsoft does not use any content created in Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams) to train underlying “foundational models.”Meta AIIn April, Meta—the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp—rolled out Meta AI to users.“We are releasing the new version of Meta AI, our assistant, that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses,” Zuckerberg said in an Instagram video. “Our goal is to build the world's leading AI and make it available to everyone.”Meta AI does not provide users the option to opt out of having their inputs used to train the AI model. Meta does give the option to delete past chats with its AI agent.To do so from a desktop computer, click the Facebook settings tab at the bottom left of your screen, located above your Facebook profile image. Once in settings, users have the option to delete conversations with Meta AI.Meta does explain that deleting conversations here will not delete chats with other people in Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on whether or how users could exclude their information from being used in Meta AI model training, instead pointing Decrypt to a September statement by the company about its privacy safeguards and the Meta settings page on deleting history.“Publicly shared posts from Instagram and Facebook—including photos and text—were part of the data used to train the generative AI models,” the company explains. “We didn’t train these models using people’s private posts. We also do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs.”But anything you send to Meta AI will be used for model training—and beyond.“We use the information people share when interacting with our generative AI features, such as Meta AI or businesses who use generative AI, to improve our products and for other purposes,” Meta adds.ConclusionOf the major AI models we included above, OpenAI’s ChatGPT provided the easiest way to delete history and opt-out of having chatbot prompts used to train its AI model. Meta's privacy practices appear to be the most opaque.Many of these companies also provide mobile versions of their powerful apps, which provide similar controls. The individual steps may be different—and privacy and history settings may function differently across platforms.Unfortunately, even cranking all privacy settings to their tightest levels may not be enough to safeguard your information, according to Venice AI founder and CEO Erik Voorhees, who told Decrypt that it would be naive to assume your data has been erased.“Once a company has your information, you can never trust it’s gone, ever,” he said. “People should assume that everything they write to OpenAI is going to them and that they have it forever.”“The only way to resolve that is by using a service where the information does not go to a central repository at all in the first place,” Voorhees added—a service like his own.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

Solana Price Prediction - Could Solana Regain Bullish Momentum And Push To $200?


								Solana has seen its price struggling to return to bullish levels for the past month. Solana previously reached $208 on March 18 after a strong price uptick spanning over five months. However, this cross over $200 was very brief as Solana dipped to $167 before reversing and reaching $203 again on April 1. 

Again, this cross over $200 was also brief and Solana has been on a downfall since then. Interestingly, the recent price level has put Solana on a 30% correction in the past six weeks. While this is a hard crash, Solana is now looking prime to resume its uptrend, with indicators now flashing bullish.
Solana To Regain Bullish Momentum?
Solana’s parabolic price rise from October 2023 to April 2024 led to an overheated market that was bound to correct. This rise was mostly exacerbated by the surge in popularity of Solana meme coins and the general bullish crypto market greed spearheaded by Bitcoin. 
This uptick saw Solana briefly overtaking BNB in market cap rankings after fully displacing XRP and ADA. However, as the greed flipped to caution, Solana started to correct with the rest of the market.
Solana dipped to a low of $120 on May 1 with the bulls defending this price support. According to a crypto analyst known pseudonymously as Inmortal, this was the last major price correction for Solana in the current market cycle. 
As a result, Solana now finds itself ranging around a minor support at $140. Per a SOL chart shared by Inmortal on social media, the crypto is now ready to march to a fresh all-time high of $320.


Inmortal is not the only analyst predicting a bullish Solana move. Analysts Maximilian FX and Orson Fawley also believe Solana is ready to beat the $200 price mark again.

Solana is currently trading at $145. Chart: TradingView
Price Levels To Watch For Solana’s Next Move
At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $145, down over 30% from its yearly high of $208. After such a sharp drop Solana has created some key price levels to watch during its next big move. The first notable price resistance is at $158. 
If Solana can break back above $160, it may signal the correction is over and the uptrend has resumed. Other resistance levels on the journey to $200 are around $175 and $185. On the other hand, a drop below $140 risks a move toward the next major support level at $120. 

Although the overall crypto market sentiment is currently neutral, the environment remains favorable for a SOL price recovery.

Can Ethereum bulls take bears out of the market? - AMBCrypto



The positive reading of the bulls and bears indicator suggests that the price might increase.
Ethereum’s network was overvalued and could hinder the potential upswing.

The price of Ethereum [ETH] might have decreased by 7.30% in the last 24 hours, but an assessment of a key indicator suggested that the decline might soon end.
The indicator talked about here is the Bulls And Bears metric provided by IntoTheBlock. This indicator can be measured in addresses or volume.
However, the focus is usually on large buyers or sellers, as they have a big influence on price movements.
The 1% want to keep the faith
A net negative of the Bulls and Bears indicator suggests more large sell orders than buys. In this instance, the price of the asset involved might decrease.
But for Ethereum, data showed that the reading was positive, indicating bullish confidence in the price trend. Should this metric maintain its position over the coming days, then ETH might be able to rise toward $3,100.
Source: IntoTheBlock
However, failure to sustain the status quo or improve on it could send the price of the altcoin below $2,800. When AMBCrypto looked at Ethereum’s STH-NUPL, we observed that market participants were not exactly confident in the cryptocurrency.
STH-NUPL stands for Short Term Holder — Net Unrealized Profit/Loss. With this metric, one can have an idea of the behavior of short-term investors.
Investors panic, but ETH may come to their aid
From our analysis, ETH’s underwhelming price action has changed the sentiment investors have toward the coin. In March, the metric was in the optimism (yellow) region.
At that point, holders were confident in ETH’s price action. But as of this writing, that reading has reached the capitulation (red) region, indicating that market participants are in fear.
Source: Glassnode
However, fear can act as fuel for a bounce. If the STH-NUPL continues to fall, ETH’s price might also decrease.
Moving, on, a turnaround might occur as intense fear could trigger a harder upswing if buying pressure increases.
In this instance, Ethereum might target a rise toward $3,500. Besides this metric, AMBCrypto found another indicator suggesting that ETH might soon recover.
This time, we looked to the dormant circulation. According to on-chain data from Santiment, the 90-day dormant circulation had dropped to 9246.
If the metric increases, it means that coins that have not moved for a long while are starting to change wallets. Sometimes, this means old hands are selling.
Source: Santiment
Thus, the recent decline implied that long-term Ethereum investors were not selling as much as they did around the 7th and 8th of May.

Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25

However, the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio suggested that ETH might still be overvalued. Low values of the NVT suggest undervalued.
But for Ethereum, the metric spiked, indicating that the network is overvalued relative to transactions.

Bitcoin or Ethereum? We asked ChatGPT which asset is a better buy for summer 2024


As summer 2024 approaches, the debate intensifies between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), two major players in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital gold, offering stability in times of economic uncertainty.
This perception is supported by its reduced volatility post-halving, now lower than that of many S&P 500 companies, according to Fidelity.
Ethereum continues to push the envelope with technological innovations like the recent Dencun upgrade, which aims to cut fees and enhance scalability. However, these changes have brought back inflationary aspects, moving away from the deflationary trend set by the 2022 Merge.


This has led to heightened volatility, with Ethereum’s implied volatility remaining significantly higher than Bitcoin’s despite the overall market calming.
With their divergent roles in investment portfolios—Bitcoin as a burgeoning digital asset and Ethereum as a technological pioneer—Finbold sought insights from ChatGPT, OpenAI’s advanced AI model, to determine which might excel in the coming months.
This analysis highlights the need to evaluate Bitcoin’s appeal as a growing store of value against Ethereum’s progressive platform in a rapidly changing market landscape.
ChatGPT’s analysis: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum investment prospects
According to ChatGPT, the decision largely depends on individual investment strategies and risk tolerance. Bitcoin is generally better suited for investors seeking stability and a relatively safe store of value, akin to digital gold, especially amidst economic uncertainties. It appeals to risk-averse individuals or those new to cryptocurrencies.

Conversely, Ethereum fuels a platform for decentralized applications and is a major player in blockchain technology. Investors who believe in the future of these technologies may prefer Ethereum.

While Bitcoin offers stability and potential for incremental growth, Ethereum provides a gateway to a rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem with higher risk and potentially higher rewards.
Ultimately, diversification with both BTC and ETH can be a way to manage risk and potentially benefit from the growth of both major cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin and ETH recent price performance

As of 2024, the year-to-date performance of Bitcoin and ETH presents a clear contrast in investment returns. Bitcoin has seen a significant rise, with a YTD increase of 45.16%, showcasing its volatile yet high-growth nature. The current price of Bitcoin stands at approximately $61,200.
On the other hand, ETH has gained 28% YTD, with its current price at about $2,921.
The choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum should align with individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and interest in the technological aspects of cryptocurrencies. 
While Bitcoin offers stability and potential for incremental growth, Ethereum provides a gateway to a rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem with higher risk and potentially higher rewards.

Wall Street Giants Unveil Crypto Plans To Boost Institutional Adoption - Coin Edition


							

Renowned financial institutions set to test novel blockchain-based regulated settlement network.
Identified institutions for the test include JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Visa, and Mastercard.
Polygon’s Colin Butler considers the developing trend a signal for mass crypto adoption.




Renowned financial institutions, including JPMorgan, Citi, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo, are among the organizations that will test an upcoming regulated settlement network involving the common settlement of tokenized assets on shared-ledger technology. According to reports, payment giants Visa and Mastercard and global financial messaging service Swift will also participate in the testing process.









The innovation comes amid growing concerns over the struggles of the U.S. dollar, the universal settlement currency. In a recent report, the billionaire Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, warned that the greenback could collapse. Hence, efforts by the identified Wall Street giants to explore asset tokenization, an idea that Citi analysts predict could become a $5 trillion market by 2030.







Colin Butler, global head of institutional capital at Polygon, considers the developing trend a signal for mass crypto adoption. Butler described it as the five-yard-line for mass institutional adoption. He noted that adding the latest test is “incrementally more important” than earlier trials like JPMorgan’s onyx private blockchain and unified ledger, a concept introduced by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) last year.









Rendering his opinion on the ongoing development, Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president for blockchain and crypto at Mastercard, highlighted the importance of significant partnerships in blockchain exploration. According to him, it will be critical for public and private organizations to partner closely to explore how to apply blockchain solutions to solve real-world pain points and improve efficiencies.



Dhamodharan’s comment supports the statement by Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive, who described asset tokenization as “the next generation for markets.” Fink’s statement aligns with his company’s recent announcement that it has entered the second stage in its plan for a crypto-based revolution in financial markets. BlackRock noted the revolution would involve launching a tokenized private equity fund.

Religious leaders debate going to church in the metaverse

When the first radio and television broadcasts began to trickle into homes around the world, religious programming was among the early mainstays of both new mediums. Now, as the world pivots away from flat, 2D screens and frequency-bound audio broadcasts, religious practitioners from around the globe have begun adopting metaverse, Web3, spatial computing, and artificial intelligence technologies as conduits to faith. However, there are still naysayers who believe there are dangers associated with these technologies, faith leaders who wonder if modern technological trappings are necessary, and billions of traditional religious followers awaiting guidance. On the supporting side, Sreevas Sahasranamam a Professor at the University of Glasgow, recently expounded on the positive potential for a metaverse for practitioners of the Hindu faith in Swarajya magazine:“Imagine getting Geetopadesha straight from Lord Krishna. No, I am not talking about being on a Sci-Fi time machine to take me back in time to the Kurukshetra war. Rather, I am talking about being in my living room, donning the role of Arjuna, seeking answers to my internal battles through Geetopadesha from Lord Krishna's avatar on a Ray-Ban Meta glass.”Many see the immersive qualities of the metaverse, especially when experienced through virtual reality, as a method to bring them closer to the scriptures and stories surrounding their religions. Sahasranamam also wrote about using the metaverse as a meditation aid, saying that the immersion it offered could lead to deeper and more meaningful experiences. Not everyone is as pumped about the potential for the metaverse as a religious tool. Gavin Ortlund and Jay Kim, theologians and Christian pastors from the United States, see it as something that could add to the current fellowship paradigm, but both men appeared to agree that it wasn’t a replacement for physical churches. The two discussed the issue in a recent video. During the talk, Kim wondered aloud if the idea of “church in the metaverse” was an oxymoron. The duo’s main objection appears to be the digital/virtual nature of the metaverse. Per Ortlund:“So, baptism and the Lord’s Supper, and those are physical acts, a church is irreducibly physical, you know, you need physical bodies for church because you have to have people there to get into the water or to eat the bread and wine. And so that’s just one example of where something gets lost if you’re moving away from face to face, bodily contact.”In Rome, the Catholic church takes a different view altogether. It embraces some metaverse tech, having dabbled in Web3, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and metaverse for the past couple of years, but Pope Francis, its current leader, isn’t a fan of all future-facing technologies. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the Pope had some choice words concerning the onset of the artificial intelligence era:“There is the substantial risk of disproportionate benefit for the few at the price of the impoverishment of many.”His ultimate prescription is to advocate for the development of a strong moral and legislative bulwark against the existential and detrimental harms posed by AI, though he does recognize the benefits of technology when used responsibly.

Another Bitcoin Earthquake in Hong Kong: This Time They Are Working on "Bitcoin Collateralized Mortgage" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Hong Kong, known for its financial center status, recently hosted the Bitcoin Asia conference. The event attracted a significant number of participants from mainland China, despite the country's ban on commercial cryptocurrency trading. Organized by BTC Inc, which also runs the Bitcoin Conference and owns Bitcoin Magazine, the conference was attended by approximately 5,500 participants, half of whom are estimated to be from mainland China.
David Bailey, co-founder and CEO of BTC Inc, noted that interest in the conference was strong due to Hong Kong's imminent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and anticipation of the launch of Ethereum ETFs, as well as an increase in the development of layer 2 projects. “I think ETFs are kind of an admission that Bitcoin is here to stay,” Bailey said.



New ETFs in Hong Kong that accept in-kind subscriptions and allow purchases made with Bitcoin and ETH have been positively received by cryptocurrency investors. According to Bailey, this feature is “very important” because crypto investors can use ETF shares as collateral for loans. Harvest Global and ChinaAMC, managers of Hong Kong's crypto ETFs, confirmed they are working to promote collateralization of ETF products in the city.

Bitcoin Hovers Below $62,000, But Could This Signal a Bottom? - DailyCoin


        
The price of Bitcoin has slumped after reaching a record high. Analysts are now debating whether the worst is over.



Weak investors have likely sold their holdings, while strong believers are accumulating more Bitcoin. 



Analysts suggest the lack of widespread “buy-the-dip” chatter could be a bullish signal.
After reaching a new all-time high of $73,750 in March, Bitcoin has experienced a significant correction, consolidating around the $60,000 mark. This price drop initially ignited a “buy-the-dip” frenzy among cryptocurrency traders, confident that Bitcoin would quickly rebound. Is Bitcoin Price Nearing a Bottom?Recent trends suggest this buying pressure might be waning, and according to some analysts, this could be a positive sign for the future of Bitcoin’s price. Cryptocurrency analytics platform Santiment observed a decline in social media chatter around “buying the dip,” which they view as a potential indicator that the market is nearing a bottom. Historically, periods of extreme negativity often follow Bitcoin crashes, with “buy-the-dip” sentiment fading as fear sets in. However, Santiment suggests that the current decline in such conversations might signify a shift. 
With the weak hands, or risk-averse investors, likely having sold their holdings, the remaining players could be the more resilient bulls who are strategically accumulating Bitcoin at its current price point. While definitively identifying a market bottom remains impossible until after the fact, some technical factors provide a glimmer of hope. Key support levels on the Bitcoin chart haven’t been breached, and the underlying fundamentals of the cryptocurrency haven’t changed significantly. If Bitcoin can maintain its position above $60,000, it could be a strong indication that the correction has reached its floor.Bullish Signs Emerge Despite Short-Term DipFurther bolstering the bullish case is the ongoing positive narrative surrounding the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Increased mainstream adoption through these exchange-traded funds could trigger a significant price upswing for Bitcoin. 
Crypto analyst Willy Woo highlights another positive technical indicator, Bitcoin’s risk signal recently printed a lower high. This formation has historically paved the way for bullish trends, suggesting a potential reversal in the near future.Bitcoin is currently trading at $61,000, reflecting a 4.2% dip in the last week. While the immediate future might see continued consolidation, factors like the halving event, which significantly reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, still has the potential to lead to bullish price movement in the coming months.On the Flipside
The decline in “buy-the-dip” chatter could also indicate a waning of investor interest, rather than just resilience from remaining holders.



While historical trends offer some insight, technical indicators like the “lower high” haven’t proven to be foolproof predictors of future price movements.
Why This MattersThe decline in “buy-the-dip” chatter could signal a shift in investor sentiment, with fear giving way to strategic accumulation by long-term holders. This, combined with strong technical indicators and upcoming events like ETF approval and the halving, suggests a potential bottoming out and future price surge for Bitcoin.Bitcoin has seen a lot of innovation lately.

Shiba Inu Adoption Grows: Buy Nike Gear and PS5 with SHIB


CoinGate, a fintech company based in Lithuania, has boosted the utility of Shiba Inu (SHIB) by integrating it with Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). 
This strategic move allows SHIB holders to purchase products from major brands like Nike and book services like Airbnb.
Shiba Inu Price Consolidates Despite Growing Adoption
The payment gateway CoinGate acts as a link between crypto and traditional finance, facilitating digital asset transactions for goods and services. The inclusion of SHIB tokens on these platforms enhances accessibility and presents numerous opportunities for SHIB holders to participate in real-world transactions. 

“Shibarmy, use your SHIB to book Airbnb, grab the latest games from Steam & PS5, refresh your wardrobe with Nike & Zalando and more,” CoinGate wrote.

Moreover, Shiba Inu is not just expanding its transactional use. It is trying to evolve beyond its meme coin origins. The launch of Shibarium, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, represents a significant step forward in improving blockchain efficiency. 
This update includes a major hard fork completed earlier this month, which is expected to result in faster transactions and more stable gas fees, enhancing the overall user experience.

In April, the Shiba Inu team also made headlines by raising $12 million to develop a new layer-3 blockchain. This fundraising attracted significant contributions from notable investors, including Polygon Ventures, Mechanism Capital, and Animoca Brands, highlighting the growing confidence in SHIB’s potential.
Despite these advancements, the price of SHIB has been consolidating. Since May 7, it has fluctuated between $0.00002379 and $0.00002227. A breakout could propel the price to $0.00002558, marking an increase of over 13% from current market price.

Crypto market's weekly winners and losers - TON, RNDR, BONK, CORE - AMBCrypto



Toncoin, Render, and Akash Network had the biggest gain in the past week.
Core, Bonk, and Pendle were the biggest losers in the past week.

This week, Toncoin [TON] emerged as the top gainer, leading the charge among cryptocurrencies. Other notable gainers included AI and computing-related tokens, which also performed well in the market.
 However, the charts indicated that the trend of meme coins has subsided, at least for now. 
Bonk [BONK] was highlighted as one of the biggest losers over the past week, signaling a downturn for meme coins in the current market conditions.
Biggest winners
Toncoin
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Toncoin’s price movement revealed a steady climb throughout the week, starting at approximately $5.9 on the 5th of May and reaching around $6.8 by the 11th of May. 
CoinMarketCap’s data indicated a 24.35% increase over the past seven days, positioning TON as the top gainer for the week. Toncoin surpassed $7 at one point before settling around $6.8 at week’s end. 
As of this writing, TON was trading at around $6.9, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $24 billion.
 However, its trading volume has decreased by over 60% and was around $267.5 million at the time of this writing.
Render
AMBCrypto’s look at Render’s [RNDR] chart showed a strong performance over the past week. 
According to AMBCrypto’s assessment of the daily timeframe chart, RNDR started the week with a strong 10.28% surge, elevating its price from approximately $8.9 to $9.8. 
Subsequently, on the 9th of May, it experienced another significant increase of over 9%, driving its price to around $10.85. Despite some declines during the week, its overall uptrends compensated for any losses.
 Although it closed the week in the red, its price remained at around $10.9.
Source: TradingView
Also, CoinMarketCap data confirmed a notable 20.80% increase in the week for Render, making it the second-highest gainer. 
Similar to TON, RNDR also witnessed a decline in trading volume over the past 24 hours, with a reduction of over 50%.
As of this writing, its volume was around $210.5 million, with a market capitalization of around $4.2 billion. However, it was trading at around $10.8 as of this writing, with around a 0.6% decline. 
Akash Network
Akash Network [AKT] emerged as the third-largest gainer in the past week, boasting an impressive 18.33% increase, as reported by CoinMarketCap. 
Analyzing AKT’s price trend revealed that it started the week trading at approximately $5. However, it experienced downturns on the 7th and the 8th of May, falling to as low as $4.2. 
Nevertheless, the token rebounded on the 9th of May, concluding the week at around $5.7. 
At press time, it traded within the $5.7 price range, with a market capitalization was around $1.3 billion, although it has declined by over 3% in the last 24 hours. 
Additionally, its trading volume has decreased by over 50% during the same period, at around $122.3 million at press time.
Biggest losers
Core 
Core [CORE] experienced a significant decline of 14.62% in the past week, placing it among the top losers, as indicated by data from CoinMarketCap. 
CORE’s price trend revealed a challenging trajectory, with the token starting the week at approximately $1.9 and subsequently experiencing a steady decline. By the week’s end, its price had plummeted to around $1.5.

$81,000 Drained From Wells Fargo Account, Sent To Citibank - Victim Says She Received No Alerts, No Care, No Compensation - The Daily Hodl


								A woman who discovered tens of thousands of dollars missing from her Wells Fargo account says the financial giant is failing to protect its customers.
The victim, who wants to remain anonymous to protect her identity, says thieves looted more than $81,000 from her account via electronic transfers, reports FOX News Memphis.










The woman says she had only withdrawn money from her account three times after opening it five years ago.
She says the incident happened in November, but she noticed the theft months later because she did not receive any suspicious activity alert or notification from Wells Fargo.
“I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me. I wasn’t expecting anything to go out of that account. I called the bank immediately…
I would want them to refund or reimburse my money back.”  
The victim says Wells Fargo told her the funds were transferred to a Citibank account under her name and social security number. But she says she never opened a Citi account and was not alerted by the banking giant that someone was using her personally identifying information to open one.
She says she’s worried that she may not see a single cent of her money after both Wells Fargo and Citi told her that they would not reimburse the looted funds. She also says Wells Fargo is blaming her for not taking immediate action.
“[They’re] saying, ‘If you would have told us within two hours, we would have stopped that transaction from happening,’ when they did not even send an alert.”
The victim says she doesn’t know how her details got exposed because she only shared her name, social security number and bank account with two potential lenders in September when she was buying a house and to the town she’s living in for bills purposes.
Without recourse, the woman now says she’s taking all her money out of her Wells Fargo account.
“I am changing banks. I am not ever going to trust a bank that does not care for its customers.”

Canada’s Financial Regulator Fines Binance Holdings $4,300,000 Over Alleged Anti-Money Laundering Failures: Report - The Daily Hodl


								Regulators in Canada have reportedly fined Binance millions of dollars after the crypto exchange allegedly failed to comply with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws.
According to a new report by Reuters, The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) is penalizing the world’s largest crypto exchange platform by volume after it failed to register as a foreign money services business.










FINTRAC says it fined Binance $4.38 million after it failed to report receiving crypto assets worth C$10,000 ($7,310) or more on 5,902 separate instances between June 1st, 2021 and July 19th, 2023.
Binance decided to leave Canada in May of last year after it said it had issues with the country’s regulations on investor limits and stablecoins.
At the time, Binance said Canada’s new regulations rendered its market “no longer tenable.”
 “Unfortunately, new guidance related to stablecoins and investor limits provided to crypto exchanges makes the Canada market no longer tenable for Binance at this time. 
We put off this decision as long as we could to explore other reasonable avenues to protect our Canadian users, but it has become apparent that there are none.”
However, Binance said that it would consider returning to Canada  the country establishes proper regulations. Also last year, Changpeng Zhao, the Canadian chief executive of Binance, pleaded guilty in a US court to violating anti-money laundering laws.
Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison and Binance was slapped with a massive $4.3 billion penalty.

Bitcoin Nears $60,000 Amid Post-Halving Volatility and Market Speculation



                    

Bitcoin‘s price recently approached the $60,000 support level as it faced the post-halving “danger zone,” causing concern among investors. 



On May 10, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView highlighted Bitcoin’s intraday lows reaching $60,190 on Bitstamp. 




The cryptocurrency experienced a sharp decline from around $63,000, sparking varied speculations about the cause of this drop.



Trader Skew, discussing the market dynamics on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out, “Monthly open has been swept again as well monthly buyers taken out. 



If bulls want higher & want to break this downtrend its here imo,” indicating a critical juncture for Bitcoin bulls around the $60.8K to $61K range, which he identifies as a key area for potential bullish action.




Material Indicators, a trading resource, suggested that large-volume institutional players might be influencing the market, speculating, “that some institutional entity may not want to see Bitcoin breakout over the weekend while the BTC ETF market is closed,” reflecting concerns over market manipulation during off-hours.



An analysis of the order book on Binance showed a new sell block around $62,500, which was predicted to possibly adjust post-weekly close.

Material Indicators further speculated, “I won’t be the least bit surprised if this sell wall moves lower to push price down. 




“I also won’t be surprised if we see a roof pull after the W candle closes on Sunday,” suggesting potential strategic moves in the market.



Rekt Capital, a popular trader and analyst, updated his views on Bitcoin’s behavior post-halving. 



He noted that the typical price drop following a halving event was nearing its end, marking a close to the “danger zone.” 



He recalled his prediction from the end of April about a significant downturn, which materialized as Bitcoin fell to two-month lows at $56,500. 



Reflecting on the market’s response, he concluded, “Bitcoin indeed downside wicked below the Re-Accumulation Range Low just like in 2016. 



Thus price-wise, the Post-Halving ‘Danger Zone’ purple has been satisfied,” yet he also noted, “Time-wise however, the ‘Danger Zone’ officially ends in 2 days.”

Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) Will Explode 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PEPEVIR will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Viral Pepe.



Currently, Viral Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PEPEVIR on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Viral Pepe by entering its contract address – AKN68pzqJzSDNfiv7nDFk27ny5TkgKFjmKEozcwYszVq – in the receiving field.




PEPEVIR currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

BofA Announced: "June Will Be a Month to Remember", Here's Why - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bank of America (BofA) analysts predicted that June will be an “unforgettable” month with important decisions expected from many central banks.
This week has been a week full of surprises from central banks, with the Bank of Sweden (Riksbank) cutting interest rates and the Bank of England (BoE) expressing more confidence than previously expected that inflation will move in the desired direction.


“We got a glimpse of what June will look like for markets, when many central banks will make important decisions,” BofA analysts said. Analysts continued: “All together, we may be entering one of the most important months for markets in a long time, where key decisions will be made for many central banks. This could be a June to remember.”

Despite the BoE's 'structural' dovish trend, BofA analysts still believe wage increases will be more stubborn. BofA said, “Our call for the first rate cut in August continues.”





Looking ahead, BofA said its focus in Europe will be on March UK labor market data due next week. They also expect the German ZEW indicator to continue improving in May and the first quarter GDP for the Eurozone to provide further insight into the evolution of growth across the region.

FLOKI, BONK's volatile week: Will the bear runs continue? - AMBCrypto



Market sentiment remained bearish on both BONK and FLOKI. 
Most indicators and metrics hinted at continued price declines. 

Bonk [BONK] and Floki Inu [FLOKI], two of the most popular meme coins, had a tough week as their values declined in double digits. 
However, as the market trend changed, their southward momentum also declined. Does this mean that investors could expect their charts to turn green in the upcoming week? 
BONK and FLOKI bears stand strong
According to CoinMarketCap, BONK’s price dropped by more than 17% in the last seven days. FLOKI’s fate was also similar, as its value dipped by over 13% during the same time.
 The declining price action took a heavy toll on these meme coins’ market sentiments. AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data, both meme coins’ Weighted Sentiments remained drastically low. 
This signified that bearish sentiment around BONK and FLOKI was dominant in the market.
Source: Santiment
However, the bearish trend seemed to have been coming to an end as the degree of price decline dropped. While BONK’s price dropped only by 1.8% in the last 24 hours, FLOKI’s price dipped by 1.5%.
 This might be an indication of a trend reversal. At press time, FLOKI was trading at $0.0001685, while BONK had a value of $0.00002264.
Is a trend reversal possible?
To see whether that’s the case, AMBCryto checked their metrics. We found that FLOKI’s MVRV ratio dropped sharply last week, meaning that fewer investors were in profit. 
Its Funding Rate increased on the 12th of May. Generally, prices tend to move the other way than the Funding Rate, suggesting that FLOKI’s price might continue to fall. 
Coinglass’ data revealed that, like FLOKI, BONK’s Funding Rate also registered an increase in the past few hours.
Source: Santiment
We then analyzed both meme coins’ daily charts to better understand what to expect. Beginning with FLOKI, we found that the meme coin might just be testing the upper trendline support of its bullish flag pattern. 
Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a slight uptick, hinting at a price increase. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained in the bears’ favor. 
If the southward price action continues, then FLOKI’s price might touch $0.000156 support, from where it might rebound. 
Source: TradingView
BONK’s market indicators also looked pretty bearish. Its CMF was also considerably lower than the neutral mark. 
Unlike FLOKI, BONK’s MFI registered a downtick, suggesting that the chances of a continued price decline were high. Additionally, the MACD also displayed a bearish crossover.

Read Bonk’s [BONK] Price Prediction 2024-25

AMBCrypto then checked BONK’s liquidation heat map to look for possible support zones. As per our analysis, BONK has strong support near $0.000022. 
If it manages to turn bullish from there, then its price could move up towards $0.000029. But a plummet under that could push BONK’s price down to $0.000018 in the coming week.

DOJ Appoints Consulting Firm for Three-Year Monitoring Role of Crypto Exchange Binance: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly appointed a London-based consulting firm to serve as an outside monitor for Binance after the world’s largest crypto exchange pleaded guilty to violating US anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and sanctions laws.
People familiar with the matter but wanted to remain anonymous say the DOJ has selected Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) for the three-year monitorship of Binance over the previous frontrunner, New York-based law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, reports Bloomberg.










One of the conditions of Binance’s plea deal in November is the appointment of an independent firm to monitor its compliance. The newly appointed monitor will have access to Binance’s internal records, facilities and employees to report on the crypto exchange’s activities to the government.
Sullivan & Cromwell used to be the leading contender for the lucrative role, but controversies over its ties with defunct crypto exchange FTX and its alleged failure to detect the fraud perpetrated by the firm’s convicted co-founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, reportedly prompted the Justice Department to review other options.
But Sullivan & Cromwell is still expected to get the appointment for a separate five-year Binance monitorship on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).
FRA, which specializes in forensic accounting, data governance and compliance consulting services, previously worked with Switzerland-based trading company Gunvor SA to negotiate a $661 million settlement with the DOJ over a bribery case involving Ecuadorian officials.

Forensic Risk Alliance Appointed to Monitor Binance Compliance After $4.3 Billion Plea Deal



                    

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has appointed Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) to monitor cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s compliance with regulatory standards. 



This follows Binance’s November 2023 plea deal wherein it admitted to charges of money laundering and other federal offenses, resulting in a $4.3 billion fine. 




FRA’s three-year engagement will involve scrutinizing Binance‘s internal records, premises, and employee interactions to keep the DOJ informed of its compliance status, a Bloomberg report revealed on May 10.



Originally, the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell was considered for the monitoring contract due to their prominence in the sector. 



However, their previous association with FTX, another crypto exchange that went bankrupt, influenced the DOJ’s decision to opt for FRA instead. 



This decision came amid allegations against Sullivan & Cromwell for their involvement in FTX Group’s fraudulent activities, as reported by Cointelegraph on February 17.

The firm allegedly had prior knowledge of deceitful practices at FTX that led to the loss of client funds, as stated by FTX creditors in a class-action lawsuit.



Despite these controversies, Sullivan & Cromwell is expected to secure a separate five-year monitoring contract for Binance under the auspices of the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.




In related news, Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, was sentenced to four months in prison on April 30. 



The sentence was for failing to implement an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at the exchange. 




Although prosecutors sought a three-year term, the judge mitigated the sentence, citing a lack of evidence that Zhao was directly aware of specific illicit activities within Binance.

Ripple's XRP Architect David Schwartz Explains His 40,000 ETH ICO Purchase and Missed Fortunes ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has recently provided insights into his involvement in Ethereum’s early days, shedding light on his purchase of 40,000 Ethereum tokens during the public initial coin offering (ICO).



The revelation came following a query posed by an XRP supporter, MetamanX, on May 10. This prompted Schwartz to elaborate on his engagement with Ethereum before the public pre-ICO phase.



Schwartz clarified that his involvement in Ethereum’s ICO was not merely a business decision but a personal one, as he revealed his acquaintance with Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum’s founders. In response to the inquiry, Schwartz disclosed that Buterin, a close friend, had extended an invitation to participate in the ICO, which prompted him to contribute 20 BTC to support Buterin’s initiative.



“I knew Vitalik. He invited me to participate. I wanted to support him, so I went in for 20 BTC. I didn’t really ask any questions. It got me 40,000 ETH. I thought of it as helping an acquaintance,” Schwartz stated.



Public records validate Schwartz’s account, indicating that the Ethereum ICO lasted 42 days between July 22 and September 2, 2014. Early investors could secure 2,000 ETH for 1 BTC. As the ICO progressed, the exchange rate of ETH to BTC increased, with 1 BTC eventually fetching 1,337 ETH by the sale’s conclusion.

&nbsp



The pundit shared a tweet from last December in which he disclosed having sold his Ether. Notably, Schwartz’s decision to liquidate his 40,000 ETH portfolio when its value rose to $40,000 marked a commendable return on investment, amounting to roughly 220% after a two-year holding period.



“As many of you know, I sold 40,000 ETH at about $1 to put solar panels on a house I no longer own. That ETH was worth over $100 million shortly after,” Schwartz wrote on December 8, 2023.



However, hindsight reveals a missed opportunity for the Ripple CTO. Had he retained his investment to date, Ether’s current price of $2,927, it would be worth a staggering $117,166,291, reflecting a 292,816% increase from his sale price of $40,000.



In a reflective tone revealing the sale, Schwartz shared a personal tale, drawing parallels between his actions and those of his father. He recounted his father’s decision to sell Apple stock to fund renovations and a new house, only to witness the stock’s value soar subsequently. 



“My father, ironically, did almost the same thing. After my older siblings moved out, my parents didn’t need the enormous house we were living in. But it needed quite a bit of fixing up to sell. So, my father sunk a lot of money into gutting and redoing the house. But during the months it took to do that, as renovation costs escalated, the real estate market crashed. He took a huge loss on the deal.” Schwartz revealed.

New Memecoin Book of Shiba Inu Will Surge 9,000% as MEXC Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Book of Shiba Inu (BOSHIBA) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Book of Shiba Inu (BOSHIBA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 9,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because BOSHIBA has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on MEXC.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Book of Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Book of Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin.



To buy Book of Shiba Inu on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the MEXC listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Book of Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 24YoPq1drHd7Xs7NbYhU3HvBCMsGZqmSefD7FYeZ6W5D – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BOSHIBA.

Sam Altman thinks giving everyone ‘a slice of GPT’ could pay for UBI

OpenAI CEO and Tools for Humanity Chairperson Sam Altman believes the progress being carved out by today’s frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models could lead to a vast restructuring of socioeconomics. Altman recently unveiled a vision wherein treating “compute” as a resource and asset, could supplant monetary income as a means of providing a universal basic income (UBI), during a recent interview on the All-In podcast. VIDEOWhile the interview touched on a number of subjects, it quickly turned to the dangers of AI and how humanity would cope with threats ranging from AI-wrought human extinction to employment displacement. On the former subject, Altman acknowledged that there could come a time when AI models were sufficiently capable of posing such threats. His solution is a global oversight board with the capacity to regulate the largest projects, thereby leaving startups relatively unfettered by potentially growth-stifling laws. “I think there will come a time, in the not super distant future ... where the frontier AI systems are capable of causing significant global harm. And, for those kinds of systems ... I would like to see some sort of international agency that is looking at the most powerful systems and ensuring reasonable safety testing.”Altman assured the All-In team that GPT-4, OpenAI’s current state-of-the-art production model, posed no “significant” threat to human lives.On the jobs front, Altman is a well known advocate for UBI. Aside from OpenAI, he also helms Tools for Humanity, a firm whose main product is the Worldcoin cryptocurrency and identity verification platform. Worldcoin is given to anyone willing to verify their humanity. After which, holders receive a monthly token stipend.Speaking to the All-In team, Altman decried government poverty assistance programs as mostly ineffective and called for a simple, respectful approach to UBI: “I’m not a super fan of how the government has handled most policies designed to help poor people, and I kind of believe that if you could just give people money they would make good decisions and the market would do its thing.”He went on to point out that giving people money is not going to solve all problems,” adding that it’s “certainly not going to make people happy.” But ventured that “it might solve some problems and it might give people a better horizon with which to help themselves.”As to why he’s such an advocate for UBI, Altman said that he and his colleagues realized back in 2016, when they began taking AI seriously, that it could have far-reaching effects. They began conducting studies and found that UBI showed promise. Now, Altman believes that the UBI paradigm itself could be ripe for an upending:“2016 was a very long time ago. ... I wonder if the future looks something more like universal basic compute than universal basic income and everybody gets a slice of GPT-7’s compute and they can use it, they can resell it, they can donate it to somebody to use for cancer research.

Satoshi Resurfaced? Decade-Long Dormant Wallets Spring To Life, Unleashing Over $60 Million In BTC ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
In a notable development, two dormant Bitcoin wallets, untouched for over a decade, have suddenly come to life, transferring a staggering $60 million in Bitcoin (BTC).



The revelation came to light through a tweet by Lookonchain, a service that tracks significant crypto transactions. The tweet announced the movement of 1,000 BTC from these long-dormant wallets in just 20 minutes.



Notably, the wallets, identified as “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH,” received 500 BTC on September 13, 2013, when Bitcoin’s price hovered around a mere $124. Going by this price, each Whale’s Bitcoin reserve was worth $62,000. Mirroring it with today’s BTC price at $61,107, each whale’s BTC worth is approximately $30.6 million, reflecting a 49,179.8% Return on Investment (ROI).



This latest development comes after another dormant Bitcoin wallet, inactive for a decade, came to life on May 6 and moved 687.33 BTC, valued at around $44 million.



Notably, the movement of such vast sums of Bitcoin raises questions about the intentions of the wallet holders. Speculation abounds regarding whether these wallets belong to Bitcoin Creator, Satoshi Nakamoto or early Bitcoin miners who had forgotten about their holdings or individuals with an unparalleled commitment to the “HODL” strategy.

&nbsp



Notably, the timing of these events coincides with Bitcoin’s current volatility. Analysts are divided on the direction of its price amid conflicting indicators. While some foresee a potential surge to $70,000 or beyond in the coming months, on-chain data suggests that long-term holders may be offloading their holdings.



JA Martunn, a leading analyst at Cryptoquant, recently highlighted this phenomenon, noting that the “Coin Days Destroyed” metric indicates a likely peak in Bitcoin’s price. Notably, this metric considers the age and volume of Bitcoin transactions, suggesting that seasoned market participants are divesting their holdings.







Martunn, however expressed optimism, suggesting that newer market participants may ultimately catalyze a fresh bull run by relinquishing their holdings to experienced market players. 



“Eventually, there reaches a point where the influx of new investors cannot sustain the demand for older coins at prevailing prices, leading to a decline. This prompts newer investors to sell at a minor loss, triggering further sell-offs. Ultimately, the cycle concludes with capitulation, as newer participants relinquish their holdings to experienced market participants” he added.



That said, it is important to note that the average purchase price for new whales is $61,200. According to Cryptoquant analyst Axel Adler, they may experience stress if the price drops below this threshold.



“Currently, this level is acting as support. Based on history, new whales almost always have to experience stress. The simplest way to get rid of it is to HODL,” he wrote.

Crypto Market Continues its Descent: Is the Bull Run Over? - DailyCoin


        
Crypto markets have experienced volatility, leading investors to question the longevity of the current bull market.



While some cryptocurrencies have defied the trend with impressive gains, others have endured significant losses.



Analysts have remained bullish on the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies despite the short-term turbulence.
This week, the cryptocurrency market navigated choppy waters, leaving many investors wondering if the recent surge is nearing its peak. While some coins managed to weather the storm, others took a significant tumble.TON Soars 20% While Dogecoin Leads Top 10 LosersDespite the overall downturn, a few bright spots emerged. Telegram’s native token, TON, defied the bearish trend and surged a staggering 20%. Binance Coin (BNB), the exchange’s token, also clung to modest gains of 0.34%. However, its position remains precarious, hovering just above the break-even point.
Among the biggest losers this week were Dogecoin (DOGE), Avalanche (AVAX), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). DOGE, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, posted the steepest decline in the top ten coins, dropping a hefty 11.2%.

This is Why Franklin Templeton Bets on Blockchain Technology


Jenny Johnson, President and CEO of Franklin Templeton oversees a financial titan with $1.6 trillion in assets. Recently, she underscored the significant benefits of blockchain technology in asset management. 
Speaking at the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California, Johnson expressed her enthusiasm for blockchain’s potential, especially in tokenizing real-world assets.
Jenny Johnson Believes Mutual Funds and ETFs Will Soon Come On-Chain
During her conversation with Bloomberg, Johnson emphasized Franklin Templeton’s innovative approach to utilizing blockchain technology. She detailed an experiment where the company processed account records using traditional and blockchain methods over six to eight months. 

“We were astonished by how much less cost it was to run it on the blockchain. It’s a very effective technology, and we think it is going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities. Eventually, I think exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain,” Johnson stated.


The CEO also discussed the challenges in financial services related to data reconciliation across systems. This process is often costly and time-consuming. 
Blockchain provides a single source of truth for transactions, dramatically reducing costs and improving efficiency. This reduction in friction indeed paves the way for new investment opportunities.
Johnson also illustrated blockchain’s broader potential with a reference to pop superstar Rihanna, who issued non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for royalties from her songs. 

“So when Spotify plays a Rihanna song, and you own that token, the smart contract can kick off. And the payment mechanism built into the blockchain can give you your fractions,” Johnson said.

Franklin Templeton launched the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) in 2021, a trailblazer as the first US-registered fund that uses public blockchain for processing transactions and documenting share ownership.

“I am a huge fan of blockchain and the technology. We had the first SEC approved money market fund, the SEC had us run the shareholders’ servicing system,” Johnson said.

At the heart of this innovation lies the BENJI token. Operating on the Stellar (XLM) and Polygon (MATIC) blockchains, these tokens uniquely represent shares of the FOBXX fund. 

They include assets like government securities, cash, and repurchase agreements. They also offer a stable yield, which is highly attractive to investors seeking dependable returns.
Recent data from rwa.xyz shows that the BENJI token has a market capitalization of $367 million. This impressive figure ranks it second only to BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). 
On April 25, Franklin Templeton expanded the functionality of BENJI tokens. They are now available for peer-to-peer transfer on the public blockchain.

Continuing its commitment to the blockchain, the company launched a Bitcoin ETF in January, achieving modest net flows of $351 million to date. Moreover, on February 13, Franklin Templeton sought SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF, further integrating blockchain into its offerings.

Blockchain adoption in healthcare faces serious obstacles in Germany

Blockchain technology has expanded beyond cryptocurrency and is now used in a number of applications, including decentralized databases, which can prevent counterfeiting through transparency and security. This ability to secure data is particularly valuable to the healthcare sector, where blockchain tech can secure data, enhance data integrity and empower patients to control their data more effectively. It can also improve transparency in supply chains and verify the authenticity of medicine. Additionally, blockchain aids in healthcare identification and has the potential to enhance biomedical research by simplifying data storage and exchange.Blockchain in the healthcare sector: Germany’s untapped potential?Although blockchain technology offers numerous benefits, its applications are rarely found in the German healthcare sector.The German Federal Ministry of Health recognized the potential of blockchain and organized a workshop on the topic in 2019. Recent: Despite Bitcoin price volatility, factors point to BTC’s long-term successOut of 142 project outlines, 20 finalists were selected, and projects such as secure electronic prescriptions, decentralized Patient Consent Service forms and a blockchain-based certificate of incapacity for work were awarded prizes. However, to date, none of these projects have been implemented.Since then, new initiatives have emerged, but many remain isolated and rarely implemented. What’s stopping Germany from adopting blockchain?Why are there so few blockchain projects in the German healthcare market when the technology is so promising?Volker Nürnberg, professor of management in healthcare at the Technical University of Munich, told Cointelegraph that the German healthcare sector is highly regulated and not always seen as a driver of innovation, which is a particular challenge for startups: “From a global perspective, the healthcare sector is not always the driver of innovation. It is also extremely regulated [in Germany]. Startups, in particular, don’t always want to fight their way through the legal jungle.”Nürnberg also addressed the technical, ethical and privacy hurdles that make blockchain implementation difficult. Protecting sensitive data and ensuring interoperability are key factors: “Without politics and legislators — due to the strong regulation in the healthcare sector — the introduction of blockchain technology is not possible.” Lukas Weidener, a doctor of medicine and investor in various medical decentralized autonomous organizations, told Cointelegraph that these “particularly strict data protection regulations to protect sensitive patient data place high demands on the security and confidentiality of blockchain systems.”GDPR poses unique challenges for blockchainsThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ensures that sensitive patient data is processed in accordance with strict security and confidentiality requirements. This is particularly important in the healthcare sector, where the misuse or unauthorized disclosure of data can have serious consequences. Therefore, compliance with the GDPR can be seen as a mark of quality and a basis of trust for patients and users, ensuring their data is secure and handled with care.According to Weidener, however, these data protection and security requirements can pose a challenge for blockchain applications. This technology relies on data transparency and immutability, potentially conflicting with the right to be forgotten or the principle of data minimization.Weidener said that these regulations could lead to firms in other countries overtaking German companies, limiting the control and influence of German industry in the global development of these technologies.On the other hand, the GDPR also offers the opportunity to promote the development of blockchain applications that are designed to comply with high standards from the outset. “This could make Germany a pioneer in the development of secure, transparent and patient-oriented blockchain solutions in the healthcare sector,” said Weidener. According to the expert, close cooperation between technology developers, data protection officers and regulatory authorities is required to fully exploit blockchain technology’s benefits and meet the GDPR requirements. “The aim must be to develop innovative solutions that ensure both technical progress and the protection and security of patient data.”Blockchain’s bad reputationAnother factor in the way of adoption is blockchain technology’s association with cryptocurrencies.The association of blockchain technology with the volatility and security concerns of cryptocurrencies has a negative impact on public perception, said Weidener, adding that the “perceived energy consumption of some blockchain protocols can also lead to concerns about environmental sustainability.” “This could lead to reservations among decision-makers and users in the healthcare sector who view the technology with skepticism, especially if sustainability and environmental protection play an important role in their organizations.”In addition to these hurdles, the “strict authorization and certification processes for medical devices mean that any technological innovation must undergo extensive testing and approval procedures, which slows down the innovation cycle.”Investment in research and funding necessaryAdopting blockchain technology in healthcare also requires significant investment in technology and expertise, which is particularly challenging for smaller clinics and practices. According to Weidener, the need to update or even completely replace existing IT infrastructures and the lack of standardized solutions make implementation even more difficult.Recent: Crypto firms brace for intensified SEC, CFTC action after regulator warningWeidener emphasized the importance of targeted investment in research and funding, especially for new technologies that comply with data protection regulations. Without this investment, Germany risks falling behind technologically and patients losing access to advanced technologies.Weidener said interoperability and integration with existing IT infrastructures, as well as the development of user-centric applications that enable easy interaction with blockchain-based healthcare applications, are also important.“This is the only way Germany can play a leading role in the development and implementation of blockchain applications in the healthcare sector.”

Polkadot (DOT) Ecosystem Recap: Here are the Latest Advancements


																TL;DR

Polkadot has recently improved its network performance, significantly boosting the speed and capacity for processing transactions.
In addition to its technical advancements, the protocol is exploring a potential $8.8 million sponsorship deal with the American soccer club Inter Miami.


What’s New Around Polkadot?
The blockchain protocol made the headlines in the past few days due to completing some important advancements. As CryptoPotato reported, it enabled Asynchronous Backing on the network. The mechanism represents “an optimized approach for how parachain blocks are validated by the Relay Chain.”
The Relay Chain is the central chain and is of critical importance to the Polkadot’s ecosystem. It facilitates communication and interoperability between the different parachains and handles the inter-chain messaging passing (XCMP) protocol. 
Polkadot’s team announced that blocks are produced twice as fast following that upgrade, while available blockspace was boosted by 6-10 times. “3-5x more extrinsic per block and higher utilization of parachain blocks” are two additional consequences of the development.
“Async Backing boosts throughput by 8x, without sacrificing security, paving the way for supporting Web3 applications across verticals such as gaming and DeFi. It brings Web2 scale into the reach of Web3, which is crucial for large-scale platforms like Mythical Games,” the team stated.
The Previous Endeavors
Several weeks ago, Polkadot released the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper. It represents a prospective design to foster the advancement of the Relay Chain and combines elements of Polkadot and Ethereum.




“JAM provides a global singleton permissionless object environment—much like the smart-contract environment pioneered by Ethereum—paired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network, a proposition pioneered by Polkadot.” the team explained at the time.
Another major development that has not yet seen the light of day is the possible partnership between Polkadot and the American soccer club Inter Miami. Nico Zini – Partnership Marketing and Media Rights for the sports team CF – revealed that the team may join forces with the blockchain protocol on an $8.8 million sponsorship deal. 
For the uninitiated, Inter Miami’s biggest star is the Argentine legend Lionel Messi, while its co-owner is David Beckham. 
This is Polkadot’s second attempt to enter the soccer world. Two years ago, it had a chance to become FC Barcelona’s official jersey sponsor. However, the Catalan club eventually chose Spotify.

One Altcoin Has $1 Billion Token Unlock in the New Week - Bitcoin Sistemi


The cryptocurrency market will witness a very interesting token lock opening event in the new week.
Aevo (AEVO), which was recently launched as Binance's Launchpool project, will experience a token unlock of approximately $1 billion on Wednesday, May 15, 2024. The token unlocking is expected to take place at 08:00 Türkiye time (UTC+3).


This will be an extremely interesting development considering that AEVO is an altcoin with a market cap of only $132 million. The tokens to be unlocked correspond to 752% of the tokens in circulation.

However, AEVO's vesting table is calculated based on the RBN vesting schedule, with the assumption that all tokens can be converted immediately after unlocking. RBN holders can convert their RBN to AEVO at a 1:1 ratio.





Following the token openings in question, a significant portion of the AEVO maximum supply will be in circulation. AEVO price is trading at $1.20 at the time of writing this article. When it was first launched, the price of the altcoin opened at approximately $3.

How does the order book work?

A very commonly used term in the field of financial trading is order book.
It is a term that refers to the register on which all purchase and sale orders are stored waiting to be executed on an exchange. 

What is the order book and how do you read it?
The same term “order book” clearly suggests that it is a book, or rather a register, related to orders. 
The fact is that purchase and sale orders are not always executed immediately. 
When an order, whether it is a purchase or a sale, is actually executed, it is also removed from the order book, so here you only have those already loaded but not yet executed. 
There are two types of orders: limit orders, and market orders. 
Market orders are executed immediately at the market price as soon as they are placed by users. 
In other words, these are purchase or sale orders for which the user who uploads them does not indicate a limit price. By not indicating the execution limit price, the user allows the exchange to execute them immediately at the market price, so they practically do not even enter the order book.
Indeed, only the orders not yet executed are recorded in the order book, that is, limit orders. 
In limit type orders, the user also specifies the limit price, in addition to the quantity they want to buy or sell. In the case of a buy order, they specify the maximum price they are willing to pay, while in the case of a sell order, they specify the minimum price they are willing to sell at. 
If the limit price indicated by the user is lower than the market price, in the case of a buy order, or higher in the case of a sell order, the order cannot be executed immediately, and is therefore placed in the order book to be executed later. 
The user can also specify a date or an expiration period, so that the order is removed from the order book within a certain time if it is not executed. 
The main features
Often the display of order books on various exchanges is more or less the same. 
At the top there are the sales orders, and at the bottom the purchase orders. They are sorted by price, from highest to lowest. 
The order book is divided in two, because it includes both sell orders, at the top with a price higher than the market price, and buy orders, at the bottom with a price lower.
In theory, in the middle there should be the market price, but since this is nothing more than the price at which the last transaction took place, it is often not displayed within the order book, to avoid confusion.
Actually, when a user places a new order, the exchange looks in its order book for other orders already loaded but not yet executed to see if there is any that can meet the requirements of the new order. 
If the user places a market order to buy, the exchange will simply take all the sell orders at a lower price already present in the order book to completely fulfill the buy order.
In this case, practically the price of the sale would have been decided in advance by those who have placed the limit sell orders that were satisfied thanks to the new buy order.
The same thing happens, on the contrary, if a user places a new market sell order.
More complicated is the functioning of matching a new order limit with the orders already present on the order book. 
Indeed, in the event that on a new purchase order the user has indicated a price lower than those of the sales orders already present in the order book, the matching simply cannot occur, and so the new order cannot be executed and is simply added to the order book. 
Instead, if it indicates a sufficiently high purchase price, the exchange will be able to match it with sell orders already present in the order book, and will be able to execute the transaction. 
However, the exchange does not always manage to find a sufficient quantity of assets at a price not higher than that indicated in the new purchase order, so it may also happen that this is only partially executed, and the rest is then recorded on the order book for the unexecuted part. 
The same things happen, on the contrary, if a user places a new limit sell order.
How to analyze the order book
In light of all this, it is easy to understand how useful it can be to analyze order books, especially since they are usually public. 
Before explaining how to analyze an order book, however, a necessary clarification is needed: not all orders publicly displayed on the order book are real. Sometimes, in fact, fictitious orders are added, which are then promptly removed after a short time, either to artificially inflate the order book, or to alter its analysis. 
It must also be said that there are many orders that are removed from the order book by the users who created them even shortly after their creation, either because they were the result of errors, or because the user changed their mind. 
Furthermore, unfortunately it is not possible to know for certain which orders are real and which are fake, so generally one simply performs these analyses with a certain caution. 
The fact is that purchase orders at higher prices, and sales orders at lower prices, indicate very well the market situation on a given exchange at a given moment. 
Furthermore, not only the prices indicated on those orders are interesting, but also the quantities. 
By analyzing this data, you can determine how deep a buying or selling market is on an exchange, remembering that crypto exchanges do not have shared order books, as each one has its own completely independent and detached from those of other exchanges. crypto
So if, for example, on an exchange there are purchase orders at a relatively high price and with high quantities, it means that both the purchasing power is high on that exchange and that even large sales can lower the price slightly. 
Conversely, if for example on an exchange there were sell orders at a not particularly low price, and with small quantities, the selling power would be scarce, and large purchases could quickly and significantly increase the price. 
However, analyzing order books is not at all simple, and generally only experienced traders know how to interpret them correctly and effectively.

Bitcoin trades sideways while TON, RNDR, PEPE and AR flash bullish signs

Bitcoin (BTC) could not hold its recovery this week, signaling that the bears have not given up and are using the rallies to sell. Bitcoin is on track to finish the week with a loss of more than 4%. The longer the price stays closer to $60,000, the greater the possibility of a downside breakdown.However, analysts remain bullish on the price action in the post-halving cycle. According to Cane Island Alternative Advisors founder and investment manager Timothy Peterson, Bitcoin could soar to anywhere “between $175,000 - $350,000 in the next 9 months.” Peterson cautioned in a X post that “this bull market will end in January 2025.”Crypto market data daily view.

Let’s study the top 5 cryptocurrencies that look promising on the charts.Bitcoin price analysisThe bulls have successfully defended the $59,600 level in Bitcoin but failed to push the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($62,650). This shows an intense battle between the bulls and the bears.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory indicate advantage to sellers. If the $59,600 level cracks, the BTC/USDT pair could retest the May 1 intraday low of $56,552. This level is expected to attract buyers, but if the bears prevail, the pair may drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298.If bulls want to prevent the downside, they will have to propel and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair could rise to $67,250. Buyers will have to overcome this hurdle to start a rally to $73,777.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

The crucial support to watch on the downside is $59,600. If this level is breached, the selling may pick up, and the pair could plunge to $56,552.Contrarily, if the price rises above the 50-simple moving average, it will suggest that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The pair may rise to $63,500 and later to $65,500.

Trump's Crypto Pivot Is Bullish...But For Whom? Mad Crypto Money With Ivan - Benzinga

gm,I’m Ivan and welcome to my weekly column Mad Crypto Alpha.Trump Is Right…You read that right.Donald Trump flip-flopped on crypto last week.And in the viral video clip documenting Trump’s totally-not-surprising pivot, Trump only says true things from second 17 onwards:Alright, even if Trump is right…why should you care?Read Also: If You Bought Your Mom $100 In Bitcoin, Dogecoin And Ethereum Last Mother’s Day, Here’s How Much She’d Have Today…And Everyone’s Losing Their MindAs long as things go according to plan and only regulators and Congresspeople comment on crypto it’s all fine.But as soon as Trump comments on crypto…The following anecdote will tell you all you need to know to position yourself correctly for maximum chance of profits going into election season.It was all nice and quiet on Crypto Twitter following Trump’s 180 until Blockworks’ opinion editor Molly Zuckerman chose to poke the hornet’s nest by giving a — wait for it— different opinion *audience gasps*.[Narrator’s voice:] What Molly did not know is that one does not simply shared a different opinion.The customary social media s–tstorm ensued. All nuance went out the window and Molly got dunked on for her looks, her presumed agenda and everything else a good old hate mob addresses.But you’re not here to read about Ryan Selkis, CEO of Messari and speaker at Trump’s event, trying to calm down the mob.Or that Coindesk thinks Trump’s speech lacked substance (no I’m not surprised, how could you tell?).You want to know why Trump’s pivot is bullish and for whom.Most people’s dunks on the op-ed had a notable conservative/libertarian undertone. These people aren’t voting Democrat in the fall and most likely never were, Trump pivot or not. And these people do not like President Joe Biden, for good reason or not.But these people do have a lot of market-moving power because they’re quite wealthy in the crypto industry.So, what coins are conservative-leaning crypto diehards going to buy come election season?Read Also: JPMorgan Reports $760K Spot Bitcoin ETF Holdings Even As CEO Jamie Dimon Called For Shutting Down Crypto IndustryCrypto Isn’t All Conservative But Whales Probably AreCrypto actually does skew Republican as much as it might appear.As Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, points out, it’s really a bipartisan issue and split almost evenly along party lines.But that is not the case on Crypto Twitter. It has long leaned Republican, and many crypto or crypto-adjacent accounts, such as WallStreet Silver, think Trump is likely to win the election (or at least retweet people that think so).When Trump-supporting crypto whales go coin-shopping in the coming weeks and months, they’re likely to buy cryptocurrencies that are mascots for their candidate.And political meme coins do not offer much for liberal-leaning folk anyway:
Trump is the biggest holder of MAGA Memecoin TRUMP/USD, the meme coin created in his honor.



Jeo Boden BODEN/USD is technically a “SOL - Benzinga">Democrat meme coin,” but it makes fun of the president’s gaffes and perceived lack of mental clarity.



Other politicial meme coins like Tooker or Ju Rugan parody right-wing media figures, but there’s no such alternative for liberals.
Conclusion: Crypto Twitter wants Trump to win. Coins supporting Trump (or making fun of Biden) have done well and will probably be high on the list again.But what about other cryptocurrencies? Are these coins going to outperform Dogecoin DOGE/USD or Shiba Inu SHIB/USD?No idea. If I knew that, I wouldn’t be … ah nevermind.I’m not saying these coins are guaranteed to do well. I don’t even know whether they will outperform other meme coins. And as always, all of that is subject to big daddy Bitcoin BTC/USD playing ball and staying in an acceptable range over summer.But I do know that crypto whales like Trump and the memecoin supercycle does not look like it has topped out.So don’t @ me because that is not financial advice, but the political crypto season is just getting started.Wrapping It UpIf you liked this column, give me a follow on Twitter and sign up to our "Future of Finance" newsletter.Shoot me a DM or Benzinga a mail if you have topic requests, and I'll see you back for next week's Mad Crypto Alpha.gnRead Next: If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When Donald Trump Said The Crypto’s Value Was ‘Based On Thin Air,’ Here’s How Much You’d Have NowImage created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) Will Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Viral Pepe (PEPEVIR), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




PEPEVIR will be listed on MEXC, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Viral Pepe.



Currently, Viral Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy PEPEVIR on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Viral Pepe by entering its contract address – AKN68pzqJzSDNfiv7nDFk27ny5TkgKFjmKEozcwYszVq – in the receiving field.




PEPEVIR currently has a market cap of just under $15,000, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Dogecoin's 'big boys' are buying: Should you do the same? - AMBCrypto



Despite the accumulation, DOGE’s price might face resistance at $0.15.
Traders looking to short the coin might get burnt as a recovery might happen quickly.

The number of Dogecoin [DOGE] addresses holding between 100,000 and 1 billion coins has increased, AMBCrypto can confirm.
Employing data from Santiment, we noticed that the accumulation started around the 2nd of April.
Typically, a surge in these addresses is a sign that demand for the coin has increased. And if demand increases, the price of DOGE is supposed to rise.
DOGE plans to win
But in most cases, this potential price increase does not happen immediately. This is because some sell-offs could be happening at other ends.
As of this writing, DOGE’s price was $0.14— a 28.18% correction in the last 30 days.
However, if the number of large addresses scooping the coin at discount prices increases, then Dogecoin might soon begin a rally that takes it back to $0.18.
Source: Santiment
Furthermore, AMBCrypto looked at the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z Score. This score checks if a cryptocurrency is in a bear or bull phase.
When the MVRV Z Score is negative, it implies that the market is in a bear cycle. But for Dogecoin, the metric was 52.83%, indicating that the coin has held on to its bull phase.
However, the metric was falling, suggesting that the price might come down again. Should this be the case, DOGE might trade at $0.12.
As a trader, a potential drop to this price might be enticing. However, it is important to check other metrics before deciding to go all in.
Source: Santiment
Wait for a decline before placing the trade
For this part, AMBCrypto analyzed the liquidation levels. With the liquidation levels, traders can have an idea of a cryptocurrency’s next movement.
This is because the indicator shows areas of high liquidity and prices where large liquidation levels might occur.
According to Hyblock, high liquidity only appeared at $0.15, meaning that it could be challenging for DOGE to reach this price.
If this remains the case, you might need to overlook buying DOGE at this point. But if the price goes lower, then it could be a good entry point.
In terms of entry point, the Cumulative Liquidation Levels Delta (CLDD) gave insights into Dogecoin’s prediction. As of this writing, the CLLD was negative.
Source: Hyblock
Positive values of the CLLD indicate that there are more long liquidations in the market. On the other hand, a negative CLLD suggests that shorts are facing a chunk of the position wipeout.

In addition, the negative CLLD confirmed the latter part of the statement above.
For the price, the negative reading of this indicator implies that later shorts might be punished, as Dogecoin could begin a sharp recovery in no time.

Crypto traders eye explosive rally as altcoin market revives | Cryptopolitan

Crypto markets are in a stage called “disbelief,” where skepticism prevails despite bullish indicators. Traders, eyeing an imminent rally, are closely monitoring three tech indicators that could signal a significant uptick in the altcoin sector.Signs of a Surge Amid SkepticismCrypto analyst Mikybull Crypto recently alerted their followers on X that the altcoin market’s capitalization is currently at the disbelief stage, which is typically followed by an explosive rally. Despite the overall market cap of altcoins, excluding the top ten, experiencing a 17.55% decline over the last 30 days to $264.9 billion, there’s still strong support above the $250 billion mark. This level is crucial as it suggests altcoins are gearing up for a potential upswing.According to the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, there has been a notable drop of 24 index points in the past month, with the “Greed” score now sitting at 56. This drop further highlights the current market skepticism that defines the disbelief stage. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital, another prominent voice in the crypto space, highlighted to their 465,300 X followers that despite recent downturns, the market is positioning itself for a future upward trajectory.Key Indicators to WatchTraders are keeping tabs on a trio of indicators across the broader crypto market that includes the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), the stochastic relative strength index (RSI), and Bitcoin dominance. The EMA provides a weighted average of prices over the period, with more emphasis on recent data, serving as a critical metric for market direction.Pseudonymous crypto trader Titan of Crypto noted that if the total crypto market cap retests the EMA20 and simultaneously achieves a bullish cross on the stochastic RSI, it could usher in rally time. These indicators are essential for predicting the altcoin market’s movement and are closely watched by market participants.Furthermore, Bitcoin’s market share, known as Bitcoin dominance, is another vital indicator. Currently, at 54.7%, having decreased by 0.56% over the past week, a continued fall in Bitcoin dominance could signal the start of an ‘altseason,’ where altcoins could perform exceptionally well compared to Bitcoin.Future Prospects and Market CyclesHistorically, altcoins tend to find their local price bottoms before making significant rallies. Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggested that altcoins are on track to find their local bottom around early June, based on past market cycles. This potential bottoming could set the stage for the next altcoin bull cycle.However, for altcoins to truly outperform, several conditions need to be met. Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, explained that the sentiment in the crypto market since mid-March has been subdued. For altcoins to thrive, Bitcoin’s price needs to break out decisively above the 20-day EMA, which would reduce the volatility in altcoin prices and foster a more bullish environment.Despite the recent challenges, the altcoin market cap remains up over 24% year-to-date and an impressive 167% over the past year. This resilience suggests that while the market is in a consolidation phase, it is also preparing for potential new highs in the future.Analysts have pointed out that a bull flag is forming on Bitcoin’s charts, indicating that we might see new all-time highs later in 2024. This setup is crucial as altcoin sentiment is tightly linked to Bitcoin’s price movements.

How the Binance beef could ruin Nigeria's economy | Cryptopolitan

Nigeria’s currency, the naira, has hit rock bottom, making it the worst performer worldwide this past month. The exchange rate has dropped to a low of 1,466 to the dollar, the weakest since March 20, affected by a drastic reduction in available US dollars, which fell to just $84 million last Thursday.Razia Khan from Standard Chartered notes that $1.3 billion in naira futures will soon mature, potentially increasing dollar demand even more. This financial instability follows changes made by President Bola Tinubu, who loosened foreign-exchange controls last June.Since then, the naira has fallen by about 68%. According to Khan, the market saw a quick rise and subsequent fall in the naira value due to offshore investors cashing in, indicating that market forces are actively shaping the exchange rate.The Central Bank of Nigeria is now under pressure to hike interest rates again at its next meeting on May 21. Previously, rate increases totaling 600 basis points earlier this year helped the naira recover from a low of 1,627 naira to 1,072 by mid-April.Market Reactions and Further ComplicationsAbubakar Muhammed from Forward Marketing Bureau de Change Ltd. reported a 0.9% dip in the naira’s value on the unofficial market, driven by heightened demand from locals.Danelee Masia from Deutsche Bank highlighted that sluggish investor interest and diminishing reserves make the naira vulnerable to future dips, especially during the higher demand in Q3 and Q4 for the holiday season.Ayodele Salami from Emerging Markets Investment Management Ltd. pointed out that as one of Africa’s largest oil producers with limited refining capabilities, Nigeria is bleeding dollars for energy imports.This is exacerbating the currency’s weakness, a situation reflected in other African nations like Zambia and Ghana, both dealing with debt restructuring challenges that hinder their ability to attract new capital.Binance and Nigeria’s Foreign Investment DilemmaThe situation with Binance has thrown another wrench into Nigeria’s economic stability. Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, has accused Nigerian officials of seeking bribes, casting a long shadow over Nigeria’s investment climate. SBM Intelligence reports that these allegations and the subsequent detention of Binance executives could severely deter foreign investment.On February 26, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla of Binance assured their safety by Nigerian authorities, faced an abrupt shift in their treatment.Following a neutral initial meeting involving top Nigerian financial and security agencies, they were later held under stricter conditions, asked to delist the naira from Binance and provide detailed user data.Teng described how Binance was asked to delist the naira as a tradable asset and provide extensive user data to Nigerian authorities.The situation escalated quickly when Binance executives were taken to a high-security location and their personal freedoms severely restricted. He emphasized that these actions were taken without clear legal justification and communicated through aggressive and non-diplomatic channels.The CEO stressed that the ongoing detention of Binance personnel, particularly Tigran Gambaryan, is a misuse of authority by the Nigerian government and a misalignment with the international community’s standards of justice and business operations.In his plea, Teng highlighted Binance’s readiness to comply with local regulations and its past cooperative history with law enforcement worldwide. He pointed out that Binance has engaged more than 600 times voluntarily with law enforcement to ensure that their platform is not misused.Despite these efforts, the response from Nigerian authorities has been disproportionately harsh and unyielding. Teng called for a rational and fair resolution to the situation, urging the Nigerian government to consider the broader economic implications of their actions.He reiterated Binance’s commitment to constructive dialogue and legal compliance, hoping for a swift resolution that would allow detained employees to return home safely and for Binance to continue contributing positively to Nigeria’s economy.The ongoing detention has caused international dismay and could potentially label Nigeria as hostile to foreign enterprises.Despite Binance’s compliance and cooperation efforts, including shutting down certain operations as a gesture of good faith, the Nigerian government has yet to ease its grip.

Billion-Dollar Bank Prepares for $450,000,000 Fine From US Government for Failing To Effectively Detect, Report, and Respond to Suspicious Activity - The Daily Hodl


								Banking giant Toronto Dominion (TD) is preparing to pay nearly half a billion dollars in penalties over an inadequate anti-money laundering (AML) program.
In an announcement, TD says it has set aside an initial provision of $450 million to pay the US government over an AML program that was “insufficient to effectively monitor, detect, report, and respond to suspicious activity.”










According to the announcement from TD, the bank is in ongoing discussions with three US regulators, plus the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
TD says it expects more monetary penalties and that the initial provision does not “reflect the final aggregate amount of potential monetary penalties or any non-monetary penalties, which are unknown and not reliably estimable at this time.”
The bank now says it’s working to address the issues within its AML program.
“Work has been underway to remedy these deficiencies. 
TD is a strong institution with the capital, liquidity, and capacity to fund the critical effort currently underway to strengthen its AML program, invest in the business, and continue to serve its customers and clients with excellence.”
TD’s US arm, based in Wilmington, Delaware, has $367 billion in assets under management and is currently the 10th largest bank operating within the US.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe Says Big Moment Coming for Ethereum, Predicts Rally for Layer-1 Altcoin - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto strategist Michaël van de Poppe believes that Ethereum (ETH) is close to witnessing a big trend shift.
Van de Poppe tells his 717,600 followers on the social media platform X that he doesn’t expect the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve pending applications for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the coming weeks.










The SEC is slated to approve, delay or deny the ETH ETF applications by financial giants Hashdex and Ark 21Shares on May 30th after postponing it in March.
Van de Poppe predicts that the SEC’s decision will end up being a pivotal point for the top altcoin by market cap.
“This is a very likely scenario with Ethereum, through which the delay/denial in two weeks is the big moment of reversal for ETH and the markets.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will plunge below $2,700 before reversing and rallying to $3,800.
At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,920.
Next up is the layer-1 crypto project AIOZ (AIOZ). According to the analyst, he expects AIOZ to sustain its bullish momentum as long as it continues to trade above $0.65.
“This one looks very promising and is one of the strongest trending assets. 
In-trend level to hold: $0.65-0.68. 
If that’s lost, then the long-term investment region comes into play. 
If we hold, I expect $1.35-1.45 might seem next. 
Very strong one.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, AIOZ is trading for $0.795.
Another altcoin on the trader’s list is the Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB). Van de Poppe thinks that ARB is very close to carving a bottom.
“This one has a full correction and is at the end stage of the correction. Massive cascade in the past weeks, through which the markets often fill that wick in the weeks after. In that regard, markets are close to the end of the correction.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ARB will bottom out at around $0.90.
The last altcoin on Van de Poppe’s radar is the native asset of the video-sharing blockchain Verasity (VRA). According to the analyst, VRA is in a full-blown downtrend and may find support at $0.004
“A full retracement is happening, which is relatively common for altcoins in this stage of the cycle.
An important area of support, and I think most of the pain is already in.
This support has held in the past, and I expect to do the same here.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, VRA is worth $0.0051.

Bitcoin Runes Hype Simmers Down as Network Activity Plunges - DailyCoin


        
After setting the bar high with its launch, Runes has been performing below expectations.



Runes activity has plummeted significantly since launch, hitting rock bottom over the weekend.



The decline could be interpreted as a natural correction as the protocol finds its footing amid the miners’ exodus and declining network activity.
Bitcoin’s novel protocol, Runes, sparked quite the excitement with its launch, promising to bring significant revenue for miners by introducing memecoins into the foray through its platform. In its first week, starting April 19, the protocol’s high-profile debut spurred record network activity even after the halving, generating millions in transaction fees and leading everyone to assume that Runes would help offset the hit to block rewards. 
However, with Bitcoin now struggling to perform and miners exploring alternate options, Runes is struggling to live up to the hype. Rune Activity Plunges to the DepthsThree weeks ago, Runes made quite the splash with its grand entrance after raking in a whopping $135 million in transaction fees during its debut week. With the protocol making up nearly half of all transactions on Bitcoin, the anticipation surrounding it was sky-high, with many expecting it to maintain its momentum. However, the novel protocol’s journey has been far from expectations.Since setting the bar high in its first week, Runes activity has taken a nosedive, hitting rock bottom over the weekend. Data from Dune showed a severe decrease in total Runes minted, falling from a peak of 23,061 on April 26 to just 62 by May 12. Similarly, fees earned from Runes plummeted from a peak of $321,263 on April 26 to just $970 on May 12. While Runes still generates considerable fees on Bitcoin, according to data from the Block, the sum of fees generated has breached $1 million only twice in the past two weeks.
Nonetheless, even with network activity plunging, Runes’ decline isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm. Don’t Let it Rune Your DayRunes’ recent downturn could be seen as a natural correction as the protocol finds its ceiling and floor. The protocol continues to perform exceptionally well, with collections already surpassing market caps exceeding $100 million, according to data from Magic Eden.Runes are likely bearing the brunt of the miner exodus as Bitcoin miners weigh whether it’s worth continuing their operations. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty dropped by 6%, making the largest reduction since July 2021, suggesting that miners are leaving the network due to the hit on their profitability. To put things into perspective, daily mining revenue has stumbled from as high as $107.8 million before the reward halving to $29.9 million on Saturday, May 11, a 29-week low, according to data from Ycharts. Until miners regain confidence in the network and Bitcoin stabilizes in the current market conditions, Runes could remain a second thought for many. On the Flipside
Many developers are concerned that memecoins tarnish crypto’s long-term vision and drive developers away.



Experts suggest that memecoins’ success stems from human desperation to get rich quick.
Why This MattersRunes is undergoing a natural correction, so it would be unfair to call Runes a flop at this time, especially considering the protocol is just three weeks old. However, in hindsight, it does raise concerns for the network since Runes hoped to offset the hit to block rewards for miners, but it isn’t a strong enough reason to retain miners.ARK 21Shares kick staking component out of their proposal:ARK 21Shares Update ETH ETF Proposal: No More Staking Mark Cuban isn’t happy with the SEC:Mark Cuban Blasts SEC Chair Gensler’s Hostile Crypto Probe

Robinhood Crypto Revenue Triples Amid SEC Crackdown


																The popular millennial trading platform released its earnings report on May 8, beating analyst estimates.
According to its first-quarter results, Robinhood reported record revenues of $618 million, up 40% year-over-year.
Additionally, revenue from cryptocurrencies surged 232% to $126 million.
“Transaction-based revenues increased 59% year-over-year to $329 million, primarily driven by cryptocurrencies,” the firm stated.

Robinhood’s crypto revenue tripled in Q1 pic.twitter.com/Z6UtTWvz4C
— Jeff Roberts (@jeffjohnroberts) May 8, 2024





Robinhood Record Revenue
Net income for the first quarter totaled $157 million, or 18 cents a share. This eclipsed the 6-cent average estimate from analysts and compared to a loss of $511 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier.
The firm also did very well out of gold-based products, with gold subscribers increasing to a record high of 1.7 million in Q1.
Vlad Tenev, CEO and co-founder of Robinhood said, “We continued to aggressively execute on our product roadmap in Q1, leading to all-time highs for Net Deposits and Gold Subscribers.”
Robinhood is the latest target in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto crackdown. On May 4 it received a Wells notice from the regulator warning the firm that it is likely to face enforcement action regarding its crypto business.
The regulator made the same argument it has with most enforcement actions, namely that most tokens traded on Robinhood are securities and subject to SEC rules and registration requirements.
Tenev described the SEC action as a “disappointing development,” while chief financial officer Jason Warnick said, “So it’s disappointing to see more regulation by enforcement here.”
“We’ve run our crypto business very carefully. We’ve been very selective about the coins we offer, and we’ve not offered services that have been criticized by the SEC,” continued Warnick.
“The Wells Notice clouds the future of this income stream,” said Lauren Ashcraft, financial services analyst at Emarketer, according to Reuters.
Robinhood stock (HOOD) gained 5.2% in after-hours trading to reach $18.60. It is up 50% so far this year, according to MarketWatch.

                        Russian energy firms are preparing to “hunt down” private crypto miners and crack down on people mining cryptoassets at home, a report claimed on May 12.The media outlet Izvestia said the Russian Government Expert Council was preparing to send fresh mining-related proposals to the Cabinet.Lawmakers want to bundle the proposed measures in a new package of crypto laws. These laws also aim to legalize industrial crypto mining and ban most domestic exchanges.Crypto Miners: Russian Energy Firms to ‘Hunt’ Offenders
The media outlet noted that the council will send written proposals, which its reporters have already seen, to the Cabinet on May 16.The documents propose using electricity meter technology to identify suspected miners. Data analysts will “compare declared readings with actual electricity usage” using “remote checking solutions.”The document also explains how power firms will fine “illegal” miners. The document proposes allowing power companies to charge home-based offenders at “higher rates.”These rates are typically reserved for “industrial enterprises.”Energy Companies to Gain More Powers
Dmitry Tortev, of the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia, told the media outlet that the move would allow power providers to act without the need to go through the legal system. He said:“At present, electricity suppliers need to provide proof of crypto mining-related violations in court. That wastes these companies’ time and money. However, if a unified system for fines is developed at the federal level, this will speed up and intensify the fight against [illegal crypto mining].”Crypto mining remains extremely popular in Russia. But as the activity currently has no legal status, mining coins is currently neither illegal nor legal.Private mining is not illegal either, and at present, Russian power firms can only step in if they suspect individuals are stealing power from local grids.A Russian home crypto miner shows off his equipment. (Source: ProMining/YouTube)Systems Overloaded, Say Providers
The documents reportedly lament that the Russian energy system is “overloaded” in many areas.The authors say that this is resulting in “interruptions in the supply of electricity to consumers.” The document reportedly claims:“In some regions, there has been a significant increase in electrical energy consumption, [often] due to an increase in mining loads. This has led to […] local deficits in the south-eastern part of […] Siberia.”The documents’ authors also said shortages had been reported in “the Irkutsk-Cheremkhovo district of the Irkutsk region, the southern part of Buryatia, and certain parts of the Trans-Baikal region.”These are known crypto mining hotspots, popular for their low power rates and cold winters.Irkutsk in particular has become a hub for mining, both legal and illegal, in recent years. This has led the region to develop a somewhat complicated relationship with mining.An engineer working in a Russian industrial crypto mining data center. (Source: Nastoyashee Vremya Syuzhetiy/YouTube)Izvestia also quoted the Deputy Minister of Energy Pavel Snikkars as saying energy tariffs for miners should “increase in such a way as to encourage them to move away from energy-deficient areas.”The same ministry has previously floated proposals aimed at reducing the strain on overloaded networks.One included forcing industrial miners to shut off their rigs for certain fixed portions of the year.While these have been met with dismay by most miners, most industrial miners want Moscow to “hurry up” and legalize their sector.While this would mean they would have to begin paying taxes on their earnings, the biggest firms want legal clarity from Moscow before they make more data center-related investments.Sergei Bezdelov, the head of the Industrial Mining Association, said:“We have a positive attitude towards any measures aimed at creating conditions for the development of industrial mining in this country. We would be happy to invite inspections by power providers if that would be desirable. This will help bring this sector legitimacy in Russia”

Charles Hoskinson Warns CBDCs Could Imperil Financial Freedom


Cardano blockchain founder Charles Hoskinson spoke against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) while explaining the fundamental concept behind crypto.
Hoskinson made this statement in a May 11 social media post while expressing his views about the forthcoming US presidential elections.
Hoskinson Explains Why Crypto is Important
According to Hoskinson, the fundamental concept of cryptocurrency is to establish new social contracts. These contracts, he explained, would hold governments, corporations, and other authorities accountable to the people. He urged the industry to focus on advancing this purpose rather than engaging in arbitrary debates on taxes and regulations.
Hoskinson warned that those opposing the expansion of crypto might unwittingly endorse the concentration of power among the few. He cautioned that if the crypto industry fails to seize the opportunity, CBDCs could become the only viable alternative.

Consequently, these CBDCs would potentially escalate financial surveillance and citizen control, endangering user privacy and autonomy. Hoskinson furthered that governments might exploit CBDCs to manipulate information flows and hinder social mobility.

“Crypto gives us our voices, financial freedom, and shared humanity back. Any politician who wants to rob us of that is dangerous,” Hoskinson remarked.

The Cardano founder’s view on CBDCs echoes concerns shared by privacy advocates who perceive them as potential tools for extensive government surveillance and economic manipulation. Renowned author Robert Kiyosaki, famous for “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” recently warned of central banks exploiting CBDCs to infringe upon individuals’ privacy.

“Please be careful. Banking crisis worsens. Threat of war grows. Cental banks will push for CBDC, Cental Bank Digital Currency, to SPY on us. I am buying more Bitcoin and silver coins,” Kiyosaki said.

Despite such apprehensions, proponents argue that CBDCs could enhance transactional efficiency and bolster defenses against fraud in digital transactions. Joachim Nagel, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, highlighted the pressing need for central banks to reevaluate their business models and swiftly embrace CBDCs.

A CBDC is a blockchain-based iteration of government-issued currency. Compared to conventional banking infrastructure, it facilitates expedited settlement of fiat currency transactions for central banks, retail banks, and consumers. 
Notably, an overwhelming majority of nations and currency unions—134 in total, comprising 98% of global GDP—are contemplating CBDC implementation, a substantial surge from the 35 nations exploring it in May 2020. Presently, 68 countries are actively engaged in advanced stages of CBDC exploration, including development, pilot programs, or launch preparations.

“19 of the Group of 20 (G20) countries are now in the advanced stages of CBDC development. Of those, eleven countries are already in the pilot stage. This includes Brazil, Japan, India, Australia, South Korea, South Africa, Russia, and Turkey,” the Atlantic Council wrote.

Bitcoin whale wallets move $61M in BTC after a decade of dormancy

Two mysterious Bitcoin (BTC) wallets holding a combined 1,000 Bitcoin — worth $61 million at current prices — have suddenly awoken after a 10-year hiatus, transferring out almost every single satoshi.Wallet address “16vRq…qjzEa" transferred out its 500 Bitcoin at block 843,131 on May 12 at 7:10 pm UTC, while the other 500 Bitcoin was sent by address “1DUJuH…NgfC5” two blocks later, according to Blockchain.com’s Bitcoin block explorer.The wallets each received 500 Bitcoin on Sept. 12 and Sept. 13, 2013, when Bitcoin was priced at $134, according to CoinGecko. At current prices, the combined amount transferred is now worth 456 times more than their acquisition price, at $61.2 million.Since the transfers, one of the receiving addresses from “16vRq…qjzEa” has already transferred the 500 Bitcoin onward to a multitude of , while the receiver from “1DUJuH…NgfC5” is still holding its 500 Bitcoin. The proximity of the inward and outward transfers prompted blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain to pair the two transactions together, onlookers believe the two wallets were owned by the same person or entity.Source: LookonchainPrior to the transfers, the two addresses were the equal 4,353rd largest Bitcoin whales, according to BitInfoCharts.Less than a week ago, a Satoshi Nakamoto-era Bitcoin wallet transferred 687 Bitcoin, worth $43.9 million, to two separate addresses.Related: 'Epic sat' mined from fourth Bitcoin halving block sells for $2.1MWhile at least one of these early-day Bitcoin wallets tends to wake up each month, there are nearly 1.8 million Bitcoin addresses that have remained dormant for over a decade, according to a recent analysis by Chainalysis and Fortune.These wallets, which exclude Nakamoto’s wallet, contain about $121 billion worth of Bitcoin, Fortune said.While it is impossible to know how much this has been lost, the 1.8 million addresses account for 8.5% of the total 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist.People often speculate that dormant wallets may be waking up to sell Bitcoin at an opportune time,  others suggest it could be to transfer the funds to a different address, perhaps under a more secure noncustodial wallet service provider.Bitcoin is currently priced at $61,450 and is up 130% over the last 12 months, according to CoinGecko.Bitcoin’s change in price since April, 2013.

Bitcoin, Ethereum: Two levels where a swing trade could be profitable - AMBCrypto



Ethereum has a slightly more bullish bias for the coming week.
The Bitcoin consolidation phase was still ongoing, and a revisit to $60k was growing more likely.

Bitcoin [BTC] traders were going through a relatively tough period after the easy, straightforward rallies that have been the norm since last October.
Ethereum [ETH] has been more complicated, but BTC’s halving event last month has changed the market conditions to chop and range formations all over the market.
AMBCrypto investigated what the market sentiment was looking like over the weekend, and where this week’s price action could go.
One of the two has speculators expectant of bullish returns in the near term

The 10th of May saw an increase in the Bitcoin Open Interest, but the OI has been trending downward since the price spike on the 6th of May.
Meanwhile, the price also formed a series of lower highs over the past week, descending from $64k to $61.1k at press time.
The Funding Rate was negative at the start of May when Bitcoin plummeted to $56k. Since then, the Funding Rate has recovered.
However, in the past few days, it has been barely above zero, which indicated the sentiment was not strongly bullish.

Ethereum also saw Funding Rates slip into the negative territory in early May but has since recovered. The past week’s downtrend saw the funding rate hover around the baseline +0.01 mark.
A slight bounce from $2980 to $3040 on the 9th of May saw the Open Interest and the funding rate jump higher.
This did not repeat with Bitcoin despite a similar price bounce, which suggested that speculators were more eager to long ETH than BTC.
What are the next liquidity pockets that could attract prices?

The 7-day liquidation heatmap of Bitcoin showed a bright cluster of liquidations at the $60k area. To the north, $61.8k and $63k are the next bullish targets.
On the 5th of May, we saw prices jump above the $64k mark to collect liquidity before a brutal short-term reversal.
Similarly, we might see a downward plunge on Monday to collect the liquidity at $60k before rebounding higher. Hence, BTC traders would want to buy the dip to the $50.6k-$60k region.
However, traders must also be prepared for a move below $59.4k for BTC, and set their stop-losses accordingly in the event of a dip to $60k.


Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

On the other hand, Ethereum has a cluster of liquidity nearby to the north at $2950. This was close to the current market price of $2928. A dip to the $2860 region would likely present a buying opportunity.
The liquidation levels around the $3.1k-$3.2k area present an attractive target. A drop below $2.8k would likely herald a strong short-term downtrend, and traders can cut their losses in this scenario.

North Korean hackers deploy ‘Durian’ malware, targeting crypto firms

North Korean hackers are utilizing a “striking” new malware variant dubbed “Durian” to reportedly launch attacks on South Korean crypto firms.The North Korean hacking group Kimsuky used the new malware in a series of targeted attacks on at least two cryptocurrency firms so far, according to a May 9 threat report from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky. This was done through a “persistent” attack by exploiting legitimate security software used exclusively by crypto firms in South Korea. Source: KasperskyThe previously unknown Durian malware acts as an installer that deploys a continued stream of malware including a backdoor known as “AppleSeed,” a custom proxy tool known as LazyLoad, and other legitimate tools such as Chrome Remote Desktop.“Durian boasts comprehensive backdoor functionality, enabling the execution of delivered commands, additional file downloads, and exfiltration of files,” wrote Kaspersky.Additionally, Kaspersky noted that LazyLoad was also used by Andariel, a sub-group within fellow North Korean hacking consortium Lazarus Group — something that suggested a “tenuous” connection between Kimsuky and the more notorious hacking group. Related: North Korean Lazarus hacker group using LinkedIn to target and steal assets: ReportFirst emerging in 2009, Lazarus has established itself as one of the most notorious groups of crypto hackers. On April 29, independent blockchain sleuth ZachXBT revealed that the Lazarus group had successfully laundered over $200 million in ill-gotten crypto between 2020 and 2023.In total, the Lazarus Group is accused of stealing over $3 billion in crypto assets in the six years leading up to 2023.Lazarus was credited with stealing over 17% — a little over $309 million — of the total stolen funds in 2023.

Franklin Templeton CEO Excited About Future with On-Chain ETFs - DailyCoin


        
Franklin Templeton’s CEO is excited about the future of blockchain technology. 



Jenny Johnson cites eye-opening results from in-house experiments. 



Franklin Templeton is optimistic about integrating the technology into the firm’s operations. 
Blockchain technology and the crypto industry have recently gained favor among major financial institutions, marking a significant shift from just a few years ago. Back then, trillion-dollar asset management firms cast doubt on the space, branding it as a hotbed of fraud. However, the industry has evolved remarkably in recent years, winning over even the staunchest critics. Among them is Franklin Templeton’s CEO, Jenny Johnson, whose public support signals a seismic shift in perception. Franklin Templeton CEO Expresses Her Love For Blockchains“First of all, I am a huge fan of blockchain and the technology,” Jenny Johnson reiterated her unwavering support for blockchain technology during the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California. 
The Franklin Templeton CEO expressed her enthusiasm for blockchain’s potential, emphasizing her firm has been working on new ways to leverage the technology. During her interview, Johnson shared that the trillion-dollar asset management firm gained a lot of insights from in-house experiments comparing traditional and blockchain technologies. The results were eye-opening for Franklin Templeton, with Johnson expressing astonishment at the cost efficiency of blockchain technology compared to traditional methods.“We were astonished by how much less cost it was to run it on the blockchain. It’s a very effective technology, and we think it is going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities.” Johnson shared.Convinced by the technology’s potential, the CEO hinted at Franklin Templeton’s plans to explore new investment avenues, including on-chain ETFs and mutual funds. Johnson explained that navigating the currency financial infrastructure, particularly reconciling data across multiple systems, was particularly costly and time-consuming. With blockchain technology, Franklin Templeton can mitigate costs significantly and enhance its efficiency. Johnson expressed enthusiasm over opening up avenues for other investment opportunities. Optimism radiated from the CEO, who was particularly looking forward to using the technology for myriad applications within the firm. On the Flipside
Franklin Templeton launched the first US-registered fund using a public blockchain to process transactions and document share ownership.



Franklin Templton’s Bitcoin ETF held $365 million in assets under management at press time. 
Why This Matters A few years ago, blockchain technology and the crypto industry had a bad rap, primarily due to the prevalence of bad actors and scammers tarnishing the industry’s image. However, Jenny Johnson’s recent comments signal a major shift in the perception and highlight the remarkable progress the industry has made. It also underscores the growing willingness of major asset managers and institutions to delve into and incorporate blockchain technology into their operations.Are Bitcoin Runes a Flop?Bitcoin Runes Hype Simmers Down as Network Activity PlungesArk 21Shares cut staking from their ETF proposal:ARK 21Shares Update ETH ETF Proposal: No More Staking

Polkadot: THIS signals worrying signs for DOT - What should you do? - AMBCrypto



Social activity for the Polkadot network declined materially in the last few days.
The overall activity on the network also fell.

Polkadot [DOT] has been one of the L1s that has not seen as much growth as its counterparts. One of the reasons for the same would be the declining popularity of Polkadot across social media platforms.
Word on the street
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that the social volume for Polkadot declined significantly. Moreover, the Weighted Sentiment around DOT fell materially.
Source: Santiment
Nevertheless, Polkadot has been actively collaborating with a media agency to amplify awareness about the network.
eVox, a Media Agency & Content Creator Management firm, has dedicated several months to advancing the Polkadot cause.
Presently, they are aiming to extend this outreach effort to CoinMarketCap.
Source: X
It remains to be seen whether Polkadot’s efforts to improve its popularity can yield positive results in the long run.
Looking at the price
DOT wasn’t doing too well in terms of price movement, either. Since the 1st of April, its price fell by 27.96%. During this period, DOT showcased multiple lower lows and lower his, indicative of a bearish trend.
Moreover, the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) for DOT had grown slightly, implying that there could an uptick in the money flow for DOT going forward.
However, the RSI had declined to 42, implying that bullish momentum had fallen significantly. DOT would need to retest the $7.598 level a couple more times before it can start its journey upwards.
Source: Trading View
Coming to the state of the protocol, the situation looked quite dire. The number of active users on the Polkadot network declined significantly over the last 30 days.
The revenue generated by the network also declined during this period.

Read Polkadot’s [DOT] Price Prediction 2024-25

These factors suggested that not only was DOT not doing well in terms of its price and social activity, but the overall strength of its ecosystem was also declining.
It could be difficult for DOT to recover if things continue like this.

Mark Cuban Schools Crypto Critic, Blames SEC For FTX-Like Events: 'This Is An Institutional Failure' - Benzinga

Billionaire and prominent television celebrity, Mark Cuban, highlighted a host of cryptocurrency benefits in response to a supposed critic of the asset class.  What Happened: James Love, Director of an NGO Knowledge Ecology International, posed a sardonic question on the utility of cryptocurrencies to Cuban. He asked, "Other than speculation, avoiding taxes and engaging in criminal activity, what is the utility of crypto?"Cuban detailed various benefits of digital assets, including minimal transaction fees, easily accessible credit, and insulation against theft."For crypto: lower cost of capital transfers, immediate collateralized loans, store of value , tokenization of assets, application and retention of royalties to digital assets like books,  real time, low cost insurance markets , cold storage ownership of significant assets to protect against theft," the entrepreneur argued. Regarding incidents like the FTX collapse which questioned the market's credibility, Cuban pinned it on the SEC. "This is an institutional failure of the SEC, not a crypto issue," he asserted. "If the SEC has instituted audited collateral and segregation of funds requirements, we would not have seen FTX and others fail."Why It Matters: Mark Cuban, one of the most influential voices in the crypto space, has advocated for clarity in legal frameworks governing digital assets. Like most influencers, he has criticized the SEC’s overbearing approach to the matter, and blamed SEC Chair Gary Gensler for making it impossible for cryptocurrency companies to function in the United States.With an energetic pro-crypto campaign launched by former U.S. president and current Republican candidate, Donald Trump, many of the players in the space have extended their unequivocal support to the firebrand leader.Photo: Courtesy of Gage Skidmore on FlickerPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin BTC/USD was trading at $61,037, following a marginal 0.25% growth in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.Read Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Trade Mixed After Turbulent Week: Analyst Says King Crypto Can Rise To $76K Level If It Reclaims This Crucial Support

Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) to Skyrocket 17,000% as ByBit Listing Announced, as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Black Donald Trump (BLATRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because BLATRUMP has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on ByBit.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Black Donald Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Black Donald Trump could become the next viral memecoin.



Black Donald Trump launched with over $54,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Black Donald Trump on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the ByBit listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Black Donald Trump by entering its contract address – 29BiHVTBEo7RnbtwqwTmV3Hy6nDTadcCgopM6HUyjGRK – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BLATRUMP.

PEPE nears breakout? A bullish pattern is set in motion - AMBCrypto



PEPE’s price increased by more than 3% in the last seven days. 
The meme coin might face resistance at $0.0000092 before retesting its ATH.

Pepe [PEPE] might once again come into the spotlight, as it was fast approaching its all-time high. 
In fact, a bullish pattern had formed on its chart, which indicated that the meme coin to go further above its ATH was high. Let’s take a closer look at what’s going on. 
PEPE is on the right track
AMBCrypto reported earlier that PEPE was heading towards its ATH to retest that level. The trend continued as the meme coin came closer to testing its ATH. 
In fact, Crypto Tony, a popular crypto analyst, also pointed out this development in a recent tweet. 
As the meme coin was on track to test its ATH, its price increased by more than 3.6% in the last seven days.
 At the time of writing, the meme coin was trading at $0.000008732 with a market capitalization of over $3.67 billion. 
The possibility of PEPE going above its ATH seemed likely to happen in the coming days as a bullish ascending triangle pattern emerged. 
The meme coin’s price has started to consolidate inside the bull pattern since the 1st of April. At press time, it was on the verge of breaking out of the pattern. A few of the metrics suggested a successful breakout.
Source: TradingView
For example, PEPE’s price remained above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick, hinting at a continued price increase. 
However, a few of the indicators suggest otherwise. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp decline. 
The Money Flow Index (MFI) also, after a comfortable rise, went down slightly, which might restrict PEPE from breaking above the pattern. 
What metrics suggest
AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data to see whether metrics supported the possibility of PEPE breaking above the pattern. We found that PEPE’s MVRV ratio remained positive last week. 
At press time, the metric had a value of nearly 15%. However, the meme coin’s open interest dropped. 
Additionally, sentiment around PEPE started to turn bearish, as evident from the decline in its Weighted Sentiment.

AMBCrypto then checked Hyblock Capital’s data to find out if there were any roadblocks for the meme coin ahead of its ATH. As per our analysis, PEPE’s liquidation would rise sharply near $0.0000092. 
A rise in liquidation often results in a price correction. Therefore, it will be crucial for the meme coin to go above that level in order to test its ATH and possibly go above it.

Franklin Templeton CEO: Blockchain offers major cost savings for tokenization - Crypto Briefing




Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, speaking at the 27th Annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California, praised blockchain’s efficiency and cost reduction in asset tokenization and shared her thoughts on the benefits of generative AI.Johnson stated that the company ran a parallel experiment for six to eight months, processing account records using both traditional and blockchain methods. The results showed that blockchain was more cost-effective and produced fewer errors.
“We used to run our own in-house, one of the few firms that did. And the one that we built on blockchain. So these are the records of the shareholders and we parallel process for a period of 6 to 8 months,” Johnson said.
“And we were astonished by how much less, how much cost it was to run a blockchain. It’s a very effective technology, and we think it is going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities,” she emphasized.
Johnson predicts that all ETFs and mutual funds could eventually transition to blockchain technology. She believes this shift would lead to significant cost savings due to the elimination of data verification between different systems on the blockchain.
“Eventually, I think exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain,” Johnson stated.
“In the case of blockchain, there’s only one source of trust. That transaction happens, everybody has the source of trust, and so that drives out a lot of costs. And when you can drive out the friction in transactions, you can start to invest in new areas,” she explained.
Franklin Templeton is behind one of the world’s leading equity tokenized funds, the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), represented by the BENJI token. As of May 12, the BENJI token had a market capitalization of $368 million, according to Dune Analytics.Data is the next oilIn addition to tokenization, Johnson also discussed the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in assisting asset managers to better meet customers’ needs.According to her, “data is the next oil next year.” She believes that large asset managers will have an edge in the AI race because these firms have much proprietary data to analyze and train AI models.Johnson said Franklin Templeton has introduced an AI bot to their help desk to assist with handling inquiries, and the bot is capable of handling 60% of queries.However, the real potential is “a model that’s leveraging a bunch of different AI,” she noted. She believes these advancements could pave the way for highly personalized investment strategies.

This Week's US Inflation Reports Are Expected to Shake Crypto Markets


																Crypto markets remained flat over the weekend following a fall last week, dropping total capitalization to $2.38 trillion.
This week’s economic calendar could induce more volatility as key inflation data is reported alongside a number of Federal Reserve speeches, which could indicate the direction of monetary policy going forward.
Economic Calendar
Tuesday will see the release of the core PPI (Producer Price Index) report, which reflects input prices for producers and manufacturers, measuring the costs of producing consumer goods and directly affecting retail pricing.
It is viewed as a pre-indicator of inflationary pressures, making it a leading indicator for the following month’s CPI (Consumer Price Index) report.






April’s Core CPI report is released on Wednesday. This is one of the two key indicators used to measure inflation, the second being Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE.
CPI directly shapes price trends in the economy, consumer spending, and business outlooks. It also directly impacts the Federal Reserve’s policy rate decisions.
“If CPI inflation rises again this week, it will mark the third straight monthly increase,” observed the Kobeissi Letter.
There are also a total of 12 Federal Reserve speaker events this week, including chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday.
According to a Conference Board measure of company CEO expectations survey last week, the majority of US CEOs expect the Fed to cut rates just once this year.
Out of 136 CEOs surveyed, 31% said they do not expect any rate cuts this year, while 26% project 2. “Meanwhile, markets are pricing just 2 rate cuts this year as a base case with the first cut in September,” reported Kobeissi.
Interestingly, Elon Musk took a swipe at the Fed over the weekend, comparing it to the Monopoly board game. He specifically referenced a section of the rules referring to the in-game bank, which says the bank never goes bankrupt and can print new money when needed.


Crypto Market Outlook
Crypto markets remain subdued this Monday morning in Asia, with little movement among most of the majors.
Bitcoin prices were around $61,000 at the time of writing having remained at almost the same time as yesterday. The asset is down 4.3% since the same time last week, however.
Ethereum has failed to recover above $3,000 following a fall below it on May 10 and remains short-term bearish at $2,900 at the time of writing.
The altcoins were predominantly in the red, with larger losses for Solana, Dogecoin, Avalanche, and Near Protocol.

Decade-old Bitcoin wallets make a $60 million exit: What's going on? - AMBCrypto



Two wallets sell over $60 million worth of BTCs.
Key metrics have declined recently.

Recently, two wallets, which had remained inactive for several years, have initiated movement, transferring all their Bitcoin [BTC] holdings. 
This action coincides with a decline in key on-chain metrics and heightened levels of greed in the Bitcoin market.
Bitcoin wallets rake in millions of dollars in gains
Recent data from Lookonchain revealed that two Bitcoin wallets, which have been dormant for nearly 11 years, have recently become active. These wallets, each containing 500 BTC, sold their entire holdings. 
Data showed that BTC was priced at $124 when they were purchased years ago, bringing each wallet’s value to approximately $62,000. 
Also, with the current Bitcoin price, the wallets sold their holdings for over $30 million each, totaling approximately $60.9 million. 
Furthermore, this significant move raises the question whether it will trigger reactions from key on-chain metrics that have recently experienced declines.
Bitcoin key metrics declines
According to Santiment data, Bitcoin has experienced significant declines in daily active addresses, transaction volume, and whale transactions. 
Analysis of the data revealed that these metrics saw significant declines following their peaks in February. Also, they are currently approaching historic lows. 
Towards the end of April, daily active addresses exceeded 815,000, transaction volume surpassed 1.5 million, and whale transactions totaled over 73,500. 
Source: Santiment
However, as of this writing, daily active addresses have decreased to around 545,000, transaction volume has fallen to approximately 495,000, and whale transactions have reduced to around 26,500.
Greed dominates the Bitcoin sentiment
According to the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, BTC was currently in the Greed zone at the time of this writing. 
The analysis of the Index revealed that BTC had a score of 56, indicating a sentiment of greed among investors. This suggests that more people were entering the BTC market to capitalize on potential profits.
 However, given the decline in key metrics that BTC was experiencing, and the recent sell-off witnessed, this could lead to a price decline.
BTC stays above 60,000 for now
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the Bitcoin daily timeframe price trend revealed that it was trading at around $61,100, representing a less than 1% increase at this time.

This slight uptick followed its previous trading session in the $60,000 price zone. However, examining the stochastic indicator indicated a potential price reversal on the horizon.
Typically, a crossover in the blue or red line of the indicator could signal an impending reversal in price direction.

Phishing Alert for BounceBit (BB) Amid New Listings


BounceBit, a Bitcoin (BTC) restaking protocol, announced the official launch of its mainnet at 02:30 UTC today. Shortly after, from 08:30 to 10:00 UTC, the company will start its BB token airdrop.
Additionally, the much-anticipated listing of BB tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges KuCoin and Gate.io is set to expand its market presence. Both exchanges will begin trading operations for BB tokens starting at 10:00 UTC today.
BounceBit Trading Begins; Watch Out for Phishing
However, a cybersecurity alert has tempered the excitement. The Chief of Information and Security Officer at SlowMist, known as 23pds, has flagged a significant risk. The first Google search result for “BounceBit” is a phishing site called bouncbit.io, posing threats to users’ safety.

“Clicking it will jump to the phishing website bouncbit[.]io. Please be aware of the risks,” 23pds warned.

Following the warning, BounceBit has shared official airdrop and customer support links on its X (Twitter) account. It also warned that any tweets below its official announcement thread that use its name and post links are likely scams.

The launch of BounceBit mainnets and BB token airdrop came after the protocol secured a $6 million seed funding earlier this year. Blockchain Capital and Breyer Capital co-led this round, with participation from various venture capital entities and angel investors. Furthermore, in April, Binance Labs, Binance’s venture capital and incubation arm, invested an undisclosed amount in BounceBit.
At its heart, BounceBit introduces a BTC restaking mechanism. It is launching a Shared-Security Clients (SSC) infrastructure, starting with the BTC Restaking Chain.
This mechanism involves a dual-token system where validators stake both BTC and BB. Therefore, such a mechanism enhances the platform’s security and stability.

As of May 13, DeFiLlama reports BounceBit has a total value locked (TVL) of $448.65 million. Given its backing, it is plausible that BounceBit’s mainnet launch and BB tokens airdrop catch the crypto community’s interest and attract scammers.

El Salvador's Bitcoin Strategy Advances with Public Mempool


El Salvador, a Latin American country famous for adopting Bitcoin (BTC) as its legal tender, recently made a significant move in its cryptocurrency investment strategy. The government now offers public access to Bitcoin investment data through a personalized mempool.
The latest mempool data reveals that El Salvador currently holds 5,748.76 BTC valued at over $352.8 million.
El Salvador Adds Transparency to Its Bitcoin Investments
The Bitcoin Office, a Salvadoran government-owned body aimed at managing all projects related to BTC, announced this new feature through their official X (Twitter) account on May 12.

“El Salvador now has its own mempool space where anyone can consult our Bitcoin treasury holdings,” The Bitcoin Office noted.

In addition to tracking the holdings, El Salvador’s mempool data unveils that the government has purchased an additional 31 BTC over the last month. This purchase is a part of the Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy announced by President Nayib Bukele in November 2022. BeInCrypto previously reported that Bukele said his administration would buy 1 BTC daily “until Bitcoin became unaffordable with fiat currencies.”

The crypto community also welcomed El Salvador’s mempool. They praised its transparency in El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings. Criptolawyer, a prominent Latin American crypto community figure and founder of Bitcoin legal advisor and consultant—Legalrocks, expressed her support.

“The Government of El Salvador publishes its holdings in BTC so that anyone in the world at any time can audit their Bitcoin reserves in real-time,” Criptolawyer said.

Despite the government’s strong BTC investment strategy, the adoption rate of Bitcoin in El Salvador remains modest. According to a study from José Simeón Cañas Central American University, only 12% of the local population in El Salvador used Bitcoin at least once to pay for goods and services in 2023.

This figure is a significant drop from 2022. During that period, 24.4% of Salvadorans had engaged in Bitcoin transactions.

Peter Schiff Says He Gets A 'Kick' Out Of Fanatics Accusing Him Of Secretly Owning Bitcoin: They Are 'Drunk On The Kool-Aid' - Benzinga

Noted economist and staunch Bitcoin BTC/USD critic, Peter Schiff, ridiculed opponents’ claims that he secretly owns the King Crypto.What Happened: The gold proponent trashed the ongoing speculation from certain section of his critics, calling them "drunk on the Kool-Aid.""I get a kick out of Bitcoin fanatics who accuse me of secretly owning Bitcoin, but refusing to publicly wear the ribbon," Schiff jabbed the pro-Bitcoin crowd. Schiff added that he fundamentally differed over the prospect of cryptocurrencies, and his detractors were finding it tough to come to terms with this fact.Why It Matters: One of the strongest anti-Bitcoin voices on social media, Schiff has stayed persistent in his opposition to the asset class over the years, vehemently advocating for gold over its so-called digital counterpart.That said, in one of the interviews in March, he wished he bought the the world's largest digital asset back in 2010, given its profit potential. Schiff stated that even if he had bought Bitcoin, he would have kept it to himself. “I would have bought it just betting on other people being dumb enough to buy it and pay a higher price.”Earlier this month, the fierce critic noted that Bitcoin was in a bear market and mocked HODLers, a crypto jargon for long-term holders of the coin, saying, "The party is over."Photo Courtesy: Wikimedia CommonsPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $60,807, following a 0.16% decline in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. It was down 18% from the all-time high set during March.Gold was seen trading at $2,357 as of 11:40 p.m. EDT, down 0.11% in the last 24 hours.
