Arbitrage opportunity as Monero trades with a 10% premium on the streets


    Multiple cryptocurrency exchanges started delisting Monero (XMR) due to its privacy features, which have created arbitrage opportunities in parallel markets.



In particular, Monero is already the third most traded currency against Bitcoin (BTC) in the popular peer-to-peer no-KYC platform Bisq. The “privacy-by-default” cryptocurrency slightly loses in volume for the U.S. dollar (USD) and the euro (EUR) on Bisq.



As of this writing, the “Street Price” index on monero.boats calculate a $156.75 price for XMR. This index refers to coins being traded more organically, like cash, as if they were exchanged on the street.

The street price index is calculated using the last exchange rate of Monero against Bitcoin—Bisq’s base pair. XMR is currently at 0.00224374 BTC, showing a consolidation pattern following the sell-off from Binance’s delisting.

Monero price analysis and arbitrage



Notably, the TradingView price index shows Monero trades at an average of $143.09 on major exchanges. XMR has been showing strong momentum as the price recovers from Binance‘s delisting drop to $101, testing psychological support.



Before that, Monero’s exchange rate against the dollar was above $165, with a year-to-date high of $174.36. Technical indicators suggest a bullish forecast for the leading privacy coin trading above the 30-day exponential moving average (30-EMA). Moreover, its daily relative strength index (RSI) highlights the steady growth and future projections at 67.76.

Right now, there is a 9.5% premium for Monero exchanged on the “streets” than the trading price on exchanges. This presents traders with an arbitrage opportunity that could work as fuel for an incoming price surge on the mainstream.



However, it is important to understand that low-volume markets, like Bisq, usually follow the price of high-volume markets during arbitrages.



What is an arbitrage opportunity?



An arbitrage opportunity in trading arises when an asset trades at different prices in different markets. Traders can exploit this price discrepancy by simultaneously buying the asset in the lower-priced market and selling it in the higher-priced one.



The main risk associated with arbitrage is that prices may change quickly, eliminating the opportunity for profit. Traders must also consider transaction costs, which can erode potential gains.



In the case of Monero, the 9.5% premium in street markets presents an arbitrage opportunity. Traders could buy XMR on mainstream exchanges and sell it in parallel economies like Bisq to pocket the difference.



Nevertheless, they must be cautious of the risks associated with dealing in unregulated markets. Additionally, the limited liquidity in street markets may make it difficult to execute large trades without affecting prices. Despite the risks, the significant price difference between the two markets makes this an attractive opportunity for traders willing to navigate the challenges.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $5 billion market cap in the first half of 2024


    As the cryptocurrency market rebounds from a recent downturn, investor sentiment is shifting positively, suggesting a potential upswing.



This surge is anticipated to push several altcoins beyond the $5 billion market cap mark, signifying a major milestone in their valuation and influence within the broader cryptocurrency landscape.



Finbold has highlighted two cryptocurrencies likely to surpass this threshold. These assets are nearing the milestone, with their trajectory dependent on the continuation of the bull run and factors like supply inflation. 







High supply inflation could increase their market cap even if their prices remain unchanged.



Aptos (APT)



Aptos (APT) recently set a new record in daily transaction volume, reaching 115 million transactions in a single day, surpassing Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) networks. The platform demonstrates impressive scalability, handling 32,000 transactions per second (TPS).



A key driver of this activity is the game Tapos Cat, which has significantly increased network usage.

Aptos is also expanding its ecosystem with strategic partnerships and integrations in the DeFi and NFT markets. Despite recent price volatility, its resilience and robust infrastructure support future growth. At press time, Aptos is trading at $9.14 with a market cap of $3.99 billion.



Render (RNDR)



Render (RNDR) offers blockchain-based rendering services for content creators and developers, driving its unique market appeal. Despite price fluctuations, Render has shown a steady upward trend, with a 23% increase in the past month and a 5% rise in the last week. 



This momentum has pushed its market cap considerably.



Render price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap



One of the reasons for the surge in price for AI tokens such as RNDR was the success of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia’s achievements in the AI sector have significantly boosted market confidence, driving substantial gains for these tokens.



Recently, a position trader booked an estimated $13.2 million (345%) profit from Render. Nvidia’s progress in AI has led to significant gains for AI tokens, particularly after its earnings call.



Render’s growing ecosystem includes new partnerships and integrations with major digital content platforms and decentralized applications (dApps). This expansion enhances its utility and market presence. 



Currently, Render is trading at $10.02 with a market cap of $3.89 billion, showing strong potential to surpass its all-time high set in March 2024. 



Key technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum, making Render a compelling investment ahead of the anticipated market upswing.



As these platforms continue to innovate and expand their use cases, achieving a $5 billion market cap seems increasingly likely.



It’s worth noting that despite being supported by several fundamentals, the possibility of the highlighted cryptocurrencies reaching the $5 billion mark will largely depend on whether the market maintains a bullish momentum.

Onchain Data Reveals: This Altcoin Broke Two Records - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Onchain data, an altcoin broke a new record in the number of daily transactions made by its users.
Aptoscan, the block explorer of the Aptos (APT) network, broke a new record with 97.48 million user transactions in one day on May 24. This record was previously held by another layer 1 blockchain network, Sui, with 65 million transactions.


In addition, Aptos users' TPS value, which is the transaction speed per second, reached 27,000, which is a record.
The reason for these records is thought to be a game released on the Aptos network.






Aptos, which has a market value of approximately $4 billion, is the 26th largest blockchain in the world at the time of writing. However, with the overall market rally and the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, Aptos' rise this week has been around 11%. This puts APT among the altcoins that have risen the most this week.
Aptos, which is listed on Binance, Coinbase and Upbit, among the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is trading at a level much lower than the all-time high price record of $ 19.90, which was reached in January last year.

Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) Will Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BUTSUCKS will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Buterin Sucks.



Currently, Buterin Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BUTSUCKS on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Buterin Sucks by entering its contract address – jr8okimfHEWaJpDmiZenkGWHzEr5bb53bDZf4kQvF7w – in the receiving field.




BUTSUCKS currently has a market cap of just under $12,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Crypto Investor Loses $6.9 Million to Phishing Scam


A cryptocurrency investor recently lost millions to a sophisticated phishing scam. Scam Sniffer, a Web3 anti-scam firm, reported that the investor was tricked into signing a malicious Permit phishing signature. 
This authorization led to the theft of 1,807 Ether.fi-Liquid1 tokens, valued at $6.9 million. Moreover, blockchain investigator ZachXBT noted that the same investor fell victim to a phishing attack last year, losing $638,000.
Pink and Inferno Drainer Linked to Attack

The scam involved using a permit function, allowing an off-chain authorization signature to execute transactions on another address’s behalf. This method enabled the transfer of tokens without on-chain transactions, facilitating the theft.
The theft involved two wallets, 0xE56978, from the scammer and 0xFC4EA, belonging to a drainer. Notably, the stolen funds remain within these addresses.
Meanwhile, MistTrack, a crypto tracking and compliance platform built by SlowMist, found connections to the Pink and Inferno Drainers, notorious draining-as-a-service (DAAS) providers in the theft. The drainers offer scammers tools for phishing exploits, such as fake social media accounts and websites, in exchange for a cut of the stolen funds. BeInCrypto reported that these services were used to steal $295 million from 324,000 victims in 2023.

“Another huge amount of phishing, nearly 7 million USD of ETH pledged assets… from the old phishing gang Inferno Drainer. The reason is that the relevant permit offline authorization signature was phished away. Are there still many people who haven’t heard of the phishing tricks or rumors of ‘1click f#ck?’ I hope the victims can come forward to tell their own stories, especially what wallets they used,” Yu Xian, founder of SlowMist, commented.

Last week, Pink Drainer announced its retirement after amassing $85 million in stolen assets. Around the same period, Inferno Drainer resumed operations after a brief hiatus, citing increased demand and competitors’ exit.

This incident further shows that phishing attacks remain a prevalent method for stealing digital assets. Scammers often use fake accounts on social media platforms to impersonate legitimate projects. These accounts may display fake verification marks and post deceptive comments to lure users to malicious websites that drain their assets.

il Capo Discussed Bitcoin and the Long-Term Future of the Market in a Statement: How Will the US Elections Affect Prices? - Bitcoin Sistemi

Il Capo of Crypto, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst, recently shared his theory on the potential impact of the upcoming elections on the crypto market.
According to Il Capo, Donald Trump has already taken significant steps to gain votes from the crypto community. This strategy includes accepting campaign donations in cryptocurrencies, openly supporting the crypto industry, and promising to release Ross Ulbricht at the beginning of his term. Il Capo also predicts that Trump will announce significant tax benefits for crypto users.


Data shows that 14.4% of American adults own or use cryptocurrencies. However, when potential voters who are cryptocurrency users are considered, this rate increases to 22%. Il Capo states that a large part of this number would have voted for Trump before these statements, while another large part would not vote for Trump even with this new approach.
According to Il Capo, Democrats will sooner or later realize that they have lost this battle to win voters from the crypto industry.





Out of pride, they may decide to continue attacking the crypto ecosystem even harder rather than trying to win votes from the crypto community. Il Capo reminds that the US government holds approximately $15 billion worth of crypto and says they will probably sell these cryptos to raise money for the election campaign, to drive down prices to have more arguments to attack the industry, and to prevent leaving these assets to the next president.

Il Capo expects Trump to continue to take a pro-crypto stance in the coming months and Biden in the next few weeks. However, he predicts that Biden will eventually become even more aggressive towards the crypto industry. This would fit a scenario where prices continue to rise for a few more weeks but then see a significant correction before the elections (possibly from July-August to November).


According to Il Capo, the future of the market will depend on who will be elected. According to the analyst, if Trump is elected, 2025 could be a very good year for the market.

Woman To Serve About Seven Years Behind Bars for Laundering Bitcoin Proceeds of $6,400,000,000 Fraud: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A Chinese woman charged for her role in laundering the proceeds of a multi-billion dollar fraud scheme is now reportedly behind bars.
According to Reuters, Wen Jian was sentenced to six years and eight months in prison on Friday after jurors found her guilty of one count of money laundering in March.










Prosecutors say that Wen converted Bitcoin (BTC) into cash and property to hide the source of money that was purportedly stolen from nearly 130,000 investors in a $6.4 billion wealth scheme that took place in China between 2014 and 2017.
The scheme is believed to have been masterminded by another woman who fled to Britain in 2017 after Chinese authorities started their investigation. Wen allegedly served as the front person who helped convert the stolen funds into Bitcoin to take them out of China.
Wen denied the money laundering accusations, saying she did not have knowledge of criminality linked to Bitcoin. She claims she was just trying to give her son a better life, but prosecutors say she should have known that the money was illegally obtained.
Judge Sally-Ann Hales says there is no indication that Wen was involved in the underlying fraud, but reportedly told the 42-year-old that “no doubt that you knew” she was dealing with criminal property.
The case involves one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures by law enforcement in the world. In 2021, British police officers conducting investigations seized wallets with over 61,000 BTC valued at around $1.8 billion at the time. The confiscated BTC is now worth around $4.2 billion at Bitcoin’s current price of $69,227.61.

Trump Vows U.S. Dominance in Cryptocurrency Industry, Criticizes Biden's Stance



                    

The United States should aim for the top spot in the cryptocurrency industry, according to former U.S. President Donald Trump.



“Our country must be the leader in the field, there is no second place,” Trump asserted in a May 25 post on Truth Social, a social media platform owned by Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG).




Expressing his enthusiasm for the burgeoning industry, Trump stated, “I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry.” 



He then criticized the current president, Joe Biden, his opponent in the upcoming 2024 presidential election, scheduled for November 4.



“CROOKED JOE BIDEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE WORST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, WANTS IT TO DIE A SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH. THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN WITH ME!” Trump proclaimed.




These remarks were made ahead of his planned speech at the Libertarian Party’s National Convention in Washington on the same day.

Trump’s recent positive stance on crypto has heightened industry expectations about his potential electoral success.



According to Polymarket, a New York-based crypto prediction platform, Trump currently has a 56% chance of winning the election, while President Joe Biden holds a 38% chance.




This comes shortly after Trump announced that his presidential campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations. 



On May 21, the Trump 2024 campaign launched a fundraising page allowing eligible donors to contribute in crypto via the Coinbase Commerce platform.



The website displayed logos for several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Shiba, XRP, USD Coin, SOL, and 0x (ZRX).



In addition to his public endorsements of crypto, Trump has reportedly engaged with crypto enthusiasts.



Cointelegraph recently reported that individuals who purchased Trump’s “Mugshot” non-fungible tokens (NFTs) had the chance to dine with him on May 8 at his Mar-a-Lago residence.



This dinner was part of the agreement associated with buying the digital trading cards, which feature his mugshot taken during his surrender at the Fulton County Jail in Georgia.

JUST IN: Legendary Trader GCR Says Heavily Invested in This Altcoin, It's Actually Fake! He Reveals He Was Hacked - Bitcoin Sistemi


GCR, who has become almost legendary in the cryptocurrency market and is one of the most well-known analysts, announced today that he has a large investment in an altcoin via address X.

Donald Trump: 'I Will Ensure That The Future Of Crypto And Bitcoin Will Be Made In The USA' - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump has doubled down on his support for cryptocurrencies, saying at the Libertarian National Convention that he would ensure that the future of crypto and Bitcoin BTC/USD “will be made in the USA.”What Happened: Trump also said he would support “the right to self-custody” and promised the audience to “keep Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) away” from their Bitcoin. Trump additionally reiterated his promise to “never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.”During his speech, Trump promised to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the convicted Silk Road founder serving a double life sentence for his role in the marketplace’s creation.Prior to the event, Trump had written on his Truth Social social media platform that he is “positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies” and all things related to “this new and burgeoning industry.” He stated that the United States must be “the leader in this field” and accused President Joe Biden of wanting it “to die a slow and painful death.”See Also: Was Cathie Wood Right About Crypto As An Issue In 2024 White House Race? ‘You Can't Be On The Wrong SideWhy It Matters: The statement followed Trump’s recent embrace of cryptocurrencies, which marks a 180-degree turn from his position a few years ago when he called Bitcoin “a scam.”Over the last few weeks, Donald Trump started accepting cryptocurrency donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum ETH/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD and the Trump-themed Maga Memecoin TRUMP/USD. He also vowed to build a “crypto army” in opposition to Warren’s “anti-crypto army.”Though some see Trump’s pivot towards crypto as “just another cow to milk,” Trump has been on the record saying that he is "having fun with crazy new currencies."His call to crypto supporters to “better vote for Trump” is seen by industry experts as a contributing factor to the Democratic Party softening its stance on restrictive cryptocurrency regulation.What’s Next: The role of crypto policy for the future of the digital asset space is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: Ethereum ETF Approved, Elon Musk Mourns Kabosu’s Death, Trump Embraces Crypto Donations And More: Top Cryptocurrency UpdatesImage: Shutterstock

According to Saylor, the SEC’s recent approval of several Ethereum ETFs showed the crypto industry’s growing political influence. Last week, the financial regulator unexpectedly approved several ETH-related financial instruments, with many industry insiders suggesting this reversal might have political motivations. 
As such, several stakeholders suggested the approval highlighted a positive shift in President Joe Biden’s stance towards cryptocurrencies.

“Is this good for Bitcoin or not? Yeah, I think it’s good for Bitcoin, in fact, I think it may be better for Bitcoin because I think that we are politically much more powerful and supported by the entire crypto industry,” Saylor said.

Michael Saylor believes the Ethereum ETFs will boost the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to him, more institutions will now recognize crypto as a legitimate asset class and allocate capital across various cryptocurrencies. However, he maintains Bitcoin would receive the largest share of these investments as the “leader” of the market.

“I think mainstream investors will say oh there is a crypto asset class now, maybe we’ll allocate 5% or 10% to the crypto asset class, but Bitcoin will be 60% or 70% of that,” Saylor noted.

The MicroStrategy chairman also seized the opportunity to express confidence in Bitcoin’s future. Saylor and his company hold a significant position in the top cryptocurrency and have consistently maintained a pro-BTC disposition. The Virginia-based company is the largest public holder of Bitcoin and has amassed over 214,000 BTC, valued at approximately $15 billion.

“I’m quite the optimist, I actually think that Bitcoin is going to succeed, it is succeeding, it’s succeeding as fast as it could reasonably succeed, and we ought to try to avoid the tendency to [mess] with it,” Saylor chimed.

Meanwhile, Saylor’s current stance on Ethereum has significantly shifted from his previous position. Earlier, he stated that the SEC would classify ETH as a security under its regulatory purview. He predicted that other cryptos, including BNB, Solana, and XRP, would suffer the same fate.

“None of [these tokens] will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” he claimed.

Trump Vows To Commute Sentence Of Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht Amid Boos And Jeers At Libertarian Convention - Benzinga

In a speech before the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday night where Donald Trump was consistently booed and jeered, the former president promised to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the online illegal drug marketplace Silk Road."And if you vote for me, on Day One, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht," Trump said, moments after mentioning his plans to pardon supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Ulbricht is serving a double life sentence for his role in creating the infamous Silk Road marketplace on the dark web that accepted nearly $1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) for payments for the sale of heroin, cocaine, LSD and other illegal drugs.Trump's comments seemed geared toward Libertarian voters who generally support the legalization of all drugs and have long lobbied for the release of Ulbricht. Politico reported that Ulbricht supporters distributed hundreds of black and white signs reading "Free Ross" and "waved them manically in the moments after Trump's announcement."Libertarians garnered only 1.2% of the national vote in 2020, or about 1.8 million votes, but the 2024 election could be decided by very few votes in several battleground states.Meanwhile, Trump has called for the death penalty for drug dealers on various occasions, despite having pardoned several people convicted of selling drugs before he left office in January 2021.Seeking The Libertarian Vote Amid Jeers And Heckling"It's time to be winners," said Trump when asked rhetorically if third-party delegates wanted to go on getting single-digit protest votes. "I'm asking for the Libertarian Party's endorsement, or at least lots of your votes." He also vowed to "put a Libertarian in my cabinet."Despite the promises, Trump elicited continuous boos and heckling from the crowd throughout his speech, suggesting the Ulbricht pardon and a cabinet post were not quite enough.Trump's own supporters were outnumbered by Libertarian delegates who seemed to resent his presence.A chant of "We Want Trump" was quickly drowned out by "End the Fed!" When Trump called Joe Biden a "threat to democracy," some delegates shouted, "So are you!"Photo: Shutterstock

Trader Predicts One Red-Hot Memecoin Dethroning Shiba Inu and Becoming 13th-Largest Crypto by Market Cap - The Daily Hodl


								A trader known for making timely crypto market calls thinks that one surging memecoin is poised to more than double its valuation.
Early last week, pseudonymous analyst Hsaka told his 554,600 followers on the social media platform X that he believes frog-themed memecoin Pepe (PEPE) will soar in market cap en route to dethroning its rival Shiba Inu (SHIB).










At the time, PEPE was the 28th-largest crypto by market cap.
Source: Hsaka/X
Since then, the Ethereum (ETH)-based memecoin has been on a tear, rallying by about 71% in a matter of days. Hsaka shares another chart showing that PEPE has leapfrogged six other crypto assets in terms of market cap rankings.


“Update: the climb to the top continues.”



Source: Hsaka/X
Hsaka is not the only crypto strategist bullish on PEPE. Fellow analyst Kaleo tells his 640,600 followers on the social media platform X that it is within the realm of possibility for PEPE to witness massive gains in this bull market based on the performance of SHIB and Dogecoin (DOGE) last cycle.
“PEPE is only at a $6 billion market cap. DOGE hit a max market cap of $75 billion last cycle, and SHIB hit nearly $50 billion. I think it’s safe to say there’s still plenty of upside for the frog.”

At time of writing, PEPE is worth $0.0000152, up about 7% in the past 24 hours.

Santiment Reveals the Top 10 Altcoins Developers Are Focusing on on the BNB Chain Network: First Ranking is Unexpected - Bitcoin Sistemi


In its statement, cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment shared an evaluation of the altcoins that developers focus on the most on BNB Chain, supported by Binance.
Santiment analysts based the evaluation on the Github pages of altcoin projects. Code contributions made by developers to the altcoins in question were used to create the developer score.


Here are the altcoins and developer scores that developers have focused on the most in the last 30 days on the BNB Chain network:

Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB) – 112.73
Dusk (DUSK) – 42.73
Flux (FLUX) – 22.6
Trust Wallet Token (TWT) – 22.1
Beefy.Finance (BIFI) – 20.23
Zigcoin (ZIG) – 16.27
ApeSwap Finance (BANANA) – 15.1
Saito (SAITO) – 11.27
TokenPocket (TPT) – 8.43
0x (ZRX) – 4.07


BTCB, which ranks first on the list, can actually be defined as the BTCs in the Bitcoin network bridged to BNB Chain. Users obtain BTCB on the BNB Chain network by locking their Bitcoins on a bridge, and this token is thus traded at the same price as BTC. Users who want to return to the Bitcoin network get their BTC back by burning BTCB tokens on the bridge.

Unique Bitcoin Course to Be Launched by Swiss University


The University of Applied Sciences in Business Administration Zurich will be offering a unique Bitcoin course starting in March 2025, according to a recent report by 20 Minuten, a local media outlet.  The course is specifically aimed at those who want to integrate Bitcoin into new business models. The training course, which offers 15 ECTS credits, will cost a whopping 9,950 francs ($10,794) for just 16 days.  The course offers a structured modular curriculum that takes into consideration various aspects of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It includes basic economic principles behind the flagship cryptocurrency as well as an analysis of the cryptocurrency's impact on the broader economy. The second part dissects the technical aspects of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. The next part focuses on the current state of Bitcoin regulation as well as compliance issues. The fourth part takes an in-depth look at various wealth management strategies that are specifically tailored for Bitcoin. There is also a comparable analysis of Bitcoin and altcoins. Its aim is to explain what makes the largest cryptocurrency stand out among the plethora of other digital assets. Finally, the last part will explore specific business models and opportunities offered by Bitcoin. The report says that the yet-to-be-launched Bitcoin course is unique in all of Europe. Bitcoiners, however, do not appear to be excited. Most commentators have taken issue with the exorbitant price of the course. One Bitcoin wrote that he would rather invest that money in the cryptocurrency while engaging in self-teaching.

Why Donald Trump Will Pump Crypto: Mad Crypto Alpha With Ivan - Benzinga

gm,I’m Ivan and welcome to my weekly column Mad Crypto Alpha.In this week’s issue: why this guy is crypto’s biggest key opinion leader (aka shill).You May Not Like Him, But Your Crypto Net Worth Is In The Hands Of This ManYou have to give it to Donald Trump.His 180 on crypto is impressive even by his standards. How it started: How it’s going:I predicted this, although the speed and intensity of the pivot surprised me too.Trump has all the attributes I want from a successful crypto shill key opinion leader.
Like any good crypto influencer, Trump is able to “update his beliefs” fast when necessary. 



He loves attention, another key trait for a successful crypto KOL. A Lambo is nice, but have you tried putting your own name on an airplane and a tower?



He likes to create a narrative and then take credit for stuff he is, at best, partially responsible for.
The narrative alone could (and in my opinion should) be enough to pump the crypto markets going into November. Oh but wait, there is more.Read Next: Ethereum ETF Approved, Elon Musk Mourns Kabosu's Death, Trump Embraces Crypto Donations And More: Top Cryptocurrency UpdatesYour Turn, Democratic PartyLet’s remember that about a week ago, the chances of the spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs happening were about 10%. Proof:Then Trump started shilling crypto and, surprise surprise, not only do ETH ETFs get approved (with the SEC refusing to elaborate further), but also the FIT21 “crypto bill” passes the House.Coincidence?Maybe. And for the record, the bill isn’t (to my knowledge) passing the Senate anytime soon, but this is a surprising and sudden shift in sentiment and hard facts as far as crypto policy goes.An unexpected love story, right in front of our eyes.And Trump, directly or indirectly, probably contributed to this by vocally embracing cryptocurrency.Let’s face it: crypto will not be a top 10 election issue (see here). But it’s also not worth alienating a passionate and wealthy minority over. In Trump, the crypto lobby found the perfect person to advance its interests. Someone who doesn’t fundamentally care about its potential or risks but likes number going up and is happy to embrace a fundamentally unimportant topic for votes.Still not convinced?See Also: Was Cathie Wood Right About Crypto As An Issue In 2024 White House Race? ‘You Can’t Be On The Wrong SideHow The Trump Pump Could HappenWill the next president try to cut spending and be fiscally responsible?Could the next president, by accident or by design, preside over a recession that necessitates a bit of, y’know, monetary stimulus?You bet.Would Donald Trump specifically like to pump the markets and actively try to make that happen?Well…Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself has said that the U.S. is “on an unsustainable fiscal path.”That means the flight of capital into assets — stocks, real estate and crypto — is likely to continue.In my humble opinion, under a President Trump, it would accelerate (more) than under a President Biden II.None of this is financial advice, but if you asked me whether a candidate that accepts donations in, *checks notes*, Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD is bullish for crypto…….I would not have to think twice.Wrapping It UpIf you liked this column, give me a follow on Twitter and sign up to our "Future of Finance" newsletter.Shoot me a DM or Benzinga a mail if you have topic requests, and I'll see you back for next week's Mad Crypto Alpha.gnRead Next: EXCLUSIVE: Trump-Themed MAGA Memecoin Plans To Rival Dogecoin And Shiba Inu With ‘Four More Years Of Catalysts’Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.

Michael Saylor Shifts Stance on Ether ETFs, Sees Approval as Positive for Bitcoin



                    

MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor has recently shifted his stance on spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), suggesting that the U.S. regulator’s recent approval is beneficial for Bitcoin as well.



“Is this good for Bitcoin or not? Yeah, I think it’s good for Bitcoin, in fact, I think it may be better for Bitcoin because I think that we are politically much more powerful supported by the entire crypto industry,” Saylor told Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack on the May 25 episode of the What Bitcoin Did podcast.




“They serve as another line of defense for Bitcoin,” he continued, following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of eight spot Ether ETFs on May 23.



Saylor emphasized that this move will “accelerate institutional adoption,” as previously hesitant investors will now see crypto as a legitimate asset class. 



He explained that while capital will be allocated across various crypto assets, Bitcoin will receive the majority, being “the leader” of cryptocurrencies.




“I think mainstream investors will say oh there is a crypto asset class now, maybe we’ll allocate 5% or 10% to the crypto asset class, but Bitcoin will be 60% or 70% of that,” he claimed.

Saylor acknowledged his change in perspective on spot Ether ETFs, having previously believed there was little chance of SEC approval.



“Two weeks before, the world looked like Bitcoin was going to be the only asset securitized and offered as a spot ETF by the Wall Street establishment and it was going to spread as the one legitimate crypto asset,” he explained.




Earlier, on May 3, Cointelegraph reported Saylor’s prediction that the SEC would classify ETH as a security, along with BNB, Solana, XRP, and Cardano.



“None of [these tokens] will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as crypto assets,” said Saylor.



Saylor’s revised stance on the What Bitcoin Did podcast drew attention from the crypto community.



“Changing his tune a bit,” Bitcoin commercial litigator Joe Carlasare commented in a May 25 X post.



“Is the next step Saylor buying ETH? That’s a serious 180,” added crypto analyst Ricky Bobbyy.

How Much ETH Will Spot Ethereum ETFs Buy? Will Bitcoin's Performance Be Seen? Bloomberg Analysts Explained - Bitcoin Sistemi


Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas expressed optimism about the potential demand for spot Ethereum ETFs.
In an interview hosted by Bitwise, Seyffart stated that he expects Ethereum ETFs to see 20% to 25% of the demand experienced by spot Bitcoin ETFs. Balchunas estimates that demand will be around 15% to 20%.


Seyffart's estimate, which he calls a “discount,” is based on the fact that Ethereum's market cap is about 30% of Bitcoin's $1.4 trillion market cap. He attributes the difference in demand to the limitations of each product. Unlike Ethereum holders, Ethereum ETF investors will not be able to stake to generate returns. Additionally, Ethereum's advanced on-chain services will not be accessible to ETF investors.

“The gap between Ethereum within an ETF and Ethereum itself is slightly wider than the gap between Bitcoin within the ETF and the actual Bitcoin,” Seyffart said.





Seyffart also noted that Ethereum futures ETFs, which currently hold only 12% of assets compared to U.S. futures ETFs, do not provide a “good proxy” for a prediction. However, Ethereum futures ETFs in foreign markets hold 20% to 30% of assets commensurate with Bitcoin futures ETFs.
Despite these limitations, Seyffart predicts spot Ethereum ETFs will have “major launches,” though not as large as spot Bitcoin ETF launches. “There will be demand,” he concluded.

Wells Fargo Freezes 92 Year-Old Man’s Bank Account Without Notice, Triggering Eight Month Battle To Withdraw His Money: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A 92 year-old man who recently lost his “true love” says Wells Fargo abruptly froze his account, triggering an eight month battle to access his cash.
Frank W. Pfluger says he discovered Wells Fargo locked him out of his bank account just weeks after losing his wife of 67 years in September, reports NBC10 Philadelphia.










Frank says he was trying to withdraw a few hundred dollars from his account, but the lender unexpectedly blocked him from accessing his funds.
“There should have been close to $2,000 or $2,500 in it and the ATM popped up and said ‘Insufficient Funds’.” 
The account in question is a joint account between Frank and his late wife Miriam. Frank says Wells Fargo had no legal basis to freeze the joint account even though his wife had passed away.
“We could never get a straight answer as to why they had bothered to freeze the account because it was a joint account with rights of survivorship.” 
Frank says Wells Fargo asked him to complete a letter of authorization, which he did four times between November 28th, 2023, and January 4th, 2024.
On April 1st, Frank received a letter from Wells Fargo saying that “the Estate process has been completed and the funds are available to withdraw… either at a Wells Fargo bank branch or online money movement.”
But even with the notice, Frank still could not access or withdraw his money. At that point, he reached out to NBC10.
The media outlet approached Wells Fargo to inquire about Frank’s case. Within days, Wells Fargo issued a statement saying “We are happy to have resolved the matter for the customer.”
When pressed for more details, a Wells Fargo spokesperson directed NBC10 to a part of its website that explains what happens to a joint account when a loved one passes.
“Most of these bank accounts carry automatic rights of survivorship, which means the joint owner will have full access to the funds.” 
Within 10 days of seeking media intervention, Frank says he received a check from Wells Fargo amounting to $1,993.91.

Bitcoin Nears $69,000 as Key Resistance Levels Hold Steady



                    

Bitcoin stayed near key price levels into the May 26 weekly close, with weekend trading centering around $69,000.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed a strong performance by BTC/USD, which briefly surpassed $69,500 before consolidating.




Despite some market predictions for a weekend upside, resistance zones kept gains in check.



“As price is ranging around ~$69K, there’s some liquidity building up on both sides,” noted popular trader Daan Crypto Trades in his latest analysis on X (formerly Twitter). 



“Most notably: $68.3K & $69.8K. Good levels to watch in the short term going into next week.”




An accompanying chart highlighted liquidity concentrations for the BTC/USDT perpetual swaps pair on Binance, the largest global exchange.



Across BTC order books, liquidity was increasing around the spot price, leading to lower volatility but raising the chances of a liquidity raid later.



Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, emphasized the importance of turning $69,000 into support.

“Bitcoin lost $69k again. It’s our strongest and most important resistance level on the chart,” he stated in his latest X post. “I’d like to see a weekly close above $69k to gain some confidence in a measured move to $73k.”



Alan noted that U.S. markets would be closed on May 27 for the Memorial Day holiday.



Regarding resistance, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital focused on levels above $71,000. Updating X subscribers on BTC price action after the April block subsidy halving, he confirmed that the market had exited the “danger zone” typically seen after such events. However, he warned that bulls are not entirely out of trouble.



“Since the Bitcoin Post-Halving ‘Danger Zone’ ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71500. 



“However, ~$71500 is where the Range High resistance of the Macro Re-Accumulation Range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from,” Rekt Capital explained.



“The consolidation continues, and history suggests it will continue for several more weeks between $60000 and $70000.”



If this happens, the May monthly close could still end in the red, aligning with the trend of the past three years, according to data from monitoring resource CoinGlass.

US Government Pays $514,000,000,000 in Interest on National Debt in Seven Months, Surpassing Defense and Medicare Costs: Report - The Daily Hodl


								The US government just spent over half a trillion dollars in interest payments on its national debt in a mere seven months.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) reports that net spending on interest reached $514 billion in the first seven months of fiscal 2024 – more than what was spent on both national defense and Medicare.










The massive interest payments also surpass all the money that was spent on veterans, education and transportation combined.
Source: Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget
As the national debt nears $34.8 trillion, the state of America’s balance sheet is garnering increasing scrutiny from the financial world.
In a new interview with Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon says political leaders must focus on the national debt and deficit, but he doesn’t think much will happen until after the election.
“I think the level of debt in the United States, the level of spending is something that we need a sharper focus on and more dialogue around than what we’ve seen. We obviously had a pandemic, we made a bunch of decisions in that pandemic, but we’re long out of that pandemic and the spending levels are continuing at a pace that I think is raising our debt level and creating issues for us down the road. 
So I think this is something that deserves a lot of attention. It’s not getting as much attention as I’d like to see it get right now. We’re obviously in an election year so I don’t have my head in the sand, I don’t think you’re going to see that get a lot of attention prior to the election but I do think it’s something that requires focus. We need to deal with the debt and the deficits, and hopefully, there will be a lot more discussions as we come through the election and move into the next administration.”

Will ​​Toncoin [TON] fall below $6 in the next 7 days? - AMBCrypto



Toncoin’s price declined by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. 
Most metrics and market indicators looked bearish on TON.

Toncoin [TON] bears have dominated the market in the last week as the token’s price charts remained red.
 The recent downtick looked bearish as it pushed TON’s price down from a key resistance, which otherwise would have sparked a bull rally. 
Toncoin bears step up
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that Toncoin bears clearly controlled the market, as the token’s price dropped by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, TON was trading at $6.31 with a market capitalization of over $21.9 billion.
While the token’s price turned bullish, it was consolidating in a bullish falling wedge pattern. 
World of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet highlighting this development as TON’s price was near the upper limit of the pattern. 
As per the tweet, a breakout from the pattern might kickstart a bull rally that would allow TON to surge by 25%. 
However, the current price trend suggests that TON might not manage to break above. Therefore, AMBCrypto analyzed Toncoin’s on-chain metrics to better understand which way the token was headed. 
What to expect from TON?
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data revealed that TON’s Exchange Inflow increased over the last week, indicating high selling pressure. 
The token’s Supply on Exchanges also dropped alongside its Velocity, further proving the fact that investors were selling TON.  This meant that TON was used less often in transactions within a set timeframe.
 Another bearish metric was the MVRV ratio, which registered a decline over the last few days. 
Source: Santiment
AMBCrypto’s look at TON’s daily chart revealed quite a few bearish indicators. For example, the Money Flow Index (MFI) registered a sharp downtick.
 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also followed a similar declining trend. These technical indicators suggested that the chances of the bearish price trend continuing further were high. 
Source: TradingView
If this turns out to be true, then investors might witness TON to touch $5.9 in the coming days, as it has strong support there. A plummet under that could push the token’s value further down to $5.3–$5. 

Is your portfolio green? Check out the TON Profit Calculator.

Nonetheless, if a trend reversal happens and TON breaks above the falling wedge, then it can reach new highs. 
AMBCrypto reported earlier that there was a possibility of TON touching $10 in the coming days or weeks.

Biden BTC (BIDENBTC) Will Surge 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Biden BTC (BIDENBTC) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Biden BTC (BIDENBTC), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Biden BTC presents a similar opportunity.



Biden BTC has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Biden BTC could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Biden BTC can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Biden BTC on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Biden BTC by entering its contract address – 9MAph1jbrbs98UTvZ3EC5VVFAeKduh9iY78jJKDwxioz – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BIDENBTC.

Normie Plunges 99% After Exploit on Base Network


Normie, a meme coin on Ethereum’s Layer 2 network Base, experienced a severe exploit, causing its token value to plummet by 99%.
The project’s team acknowledged the breach and agreed to the attacker’s proposal to return the stolen assets.
Normie’s Market Capitalization Free Falls

An attacker exploited a vulnerability in Normie’s contract tax mechanism, conducting a flash loan attack drastically increasing the meme coin’s token supply. This exploit caused a 99% drop in the token’s value while the market cap from approximately $41 million to around $1.3 million.
Lookonchain highlighted the severe impact on traders. The analyst noted that a trader whose $1.16 million investment in NORMIE is now worth less than $150. Similarly, many other token holders expressed their significant losses on the project’s official Telegram channel.
Meanwhile, crypto exchange LBank reported an influx of Normie token deposits, suggesting a connection to the exploit.

“We’ve noticed a large number of unusual NORMIE token deposits, possibly linked to an exploit. We urge the project team to contact us with details about the addresses involved and potential solutions,” LBank stated.

Interestingly, the attacker has offered to return 90% of the stolen assets if the project launched a new token to compensate affected holders.

In response, the Normie team accepted this proposal and assured there would be no reprisals. Additionally, the project stated that all the ETH in its development wallet would be committed to the recovery effort. On-chain data shows that the Normie developer wallet currently holds about 736 ETH, valued at approximately $11.7 million.

“Exploiter, we accept your offer to return 90% of the exploited ETH. You may keep 10%, no reprisals. All $ETH from the normie dev wallet will be used to rectify this situation and assist in our relaunch,” Normie’s team stated.

Normie is a memecoin launched on Base in March during the meme coin frenzy that swept the blockchain network following the introduction of the Dencun Upgrade, drastically reducing fees for Ethereum layer-2 networks. The project had enjoyed some early successes, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $100 million before this incident.

Solana Memecoin RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) to Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because RIPDOGEY has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, RIP DOGEY can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and RIP DOGEY could become the next viral memecoin.



RIP DOGEY launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy RIP DOGEY on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for RIP DOGEY by entering its contract address – GVZoEtPFj1fMuW2zA4Zww27Mcx1yJSobrW3hzp5hfqCe – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.

Crypto Exchange Coinbase Adds Bitcoin Ecosystem Altcoin to Its Listing Roadmap - The Daily Hodl


								Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, has announced the potential future listing of an altcoin within the Bitcoin (BTC) scaling ecosystem.
The exchange announced that Core (CORE) is now on its listing roadmap, meaning the exchange will possibly list it for trading in the future.










Core is designed to be a hyper-scalable complimentary smart contract platform to Bitcoin.
Core’s ecosystem consists of several major components, including its Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism, its non-custodial staking and its native version of wrapped Bitcoin.
CORE currently has a market cap of $1.96 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $4.64 billion.
Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa says that CORE is one of his altcoin bets for the Bitcoin ecosystem looking ahead to the next big rally.
“CORE: temporary bottom looks in but would wait for a solid break of $2 before entering. One of my bets for BTC ecosystem plays this cycle, I think this goes to $2.50+ in the mid-term as long as BTC is stable”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Coinbase created its listing roadmap in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors front-running new trading support announcements.
At time of writing, CORE is trading at $2.23.

Crypto news: il DEX Uniswap rivela gli asset in vista del voto

The decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) Uniswap reveals the assets in preparation for the vote on the fee mechanism. In the first quarter, the foundation allocated 4.34 million dollars to new grants and distributed 2.79 million dollars for already approved grants.
Let’s see all the details below. 

Vote on the commission mechanism: the statements of the crypto DEX Uniswap 
As anticipated, the Uniswap Foundation has communicated that it possesses 41.41 million dollars in fiat and stablecoin, in addition to 730,000 UNI tokens, at the end of the first quarter.
During this period, the foundation committed 4.34 million dollars in new grants and disbursed 2.79 million dollars for previously approved grants. 
Fiat cash and stablecoins are intended for lending activities and operations, while UNI tokens are reserved as employee rewards.
La Uniswap Foundation ha inoltre annunciato che il voto on-chain per una proposta che stabilisce il nuovo meccanismo di commissioni si terrà entro il 31 maggio. 
La proposta rappresenta un crucial step verso l’implementazione autonoma della riscossione e distribuzione delle commissioni nei pool Uniswap v3.
After the approval of the proposal, the control of the mainnet UniswapV3Factory will be transferred to a new contract V3FactoryOwner, marking an important progress in the decentralized governance of Uniswap. 
Tuttavia, il voto non attiverà le commissioni, che saranno affrontate in una futura proposta.
The Uniswap Foundation has stated that the change will be implemented despite the Wells notice received from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Quest’ultima ha accusato il protocollo DeFi di violazioni delle leggi sui titoli, operando come borsa valori e broker non registrati.
Uniswap Labs has responded by arguing that the SEC does not have jurisdiction to regulate their decentralized protocol according to current legal classifications.
The response from the company arrived promptly, coinciding with the vote of the United States House of Representatives on a bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.
Which could change the way the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulate criptovalute.
New proposals for the distribution of commissions and incentives to governance
As we know, since 2021, the SEC has been conducting an investigation into Uniswap Labs, the main developer of Uniswap. The decentralized exchange (DEX) has delisted several tokens from its platform due to increasing regulatory pressure.
So far, the commission revenues of Uniswap have been entirely allocated to the liquidity providers (LP). They earn rewards for providing assets to the platform, supporting trading activity and market liquidity.
The new proposal, however, provides for distributing the protocol fees among the token holders who stake or delegate their tokens. 
This would create a structure of incentives that rewards active engagement and encourages significant contributions within the Uniswap ecosystem.
A febbraio, la Uniswap Foundation ha avanzato una proposta per introdurre un sistema di ricompensa delle commissioni volto a incentivare i possessori di token UNI a impegnarsi più attivamente nelle decisioni di governance. 
Improving thus the participation of the community and the decision-making processes.
The +15% of UNI among positive developments on Ethereum and the legal battle with the SEC
In a week characterized by the consolidation of the cryptocurrency market, the UNI token of Uniswap defied the trend, recording an increase of over 15% and surpassing the 10 dollars.
This rise occurred in a context of positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem and the ongoing legal battle between Uniswap and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Beyond the legal dispute, the current momentum within the Ethereum ecosystem is pushing the price of UNI upwards. On-chain data shows significant whale withdrawals from cryptocurrency exchanges following the news of a potential spot ETF on Ethereum. 
This search for security, along with the general bull sentiment on Ethereum, is benefiting UNI, a key player in the Ethereum DeFi landscape.
From a technical standpoint, the breakout of UNI from a monthly consolidation phase paints a promising picture. Technical indicators and on-chain data suggest a potential increase of 25% in the price of UNI. 
The recent surge of the token indicates a possible bull run, with analysts targeting a price goal of 12.80 dollars if the current momentum continues.
Supporting this forecast is the Age Consumed index by Santiment, which measures the movement of dormant tokens. The peaks of this index often precede price rallies and the latest rise at the end of April seems to have foreshadowed the current bull trend of UNI. 
Questo parametro on-chain rafforza le prospettive bull per UNI, suggerendo che gli investitori stanno riconoscendo il suo potenziale.

                        The Russian Central Bank says it has noticed a significant rise in citizens’ transactions on crypto exchanges and peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms.Per the Russian media outlet RBC, the bank has published a financial stability report, making several observations on Russian citizens’ crypto transactions.The bank wrote about trends it had noticed from the fourth quarter of the Financial Year 2023 to the first quarter of FY2024.The regulator wrote that the “total web traffic of Russian users on the websites of the largest cryptocurrency platforms” increased by 16.4% “compared to the second and third quarters of 2023.”Russian Central Bank: Citizens More Active on Crypto Platforms
The bank said that Russians made a total of 104.6 million visits to crypto exchanges and P2P sites.The average monthly number of unique Russian IP address-holders to “major crypto exchanges” also increased by 15.1%, the bank said.This means that 7% of all the traffic on these major overseas crypto exchanges originates from Russia, the bank added.However, this is still short of the 9% peak the bank reported in the first quarter of FY2023.The bank said it had used a tool named Transparent Blockchain to make its calculations.The tool was developed by the Federal Financial Monitoring Service (aka Rosfinmonitoring), in a bid to fight crypto-powered money laundering.Russian officials claim Transparent Blockchain lets them identify the “true” identity of crypto users on multiple blockchain protocols.The report suggests that Russians remain keen on higher-cap cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). They also appear to use USD-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC.In total, transactions “potentially attributable” to Russians amounted to over $50.2 billion in the same period.This, analysts noted, includes not only crypto trades, but also P2P payments, remittances, and “payments for goods and services.”Crypto Is Risky, Regulator Warns
RBC noted that the Russian Central Bank report “does not publish a list of the crypto platforms it has monitored.”However, it added that “previous Central Bank financial risk reports” have included data from platforms such as Binance, Bybit, MEXC, KuCoin, and others.Part of the reason for the spike in transactions may be due to Binance’s exit from the Russian market.The bank thinks that at the time of its exit from Russia, Binance had cornered just short of half of the nation’s crypto market.And the bank further warned Russian crypto users of the “dangers” and risks” involved with holding crypto in Russia.It wrote that it was “necessary to assess the risks associated with possible sanctions from unfriendly countries.”It claimed that, with tensions rising between the West and Moscow, Russian USDT and USDC holders risk “loss of access to their funds.”The bank said that such losses “cannot be ruled out if [Russians] are blocked by stablecoin issuers.”RBC noted that in the US and UK, regulators are increasing their scrutiny of “transactions with stablecoins,” as “control over crypto exchanges is being tightened.”The bank further warned that governments of “unfriendly nations” could order crypto exchanges to “strengthen control over user transactions, including within the framework of sanctions restrictions.”But in its “recommendations” for Russian “financial organizations,” the bank hinted at forthcoming Russian regulations.The bank “recommended” that domestic financial providers should “not offer financial instruments tied to cryptoassets.”It also advised banks “not to advertise services related to the circulation of cryptoassets.”

Bitcoin White Paper Reuploaded to Bitcoin.org After Craig Wright's Failed Satoshi Claim



                    

The Bitcoin white paper has been reuploaded to the Bitcoin.org website following Craig Wright’s failed court attempt to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the protocol’s pseudonymous creator.



Hennadii Stepanov, the maintainer of Bitcoin.org, announced the return of the Bitcoin white paper by sharing a link to the PDF on platform X.




Due to legal constraints, Bitcoin.org had to restrict access to the white paper for UK-based users. 



Instead, it displayed a poignant quote from Satoshi Nakamoto: “It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle.”



In 2021, Wright successfully sued Cobra, the anonymous group running the website, for copyright infringement, leading to the removal of the white paper PDF. 




Wright won by default after Cobra chose not to defend the case, resulting in Cobra paying £35,000 ($40,100) of Wright’s legal fees. Wright had filed for U.S. copyright registration for the Bitcoin white paper in 2019.



In 2023, Wright sued 13 Bitcoin Core developers and companies including Blockstream, Coinbase, and Block, for copyright violations related to the Bitcoin white paper, its file format, and database rights to the Bitcoin blockchain.



The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund responded, emphasizing the trend of abusive lawsuits against prominent Bitcoin contributors.

According to the defense fund, these lawsuits deter development due to the associated time, stress, expenses, and legal risks.



However, Wright’s copyright win is now invalid, as his claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto and authoring the white paper have been decisively debunked. 



The detailed ruling came from a case brought against Wright by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a coalition of prominent companies seeking to prevent Wright from asserting ownership over Bitcoin’s core intellectual property.



COPA alleged that Wright engaged in an elaborate scheme of forgery and deceit to fabricate evidence backing his claim of being Nakamoto. 



Consequently, Craig Wright’s assets, worth 6.7 million British pounds ($8.4 million), were frozen after a UK court approved a plan to prevent him from evading court expenses.



The Bitcoin white paper is now subject to an MIT open-source license, allowing anyone to reuse and modify the code for any purpose.

Lower Cost Bitcoin Miners Increase Market Share After Halving: Bernstein Analysts ⋆ ZyCrypto


            
            
Advertisement

&nbsp

&nbsp
In a dramatic turn for the Bitcoin mining industry, a big drop in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has paved the way for lower-cost miners to grab a larger market pie. This significant shift, the most substantial since the crypto winter of 2022, is reshaping the competitive landscape and highlighting the critical role of operational efficiency in the mining sector.



A recent report from brokerage firm Bernstein delves into this fascinating trend, exploring how key players leverage these changes and the implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.



Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Plummets



Bitcoin mining difficulty, a measure of how hard it is to mine new Bitcoins, recently experienced a noteworthy 6% decline. This significant drop indicates miners need fewer computational resources to mine new Bitcoin, which has wide-ranging effects across the mining sector.



According to data, Bitcoin mining difficulty declined 6% on May 10, from 88.1 trillion hashes to 83.15 trillion hashes. This is the most significant percentage decrease since July 2021, when it fell by 28% to 14.36 trillion hashes. The mining difficulty metric adjusts automatically to accommodate fluctuations in the Bitcoin network’s total computing power.



One of the most striking outcomes of the decline in mining difficulty is the surge in market share for lower-cost miners. Bernstein’s report highlights how miners with lower operational costs have rapidly expanded their presence since the Bitcoin halving event.

&nbsp



Last month, Bitcoin went through its fourth halving event. This occurrence, which happens roughly every four years, slashed the rewards miners receive for processing new blocks on the network by half, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.



Bitcoin miners, who create new coins and ensure the network runs smoothly by processing transactions, now face a tougher challenge to stay profitable. Reduced rewards and increased mining difficulty have led many miners to shut down their operations.



Impact on Mining Giants



Mining giants like Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK) have emerged as frontrunners due to the decline in mining difficulty. These companies, known for their streamlined operations and robust financial positions, have witnessed a surge in market share as higher-cost competitors struggle to stay afloat.



Bernstein’s analysis suggests that these companies are poised to capitalize on the evolving dynamics of the Bitcoin mining sector.



Despite recent challenges, Bernstein remains bullish about the future of Bitcoin mining. The firm predicts that Bitcoin’s price will remain steady in the short term but anticipates an upward surge once spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attract more attention from institutional investors.



This forecast indicates promising investment opportunities in Bitcoin mining firms, particularly those with efficient operations and solid financial footing.

Bitcoin soars, but what's causing a shadow on the breakout? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin saw a positive reaction on the price charts, but social metrics underlined weakness.
The high demand for Bitcoin in May could propel prices past the ATH soon.

Bitcoin [BTC] saw an interesting week in terms of price action. It had a lively breakout past the local range high at $67k on the 20th of May.
On the 23rd and the 24th of May, Bitcoin retested the $66.3k-$66.6k zone as support and bounced higher to trade at $69.1k at press time.
More gains are likely to follow as demand for the king of crypto continues to grow.
The CEO of the blockchain-based payments’ app Strike, Jack Mallers, asserted that “Bitcoin is the best thing you can own” in a conversation with Antony Pompliano.
The social metrics and on-chain activity were weakening

The Social Volume behind Bitcoin has slowly slid lower since the 11th of March. The Weighted Sentiment was negative throughout May, with two positive surges since mid-May.
Together, they pointed toward reduced social media engagement.
The daily activity also trended lower since mid-March. On the other hand, the dormant circulation last saw noticeably large spikes on the 18th of April and the 15th of May.
However, their size did not rival the ones in March or late February.
This revealed that the on-chain movement of dormant Bitcoin was absent recently, which suggested a large wave of selling was not yet upon us. This was a good sign as it underlines lowered selling pressure.
Is the demand for Bitcoin higher than ever before?

In a post on X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Axel Adler showed that the demand was red-hot. This conclusion was made based on the entity-adjusted transaction count.
Based on the chart’s readings, the demand was close to the levels of the 2016 rally.

He also added that the price of Bitcoin back then was $300, compared to $69.1k now. Hence, the capital involved is vastly greater than eight years ago.
This demand from retail and institutional investors, combined with a reduced selling pressure from the dormant circulation metric, indicated that Bitcoin is very likely to break out past the $71.4k region once again.

Binance Coin: Why the next 2 weeks will be interesting for BNB - AMBCrypto



Analysis showed that the coin could see an upswing to $738 by June.
Derivatives market data indicated bullish sentiment, as BNB might favor long positions.

The price of Binance Coin [BNB] could be on the verge of dropping below $600 but in June, the value of the coin might trade higher. AMBCryto got wind of this possibility after evaluating some indicators on-chain.
To start with, we considered the Social Dominance, which metric gauges sentiment by looking at the overall talk online about an asset.
At press time, BNB-related discussions increased, prompting social dominance to hit 1.012%
Attention is shifting to the coin
This increase meant that the cryptocurrency was one of the most talked-about out of the top 100. Historically, a rise in the metric could foreshadow demand for the coin.
Also, as long as the dominance does not get too heated, the price can appreciate.
However, the last time the metric hit 1.641%, the price of the coin reached $632 from a low of $511. If the pattern were to follow a similar trend, BNB could be set to hit $738 within the next 35 days.
Source: Santiment
At press time, the price of the coin was $601. Furthermore, this was around the same value it was 30 days ago. Meanwhile, BNB’s price was 12.96% down from its all-time high.
With the momentum displayed, the cryptocurrency could be on a path to a new high before the end of the second quarter (Q2).
Furthermore, it seemed traders in the derivatives market shared the thought in like manner.
Evidence of this was reflected in the Long/Short ratio. The Long/Short ratio gives an insight into investors’ expectations. Reading more at 1 or above, suggest that traders are bullish on an asset.
However, if the reading is below 1, it implies a bearish sentiment. At press time, BNB’s Long/Short ratio was 1.10, according to Coinglass.
Simply put, this ratio implied that there were 1.10 as many long positions as shorts. On most occasions, the bullish reading of the indicator hardly gets to this point.
Source: Coinglass
The support levels have landed
Therefore, the high value suggests that there was growing confidence that BNB might surpass $700. In addition, to this, AMBCrypto analyzed the Net Positions Heatmap.
This is similar to the volume profile. But the difference is that the Net Positions Heatmap gauges market sentiment and strength by highlighting positions that traders have opened.
At press time, there was an increase in the number of long openings at $601, $616, and $630. From a trading perspective, all these areas can act as support for the cryptocurrency.

Should buying pressure increase when BNB revisits these points, the price might climb toward $738 as mentioned above. However, traders might need to be wary.
This is because a decline in buying pressure could cause the coin to swing sideways. In a highly bearish situation, the price might fall to $565— the next underlying support.

Ethereum Price Remains Supported for More Upsides
Ethereum price remained stable above the $3,540 support zone. ETH formed a base, outperformed Bitcoin, and started another increase above the $3,650 level.
There was a move above the $3,750 resistance. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,944 swing high to the $3,530 low. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.
Ethereum price is trading above $3,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,944 swing high to the $3,530 low.

Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com
If there is a clear move above the $4,080 level, the price might rise and test the $4,220 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $4,350 resistance zone.
Another Drop In ETH?
If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,880 resistance, it could start another downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,800 level and the trend line.
The next major support is near the $3,735 zone. A clear move below the $3,735 support might push the price toward $3,630. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,540 level in the near term.

                        Argentinian regulators have been talking to their counterparts in El Salvador about Bitcoin (BTC) adoption, the National Securities Commission of Argentina (CNV) confirmed this weekend.Per an official notice from the Argentinian CNV and a report from Criptonoticias, top officials met the head of El Salvador’s National Digital Assets Commission last week.Officials said the countries are “evaluating possible cooperation agreements” on digital assets-related issues.El Salvador an ‘Example’ as Argentinian Regulators Talk Bitcoin?
High-ranking CNV officials have visited El Salvador to “learn how” the government regulates BTC.Criptonoticias remarked that the nations were forging an “alliance, with Bitcoin at the center of the conversation.”CNV President Roberto Silva was joined by the regulator’s Vice President Patricia Boedo for the talks.The duo met with Juan Carlos Reyes, the President of El Salvador’s National Commission for Digital Assets (CNAD).Argentine officials said they were keen to “learn more” about the Salvadoran government’s experience with adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. Silva said:“El Salvador has emerged as one of the leading countries, not only in the use of Bitcoin, but also in the [wider] world of crypto assets.”Silva praised the Salvadoran government for creating the CNAD. He said the nation had “experience that is very valuable for the CNV at this moment.” Silva explained:“We want to strengthen ties with El Salvador. So we will explore the possibility of signing collaboration agreements with [the Salvadoran government].”Boedo visited El Salvador in March this year for preliminary “technical meetings.”‘Rapprochement’ Boost for Bitcoin Community?
The CNV has confirmed that she also spoke to her counterparts about “key elements” of Bitcoin “regulation.”Reyes commented that Argentina “is a pioneer in the technology sector.” He added that the CNV “wants to work with the [Bitcoin and digital assets] industries efficiently and create appropriate regulation.”The move may come as some form of comfort for Argentina’s Bitcoin and crypto communities.VIDEODespite much talk about President Javier Milei’s pro-Bitcoin views, Buenos Aires has apparently “caved” into IMF pressure on crypto regulation.The nation has announced a slew of crypto exchange-related regulations in a bid to appease the IMF and secure financial packages.However, Criptonoticias noted that “the rapprochement of Argentina and El Salvador” was “opening up the possibility” that new Argentinian regulation would “be “friendly” and “relatively unrestrictive.”

Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) Will Surge 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BUTSUCKS will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Buterin Sucks.



Currently, Buterin Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BUTSUCKS on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Buterin Sucks by entering its contract address – jr8okimfHEWaJpDmiZenkGWHzEr5bb53bDZf4kQvF7w – in the receiving field.




BUTSUCKS currently has a market cap of just under $12,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Standard Chartered’s interest in SEC approval for more crypto ETFs, including Solana, is fueling speculation and optimism.Positive market dynamics and technical indicators support a potential surge, with predictions suggesting Solana could see significant growth, possibly surpassing $200.Solana and XRP ETFs Could Boost Prices by 2025: Standard Chartered Predicts
Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Forex and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank, predicts that cryptocurrency ETFs for Solana and XRP might be approved by 2025, following the recent approval of Ethereum spot ETFs by the SEC.Kendrick argues that Ethereum’s approval sets a precedent for similar cryptocurrencies, potentially paving the way for XRP and Solana ETFs.He expects significant institutional investments in Ethereum ETFs, which could enhance Bitcoin and Ethereum’s market dominance, leading to further ETF approvals for other major cryptocurrencies.Kendrick highlights the need for regulatory clarity and political support to foster a favorable environment for digital assets.These predictions suggest that potential ETF approvals for Solana and XRP by 2025 could positively impact Solana’s price, as increased institutional investments boost overall market sentiment.Positive Inflows into US Bitcoin ETFs Boost Investor Confidence
Since the SEC approved spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen ten straight days of positive inflows, totalling $251.94 million as of May 24.Leading this surge are BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) with $182 million and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $44 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) reported no new investments.Despite the excitement around spot Ethereum ETFs, their launch awaits SEC approval of S-1 filings.

Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $165, reflecting a modest increase of over 1%. The green line on the chart marks the pivot point at $160.54, which serves as a crucial level for determining the trend direction.

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $168.59, suggesting a downward trend.Solana Price PredictionOverall, Solana’s position above the pivot point suggests a potential upward move. However, it faces immediate resistance at $170.37, and a break above this level could push it further towards $176.66 and $183.26.On the other hand, if the price falls below the immediate support at $156.75, it could decline further towards $151.08 and $144.08.

Traders Cautious About Ether's Price Movement Post Spot ETF Launch Despite Bitcoin's Previous Downturn



                    

Traders are cautious about assuming Ether‘s price will decline following the launch of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), unlike what occurred with Bitcoin after spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading.



“I think there is less likelihood of a selloff here after the ETH ETF compared to the BTC ETF,” crypto trader Matthew Hyland explained in a May 24 post on X.




Hyland noted that, unlike Ether, Bitcoin didn’t see a price drop before the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10.



“The BTC ETF had no pullbacks in the months leading into it. 



The selling pressure began when the Grayscale ETF was listed the following day,” Hyland added. 




Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has lost $17.6 billion in assets, according to Farside data.



Ether had declined by 15% over two months by May 20. However, after reports suggested the SEC might approve ETFs, Ether surged 29% within three days.



At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $3,752, according to CoinMarketCap data.



Concerns remain about Grayscale’s plans to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to an ETF, potentially causing selling pressure and affecting the price.

“One key similarity is both have a Grayscale product. 



The Grayscale ETF led to selling pressure for BTC, likely will see the same for the ETH ETF once the product is listed,” Hyland stated.



Despite this, Hyland predicted upward momentum for Ether’s price, noting it reached “local highs” of $4,092 in March without the positive news of spot Ether ETF approval. 



The year-to-date all-time high came shortly before ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reduced his approval hopes for spot Ether ETFs to 25%.



Meanwhile, MN trading consultancy founder Michaël van de Poppe expressed similar uncertainty until spot Ether ETFs start trading.



“It’s a waiting time until the listing takes place, and then the inflow will provide whether there’s a strong continuation upwards,” van de Poppe stated in a May 24 X post.



On May 24, Cointelegraph reported widespread commentary on Ether’s price stability following the SEC’s approval of spot Ether ETFs.



Independent Ethereum educator Sassal declared that “ETH is stupidly undervalued,” arguing the market had only three days to “price in the ETF approval.”

Solana DEX volume tumbles: Could SOL be in trouble? - AMBCrypto


 

The significant decline hinted at a cooling interest in Solana-based memecoins.
SOL’s price might test the lower support levels around $145.90 if interest continues to decline.

The daily trading volume of decentralized exchanges on Solana [SOL] has fallen. As of the 26th of May, AMBCrypto’s analysis of Artemis’ dashboard showed that the volume was $984 million.
Three days before that, the figure was over $1.5 billion. This decline was in contrast to the blockchain’s record in April. At that time, Solana’s DEX volume hit a record high of $60 billion, summed up every month.
Considering the recent fall and May nearing its end, it is possible that the total volume for the month could be less. The previous surge could be linked to the memecoin frenzy on the network.
No memecoins, no party
Therefore, the decline could mean that interaction with memecoins launched on Solana was no longer as high as it was. Besides that, the development seemed to put SOL, the native token of the ecosystem on the backfoot.
At press time, SOL’s price was $161.49. A few days back, the value got close to $190. Should the DEX volume continue to slide, SOL might also follow.
This is because demand for the cryptocurrency is relatively tied to memecoin trading. For those unfamiliar, while some memecoin might allow exchange with USDC, most need SOL.
Source: Artemis
As such, if the purchase of memecoins decreases, bids for SOL would most likely drop. Apart from this, other metrics can also predict the next direction for Solana’s price, and AMBCrypto looked at them.
SOL has become weak
One other indicator we analyzed was Solana’s Open Interest (OI). According to data from Santiment, the OI was down to $1.90 billion. As of the 20th of May, this value was almost $2.20 billion.
OI is the value of all open positions in a contract. If it increases, it means that net positions are increasing and more money is coming into the market. In this instance, the increase serves as a bullish signal.
A good example was shown in the chart below as SOL’s price rallied to $188.45 as the OI jumped. However, this decrease meant that liquidity taken out of SOL contracts increased.
Source: Santiment
Thus, the strength for a possible uptrend was waning. If this persists, SOL’s price might continue to decrease, and a move to $145.90 could be possible.
In addition, AMBCrypto reported that Solana has started lagging behind other blockchains in terms of activity. Some of the projects giving Solana a run for its money were Aptos [APT] and Sui [SUI].

Realistic or not, here’s APT’s market cap in SOL terms

However, it remains uncertain if these projects would be able to stand the test of time by outpacing Solana transactions consistently.
If this happens, Solana might shed a part of its market value as well as its price. If not, it could get back to winning ways.

                        A recent study has revealed that 60% of US residents lack comprehension of blockchain technology.Millennials emerged as the most confident generation regarding cryptocurrency knowledge, according to a recent study by language learning marketplace Preply. It also found a gender gap, with men generally feeling more assured about their crypto understanding than women.However, despite 46% of respondents expressing overall confidence, a significant portion of crypto investors themselves (35%) harbored doubts about their grasp of cryptocurrency. This uncertainty was particularly prevalent among Gen Z investors, with a staggering 40% unsure of their understanding.In anticipation of the future, Gen Xers who had not yet ventured into crypto investment displayed the highest level of interest in potentially doing so.Image Source: PreplyAcross all age groups, 40% of those currently uninvested expressed interest in crypto, and a significant 27% indicated a desire to learn more through educational resources.Survey Shows Low Confidence in NFTs, Metaverse
The survey also revealed a significant knowledge gap regarding NFTs and the metaverse. Only 42% of respondents showed confidence in their understanding, presenting a prime opportunity for educational initiatives.This lack of knowledge might explain the low investment enthusiasm, with just 11% excited about putting money into NFTs. However, the metaverse sparked greater curiosity, with 32% expressing interest in participating.US Cities Search for Blockchain-Related Answers
Preply’s study also showed a surge in interest in crypto terminology across the US. Florida, Washington, and California led the pack when it came to state-level searches for crypto terms.Similarly, Orlando and Miami in Florida, along with Atlanta in Georgia, emerged as the cities with the most curious residents actively searching crypto slang. Interestingly, DAO, DEX, and ICO were the crypto-related phrases that people were most likely to search for, suggesting these terms might be particularly confusing for many.The Fed’s annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) shows a significant decline in US crypto usage compared to previous years.In 2023, roughly 18m US adults reported using cryptocurrencies, according to the survey. This represents a substantial drop from 10% in 2022 and 12% in 2021. These findings contradict Coinbase’s claim that 52m Americans own cryptocurrency.

What Is Ethereum Name Service And Why Has It Pipped BTC, ETH To Nearly Double In Value Over This Week - Benzinga

In an intriguing turn of events, a cryptocurrency with Ethereum ETH/USD in its name has outperformed the original blue-chip currency in weekly gains.What Happened: Ethereum Name Service ENS/USD nearly doubled over the week, according to data from Benzinga Pro, becoming the market's largest gainer in the said time period. The coin outperformed heavyweights like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: Bitcoin) and Dogecoin DOGE/USD on its way to the top.Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, meanwhile, saw its weekly gains pale in comparison, growing by 27% during the last seven days.The 24-hour trading volumes also present a telling contrast. While ENS soared 170%, Ethereum saw a 72% rise in trades.Why It Matters: ENS is a token associated with Ethereum Name Service, a decentralized naming system that converts complex, machine-readable names to ones that could be more easily comprehended by humans. Think of it as similar to the role played by the internet’s Domain Name Service.Its recent success, though, could be tied to the approval of Ethereum's spot ETFs last week. While bullish sentiment around Ether grew manifold, its high price, around $3,900 for one unit, could be a big deterrent for retail investors. Instead, they might have chosen to invest in a cheaper coin with Ethereum in the name. A similar surge was seen for Ethereum Classic ETC/USD on the ETF approval day.Well-known cryptocurrency trader Doğu Tekinoğlu Doğu talked about his strategy to buy ENS at the bottom, which was vindicated because of the latest uptick. "I said their time would come, I don’t like bulky coins, but these two are an exception," he added.The trader stated that he was positioned for ENS’ next goal of $40.Photo by Avi Rozen on ShutterstockPrice Action: At the time of writing, ENS was trading at $26.25 following a 12% surge in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Read Next: Pepe Becomes Only The Third Memecoin After Dogecoin And Shiba Inu To Reach $7B Market Cap, Adds $4B In May Alone

Biden BTC (BIDENBTC) Will Rally 11,000%, As It Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Biden BTC (BIDENBTC) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Biden BTC (BIDENBTC), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Biden BTC presents a similar opportunity.



Biden BTC has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Biden BTC could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Biden BTC can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Biden BTC on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Biden BTC by entering its contract address – 9MAph1jbrbs98UTvZ3EC5VVFAeKduh9iY78jJKDwxioz – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BIDENBTC.

Ethereum Price Hits $3,900. Will It Reach $4,500 Before ETFs?


Arthur Cheong, founder and CEO of Defiance Capital, has predicted that the price of Ethereum (ETH) could potentially hit $4,500 even before the launch of spot ETFs.At press time, Ether is trading at $3,885 after adding 3.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. As reported by U.Today, the SEC greenlit 19b-4s listing requests from a slew of Ethereum ETF issuers last week in a stunning U-turn. Prior to that, leading ETF industry analysts as well as major banking players of the likes of Standard Chartered claimed that these products were unlikely to be approved. After the news about imminent ETF approval broke on social media, the Ether price entered a major uptrend, surging from $3,600 to $3,900 in a span of just three days.Weakening momentum Despite the major bullish catalyst, the leading altcoin has so far failed to gain a footing above the $4,000 level. It is also down 19.8% from its all-time high. According to 100eyes Crypto Scanner, the Ethereum price has seen bullish divergence on the hourly time frame. This bearish pattern occurs when an asset manages to make new highs, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) records slower highs. Based on this particular chart, it is clear that Ethereum is currently experiencing weakening momentum despite the substantial price increase. The RSI recorded a lower high in the 65-70 range after Ether surged to $3,900, which is the main horizontal resistance level.  If the bearish divergence ends up playing out, the price of the chief altcoin could experience a pullback from the current level. However, it is also likely that Ether will be able to break above $3,900 if the volume is strong enough.

Bitcoin inches toward $69K: Is BTC poised for a new peak? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin’s price increased by over 3% in the last seven days.
Most market indicators and metrics looked bullish on BTC.

Investors have become skeptical of Bitcoin [BTC] as it is failing to hold its price above $70k. However, there was more to the story, as BTC has the potential to reach new highs soon, but only if history repeats itself. 
Bitcoin has a plan
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that after dropping from $70k and reaching $68k, the king of cryptos was once again inching towards $69k. The coin’s price had increased by over 3% in the last seven days. 
At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $68,953.86 with a market capitalization of over $1.35 trillion. 
Mags, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet that gave hope for a massive price surge. As per the tweet, there were many similarities between BTC’s 2016 cycle and the current 2024 cycle. 
The RSI just returned from the overbought zone while the price moved sideways, which looked similar to that of 2016. 
To be precise, in 2016, the RSI surged from 60 to 90 three times before the price eventually peaked. As of now, the metric has spiked only once, suggesting that BTC’s bull rally is far from ending anytime soon. 
Therefore, if history repeats itself and BTC follows the same trend, investors might see BTC reach an all-time high. 
Do metrics support a rally?
AMBCrypto then analyzed CryptoQuant’s data to see whether metrics were bullish on the king of cryptos. We found that BTC’s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven-day average, hinting at lower selling pressure. 
Miners were also selling at a moderate rate, which was evident from its low MPI.
Source: CryptoQuant
Additionally, its funding rate was also green. This meant that derivatives investors were actively buying BTC. However, market sentiment around the king of cryptos looked pretty bearish.
 As per our analysis, both Coinbase Premium and Korea Premium were red, indicating selling sentiment was dominant among US and Korean investors.
Source: CryptoQuant
We then analyzed BTC’s daily chart to better understand which way it was headed. We found that the MACD displayed a bullish advantage in the market.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a sharp uptick. These indicators suggested that the chances of BTC turning bullish were high. 
However, not every indicator supports the bulls. For example, after a sharp increase, the Money Flow Index (MFI) started to decline, which indicated a price correction in the coming days.

                            Bitcoin White Paper Returns to Bitcoin.org After Craig Wright Fails to Prove He is Nakamoto

                        The Bitcoin white paper has made its way back to the Bitcoin.org website following Craig Wright’s unsuccessful attempt to prove his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the Bitcoin protocol.Hennadii Stepanov, the maintainer of Bitcoin.org, announced the return of the white paper by sharing a link to the PDF on platform X.Earlier, Bitcoin.org faced legal constraints that forced it to limit access to the white paper for users based in the United Kingdom.Instead, a powerful quote from Satoshi Nakamoto adorned the site, emphasizing the nature of information as being easy to spread but hard to stifle.Wright Won Copyright Infringement Case Against Cobra
In 2021, Craig Wright managed to win a copyright infringement lawsuit against Cobra, the anonymous group operating the website.As a result, Bitcoin.org was compelled to remove the white paper PDF, and Cobra, opting not to mount a defense, had to pay £35,000 ($40,100) in legal fees.Wright had previously filed for United States copyright registration for the Bitcoin white paper in 2019.Taking his legal actions further, in 2023, Wright filed lawsuits against 13 Bitcoin Core developers and several companies, including Blockstream, Coinbase, and Block, alleging copyright violations related to the white paper, its file format, and database rights to the Bitcoin blockchain.The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund responded, highlighting the concerning trend of abusive lawsuits targeting prominent Bitcoin contributors.These lawsuits not only introduce significant time, stress, and expenses but also pose legal risks that discourage open development.However, Wright’s copyright victory has lost its significance as his claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto and the author of the white paper have been thoroughly discredited, rendering his copyright claim invalid.A detailed ruling came about as a result of a case brought against Wright by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a coalition of prominent companies aiming to prevent Wright from asserting ownership over Bitcoin’s core intellectual property.COPA accused Wright of engaging in an elaborate scheme of forgery and deceit to fabricate evidence supporting his claim as Nakamoto.Furthermore, a United Kingdom court froze Craig Wright’s assets worth £6.7 million ($8.4 million) to ensure he doesn’t evade the payment of court expenses.With the Bitcoin white paper now falling under an MIT open-source license, it is freely available for anyone to reuse and modify the code for any purpose.Nakamoto May be a Collective Entity
Meanwhile, a recent investigation provided evidence to suggest that Nakamoto may actually be a collective entity. One piece of evidence is the usage of both “we” and “I” in the Bitcoin white paper, indicating the possibility of a team operating under a singular pseudonym.Another piece of evidence comes from the linguistic analysis of Nakamoto’s writings.The white paper showcases impeccable English with precise language and accurate usage of technical terms.However, since Nakamoto’s writing style appears to be different in forums and email correspondences, this suggests multiple individuals were involved.

How Will This Week’s US Economic Data Impact Crypto Markets?


																Crypto markets have remained relatively inactive over the weekend, maintaining gains made last week in the wake of spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund approvals in the United States.
This week will see the release of more economic data such as consumer confidence and gross domestic product indicators.
Economic Calendar May 27-31
Monday is Memorial Day in the U.S., so markets will be closed, and low volatility is expected for crypto assets.
Tuesday will see the release of consumer confidence data which has improved slightly in May from the previous month with better-than-expected weekly jobless claims and manufacturing and services PMIs last week.
Thursday, we will see the Q1 2024 GDP Growth Annualized report, which provides an advanced estimate and insight into the economy’s health from the previous quarter.




However, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that the economy has slowed to an annualized growth of 1.5%, slightly lower than initial estimates.


On Friday will be released April’s Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report which indicates the average amount of money consumers spend monthly. Federal Reserve FOMC policymakers keenly eye this data as their primary inflation gauge and will use it to estimate whether inflation is coming down.
A related Personal Income and Personal Spending report for April is also due on Friday. This reflects the total value of personal income in America in addition to the value of purchases of all types of goods and services by consumers.
Consumer spending is a big driver of economic growth, so these reports can provide data on the overall economy and impact Fed monetary policy decisions.
There will also be a total of ten speeches from Federal Reserve bosses this week.
Wholesale giant Costco, software firm Salesforce, and computer firm HP are among the earnings reports to keep an eye on this week.
Crypto Market Outlook
Presidential candidate Donald Trump gave the crypto industry a huge potential boost over the weekend when he said he would support its future in America if elected.


However, it was not enough to move markets, which hovered around the $2.7 trillion market cap level over the weekend.
The Monday morning Asian trading session has been muted. Bitcoin has slipped slightly and sits just below $69,000 at the time of writing.
Ethereum prices were doing better, with a gain of 4% on the day to reach $3,900 after the ETF approvals, while the altcoins remained largely mixed.

New Solana Memecoin RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) to Skyrocket 18,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



RIP DOGEY (RIPDOGEY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because RIPDOGEY has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, RIP DOGEY can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and RIP DOGEY could become the next viral memecoin.



RIP DOGEY launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy RIP DOGEY on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for RIP DOGEY by entering its contract address – GVZoEtPFj1fMuW2zA4Zww27Mcx1yJSobrW3hzp5hfqCe – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like RIPDOGEY.

            Over the weekend, a series of hacks compromised several X accounts from crypto influencers and celebrities to promote a number of coins, resulting in short-lived price surges.One of the most prominent targets was GCR, whose account was compromised on May 26. After the initial intrusion, the hacker was able to post promotional content on ORDI and Luna2.0, causing momentary price increases of 6% and 274% for the tokens. Observers noted that the hacker could have chosen to promote a microcap coin for more significant gains, rather than the relatively established ORDI, which already has a market cap of $856 million.Udi Wertheimer, a Bitcoin dev and Ordinals supporter, warned that the incident with GCR may not be an isolated case. It appears that this was part of a broader operation targeting celebrity X accounts, such as mumble rapper Rich the Kid and media personality Caitlyn Jenner.For the former, a new token called $RICH on the Solana meme coin creation platform pump.fun. No official confirmation from Rich the Kid’s management team has been posted, although the post has already been deleted. Current market cap for this coin has stagnated at $144K, data from dexscreener indicates.As for Jenner’s account, a meme coin named $JENNER was also promoted, moving the coin’s market capitalization to $25 million, according to aggregated data from Raydium and GeckoTerminal.Despite videos of Jenner assuring followers that the posts are genuine, many industry experts believe the account has been compromised. Interestingly, the crypto wallet address posted by Jenner matches the one used by adult content creator Kazumi, whose account was hacked on May 20 to promote the “ZUMI” coin.No data regarding the threat actor’s identity has been disclosed at the time of writing, while no particular entity has claimed responsibility for the hacks, and whether these are connected or related to a singular hacker or group has not been established.

Ethereum ETF Approval To Spur 'A Basket Of Crypto Tokens Within A Year,' Says TD Cowen - Benzinga

The approval of spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETF products may spur the creation of more cryptocurrency-linked investment funds in the near future, according to investment bank TD Cowen. What Happened: TD Cowen‘s Washington Research Group viewed the approval of Ether ETFs as a marquee event, paving the way for more institutional interest in digital assets, The Block reported.See Also: Bitcoin, Dogecoin Bounce Back With Ethereum Lagging: Trader Sees ‘Price Discovery Next Week’ Under One CoJaret Seiberg from TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group stated, “This comes about six months faster than we expected…yet this decision was also inevitable once the SEC approved cryptocurrency futures ETFs.”Seiberg further noted that within a year, there might be offerings that include a “basket of cryptocurrency tokens,” potentially just featuring Bitcoin and Ether, or many more.Why It Matters: The approval of Ethereum ETFs is a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency industry. According to a report by JPMorgan, Ethereum ETFs are expected to trade well ahead of November, indicating strong market interest and potential growth.Furthermore, the approval marks a new era for digital assets. The introduction of these ETFs could lead to increased mainstream adoption and investment in cryptocurrencies.Despite this approval, the SEC’s overall stance on cryptocurrency remains unchanged. SEC Chair Gary Gensler issued a critical statement against new crypto legislation, emphasizing the industry’s issues with compliance.Interestingly, Chair Gensler was not part of the team that voted to approve the ETFs.TD Cowen predicts that the SEC will maintain its Democratic majority until 2026, continuing its litigation against cryptocurrency trading platforms that trade what it considers unregistered securities.Read Next: Donald Trump: ‘I Will Ensure That The Future Of Crypto And Bitcoin Will Be Made In The USA’Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

JENNER Token by Caitlyn Jenner Stirs Controversy


Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympic athlete and member of the Kardashian-Jenner family, has caused a stir in the cryptocurrency community with the announcement of her eponymous token, JENNER.
Her X (Twitter) and Instagram accounts revealed the launch, leading to widespread debate and suspicion. The JENNER token’s announcement came amid a wave of similar hacks affecting other crypto influencers and celebrities, adding to the skepticism.
What’s Behind the JENNER Token?

Jenner’s X and Instagram accounts featured videos of her promoting the JENNER token. These were accompanied by statements from her manager, Sophia Hutchins, who assured followers that the project was legitimate and not a scam.
Hutchins emphasized her role in overseeing the project, insisting that Jenner’s accounts were secure and not compromised by hackers. Despite these reassurances, skepticism persisted within the crypto community.

“A lot has been going on today, and yes this crypto on my account is real. If you wanna get in on this, get in in a hurry. Get in right now,” she said.

The concerns prompted the crypto community to invite Jenner to a Twitter Space discussion, but she could not attend. Instead, Hutchins spoke on her behalf. However, she failed to provide clear answers about the token’s value proposition.
Following the discussion, the community has mixed reactions. Some members remained optimistic, while others suspected a coordinated scam.
Further doubt arose when it was discovered that the wallet address associated with Jenner’s token was previously linked to another hacked account belonging to adult content creator Kazumi, who promoted a different token, ZUMI, just days earlier. Meanwhile, some speculated that scammers used deepfake technology to impersonate Jenner in promotional videos.
The JENNER token debuted on pump.fun, a Solana-based platform for meme coins. Pump.fun’s official X account also actively promoted the JENNER token, further blurring the lines between a genuine launch and potential fraud. 
Despite these concerns, the token experienced a dramatic price increase of 28,000% in just one day. DEX Screener data reveals that JENNER has achieved a market capitalization of $18 million.

The concern is valid, as malicious actors often exploit the fame of celebrities for illegal activities, particularly with meme coins that have no practical use. Recently, prominent crypto investor Gigantic-Cassocked-Rebirth (GCR) confirmed their X account was hacked.
The hacked account posted about ORDI and LUNA2 on May 26. The post caused both tokens to spike by 6% and 274%, respectively.
Similarly, American rapper Rich The Kid shared a link with his 2.3 million followers to buy a new token, RICH, launched on the pump.fun. Within the first two hours, the token quickly reached a $90,000 market cap. Although it remains unclear if Rich The Kid’s X account was hacked, the post was subsequently deleted.

The controversy highlights the potential risks and vulnerabilities in the crypto space, especially involving high-profile figures. These vulnerabilities are a key reason why some regulators approach the industry with caution and stringent measures. As the situation develops, the crypto community remains split on the legitimacy of the JENNER token and its future impact.

Crypto Trader Says Bitcoin Halving Still Not Priced in Despite Run-Up to New Highs - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed analyst in the crypto space says that markets still haven’t fully adjusted to Bitcoin’s recent halving, which slashed BTC miners’ rewards in half.
In a new video update, pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital tells his 77,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin has historically ignited a parabolic rally after the halving.










But the trader notes that actual pricing in of the halving tends to happen a few months after the event.
“The Bitcoin halving is not priced in. Historically, whenever we’ve seen a halving, we’ve seen phenomenal upside at this point in the cycle, where already we’ve seen new all-time highs but we’ve been consolidating for a long time, and so breaking to new all-time highs once again is only a matter of time. 
Of course, this is not on the logarithmic scale so I don’t expect price to be rallying to $400,000 or whatever the case may be. 
Historically, we tend to see consolidation for over 150 days before finally seeing a breakout to a parabolic rally which lasts multiple months. We’re currently in a re-accumulation period again so the fact that we’re re-accumulating here, the longer the better, the more we pause and capture a breather here will be better for the uptrend that inevitably ensues afterward.”
Rekt Capital recently said that Bitcoin was officially out of the “danger zone” where corrections have historically occurred during its market cycles. However, he said that BTC may not spark breakout rallies to new all-time highs until about September of this year.
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $68,580.

Checking Cardano's strong link with AVAX, MATIC: Gains ahead? - AMBCrypto



The correlation coefficients respectively indicate nearly parallel market movements.
On-chain data suggested that holders should anticipate further gains in the future.

According to IntoTheBlock, Cardano [ADA] has a stronger correlation with Avalanche [AVAX] and Polygon [MATIC] than any other top cryptocurrencies.
At press time, the correlation between ADA and AVAX was 0.99. For MATIC, it was 0.98 on a 60-day basis. Values of the correlation coefficient range from -1 to +1 where the former implies significant divergence.
On the other hand, a reading close to +1 suggests strong direction movement which was the case with Cardano and the other two. As of this writing, ADA’s price was $0.45, which was a 26.40% decrease on a Year-To-Date (YTD) basis.
Source: IntoTheBlock
A trio in deep waters
For AVAX, its value was $36.94— a 11.73% decrease within the same period. Lastly, MATIC changed hands at $0.71, marking a 29.21% slide.
To ascertain if Cardano would continue to follow in the same direction as AVAX and MATIC, AMBCrypto looked at the sentiment around the projects.
A look at the Weighted Sentiment metric provided by Santiment that the reading was -1.613 for ADA. In AVAX’s case, the reading was -1.018 while MATIC’s was -1.544.
Weighted Sentiment shows the unique social volume, measured by comments about an asset. If the metric is positive, it implies that market participants are bullish, and demand for the assets involved might increase.
However, since the reading was negative for all three, it indicates low confidence in the potential. With this trend, there is a chance that ADA, AVAX, and MATIC prices might decrease again.
Source: Santiment
At the same time, a highly negative sentiment of this nature could indicate a good period to accumulate before a major surge appears.
The tokens may soon get back to the bull phase
But to confirm that, we need to analyze the Market Value to Realize Value (MVRV) ratio. This metric tells if a cryptocurrency is undervalued or otherwise.
The more the MVRV ratio increases, the more profits holders have, and the more they are willing to sell. On the other hand, a decrease in the metric suggests that more holders are moving into unrealized losses.
In this case, most will decide to HODL. At press time, Cardano’s 30-day MVRV ratio was -5.313%. This means that if every ADA holder who accumulated within the last 30 days sold, they’d be making an unrealized loss.
In MATIC’s case, the metric was 1.608%. But one thing AMBCrypto noticed was that the ratios decreased. Therefore, one can assume that the tokens were undervalued in the context of the bull market.
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s AVAX’s market cap in ADA terms

Should the prices begin to recover, ADA could rally back to $0.67. If it is the same for AVAX, the token could make a move to $50.35.
In addition, a bounce for MATIC could send the price in the $1.06 direction.

Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) Coin Will Skyrocket 14,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Buterin Sucks (BUTSUCKS), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




BUTSUCKS will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Buterin Sucks.



Currently, Buterin Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy BUTSUCKS on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Buterin Sucks by entering its contract address – jr8okimfHEWaJpDmiZenkGWHzEr5bb53bDZf4kQvF7w – in the receiving field.




BUTSUCKS currently has a market cap of just under $12,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Ripple Vs. SEC: Lawyer Predicts Impact Of Biden's Crypto Shift


								James “MetaLawMan” Murphy, the founder and chairman of law firm Murphy & McGonigle, has provided his expert analysis on how the recent policy adjustments under President Joe Biden’s administration might affect ongoing legal battles, specifically the case between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). His insights were shared in the context of a dialogue on X.
Under the leadership of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the commission has maintained a stringent stance on cryptocurrency, prioritizing investor protection through rigorous enforcement. However, Murphy points out a potential shift in regulatory approaches influenced by the broader political environment, particularly with upcoming elections that could lead to changes in leadership within the SEC.
Can Ripple Leverage Biden’s Crypto Softening?
Murphy expressed skepticism about settling with the SEC under its current trajectory. “I wouldn’t settle any crypto case with the current SEC before seeing how the election turns out,” he advised on X. He highlighted the possible implications of a shift in leadership, noting, “Given what Trump & [Robert] Kennedy are saying, I would expect a very different SEC under open-minded leadership like Hester Peirce or similar.”

Peirce, known as ‘Crypto Mom‘, is popular in the crypto community for her dissenting opinions favoring a more progressive approach to crypto regulation. He speculated that a new SEC leadership could lead to significant changes, including “voluntary dismissals of crypto cases the Gary Gensler regime has initiated where there was no fraud and no victims.”
The Biden administration has recently shown signs of a more softening approach towards cryptocurrencies after former US President Donald Trump openly rallied his pro-Bitcoin and crypto stance. Notably, Murphy’s statement came shortly after Trump reinforced his pro-Bitcoin and crypto stance: “I will ensure that the future of crypto and Bitcoin will be made in the USA. I will support the right to self custody to the nation’s 50 million crypto holders. I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your Bitcoin.”

In response to these political maneuvers by his competitor, Biden’s response is exemplified by the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, a move seen as a significant forward step given the previous reluctance to approve crypto ETFs due to concerns over market volatility and investor protection.
When questioned about the potential effects of this softer stance on the Ripple case, Murphy was careful to separate judicial proceedings from administrative shifts. “The recent softening of the Biden admin’s stance on crypto should not have any effect on Judge Torres’s ruling,” he stated, emphasizing the independence of the judiciary.
However, he did acknowledge that this could affect the SEC’s stance in potential settlement negotiations, suggesting, “I guess it’s conceivable that it might impact the negotiating position of the SEC—if there are any settlement discussions.”
The discussion on X also touched on strategic considerations for Ripple. One user argued that settling might be prudent given the uncertainties of future administrations, stating, “I think it is smart for Ripple to settle if they get the opportunity. You never know who wins the next election. A devil you know is better than a devil you don’t know.” Murphy recognized the validity of this cautious approach but maintained his neutrality, saying, “I hear you. I don’t have any opinion on what Ripple should or shouldn’t do.”
At press time, XRP traded at $0.52737.

                        Ex-US President Donald Trump rallies behind cryptocurrencies, embracing “all things related to this new and burgeoning industry.”“I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies,” he reiterated his pro-crypto stance on Sunday, during the Libertarian National Convention address.Trump assures that he would never let crypto die, throwing a shade on Biden’s moves to kill Bitcoin and crypto.“Crooked Joe Biden, on the other hand, the worst president in the history of our country, wants it to die a slow and painful death. That will never happen with me,” he wrote in a post on Truth Social.Trump’s crypto endorsement comes at a time when the current President Biden is facing heat for his anti-crypto stance. However, Biden administration is also softening its crypto stance as the US election is just months away.Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved eight spot Ethereum ETF applications, signaling growing acceptance of cryptos within traditional finance.Trump Wants US to be the ‘Leader’ in Crypto
Trump has been continuously projecting his crypto support in the recent past, trying to lure younger crypto-loving voters. He recently began accepting crypto campaign donations after raising millions from Trump trading cards in the NFT space.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee stressed his desire to make the US, a leader in cryptos.“Our country must be the leader in the field. There is no second place,” his Truth Social post read.Trump’s sudden crypto embrace has caught the eyes of several prominent investors. Early this month, Shark Tank billionaire Mark Cuban, who is an open supporter of Biden, warned that Trump could win the 2020 elections for taking up a “new weapon” against Biden: crypto.“If Joe Biden loses, there is a good chance you will be able to thank Gary Gensler and the New York SEC,” he wrote on X (Twitter). “Crypto voters will be heard this election.”Crypto’s Key Role in 2024 Elections
According to a report from Washington-based Politico, only a fraction of voters in America use crypto. Further, only 7 percent of adults held or used crypto in 2023, the Fed’s recent “Economic Well-being of US households” reveal. This is a decline of 5 percentage points from 2021.Despite this, crypto holds a key space in the US politics, as several crypto businesses are willing to spend over $80 million in the upcoming 2024 elections, Politico noted.

How Institutional Adoption Could Push Bitcoin Over $400,000


Bitcoin’s allure is growing as investors increasingly recognize its unique traits. The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) simplify the process for investors, potentially leading to a significant increase in Bitcoin’s price.
The Motley Fool analysts highlight that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs is a major step in cryptocurrency acceptance. They believe this could drive Bitcoin’s price to $400,000 or even $1 million. 
Bitcoin’s Path to $400,000 and Beyond 

The ETFs allow retail investors to bypass complex crypto exchanges and digital wallets, making Bitcoin more accessible.
However, the potential for substantial growth lies with institutional investors entering the Bitcoin market. These include pension funds, retirement plans, and hedge funds, which manage vast sums of money. Previously deterred by the complexities of digital assets, these institutions can now incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolios with ease, thanks to ETFs.

As of now, about 700 professional investment firms have invested around $5 billion in these ETFs. Leading investors include Millennium Management, which has allocated about 3% of its $64 billion portfolio to Bitcoin ETFs. Others, such as Morgan Stanley and Bracebridge Capital, along with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, are also significant participants.
Despite this growth, institutional investors still represent only about 10% of the total ETF ownership. This figure is increasing, indicating a rising institutional interest that could significantly boost demand for Bitcoin. Institutional investors often conduct extensive due diligence before diversifying into new assets like Bitcoin.

“Yet, after conducting their research, I think they will all likely arrive at the same conclusion: Bitcoin’s inherent characteristics make it a necessity in portfolios. Eventually, widespread adoption among institutional investors will occur, leading to a tsunami of capital flowing in,” a Motley Fool analyst said.

This shift in investment isn’t just about increasing Bitcoin ownership; it involves strategic financial planning. With the vast sums managed by these institutions, even a small allocation to Bitcoin could have a major impact. If institutions allocate 5% of the $129 trillion assets they manage to Bitcoin, its market cap could exceed $7 trillion, pushing its price beyond $400,000.

Some analysts believe a 5% allocation might be too conservative. ARK Invest suggests an optimal portfolio could include up to 19% Bitcoin for the best risk-adjusted returns.

Their recommendation is based on a rolling 5-year analysis, which supports a higher allocation to maximize portfolio performance.
As investment strategies evolve, Bitcoin’s role in future financial portfolios appears increasingly significant. Observing the benefits reaped by their peers, more institutions might feel compelled to increase their Bitcoin investments.

Former Head Of Google China Predicts On AI Taking Over Jo...


                                “AI In 2027 Will Take Over Human Jobs”, Former Google China Head                                Technological change through AI has made many discussions regarding its effects on the global workforce. Two very influential persons Kai Fu Lee and Elon Musk have given their views about the future of AI and how it can impact human employment and society. If AI is to take away a significant amount of employment, then society has to deal with unemployment and its consequences. This may entail redesigning the education, employment training, and welfare systems for people who are likely to be displaced by AI.Kai Fu Lee’s Predictions on AIKai Fu Lee is a computer scientist who has been in the industry for many years and is also a venture capitalist who has been arguing for the use of AI for many years. In 2017, Lee said that AI would displace over 50% of the global human workforce by 2027. Nonetheless, he has been very vocal on the issue though many people have criticized him for being too aggressive. In an interview with Fortune, Lee stood by his forecast saying, “It’s quite accurate. I got too aggressive in 2017, 2018, and 2019 and frankly speaking, I was somewhat nervous at that time but when gen AI came out, everyone seemed to get on the bandwagon and believe that is the right speed.”Lee’s argument is based on the assumption that the majority of the jobs include monotonous tasks that Artificial Intelligence can best do. He named such jobs as truck driving, telemarketing, dish-washing, fruit picking, and assembly line jobs as samples of jobs that AI could replace. He considers AI as being an infrastructural technology in the same way that electricity and the internet are.Elon Musk's Opinions On Dangers of AIAnother major player who has given his thoughts on AI is Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Musk has often expressed his concern over the threat posed by AI and has said that it may even outcompete humans in almost all spheres. In the recent past, Musk declared that “AI will be better than humans at everything.” This bold assertion captures Musk’s view that AI is capable of taking over every job.Currently, the use of AI is widespread and is actively used in many industries, with its development constantly growing. Many companies such as IBM, LinkedIn, and Google have laid off thousands of employees due to AI. Over 50,000 employees have been let go of their jobs in 2024 alone which depicts a future trend as AI technology grows.Musk’s worry does not end with losing jobs. He has also pointed out the threats of bleeding control over AI advancement, stressing the importance of its proper regulation and ethical approach. Recently, Musk revealed his thoughts on the dangers of politically correct AI rather than being true. As much as he agrees that AI would benefit society, he insists that people must oversee the process to ensure that the development of AI is in harmony with people’s vision and standards.What CoinGabbar Concluded?As per the fact-finding, both Kai Fu Lee and Elon Musk share their opinion regarding the importance of AI though having a somewhat different attitude towards it. Lee’s concern is the fact that AI is likely to replace many human jobs given the efficiency and the existing economic systems. Musk on the other side focuses on the risks that are bound to occur in the future with politically correct AI rather than being true and how there is a need to ensure that these risks are well managed to avoid negative impacts.There are many opportunities and threats that AI brings into the future. There is thus a need to approach this shift wisely to ensure that policymakers, business managers, and society. In general, understand and appreciate how technology is opening up new horizons while at the same time presenting a threat to the human labor force.Also Read: Suno AI Music Platform Attracts $125 M Investment

                        Aptos, a layer-1 blockchain platform developed by former Facebook employees, has set a new record in blockchain transactions.On May 25, Aptos surpassed Solana by recording an astounding 115.4 million transactions in a single day, far exceeding Solana’s 31.7 million, according to Aptoscan.The surge in transaction volume not only shattered previous records but also surpassed the L1 record of over 65 million held by Sui Network by an impressive margin of over 50%.The exponential growth in transactional activity on Aptos highlights the platform’s increasing adoption and the industry’s overall momentum.According to data from Aptoscan, the blockchain’s user TPS (transactions per second) reached an all-time high of 32,000 on the same day.This signifies a significant increase in activity within the blockchain ecosystem, showcasing the platform’s scalability and robustness.The recent surge in transactional activity on Aptos can be attributed to the launch of Tapos Cat, an innovative tap-to-earn game that has rapidly gained popularity.Within its first day on the mainnet, Tapos Cat processed a staggering 10 million transactions, making a substantial contribution to the increased activity on the platform.Tapos Cat offers users the opportunity to earn $HEART tokens by ‘tickling’ a virtual cat, encouraging multiple transactions within the game.Additionally, the game provides a gas-fee-free experience for the first 72 hours, incentivizing players to engage without incurring any additional costs.Crypto Veterans Question Tapos Cat’s Long-Term Viability
Critics, including the CEO of Helius Labs, have raised questions about Tapos Cat’s long-term viability and practical utility.They argue that the game’s emphasis on click-and-buy interactions may artificially inflate metrics without genuinely serving user needs.However, proponents of Aptos contend that Tapos Cat serves as a crucial engineering project, showcasing the scalability and robustness of the Aptos network while paving the way for future developments.In another move, the Aptos Labs team recently introduced a group of global advisers, including David Lawee, former vice president of corporate development at Google.Additionally, Aptos Labs has collaborated with Atomrigs Lab to announce plans for the launch of T wallet, a Web3 wallet service, in partnership with South Korean telecommunications operator SK Telecom (SKT). Solana Among Fastest Blockchains
Solana has proven to be the fastest among large blockchains, processing a staggering 91 million transactions in a single day.On April 6, Solana achieved a record-breaking daily average of 1,504 transactions per second (TPS) during the memecoin frenzy.This makes the blockchain an impressive 46 times faster than Ethereum and over 5 times faster than Polygon, which boasts the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.Despite its position as the fastest blockchain, Solana has only achieved 1.6% of its theoretical maximum speed of 65,000 TPS.It is worth noting that Ethereum scaling solutions and layer 2 solutions have yet to surpass other layer 1 blockchains in terms of real processing speed.This may be attributed to the lower number of on-chain transactions on Ethereum scaling solutions, resulting in slower realized TPS for these blockchains.

Bitcoin to face altcoin onslaught? Here's what to expect in June - AMBCrypto



The altcoin positioning chart showed that alts performed well relative to Bitcoin recently.
Their market capitalization has steadily grown alongside BTC’s price gains.

The Bitcoin [BTC] slump of early May lasted only for a short while. The ETF inflows were negative for around a week at the beginning of the month, but have quickly picked up since then.
The past two weeks saw consistent inflows which highlighted the presence of demand behind Bitcoin.
The altcoin performance in the past month has also been positive. Memecoins have been some of the best individual performers, but the rest of the altcoin market also expanded its market capitalization.
Will the past nine months’ pattern repeat once more?

Crypto analyst Jessica Miranda observed in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that altcoins had more prominence compared to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin still held just over 54% of the market share, compared to the king the alts have performed better recently.
The analyst noted that this usually does not last long and is also usually followed by a downturn in BTC prices. That has been true for a large part of the past nine months, when the rally began in earnest in September 2023.

However, on the longer timeframes, even intense bull runs can have periods where altcoins outshine Bitcoin. The 2016-17 run had plenty of such moments. The 2020-21 run had fewer such occurrences but a BTC rally did see favorable altcoin moment.
The bear trend of 2022-23 was when this pattern made itself more clear. If it repeats once more, Bitcoin might see a dip in the coming week or two.
Taking the recent Bitcoin breakout past the $67k resistance into account, such a dip was unlikely. Yet, it is something traders might have to be prepared for.
What does the Bitcoin dominance chart reveal?
Source: BTC.D on TradingView
The BTC Dominance was closing in on a short-term range low at 54%, meaning that it would likely bounce soon.
Such a bounce would cut short any rally that the altcoin market has initiated, but it would also subvert expectations of a BTC price drop from the altcoin positioning chart.
Source: TOTAL2 on TradingView
The suggestion that the altcoin market could see a pullback gained more credibility when the altcoin market cap, or the market cap of the entire crypto ecosystem minus that of Bitcoin, was analyzed.

The market cap chart approached a key zone of resistance at $1.24 trillion. A rejection from that region was expected from a technical analysis perspective, although eventually this resistance would be broken given the strong uptrend of the past eight months.
Therefore, based on technical analysis, a Bitcoin surge and an altcoin (temporary) slump is expected in the first half of June.

Ethereum Breaks Out as SEC Greenlights ETFs, Memecoins Soar


							

Ethereum signals an upside breakout following the SEC’s ETF approval.



ETH surged 6.39% over the weekend to retest post-ETF approval levels.



PEPE, BONK, FLOKI, and BOME surge following Ethereum’s recent rally.




Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has shown signs of an upward trajectory following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETH rose by 6.39% over the weekend to approach the post-ETF approval price of May 23, when the SEC announced its approval for firms seeking to launch Ethereum ETFs.



TradingView’s data indicated that Ethereum’s resurgence pushed the leading altcoin above $3,900 in the early hours of today, following two days’ consecutive positive daily closes. Today’s rally means Ethereum has gained nearly 30% in the past seven days, bolstered by last Monday’s single-day 20% surge, three days before the ETF approval.







Following the cryptocurrency’s recent surge, analyst Matthew Hyland noted in a post on X that ETH has confirmed a bullish divergence. According to Hyland, the cryptocurrency has broken out of the downtrend. He also shared a screenshot illustrating his analysis to show that a volume increase supports Ethereum’s upside breakout.



Meanwhile, more analysts have predicted an imminent rally for Ethereum following last week’s ETF approval. DeFiance Capital founder Arthur Cheong believes the altcoin would climb to $4,500 before firms start launching spot Ethereum ETFs. On his part, Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano predicted MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor would invest in ETH within the next six to twelve months. 









It is worth noting that some x aligned with Ethereum’s recent rally, have delivered significant returns in the past seven days. Data from CoinmarketCap shows Pepe, the frog-themed memecoin, gained over 79% in the past seven days. BONK, FLOKI, and BOME followed the trend, with seven-day gains of 40%, 27%, and 14%, respectively.

OP Mainnet comes the second with $7.88 billion. Base is ranked the third with $6.94 billion TVL.Other blockchains with a TVL exceeding $1 billion include Blast, Mantle, Linea, and Starknet. L2BEAT indicated that the total value locked of all L2s has increased by 17.39% in the past seven days.Spot Ethereum ETFs Drive Growth
The bullish trend was primarily motivated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent approval of the spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).On May 23, the SEC approved the Ethereum ETF applications filed by a total of eight issuers, marking the second spot digital asset ETF in the country, following the spot Bitcoin ETFs approved in January.The issuers included BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. They are yet in the process of submitting S-1 forms, as the timeline remained uncertain while analysts expected launch within weeks.Next Upgrade Pectra Scheduled for Q1 2025
In addition, the Ethereum core developers have decided that Pectra, the next major upgrade of the Ethereum network, will be launched in the first quarter of 2025.The community choose Q1 2025 so the developers could avoid debugging during Devcon and the holiday season. This schedule would also allow the contributors to extensively test the upgrade and handle the transition.For the consensus client “CL,” the upgrade will include PeerDAS to increase the network’s data availability. For the execution client “EL,” Pectra is planned to include EOF, replace EIP3074 with EIP7702, and patch EIP2935.

The Total Value Locked in the Project Supported by the Popular Social Media Application Telegram Exceeded 300 Million Dollars! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The total value locked (TVL) on The Open Network (TON) blockchain has surpassed $300 million for the first time, marking an impressive tenfold increase since early March.
Total Locked Value of TON Blockchain Exceeds $300 Million
This increase is largely attributed to The Open League, TON's ongoing ecosystem initiative that encourages users of the network's top decentralized applications (dApps).


According to DeFiLlama data, since the launch of the incentive program, TVL on the TON blockchain has increased dramatically from $23 million in early March to $315 million.
The rapid growth has been driven primarily by decentralized exchanges such as Ston.fi and Dedust, as well as liquid staking projects such as Tonstakers and bemo.





In addition to the increase in TVL, the network recently acquired 1 million wallets during a token creation event for Notcoin, a viral clicker game developed as a Telegram Mini App.
This influx of new users demonstrated TON's robust architecture that enables transactions without network outages, increased fees, or transaction delays.



Originally conceived as a blockchain project by popular messaging platform Telegram, Open Network raised $1.7 billion through two private token sales in 2018.
However, the mainnet launch was delayed due to a legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission over unregistered securities offerings.





In response, community members founded the Tone Foundation and continue to develop it, culminating in the launch of The Open Network in 2021.
Telegram continues to support blockchain by promoting its use for applications such as sharing advertising revenue with channel owners.

Why Is the Market Up Today?


The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) and Bitcoin’s (BTC) price are currently subdued owing to bearish macro conditions. The recent approval of spot Ethereum filings and the crypto regulatory framework bill FIT21 have had no bullish impact on the market yet. 
Nevertheless, a small-cap token, JasmyCoin (JASMY), did impress investors with a 31% rise in 24 hours.
In the news today:-

Justin Sun publicly advocates for a US presidential candidate who endorses cryptocurrencies. He tweeted that it’s imperative to demonstrate to the candidate that the cryptocurrency community and companies’ voices should be heard and interests protected.
Former US President and candidate Donald Trump vows to release the founder of the website Silkroad, Ross Ulbricht. Trump noted that Ulbricht would be pardoned on the first day if re-elected.


The Total Market Cap Rise Is on Pause
The total crypto market cap is currently at $2.5 trillion, hovering around this level for almost a week. TOTAL managed to breach this barrier but fell soon after below the level. Amid the bearish macro market conditions, the rise expected to take the total market cap beyond $2.61 trillion has become a sideways movement.
This will continue in the coming days until the market witnesses a resurgence in optimism.

But if bearish cues dominate the market, a drop to $2.40 trillion cannot be ruled out. This could also wipe out a chunk of inventors’ gains.

Bitcoin’s Price Holds at Crucial Support
Bitcoin’s price is trading at $68,571 at the time of writing after failing to breach the resistance at $71,800. Holding the support at $70,000 or bouncing off it would have enabled BTC to continue rising, but this did not transpire either.
As a result, the crypto asset is currently holding above the $68,500 support floor that BTC has tested multiple times.

A fall below this support could lead to a significant drawdown, which could drag Bitcoin’s price down to $64,800.

JasmyCoin Takes the Spotlight
JasmyCoin, the native crypto token of a Tokyo-based IoT company, Jasmy Corporation, leveraged the little bullishness still in the market. The altcoin surpassed every other major altcoin to emerge as the best performer in the last 24 hours.
JASMY marked a 30% rally, bringing the crypto asset up from $0.021 to $0.027 and reaching a two-year high as a result.

While the all-time high is far away, the next major support is also far away. Thus, if investors do not sustain this rise, the chances of reaching it could vanish, with JASMY falling to the crucial support of $0.024.

                        The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs last week has ignited pressure on South Korea’s financial regulators to greenlight similar crypto exchange-traded funds.Last week’s approval of Ethereum ETFs marked a dramatic reversal for the US market. Up until then, most market participants were expecting a rejection for these ETFs, atleast in May.The Korea Times reported Monday that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) are hesitant about allowing crypto assets to be traded on the traditional securities market.The FSC cited the Capital Markets Act to justify its skepticism towards crypto ETFs. The Act restricts ETFs to underlying assets, which are traditionally real financial assets or securities like international currencies or commodities.Jung Eui-jung, head of the Korean Stockholders’ Alliance, reportedly called for the authorities to follow the US and approve ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum. He believes this step is crucial to prevent investors, both in traditional finance and digital assets, from leaving Korea.“Who would want to invest their money in a market that lags behind the fast-changing regulatory landscape?” Jung said.South Korea Financial Watchdog Stalls on Crypto ETFs
South Korean crypto investors currently don’t have the option to trade spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Additionally, financial authorities in January shut down any hopes for regulations allowing sales of Bitcoin futures ETFs in the near future.In March, Lee Bok-hyun, governor of the Financial Supervisory Service, acknowledged the internal debate surrounding virtual assets. While he personally holds a positive view, others within the agency express more caution, he said. Lee stressed the importance of considering all viewpoints and having open discussions before moving forward.“Among authorities, I am one of those who are positive about virtual assets, while there are others who are wary, and we need to hear their opinions as well. We are internally discussing it,” he said.Korean Parties Vie For Crypto Voters
In a surprising turn of events, South Korea’s robust cryptocurrency market became a central theme in the lead-up to the country’s parliamentary elections in April. Both major political parties saw an opportunity to woo voters with crypto-centric promises.President Yoon Suk Yeol’s People Power Party acknowledged the growing influence of the crypto industry and pledged to delay the implementation of a digital-asset tax, a move likely to resonate with crypto investors.In contrast, the opposition Democratic Party focused on loosening restrictions on ETFs, including those that would allow investment in US Bitcoin products. This strategy aimed to attract voters seeking easier access to cryptocurrency investments.

Token Unlock Tsunami: Crypto Markets Ready for the Incoming Wave?


							

Seven major token unlocks scheduled for the coming week



June 1 Dominates Unlock Schedule: dYdX, 1inch, Axelar, and others set for release



Market Impact Uncertain: Potential for increased supply and price volatility




Large-scale token unlocks in the cryptocurrency market often signal a bearish trend, as they release previously restricted assets into circulation, increasing supply and potentially lowering prices. These unlocks typically involve distributing tokens to team members, organizations, and early investors, including venture capital firms.



In the coming week, seven token unlocks are scheduled, potentially impacting the market. The first is the dYdX (DYDX) token unlock scheduled for June 1, where $67.77 million worth of digital assets will enter circulation.



Also on June 1, $30.78 million worth of 1inch (1INCH) tokens will be unlocked, adding 98.7 million tokens to the existing circulating supply of 1.15 billion 1INCH. Additionally, on May 29, Portal (PORTAL) will see the unlocking of 30.61 million tokens (3.06% of total supply), valued at around $26.59 million.



Furthermore, 33.30 million Axelar (AXL) tokens (3.33% of max supply) will be unlocked on June 1, with an estimated value of $24.28 million. The same day, the digital asset community will witness the unlocking of 195.25 million Skale (SKL) tokens, worth approximately $17.30 million.



It seems like June 1 is the day of multiple token unlocks, with 28.88 million Biconomy (BICO) tokens worth $16.47 million being released into circulation. It’s noteworthy that 65.08 million Sui (SUI) tokens, worth $67 million, will be added to the circulating supply of 2.33 billion SUI on June 1. 



 
 




Finally, on June 2, 37.41 million Orbler (ORBR) tokens will be released, with a total value of $14.73 million.



The following is a summary of the upcoming token unlocks along with tentative datelines, highlighting the impact on the cryptocurrency market:




May 29: Portal (PORTAL) – $26.59 million



June 1: dYdX (DYDX) – $67.77 million



June 1: 1inch (1INCH) – $30.78 million



June 1: Axelar (AXL) – $24.28 million



June 1: Skale (SKL) – $17.30 million



June 1: Biconomy (BICO) – $16.47 million



June 1: Sui (SUI) – $67 million



June 2: Orbler (ORBR) – $14.73 million




While the cryptocurrency market is already in a corrective phase, the influx of billions of dollars worth of new tokens could further hinder any significant recovery.

Donald Trump will liberate Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road if re-elected President

Donald Trump has promised that if he is re-elected President of the USA, he will proceed with the release of Ross Ulbricht, founder of Silk Road, sentenced to two life sentences plus 40 years in prison. 

Donald Trump: “Ross Ulbricht has already served 11 years, we will bring him home”
In a speech at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C, Donald Trump promised to commute the life sentence of Silk Road founder, Ross Ulbricht. 
Nello specifico, il candidato alla Presidenza degli USA, ha affermato che se venisse rieletto procederà a liberare Ulbricht dalla sua condanna a due ergastoli più 40 anni per aver creato il mercato darknet.
Here are Trump’s words:
“If you vote for me, on the first day I will commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence to a reduced sentence. He has already served 11 years, we will bring him home”
The promessa è stata accolta con applausi rauchi dal pubblico riunito, molti dei quali reggevano cartelli con la scritta “Free Ross”.
On the other hand, it was already since December 2020 that the news was circulating that Trump, at that time President of the USA, was already considering granting a pardon to Ulbricht. 
Ulbricht has been in prison since 2013, sentenced to 2 life sentences plus 40 years, without the possibility of parole, for computer fraud, money laundering, and drug trafficking. His darknet market Silk Road operated from 2011 to 2013, and is widely considered the first case of Bitcoin use in the real world.
For many activists, the sentence would be too excessive given that Ulbricht would not have committed any violent crime, to the point that over 200,000 signatures have been collected for his release. Ulbricht has become a sort of martyr for many even in the crypto community.
Donald Trump: the response of Ross Ulbricht and his favorable position towards crypto
Directly from prison, here comes Ulbricht with his response on X to both Trump and his supporters:

“Last night, Donald Trump committed to commuting my sentence on the first day if he is re-elected. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you all. Thank you all. After 11 years in prison, it is difficult to express how I feel at this moment. It is thanks to your unwavering support that I will have a second chance.”
Donald Trump then also ventured on Truth Social to confirm his favorable position on crypto, stating even that he predicts that the USA will be the leaders in this sector as well. Here are his words: 
“I am very positive and open to cryptocurrency companies and everything related to this new and thriving industry. Our country must be a leader in this field. There is no second place”.
Sempre Trump ha poi aggiunto: 
“President Joe Biden wants [the cryptocurrency industry] to die a slow and painful death. With me, it will never happen!”.
The executive order focused on crypto and the election campaign 
E così, se dovesse mai venire rieletto Presidente degli USA, fin dal suo primo giorno Trump dovrebbe da un lato concentrarsi a commutare la condanna a Ulbricht, e dall’altro svolgere un altro impegno. 
It is the complete executive order focused on and in favor of crypto proposed by David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine. 
In practice, Bailey would have publicly announced the connection (of him and his team) with Trump’s election campaign, which in return will lead to a pro-crypto political program, the details of which have not yet been revealed. 
At the same time, Bailey has also asked for support from the crypto-community in voting for Donald Trump as the new President of the USA, so that everyone can be together against Biden’s crypto policies. 
Not only, Trump’s pro-crypto stance has been further confirmed since his election campaign started accepting donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto. Trump’s supporters can donate in cryptocurrency.

BNB looks beyond $686: Will the altcoin cross 2021 highs? - AMBCrypto



BNB’s price increased by more than 4% in the last seven days. 
Metrics and indicators hinted at a continued price rise.

Binance Coin [BNB] investors were having a great time as the coin’s price rallied during the last week. However, the momentum has declined in the last few hours. 
Though this looked bearish at first glance, it might be an indication of yet another bull rally.
BNB’s silent move
After a comfortable rally of 4% last week, the coin slowed down. According to CoinMarketCap, BNB’s price only moved up marginally in the last 24 hours. 
At the time of writing, the coin was trading at $602.68 with a market capitalization of over $88.9 billion. The decline in momentum resulted in a drop in BNB’s 1-week price volatility. 
Apart from this, social metrics were also affected.
 AMBCrypto’s look at Santiment’s data revealed that its Social Volume declined sharply last week. Its Weighted Sentiment also dropped sharply on the 26th of May.
 This clearly indicated that bearish sentiment around the coin was dominant in the market. 
Source: Santiment
But BNB had a trick up its sleeve that could turn the situation around. A bullish pennant pattern appeared on the coin’s price chart in mid-March. Since then, BNB has been consolidating inside the pattern.
At press time, the altcoin was on its way to test the upper limit of the pattern. So, a breakout above that could kick off yet another bull rally.
 In fact, if the bull rally happens, then the coin might soon test its all-time high of $686, which it touched back in 2021. 
Source: TradingView
Will BNB manage to break out? 
AMBCrypto then analyzed BNB’s on-chain data to see whether it hinted at a successful breakout of the bullish pennant pattern. 
As per our analysis, BNB’s trading volume declined while its price volatility dropped. This hinted at a trend reversal soon. 
Its Funding Rate has also remained low, further increasing the chances of a rise in volatility in the coming days.
Source: Santiment
The coin’s price was sitting on its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), hinting at a rebound.
 On top of that, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a sharp uptick, which suggested that bulls might step in soon and, in turn, allow BNB to break above the bull pattern.

However, in order to sustain a bull rally, BNB must go above a strong resistance level near $613. This seemed to be the case, as liquidation would rise sharply at that mark, which can cause a price correction. 
A successful breakout above that would allow BNB to target new highs.

‘It’s Time’ ‘$1 Million BTC’ Advocate Samson Mow Says, Expecting Omega Candle Soon

Samson Mow, a Bitcoin permabull and CEO at a Bitcoin adoption-focused company Jan3, has published an ultra bullish BTC tweet, predicting a BTC Omega candle taking place soon.Mow is a believer, among many other Bitcoiners, that the world’s flagship cryptocurrency will eventually skyrocket to the $1 million level and in his view this remarkable growth will happen thanks to “Omega candles”. In one of his tweets this year, Mow identified them as tremendous green candles on Bitcoin charts that may be accompanied with large volatility curves.The Jan3 boss tweeted “it’s time”, accompanying his tweet with an animated GIF. He and his former boss from Blockstream Adam Back have used the same GIF of a dragon sending a pillar of green fire from his mouth into the sky. This symbolizes an “Omega candle” in the context of their tweets. Mow’s X post was a response to Back’s tweet, in which he asked “is it time?” also referring to a massive Bitcoin rise he expects to happen in the near future, perhaps even this year. After the spot Bitcoin ETF launch, Mow tweeted that he expected the ETFs to create a Bitcoin demand shock by massive daily purchases. Once the halving took place in mid-April, Mow tweeted that it had caused a supply shock which would soon clash with the BTC demand shock.Robert Kiyosaki explains why Bitcoin safer than bondsFinancial expert and entrepreneur Robert Kiyosaki, widely known as the author of a classic book on personal finance management “Rich Dad Poor Dad”, has taken to his account on the X platform to share a useful observation about Bitcoin.Kiyosaki dispelled a popular opinion of traditional investors which claims that “bonds are safe.” The expert stated that this is the “biggest lie financial planners tell gullible mom and pop investors.”The “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author also pointed out that even sophisticated investors often take losses when AAA bonds crash – this happens when commercial real estate collapses on the market. These “sophisticated investors”, he explained face massive losses when the market office real estate market fails to make loan payments. The best move here, according to Kiyosaki, is to get into safer assets – gold, silver and Bitcoin “before their prices explode.”

Analysts Shared Their Expectations for Ethereum Following Ethereum ETF Approval! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Arthur Cheong, founder of DeFiance Capital, made a bullish prediction that Ethereum (ETH) will reach $4,500 before spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trading goes live.
DeFiance Capital Founder Predicts Ethereum to Reach $4,500 in a Short Time with Spot ETH ETF
This optimistic outlook comes amid growing expectation in the crypto community regarding the potential impact of spot ETH ETFs on the market.


A survey conducted by WuBlockchain within the Chinese crypto community reveals strong belief in Ethereum's bullish potential. According to the survey, 58% of respondents are confident that ETH can rise to $10,000 or above during this market cycle.
This sentiment underscores the widespread optimism and high expectations surrounding Ethereum's future performance.





Ethereum is currently trading at around $3,940, and spot ETH ETFs have generated significant interest among investors.
The approval of these ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seen as a major milestone that could attract significant institutional investments and further increase the price of ETH.


Arthur Cheong's prediction aligns with the views of other market analysts who see strong potential for Ethereum in the near term.

The anticipated approval and subsequent trading of spot ETH ETFs is expected to increase liquidity and institutional participation, which could positively impact the price of Ethereum.





The broader cryptocurrency market has seen increased interest and inflows, particularly following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. This precedent set the stage for similar enthusiasm around Ethereum ETFs and contributed to the current bullish sentiment.
Ethereum, which started the new week with an upward trend, has increased by nearly 4 percent in the last 24 hours. It is possible to say that the rise may become even stronger, especially after the 4000 dollar level is crossed.

New York Attorney General Plans to Pursue Crypto Firms


New York Attorney General Letitia James has reiterated her firm stance against deceptive practices within the crypto sector. 
These actions highlight James’ commitment to fighting against unregulated crypto activities.
Letitia James Maintains Her Anti-Crypto Stance

Following a recent landmark $2 billion settlement with crypto lender Genesis, James emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance for all crypto entities operating in the state.

“Crypto companies must play by the same rules as everyone else. We will go after those that don’t,” James said.

Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?
Last week’s settlement with Genesis marked a record in New York’s legal history—the largest ever. In October 2023, the legal action stemmed from allegations that Genesis misled investors about the risks involved in its operations. Consequently, Genesis is required to return the fraudulently acquired funds to the affected parties and will cease its operations within New York.
Moreover, James’ vigorous approach to crypto regulation is not new. Since being elected New York’s Attorney General in 2018, she has used her position to launch various crackdowns against crypto companies. She claims she wants to ensure the crypto market adheres to established financial laws.
In January 2023, James took legal action against Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius, accusing him of defrauding over 26,000 New Yorkers. Consequently, in July 2023, Mashinsky was arrested after facing legal charges from various US regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

In March 2023, James filed a lawsuit against the crypto exchange KuCoin. She alleged that KuCoin operated as an unregistered securities trading platform, engaging in the unauthorized sale and purchase of securities and commodities.

Additionally, her legal endeavors include a protracted battle with Tether and crypto exchange Bitfinex, initiated in April 2019. This confrontation culminated in February 2021 with a settlement that imposed an $18.5 million fine on the companies. This fine underscored the consequences of disregarding regulatory mandates.

Jenner Token Launch Plagued by Doubts: Hack or Deepfake?


							

Caitlyn Jenner launched the JENNER token, which saw a $113.5 million volume in just 4 hours.



Speculation of a hack and deepfake concerns raised despite assurances



Community identified connection between JENNER’s wallet address and a previously hacked wallet, raising red flags




Caitlyn Jenner, the American media personality and former Olympic gold medalist, has recently launched the JENNER token, sparking interest and raising questions in the crypto community. While Jenner’s official X account shared a post promoting the token, some members of the community speculated about a possible hack.







Jenner’s post asserted that the Jenner token launch is real, dismissing speculations about “deep fakes.” She added that the token saw a significant volume of $113.5 million in just 4 hours. Additionally, Jenner’s post included a statement from her manager, Sophia Hutchins, that emphasized the project’s legitimacy.







Sharing Hutchins’ words, Jenner wrote in her post:




 “Here is Sophia Hutchins, my manager, rest assured. I have not been hacked and keep sending this to the moon. I’m out on the golf course enjoying my Sunday and I will not be going live in spaces today. My team is managing this launch. It is authentic. Keep it up.”




Hutchins stated that the token was real and that Jenner’s account was not hacked. She wrote, “A lot has been going on today, and yes this crypto on my account is real.” She added, “If you wanna get in on this, get in in a hurry.”



Despite these assurances, the community remained skeptical about the project as it was later discovered that the address associated with the JENNER token was previously linked to a content creator Kazumi’s account. Kazumi had promoted a token, ZUMI, and her account was hacked. There are also speculations that the scammers may have used deepfake technology to impersonate Jenner in the video.

Crack The Bitcoin Code: Swiss University Unveils Pioneering Business Course


								The hallowed halls of academia are embracing the digital age, with the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Business Administration (HWZ) announcing a one-of-its-kind Bitcoin course.
Launching in March 2025, this program promises to be the first of its kind in Europe, offering a comprehensive exploration of Bitcoin for business professionals. However, the hefty price tag of the course has left some members of the cryptocurrency community feeling more like spectators at a “fiat faucet failure” than potential enrollees.

Bitcoin Course Costs A Fortune
HWZ’s brainchild caters specifically to individuals seeking to integrate crypto into their business models. Spanning 16 days and carrying a price tag of 9,950 francs (which is almost $11,000), the course offers a crash course in all things Bitcoin.
Participants can expect to explore the economic principles that underpin the world’s first cryptocurrency, analyze its impact on traditional finance, and dissect the technical aspects of blockchain technology, the backbone of Bitcoin.
Source: 20 Minuten
Recognizing the complexities surrounding cryptocurrency, the curriculum also examines the ever-evolving regulatory landscape of cryptocurrency, equipping participants with the knowledge to navigate compliance hurdles. But the course doesn’t stop there. It also guides participants through wealth management strategies specifically tailored for BTC, a valuable asset class known for its volatility.

To help students differentiate Bitcoin from the sea of other digital assets, the program includes a comparative analysis of altcoins. This in-depth exploration equips participants with a clear understanding of what makes Bitcoin the “granddaddy” of cryptocurrencies and how it stacks up against its younger counterparts.

From Theory To Practice: Business Models For The Future?
The final leg of the course bridges the gap between theory and practice. Here, participants get a chance to explore the exciting world of business models and opportunities enabled by Bitcoin. By the course’s end, graduates will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to leverage Bitcoin’s potential for innovation and disruption within their organizations.
Crypto Community Questions Value Proposition
While HWZ boasts the program’s uniqueness, the hefty price tag has caused some ripples of discontent within the Bitcoin community. Many online commentators expressed skepticism, suggesting that the cost would be better invested directly in Bitcoin itself, with the remaining funds used for self-directed learning through online resources and forums.

Is This A Gateway For Broader Adoption?
Despite the initial resistance from some Bitcoin enthusiasts, the university’s initiative signifies a growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s influence on the business world. The course’s existence could pave the way for the development of further educational programs, fostering a new generation of professionals equipped to navigate the complexities of the digital asset landscape.

Ripple CTO Deciphers XRP and XLM Price Mystery


A recent community discussion drew attention to the very similar price movement of XRP and Stellar (XLM). Ripple CTO David Schwartz suggested his perspective on this anomaly.Schwartz, who played a key role in the engineering of XRP Ledger, suggested that the parallel price behavior of XRP and XLM could be influenced by external factors outside of their ecosystems. He acknowledged that there is evidence both for and against this theory, emphasizing the complexity of the issue.As one key point, Schwartz cited the impact of Stellar's significant token burn last year. Despite the reduction of half of the entire supply, this event did not cause a noticeable deviation in Stellar's price or its correlation to XRP.  This made Schwartz believe that a similar burn of Ripple-owned XRP would likely not have a positive impact on the price of XRP. He once again cited charts comparing the price behavior of XRP and XLM before and after the burn, which showed no significant change.What may lie behind this anomaly?Despite similar price behavior, XRP and XLM have different tokenomics. XRP has a total supply of 99.98 billion tokens, 55.43 billion tokens in circulation, a price of $0.525 and a market capitalization of $29.1 billion. In contrast, XLM has a total supply of 50.001 billion tokens, 28.976 billion in circulation, a price of $0.1083 and a market capitalization of $3.14 billion.The price correlation between XRP and XLM can be attributed to their intertwined history and market dynamics. Created by Ripple cofounder Jed McCaleb as a decentralized alternative, the Stellar ecosystem often follows the movements of XRP. Investors tend to look for opportunities in similar assets, leading to capital flow into the market and equalizing the price dynamics of these two cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum Soars to $3,900, Altcoins Rally Post-ETF Approval


The preliminary approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for several spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has sparked renewed enthusiasm in the crypto market.
This development has led to significant gains for Ethereum (ETH) and several altcoins within its ecosystem, such as PEPE and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), over the past 24 hours. This signals strong investor confidence and optimism about the future of Ethereum-based assets.
DeFi Ecosystem Benefits from Ethereum’s Market Momentum

Ethereum’s price surged to $3,910, inching closer to the critical $4,000 mark. This represents a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours. Crypto analyst Gert van Lagen sees a bullish outlook for Ethereum’s long-term price trajectory.

“ETH [1-week chart] showing strong hidden bullish divergence too! While the price makes higher highs, the momentum indicator (RSI) makes lower lows,” Van Lagen explained.

Additionally, altcoins in the Ethereum network have shown impressive growth, with PEPE rising by 13.5% and ENS increasing by 9.4%. They are now trading at $0.00001679 and $26.05, respectively.
Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has also experienced a surge. DefiLlama data shows that the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s DeFi is $66.61 billion as of May 27, marking its highest TVL since mid-May 2022.

Despite the renewed interest, the market has not yet entered an altcoin season (altseason). According to the Altcoin Season Index, only 35% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. To enter an altseason, the market needs 75% of altcoins to outperform Bitcoin.

In addition to the optimism from the ETF approval, Ethereum developers have announced the upcoming “Pectra” upgrade for Q1 2025. This update will introduce the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), which includes about 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). EOF aims to improve the EVM code with an opt-in container system, marking a significant advancement in Ethereum’s development.

Trump Takes Center Stage: US Crypto Advocacy Gets A Powerful Voice | Bitcoinist.com


								Republican Presidential candidate and Former US President Donald Trump has declared his support for cryptocurrency, advocating for its future in the United States, as the presidential election draws closer. With this declaration, Trump’s views on digital assets have clearly changed because he now acknowledges their ability to spur economic growth and innovation.
US Should Not Accept Second Place In The Crypto Industry
Former US President Donald Trump revealed his unwavering support for cryptocurrency during a campaign against incumbent President Joe Biden in Washington DC. He also disclosed his plans for the industry should he be elected as the next president of the US.

“I will ensure the future of crypto and the future of Bitcoin will be made in the USA, not driven overseas,” he stated. This statement simply demonstrates that Trump aims to position the US as a leader in the global digital economy and emphasizes the significance of progressive regulations.
Trump further stated that he would support the right to self-custody for the over 50 million digital currency holders in the US. The former president has promised to create a safer landscape by keeping those against digital assets, such as US Senator Elizabeth Warren, away from it. In addition, he affirmed his stance against the creation of a central bank digital currency.
It is worth noting that Trump has constantly displayed his support for digital assets lately. Last week, the former president announced he would be accepting political donations for his campaign in the form of cryptocurrency through Coinbase Commerce.
The website read:
“Demonstrating President Trump’s success as a champion of American freedom and innovation, we proudly offer you a chance to contribute to the campaign with cryptocurrency.”
According to his website, the campaign will be accepting coins such as Bitcoin (BTC), the largest digital asset, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB).
Specifically, the campaign has established a fundraising page where donors who meet federal requirements can make contributions with any of the aforementioned assets that Coinbase Commerce accepts.
With this action, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in this year’s upcoming election is now the first candidate from a major party to accept digital currencies.
Trump Blasts Joe Biden’s Understanding Of The Assets
This move by Trump comes a few weeks after he declared himself a crypto candidate for the upcoming election at a Mar-a-lago gala celebrating Trump’s Mugshot Edition NFT collection. At the event, Trump highlighted the value of crypto supporters’ votes as he asked them to back his candidacy.

He then criticized current US president Joe Biden, alleging he lacks understanding of these digital assets, casting himself as a pro-innovation rival ahead of the election scheduled for November 4, 2024.
Thus, he has urged crypto enthusiasts to vote for him in order to drive innovations and make the US a leader in the industry. “If you like crypto in any form you better vote for Trump,” he stated.

Santa on Solana (SANTASOL) to Skyrocket 17,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Santa on Solana (SANTASOL) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Santa on Solana (SANTASOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SANTASOL has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Santa on Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa on Solana could become the next viral memecoin.



Santa on Solana launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Santa on Solana on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa on Solana by entering its contract address – 9aKN9xRfKe9gzfA6cC1aVC88DvRpyjPhyBGEnSyLzR2D – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTASOL.

                        Scammers have targeted popular crypto influencers on X (Twitter) with the acronym GCR, on late Sunday. His compromised X account carried a post predicting the price of the ORDI token, causing brief price surges.The hacker apparently posted promotional content on ORDI and Luna 2.0 tokens, resulting in momentary price increases.GCR later confirmed the hack, asking followers to ignore any promotional posts.Interestingly, he believes that someone was “bribed” at X.com to provide his log-in credentials, causing a security breach.“Was notified 2 months ago by someone affiliated with Twitter that bribes were had been made to get access to my account, and beefed-up security then. He wrote. “But there can’t be any security if X employees take money for admin access.”Following the hacker’s post, the price of ORDI climbed from around $40 to $44. However, the rally was short-lived and the price fell back. The token is trading at $40 at the time of writing. Additionally, Luna 2.0 soared 274% momentarily.Observers’ Predictions
GCR’s heads-up on the hack has caught the eyes of several crypto observers who predicted the possible motive of the hack.For instance, Bitcoin developer and an observer Udi Wertheimer has predicted that GRC’s X account hack could be a part of a wider scam targeting celebrities and crypto influencers.“As more niche celebs are popping up by the minute launching meme coins — on a long weekend when platform engineers are away — I recommend that you guys be very careful,” he warned.Additionally, popular Chinese crypto blogger Colin Wu noted that the hacker “established positions on OKX and Binance 6 minutes in advance.”Another crypto analyst Miles Deutscher commented that GCR’s hacker “fumbled the bag hard.”“Bro could’ve picked any believable micro-cap to pump 10-20x, yet chose to shill ORDI and LUNA2 for a measly 10% wick.”Celebrity Crypto influencers’ X Accounts Hacked
Previously, American rapper “Rich The Kid” posted a link to buy a new token RICH, launched on the Solana memecoin creation platform – pump.fun. According to DEX Screener data, the token’s market value reached $90,000 in the first two hours of its release.However, the post was later deleted and no official statement from Rich The Kid management was made confirming that it was a hack.Parallely, American media celebrity Caitlyn Jenner’s X account promoted a new memecoin JENNER, also on pump.fun platform. Apparently, the token accumulated a market value of $4.7 million since its launch. Given the token’s sudden surge, many believed it to be a hack.Jenner again strongly promoted that coin few hours ago, asking followers to ignore influencers who told not to buy JENNER token. “They want you to stay broke,” her recent post read.

Media Celebrity Caitlyn Jenner Promotes New Meme Coin, Community Reacts to Potential Hack


																Caitlyn Jenner, an American media personality and a former Olympic gold medal winner, has a new meme coin she’s promoting via her X account. Dubbed $JENNER, the token was launched on the Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX), Pump.fun.
Despite the suspicion from several crypto community members on X, the meme coin has soaked up a market capitalization of over $24 million, according to data from the on-chain analytics platform DEX Screener.
Jenner Promotes New Meme Coin
On May 26th, Jenner’s X account began publicizing the meme token hours after the crypto-friendly Donald Trump promised to “keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from [Americans’] Bitcoin.” The Olympian personality has been a vocal supporter of Trump in his presidential campaign against Joe Biden.
While Jenner began promoting the Solana-based meme coin under her name via X, she followed some prominent crypto figures. The media personality and her supposed manager, Sophia Hutchins, reassured the crypto community through video clips that Jenner’s account was not hacked. Still, several users claimed that Jenner’s video was a deepfake.
Jenner’s manager informed users via X Spaces that Jenner was out playing golf and unavailable to go live.




In less than 24 hours of launching the meme coin, $JENNER has captured a millions-worth market cap and $183 million in trading volume. The Solana-based token has soared by 39,000% to a trading price of $0.024. This surge is fueled by Jenner’s large followers on social apps. She has 3.3 million followers on X and 15.6 million fans on Instagram.
Is It Real or a Hack?
Despite the videos shared by Jenner and her manager and the mem ecoin’s market performance, its authenticity is still questioned among users.
Rich the Kid, an American rapper, saw his X account promoting a meme coin the same way Jenner’s X handle is currently doing. However, these tweets have been taken down.
An X user, CodeXBT, stated that one malicious player is behind the crypto adverts on both accounts. The user added that “a known grifter” from the AVAX ecosystem called Sahilsays is behind the attack.

                        The native token of Web3 social network Friend.tech, known as FRIEND, has experienced a significant drop in value.The decline came after one of the protocol’s co-founders, who goes by the pseudonym Racer, expressed intentions to part ways with Base, the Ethereum Layer-2 network developed by Coinbase that hosts the project.“System design bounty: If you can figure out a way to migrate friendtech off of Base without causing major issues for users, and it works well enough that we decide to use it, we will pay you $200K,” Racer said in a post on X. Friend.tech Relationship With Base Has Been Tumultuous
According to Racer, the relationship between the Friend.tech team and Base has been tumultuous.In another post, Racer mentioned that Farcaster investors had misconstrued their project upon its launch, resulting in a strained relationship with the Base community.The team felt ostracized and disconnected from certain parts of the Base and Ethereum ecosystems.Jesse Pollak, the head of Base at Coinbase, responded to the situation with a message of understanding.In a post, Pollak acknowledged that the Friend.tech team had experienced feelings of isolation and disconnection and expressed his support for whatever path they choose.“I’ll be sad if the team decides to leave Base, but I also respect and will support whatever path – that’s the beauty of the decentralized, onchain, economy,” Pollak wrote.Following Racer’s statements, the value of the Friend.tech token plummeted by approximately 20%.Friend.tech’s Popularity Sees Uptick After Decline
Friend.tech, launched on August 10, 2023, has become one of the top decentralized applications (dApps) on the Base layer, attracting over 200,000 users and facilitating a trading volume exceeding $230 million.The platform uniquely converts user influence into tradable tokens known as “keys,” allowing users to gain access to a creator’s attention or influence.The model has attracted not only cryptocurrency influencers but also NBA players and esports personalities, broadening its appeal beyond the crypto space.One significant factor contributing to Friend.tech’s popularity was the hype surrounding the Base network, a Layer 2 solution associated with Coinbase.The involvement of Paradigm, an investment firm connected to Coinbase, further increased confidence in Friend.tech’s potential.However, the platform has also faced privacy concerns, particularly regarding the potential for user doxxing due to the link between Twitter profiles and Ethereum addresses.Friend.tech has addressed these concerns by clarifying that the information deemed leaked was actually from their public API, showcasing the platform’s open nature while also highlighting the importance of user caution in protecting personal information.Nevertheless, Friend.tech has seen an uptick in popularity as of late.According to a Dune analytics dashboard, the project raked in more than $500,000 in revenue on May 3. This came as its revenue had recently fallen to under $20,000 over the past couple of months.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.16659, reflecting a 0.50% increase, which may indicate a bullish Dogecoin price prediction.
This comes as the internet mourns the loss of Kabosu, the Shiba Inu behind the iconic “Doge” meme, who passed away at the age of 18.
Farewell to Kabosu: The Iconic Doge Meme Shiba Inu Passes Away at 18

Kabosu, the Shiba Inu that inspired the famous “Doge” meme and Dogecoin cryptocurrency, passed away on May 24 at the age of 18. Kabosu, known for her iconic internet presence, had been battling leukemia and liver disease.
Her owner, Atsuko Sato, shared the news on her blog, mentioning that Kabosu passed away peacefully while being caressed. Sato adopted Kabosu as a rescue dog in 2008.
In 2010, Sato posted a picture of Kabosu with crossed paws on the sofa, which quickly became a viral meme on Reddit. This image symbolized Shiba Inus’s inner thoughts in broken English. The meme later became an NFT, selling for $4 million, and inspired Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency now worth $23 billion.
Dogecoin has gained attention from celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, and Elon Musk, who often promotes it on social media. Kabosu’s health had been a concern since late 2022, but Sato credited the support and prayers from fans worldwide for helping her through difficult times.

In November, a $100,000 statue of Kabosu was unveiled in a park in Sakura, crowdfunded by Own The Doge, a crypto organization.
Sato and the organization have donated over $1 million to international charities, including Save the Children.

Kabosu’s legacy will continue through her contributions to internet culture and philanthropy.
Dogecoin Price Prediction

Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.16659, reflecting a 0.50% increase, signalling the chances of a bullish Dogecoin price prediction. The pivot point at $0.1658 is a crucial level for determining the market’s direction. Immediate resistance levels are identified at $0.1708, $0.1746, and $0.1788, suggesting potential targets if bullish momentum persists. On the downside, immediate support is found at $0.1625, followed by $0.1575 and $0.1516, providing key levels to watch if the price faces selling pressure.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 50, indicating a neutral stance with neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $0.1634, with the current price trading above this level, suggesting a bullish trend in the short term.Dogecoin Price PredictionGiven the current technical setup, the upward channel supports the likelihood of continued buying above the $0.1665 level.Key Points:
Dogecoin trading at $0.16659, up 0.42%, pivot point at $0.1658.
RSI at 50, indicating a neutral stance; immediate support at $0.1625, resistance at $0.1708.
Bullish above $0.1658; break below this level can drive a sharp selling trend.
The strategy would be to maintain a bullish outlook above the pivot point at $0.1658, with a focus on potential gains towards the immediate resistance levels. However, a break below this pivot could trigger a sharp selling trend, making it essential to monitor these key levels closely.

Chart Whisperer Spots Algorand Breakout: Looming 50% Rally


																Algorand (ALGO), the blockchain platform known for its speedy transactions and energy efficiency, has caught the eye of crypto analysts. Popular analyst ZAYK Charts identified a potential paradigm shift for ALGO, pointing to a price breakout on the 12-hour chart that could propel the token 40-50% higher.

Algorand: Breaking The Resistance Barrier
Technical analysis, a realm where chart patterns and indicators guide investment decisions, has become a popular tool in the cryptocurrency space. ZAYK Charts noticed a significant development for ALGO – a breakout from a trendline on the 12-hour timeframe.
This trendline resistance level had previously acted as a ceiling for the token’s price. The successful breach of this resistance is seen as a bullish signal, suggesting a potential shift in momentum towards a price increase.

Volume Speaks Volumes
Breakouts alone aren’t always the most definitive indicators. To strengthen the bullish case, ZAYK Charts emphasizes a crucial supporting factor – increased trading volume. Imagine a surge in trading activity like a crowded stock exchange. In the context of cryptocurrencies, higher volume during a breakout suggests increased buying pressure from investors, further bolstering the likelihood of a sustained price rise.
ZAYK believes that this breakout has already occurred and that a 40–50% bullish wave would likely follow.
The Technical Arsenal Weighs In
ZAYK Charts doesn’t stop at the breakout and volume. The analyst examines deeper, citing positive momentum oscillators as additional evidence for a potential ALGO bull run. Momentum oscillators are technical indicators that measure the speed and strength of price movements. Positive readings on these oscillators suggest that the current uptrend has enough power to continue pushing prices upwards.
ALGOUSD trading at $0.19 on the 24-hour chart: TradingView.com
While the technical analysis paints a rosy picture for ALGO, it’s important to remember the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Unlike traditional assets with established regulations and underlying fundamentals, cryptocurrency prices can be influenced by a wider range of factors, including news events, social media sentiment, and even celebrity tweets.
A Look At Algorand’s Ecosystem
Technical analysis provides valuable insights, but it shouldn’t be the sole factor driving investment decisions. Investors should also consider the overall health and development of the Algorand ecosystem. Is there active development on the platform? Are there any upcoming partnerships or product launches that could drive adoption and increase demand for ALGO tokens?

ALGO’s Future: Soaring High Or Grounded By Reality?
The coming days will be crucial for ALGO. If the token can maintain its momentum and establish itself above the broken resistance level, the predicted 40-50% price surge might become a reality. However, if the bulls lose steam and the price falls back, the breakout narrative could be quickly forgotten.

Ethereum Developers Announced the Date of the Next Update, Pectra Update! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethereum core developers aim to release the Pectra update by the first quarter of 2025, according to the decision made at a recent executive meeting.
Ethereum Targets Q1 2025 for Pectra Upgrade After Dencun
Pectra is set to be the next major milestone for Ethereum following the successful implementation of the Dencun upgrade in March 2023.


Key Features of Pectra Upgrade
Pectra will introduce the Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF), which includes approximately 11 improvement proposals designed to enhance Ethereum's Virtual Machine (EVM) in both Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions.
These improvements are expected to benefit both developers and users by increasing the performance and flexibility of the EVM.





One notable addition in Pectra is the EIP-7251, otherwise known as “increasing maximum active balance.” This offer will allow individual validators to contribute more than the current maximum of 32 ETH, increasing the limit to 2,048 ETH.
This change aims to reduce operational complexity for validators managing multiple low-consistency accounts by enabling higher-consistency validators.


Replacement of EIP-3074 with EIP-7702
In addition to these improvements, Ethereum developers decided to replace the EIP-3074 account abstraction proposal with EIP-7702, a new proposal submitted by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.
EIP-7702 will introduce a new transaction type that allows Ethereum account addresses to temporarily act as smart contract wallets during a transaction and then revert to their original state.





This innovative feature is expected to increase the flexibility and functionality of Ethereum transactions.

PEPE's Latest All-Time High Makes it Bigger Than Litecoin, Polygon: Details


																TL;DR

Pepe (PEPE) reached a new all-time high of $0.00001717, while its market cap of over $7 billion positioned it as the 21st largest cryptocurrency.
The asset’s 24-hour trading volume exceeded $1.8 billion, outperforming other meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.


PEPE Keeps Rising
The frog-themed meme coin – Pepe (PEPE) – seems to have no limitations, tapping a new all-time high price today (May 27). It’s currently worth approximately $0.00001676 after a minor retrace from the latest peak, representing an 80% spike on a weekly scale and a staggering 1,000% jump since May last year.
PEPE Price, Source: CoinGecko
Its market capitalization rapidly increased, recently surpassing the $7 billion mark. Thus, the token flipped well-known altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC) and Polygon (MATIC).
PEPE is currently the third-biggest meme coin, trailing behind the leaders Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, it outperformed its rivals in one important field. According to CoinGecko’s data, PEPE’s trading volume for the past 24 hours reached over $1.8 billion, whereas DOGE and SHIB collectively hit a little more than $1 billion.




The token’s recent success is more than impressive considering the fact that its market cap stood at less than $3 billion at the start of May. Currently, over 96% of all PEPE holders sit on paper profits (according to IntoTheBlock’s data).
One cryptocurrency exchange that responded to the asset’s recent rally and increased interest from industry participants is Binance. As CryptoPotato reported, the company included the trading pair PEPE/EURO to the list of choices offered on Binance Spot. It also enabled trading bots services for the aforementioned option.
Is There More Room for Growth?
Crypto X is rammed with users who think PEPE’s bull run is nowhere near its end. One example is the content creator JAKE, who claimed that the asset’s market capitalization of $7 billion is “undervalued.”
Another X user suggested that PEPE’s pump is “still in nascent stages.” They assumed that a further rally for the asset “will pave the way” for other meme coins to follow.
Dealing with the token may seem like a successful investment option that can result in multi-million profits. The blockchain analytics platform – Lookonchain – revealed the case of a trader who made almost $2.5 million after purchasing PEPE in December last year and cashing out several hours ago. 
However, entering the ecosystem of meme coins can also be quite dangerous due to their infamous volatility. If you are about to jump on the bandwagon, please take a look at our dedicated video to protect yourself from some common mistakes:

PEPE and FLOKI extend gains as memecoins tease bull run - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Pepe price is up 80% this past week and over 140% in 30 days.
FLOKI has jumped 36% this past week and 53% in the last 30 days.

Pepe (PEPE) was the standout memecoin this past week, rising more than 80% to reach a new all-time high of $0.0000169 on May 27. Meanwhile, Floki (FLOKI) has surged to $0.0002656 amid fresh momentum in the memecoin market.
PEPE and FLOKI lead meme coins up
PEPE price is up 14% in the past 24 hours, bringing 30-day gains for the meme coin to 140%. Pepe has outperformed top meme coins over this period.
The 24-hour trading volume of Pepe stood at over $1.8 billion at the time of writing. Except for the stablecoins USDT, USDC and FDUSD, Pepe’s volume is fourth-largest behind Solana, Ethereum and Bitcoin.
The upside sees Pepe cement its position as the third-largest meme coin by market cap. At $7.1 billion, it is more than double that of Dogwifhat ($3.1 billion) but behind the top two of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin at $14.6 billion and $24 billion respectively.
Elsewhere, FLOKI price is up 18% in the past 24 hours and 53% in the past two weeks to hit highs last seen in March 2024. 
The uptrend is solidifying as investors eye top meme coins. Coinbase announcing support for FLOKI perpetual futures has catalysed further interest ahead of listing on May 30. 
Can FLOKI ride this and other catalysts to reach a new all-time high? Bulls appear in control.
Read more: Analysts bullish on Floki as Pepe and Bonk rally.
Crypto upbeat ahead of US election
The past week was largely positive for cryptocurrency after major regulatory-related developments in the US. The SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs and lawmakers passed key crypto bills that experts say suggest a flip in the regulatory landscape.
Former US president Donald J. Trump’s recent remarks about crypto has buoyed sentiment, propeling PolitiFi tokens.
While ETH price consolidated above $3,700 after the ETF news, it has climbed above $3,900 on Monday, and could eye a new high amid bullish predictions for Bitcoin (BTC) and the altcoin market.
In this case, its likely PEPE and FLOKI’s price gains are just getting started. 
Other memecoins making waves in the market today are Bonk (BONK) and MAGA (TRUMP) – the latter surging by more than 25% in the past 24 hours to reach a new all-time high above $13.

Top Analyst Predicts Over 50% Decline for Solana, Says There’s Really High Chance SOL Printed Macro Lower High - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto strategist who’s been bullish on Solana (SOL) for the past year is suddenly flipping bearish on the Ethereum (ETH) rival.
In a new video, pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 259,600 followers on the social media platform X that Solana appears to have completed a five-wave rally.










Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that attempts to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, an asset that has completed a five-wave upside move will likely witness a corrective period.
According to the analyst, SOL has been printing bearish patterns ever since rallying to its recent high of about $210 in March.
“We see a nice five-wave rise here on SOL from the bear market lows. Not only do we see that five-up, but from this fifth-wave high ($210) we can also see a five-wave decline, and now a three-wave move-up… And now we’ve started coming off again.
This has not risen in five waves. It’s declined in five waves. It’s starting to struggle here so I do think that there’s a really, really high chance that this is going to end up being a macro lower high ($188) for SOL/USD and that this will probably chop around and ultimately come down and take out these levels down here.”
Source: Bluntz/X
Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that SOL may drop all the way down to $80. At time of writing, SOL is trading for $165.

Now, Caitlyn Jenner Promotes Own Crypto Coin On X - But Is It Real Or Another Hack? - Emeren Group (NYSE:SOL) - Benzinga

A wave of posts from Olympian and media personality Caitlyn Jenner's official X account promoting a cryptocurrency inspired by her went viral Sunday, raising doubts about their authenticity.What Happened: In a series of posts, Jenner's X account, known for her vocal support of former President Donald Trump, promoted JENNER, a coin purportedly launched via Solana SOL/USD-based memecoin platform, pump.fun.One post from the official account stated, "We will be solely focused on Jenner and expect to hit the $50 million market cap in the first 24 hours."The aggressive promotion surprised social media users, with many suspecting the account had been hacked.Amid the confusion, a video surfaced from the account, purportedly showing Jenner in a bathrobe, saying, "Yes, this is for real. Get involved. It's going to be really good." A text accompanying the video reads, "No deep fakes. All real crypto."However, users remained skeptical.

Argentina Talks to El Salvador About ‘The Growth of the Use of Cryptocurrencies in Economies’ | Cryptoglobe


                                
Argentina has turned to El Salvador, a pioneer in Bitcoin adoption, to learn from its experiences and insights in navigating the complex world of digital assets.



According to a report by Argentina’s National Securities Commission (CNV), which is part of the country’s Ministry of Economy, in a significant step towards enhancing international cooperation in the realm of digital assets, top officials from Argentina and El Salvador recently exchanged insights on the growth and regulation of cryptocurrencies. This dialogue underscores the pivotal role of El Salvador, which became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar in 2021. 



Dr. Silva of CNV emphasized El Salvador’s leadership in the crypto space, noting the establishment of the National Commission for Digital Assets (CNAD). He pointed out, “El Salvador has emerged as one of the leading countries, not only in the use of bitcoin, but has also stood out in the world of crypto assets.” He further expressed the desire to strengthen ties with El Salvador and explore collaboration agreements. 



Dr. Boedo of CNV, who recently visited El Salvador for technical meetings on the development of securities markets and regulatory elements, praised El Salvador’s experience with crypto assets. He stated, “I want to highlight the experience of El Salvador when it comes to the world of crypto assets.” He emphasized the importance of continuing to strengthen ties with El Salvador, a pioneer in this field. 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Mr. Juan Carlos Reyes of CNV noted Argentina’s pioneering role in technology and the National Securities Commission’s commitment to efficient regulation of the industry. He said, “We appreciate the approach with the National Digital Assets Commission of El Salvador, being an innovative supervisory authority with experience in the digital assets industry.” 



The CNAD in El Salvador regulates all digital assets and financial instruments, with the Financial Superintendency and the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador also overseeing Bitcoin as an official currency. This comprehensive regulatory framework highlights El Salvador’s advanced position in the digital asset landscape.



Per a report by Cointelegraph, this collaboration between Argentina and El Salvador comes at a crucial time for the South American nation. In April, Argentina took significant steps towards regulating its domestic cryptocurrency market, introducing registration requirements for crypto firms operating within its borders. Argentina’s move towards embracing digital assets has been further bolstered by the election of Bitcoin-friendly politician Javier Milei as president in late 2023.



In a related development, Argentina’s foreign affairs minister, Diana Mondino, revealed in late 2023 that the government was preparing a decree to legalize the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for payments under certain conditions.

After El Salvador, Another South American Country is Preparing to Adopt Bitcoin! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Argentina's National Securities Commission (CNV) confirmed over the weekend that Argentine regulators are in talks with their counterparts in El Salvador regarding the adoption of Bitcoin (BTC).
Argentine Regulators Begin Bitcoin Talks with El Salvador Authorities
According to an official statement from CNV and a report by Criptonoticias, senior officials from Argentina met with the head of El Salvador's National Digital Assets Commission last week.


The talks focused on evaluating potential cooperation agreements related to digital assets.
CNV President Roberto Silva and Vice President Patricia Boedo traveled to El Salvador to understand the government's approach to BTC regulation.





The purpose of their visit was to strengthen ties with the Salvadoran government and explore opportunities for cooperation, and they placed Bitcoin at the center of their conversations.
“We want to strengthen our ties with El Salvador. Therefore, we will explore the possibility of signing cooperation agreements with the Salvadoran government,” said CNV Vice President Boedo.


This visit follows Boedo's preliminary technical meetings in El Salvador in March.

Juan Carlos Reyes, President of El Salvador's National Commission for Digital Assets (CNAD), emphasized Argentina's leading role in the technology sector.





He expressed interest in working effectively with the Bitcoin and digital assets industries to create appropriate regulations.
Reyes said: “Argentina is a pioneer in the technology sector. CNV wants to work efficiently with the Bitcoin and digital assets industries and establish appropriate regulations.”
The agreement with El Salvador is seen as a potential positive development for Argentina's Bitcoin and crypto communities.

Crypto Week Ahead: Solana's Big Fix, Ethereum Classic Halving, and More


							

Solana Upgrade Aims for Stability: Can it resolve recent network issues?



Bitcoin & Ethereum ETPs on London Stock Exchange: Will this boost mainstream adoption?



U.S. Treasury Buyback Program: How will this impact the crypto market?




This week, the cryptocurrency market is poised for a series of key developments, including significant network upgrades, new listings, the introduction of crypto ETPs on the London Stock Exchange, and crucial economic announcements from the U.S. Treasury.



The week begins with the Solana blockchain implementing its v1.18 upgrade on May 27, aimed at improving stability and performance. The Solana network has recently experienced intermittent outages.



On the same day, the MON Protocol (MON) will begin trading on prominent centralized exchanges, including KuCoin. MON will be paired against the USDT stablecoin, and holders can deposit their MON tokens to KuCoin via the ERC20 network.



Meanwhile, on May 28, exchange-traded products (ETPs) of Bitcoin and Ethereum will start trading on the London Stock Exchange. This move provides investors with additional avenues to gain exposure to digital assets through traditional financial markets.



On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury will initiate a buyback program. This strategic initiative, designed as an effective cash management tool, offers the flexibility to manage public debt. By repurchasing higher-yield debt and substituting it with lower-yield debt, the Treasury aims to reduce the government’s interest expenses, potentially easing the financial burden on taxpayers.



This move may instill confidence in the market and reassure investors about the government’s commitment to financial stability.









Moreover, the last few days of May will see a series of token launches and listings within the crypto community. May 29 marked ELIX’s Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on the Elixir launchpad, alongside the PARAM token listing on ByBit and the Saakuru (SKR) token IDO on Decubate.



Furthermore, the WeatherXM (WXM) project will debut its WXM token on Uniswap on May 30, expanding the diverse pool of assets in the DeFi ecosystem. Additionally, Ethereum Classic (ETC) miners are preparing for a mining rewards halving on May 31, a development that typically influences the asset’s supply dynamics and market valuation.

Ether Gains 26% in One Week After U.S. SEC’s ETF Nod | Cryptoglobe


                                
Speculative interest in Ether is intensifying after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unexpectedly permitted exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the digital asset. 







This regulatory pivot catalyzed a significant 26% increase in the value of Ether over the past week, marking the largest weekly gain since the 2021 crypto bull market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.







Investors might be encouraged by the successful debut of US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which have accumulated $59 billion in assets. However, Ether’s lesser-known status compared to Bitcoin makes predicting investor demand more challenging.



Unlike holding the tokens directly, spot Ether ETFs will not involve staking, a process that rewards participants for pledging tokens to support the Ethereum blockchain. This exclusion could dampen interest in the funds.



Further approvals from the SEC are required before firms like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments can launch these products, and the timeline for these approvals remains unclear. 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The approval process is not yet complete, as the ETF issuers still need the SEC to approve their registration statements detailing investor disclosures. While there is no set timeline for this, industry participants believe that many issuers are ready to launch once they receive the green light. However, the SEC’s corporate finance division is expected to request changes and updates in the coming days and weeks.







As of 10:10 a.m. UTC on May 27, Bitcoin is trading at around $68,496, down 0.9% in the past 24 hours, while Ether is trading at roughly $3,902, up 2.6% in the past 24-hour period.



According to a report by Bloomberg News, Chris Weston, Head of Research at Pepperstone Group, noted in a statement that the risk for Ether remains on the upside, suggesting that pullbacks should be seen as buying opportunities. The report also mentions that data from the Deribit trading platform indicates that the highest concentrations of bullish options bets anticipate Ether reaching $5,000 or higher. Ether’s current all-time high is $4,878, achieved on 10 November 2021.



The Bloomberg report went on to say that the gap between the T3 Ether Volatility Index, which reflects expected 30-day price swings based on options prices, and a similar index for Bitcoin is at its widest since at least the beginning of 2023. This suggests that speculators anticipate more significant price fluctuations for Ether than for Bitcoin.

If you bought Bitcoin with your $1,200 stimulus check in 2020 you'd now have this much


    Four years ago, American citizens received stimulus checks from the government in the amount of $1,200 to help them recover from the financial losses incurred during the Covid pandemic, and investing this money was among the popular choices of the checks’ recipients.



Indeed, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had issued the stimulus checks, or Economic Impact Payments, under the Coronavirus Aid, relief and Economies Act (CARES Act), and the first round amounted to $1,200 (and $500 more per each child).



Investing in Bitcoin



For those who chose to invest their $1,200 stimulus in Bitcoin (BTC) at the time, this would have been an exceptionally lucrative decision, considering that the price of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset had risen by nearly 1,218% since March 2020 when it stood at $5,201.07.

In other words, investing $1,200 in Bitcoin when its price was around $5,201 would mean that today, the investor in question would be holding close to $15,816 worth of the maiden cryptocurrency, providing them with significant profit if they chose to sell it at a current price.

At the moment, Bitcoin is changing hands at the price of $68,540, which suggests a slight decline of 0.88% in the last 24 hours but still an increase of 2.52% across the previous seven days and an 8.92% advance over the past month, adding up to the 62.35% gain this year, as per data on May 27.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales seem to be back in the crypto sea, as they have recently started to show significant buying activity, reflecting the largest holders’ confidence in the crypto asset’s future price and signaling a resurgence of bullish sentiment in the sector, as Finbold reported on May 25.

All things considered, investing in Bitcoin when the government signed the stimulus checks into law back in March 2020 would have been exceptionally profitable, and certain indicators point to further price advances for the largest asset in the crypto market in the years to come.

Toncoin price: What next for TON as TVL surpasses $300 million? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Toncoin price bounces as total value locked (TVL) on the TON Blockchain surpasses $300 million.
DeFiLlama data showed TON Blockchain’s TVL at $315 million, up from $156 million on May 1.
Telegram related news and Pantera Capital’s investment have been notable catalysts for Toncoin (TON).

Toncoin (TON), the native cryptocurrency token of The Open Network (TON) Blockchain, currently trades around $6.40. 
After flipping negative amid profit-taking in recent days, the price of Toncoin looks poised for a major bounce.
TON Blockchain TVL surpasses $300 million
According to data from DeFiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) on the TON Blockchain has increased sharply this month. Indeed, the TON’s ecosystem has seen the TVL jump from $156 million on May 1 to currently stand at $315 million.

The milestone comes as TON shows growing traction in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Top projects are across decentralized exchanges (DEXes), lending, liquid staking and gaming.
In the past month, for instance, DEX protocols Ston.fi and Dedust recorded a TVL surge of 132% and 30% respectively. Liquid staking protocols Tonstakers and bemo also recorded notable increases of 20% and 17% respectively.
Toncoin price outlook
Toncoin price reached highs of $7.63 in April, riding positive news and network developments.
Telegram’s launch of an ad revenue share program with payouts in Toncoin and a TON Blockchain promotion The Open League provided some of the upside momentum. 
There was also a massive surge for TON token when venture capital firm Pantera Capital revealed a new investment in TON.
The recent market debut of Notcoin (NOT) also provided buyside pressure for Toncoin.
However, TON price dipped amid a retreat for the broader market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum’s declines to support levels last week adding to the downside pressure. 
BTC and ETH are back above $68,000 and $3,800 respectively, helping top altcoins higher as meme coins Pepe and FLOKI outperform peers.
TON price looks poised for a bounce as it flips green on the daily chart.

If bulls strengthen above the immediate support zone, a breakout to $7 could bring a new all-time high into view. 
On the other hand, a downturn would risk a retreat to lows of $5.64 and potentially $4.86.

Spot Ether ETF Approval And Its Impact On Crypto Market


                                Michael Saylor In Support Of Spot Ether ETF Approval                                MicroStrategy's founder, Michael Saylor has once again attracted attention by speaking in favor of the spot Ether ETF. Recently, eight firms received approval for their spot Ether ETF from the SEC prompting Saylor to comment that this approval could be very beneficial for Bitcoin. In his statement, the MicroStrategy founder said, "I think this is better for BTC. It will provide an additional layer of security for Bitcoin. Moreover, institutional adoption of cryptocurrency will now increase rapidly. Investors will recognize crypto as a legitimate asset class, which will directly benefit Bitcoin as BTC is still the most popular cryptocurrency in the crypto market today."It is noteworthy that Saylor has changed his opinion on the spot Ether ETF. Previously, he believed that the chances of the spot Ether ETF getting approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were very low.Before 23rd May the entire cryptocurrency market believed that getting approval for the spot Ether ETF would be very difficult and Bitcoin would remain the only cryptocurrency with an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The main reason behind this was the SEC's continuous delay in approving the spot Ether ETF.Approval of 8 Spot Ether ETF Applications by the SECOn 23rd May after a long wait, the SEC approved 8 spot Ether ETF applications. In the filing, the SEC approved the 19b-4 filings from VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise. It should be noted that on 10th January the SEC had already approved the spot Bitcoin ETF, which had generated significant enthusiasm among cryptocurrency investors. Investors saw this as a shift in the SEC's stance towards the crypto market. Therefore, the approval of the spot Ether ETF is seen as a major update in the direction of crypto regulation.It is notable that the approval of the spot Ether ETF is having a visible impact on the entire cryptocurrency market with Ethereum ($ETH) reaching $3,950 and Bitcoin ($BTC) trading between $68,000 and $69,000. Experts believe that in the future, similar bullish trends could be seen in the crypto market due to the spot Ether ETF and both ETH and BTC could achieve new all-time highs.

Arbitrum Community Backs 200M ARB Plan To Attract Web3 Game Builders - The Defiant

The proposal seeks 200 million ARB as incentives to foster the development of web3 gaming titles and infrastructure.The Arbitrum community is rallying behind a governance proposal advocating for allocating a large sum of ARB to foster the development of web3 games on the Ethereum Layer 2.Community members have mobilized 35 million ARB to vote in favor of the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) proposal, which would earmark 200 million ARB ($250 million) as incentives for game developers over the next three years.Just 101,400 Arbitrum have been mobilized in opposition to the proposal, however, at least 105.57 million ARB must be cast as votes for the proposal to reach quorum. Voting began on May 24 and is scheduled to end on June 7.“The Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) is designed to immediately expand awareness and adoption of Arbitrum/Orbit/Stylus by builders and players in the Gaming community,” the proposal said. “By offering support, incentives, and game industry-specific tools, Arbitrum can position itself as an attractive platform for game development, leading to a surge in high-quality gaming experiences on the network.”The proposal previously passed a preliminary temperature check vote with nearly 97% support in March.Arbitrum is the largest Ethereum Layer 2 by total value locked (TVL) with roughly $19.3 billion, according to L2beat. Arbitrum is also the fifth-ranked network by DeFi with $4.79 billion, according to DeFi Llama.Gaming Catalyst ProgramThe proposal notes that Arbitrum’s DeFi sector previously enjoyed a “snowball”-like proliferation, asserting that the GCP could ignite similar growth for its web3 gaming ecosystem.However, the proposal also acknowledges that Arbitrum is lagging behind several of its competitors who have actively courted the GameFi industry based on metrics including total games migrated, games launched, and total gamers.“Arbitrum has had immense success in the decentralized finance vertical, but the branding of Arbitrum as a home for gamers and game builders is nascent,” the proposal said. “We believe that the same opportunity exists to attract the best builders that will in turn create sticky high-quality games that bring and retain new users within Arbitrum… Several L1s and L2s see this opportunity (most notably Solana, Cardano, Opstack, Immutable, Optimism, to name a few) and are moving to claim the builders with grants and investments.”The GCP would allocate 160 million ARB to “onboarding and growth,” with the funds used to attract and provide ongoing support to publishers, studios, and independent developers building web3 gaming titles. This includes establishing the “Build Grants” program, with 25 million ARB set aside as grants for early-stage projects capped at 500,000 ARB each.The remaining 40 million ARB would go towards infrastructure and tooling development.The proposal also requests an additional $25 million to cover legal and compliance costs, marketing and infrastructure, and salaries for team members.The incentives program would be overseen by the GCP council, a group of “trusted professionals with backgrounds ranging across gaming, venture, grant allocation, web3 technology, and DAO relations.” Council members would be elected by the DAO, and cannot represent GCP applicants or competing networks.GameFi projects currently boast a combined capitalization of $22.7 billion, up 144% from $9.31 billion at the end of October, according to CoinGecko.

Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Network Sees 50% Surge: What’s Next?


The Shibarium network, integral to the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem, has witnessed a remarkable surge in on-chain activity. 
According to data from Shibariumscan, new transactions on Shibarium increased by nearly 50%, escalating from 5,150 on Friday to 7,691 by Sunday. This spike highlights a growing interest within the network.
Shiba Inu Poised for 32% Gains?

Moreover, the total number of Shibarium accounts has significantly risen. Starting from 105,367 on May 1, it reached 113,732 by May 27, indicating robust expansion and growing trust in the platform.
Shibarium functions as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, enhancing scalability and transaction efficiency on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to reduce transaction times and costs markedly, aligning with Shiba Inu’s goal to evolve from its meme origin into a widely utilized cryptocurrency.

Recently, the ecosystem advanced further with the integration of ShibaSwap, its native decentralized exchange (DEX), into Shibarium on May 16. This strategic move is part of the broader effort to increase the utility and appeal of Shibarium. 
Kaal Dhairya, a developer for Shiba Inu, highlighted the team’s commitment to continuous improvement. 

“This version is focused on discovery, so all the creative geniuses meme away! We will keep pushing out updates and upgrades on regular basis going forward, also for everyone to remember it’s not a race it’s a marathon,” Dhairya said.

Furthermore, Shiba Inu exhibits a volatility contraction pattern (VCP). This technical pattern, characterized by progressively narrower price fluctuations, is often seen by traders as an indicator of a potential breakout.

If SHIB successfully breaches the neckline at $0.00002631, it could potentially experience a surge of approximately 32% from its current market price towards the resistance at $0.00003282.

However, should it fail to achieve this breakout, the price may fall back to the support level at $0.00002345. A break below this level could bring the next significant support into play at $0.00002052.

Argentina and El Salvador Discuss Bitcoin Adoption


The National Securities Commission of Argentina (CNV) confirmed the country is considering cooperating with El Salvador on Bitcoin adoption. This follows an important meeting between Argentinian and Salvadoran regulators last week. 
Officials from Argentina’s CNV met with Juan Carlos Reyes, head of El Salvador’s National Digital Assets Commission (CNAD), to discuss El Salvador’s Bitcoin regulation strategies.
Learning from El Salvador’s Experience

High-ranking CNV officials, including President Roberto Silva and Vice President Patricia Boedo, visited El Salvador. The President highlighted Argentina’s proactive stance in learning and praised El Salvador’s progress in forming cooperation agreements.

“El Salvador has emerged as a leading country in the use of Bitcoin and the broader world of crypto assets. We want to strengthen ties with El Salvador. We will explore signing collaboration agreements with their government,” Silva stated. 

The CNV’s efforts could relieve Argentina’s Bitcoin community. Despite President Javier Milei’s pro-Bitcoin stance, Buenos Aires faces pressure from the IMF to regulate crypto exchanges.
The country faces severe economic challenges, including high inflation and currency depreciation, have spurred Bitcoin trading. Crypto adoption has increased since 2017, with many using it for everyday transactions. The country has also seen a rise in crypto startups, offering innovative solutions to economic challenges.

Strict currency controls have led to a surge in stablecoin use. These digital assets provide a hedge against currency restrictions. A report by Bitso indicated that 60% of crypto trading volume in Argentina comes from stablecoins like USDT or USDC.
El Salvador, under President Nayib Bukele, became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Bukele’s initiative has significantly boosted the country’s economy. BTC adoption has attracted global tourists to El Salvador’s popular destinations. Additionally, the country buys the asset daily and mines it using energy from volcano-powered operations.
The potential cooperation between Argentina and El Salvador could signal a shift in Argentina’s approach to crypto. With significant crypto adoption among its population, this move might pave the way for a more regulated and secure environment.

Ethereum brushes against $4k! Will the market optimism continue? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum momentarily hit $4,000, backed by ETF enthusiasm.
Technical indicators suggest a retest of $4,000, breaking it sustainably soon.

Ethereum [ETH] has managed to sustain its ETF-infused rally. An hour ago, it even temporarily hit the $4,000 level before bouncing back to $3,947 at press time. 
ETH bulls are clearly leading the pack here, but when can we expect the token to stay comfortably above $4K?
Ethereum’s key levels
This ETH/USDT pair showed a significant upward movement at press time, breaching the $4,000 mark temporarily before settling into a phase of consolidation. 
The sharp rise preceding the consolidation showed strong buying pressure, fueled by the bulls.
Source: TradingView
Observing the moving averages (MA50 and MA200), there’s a bullish crossover with the MA50 trending above the MA200, which is typically a favorable sign.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around 63, indicating strong momentum without being overbought, which supports potential further upward movements. 
However, the recent consolidation near the $3,940 mark shows resistance that could cap gains temporarily as Ether cools down.
If Ethereum can maintain support above the MA200 line and leverage the current bullish sentiment, it will attempt another break above $4,000 sustainably later today.
Source: Coinglass
The Ethereum derivatives market is also showing some intense bullish activity, with a notable increase in both trading volume and Open Interest. 
This suggested heightened trader engagement in anticipation of a sustained bull run. 
Analyzing the long/short ratios, particularly the figures from top traders on Binance [BNB] and OKX, where long positions outweigh short positions by far, suggests that the market’s leading participants are bullish on Ethereum. 
This would strengthen ETH’s chances of sustaining a price above $4,000 and potentially reaching new heights as market conditions align with investor confidence and external market stimuli.
The Ethereum Fear and Greed Index, currently at 66% indicating “Greed,” further reflects the bullish sentiment in the market.

The bulls are supported by overwhelmingly positive scores across multiple indicators such as social, volume, and volatility.
All in all, the metrics tell us Ethereum bulls are merely waiting for the market to cool down. A surge above $4,000 would likely come today. Or, at the latest, tomorrow.

Crypto's Double-Edged Sword: NORMIE Token Exploited, MAGA Investor Profits Big


							

NORMIE exploit caused a trader’s $1.16M investment to plummet to less than $150, highlighting high crypto risks.



Another trader gained $2.7M from MAGA tokens, achieving a remarkable 505% ROI by selling 1.5 billion tokens in three days.



NORMIE’s development team negotiated with the hacker to return 90% of stolen funds, planning a new token to reimburse holders.




Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics firm, recently reported two contrasting developments involving different cryptocurrencies, highlighting the volatility and risks inherent in the digital asset market. A NORMIE exploit has resulted in substantial losses for one trader, whereas another trader secured impressive gains from trading MAGA.



A trader who invested $1.16 million to purchase 11.23 million NORMIE tokens, buying at $0.1035 each between March 25 and April 9, saw its value plummet to a meager $150 following an exploit. NORMIE’s price fell sharply to $0.000003, marking a 98.69% drop in just 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.82 million. The exploit led to a precipitous decline, highlighting the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments.







Conversely, Lookonchain identified a lucrative trade involving MAGA tokens. On May 24 and 25, a trader invested $537,500 to acquire 6 billion $MAGA tokens. In just three days, the trader sold 1.5 billion MAGA tokens for $744,000 USDT, realizing a remarkable ROI of 505%. The trader still holds 4.5 billion $MAGA tokens, now valued at $2.51 million. MAGA’s price surged by 100.55% in the last 24 hours.







The situation surrounding NORMIE took another turn when the development team revealed negotiations with the hacker responsible for the exploit. The hacker offered to return 90% of the stolen funds, resulting in a $41.7 million plunge in the token’s market cap within three hours. Lookonchain was one of the first to detect the exploit and the hacker’s on-chain message to NORMIE’s deployer address on May 26.









NORMIE’s team accepted the hacker’s offer to retrieve 90% of the stolen tokens. The condition was that the recovered funds and $2.3 million from the team’s development wallet would be used to launch a new token to reimburse NORMIE holders. This approach aims to mitigate the impact on investors and restore some of the lost value, although the token has already seen a 96% decline since the exploit.

Crypto expert predicts total market cap going to $15 trillion


    Although many assets in the cryptocurrency industry are consolidating their previous gains, and the total crypto market capitalization is doing the same following a deep correction, a popular crypto expert has projected that the total crypto market cap might hit a staggering $15 trillion.



Specifically, professional crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe has recently observed that the total crypto market capitalization was consolidating after a 25% correction and that this included a “50-70% on altcoins,” according to his detailed analysis published in an X post on May 25.



With this in mind, van de Poppe has predicted that the market could expect “some more consolidation before a clean break of the all-time high,” voicing his vision of the “total market cap going to $15T,” which would suggest a rally of 484% from the crypto sector’s current market cap.

As the analyst observed more recently, the crypto arena is currently waiting for the S-1 documents for the approved spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that would finalize the approvals and possibly precede the “continuation on the markets in a strong manner.”







Crypto market cap analysis



Meanwhile, the total market cap of all digital assets at press time stood at $2.57 trillion, suggesting a 0.07% increase in the last 24 hours, an advance of 5.76% across the previous seven days, and an 11.26% gain on its monthly chart, adding up to the growth of 54.82% since the year’s turn, as per data on May 27.

Among the digital assets that could help the entire crypto arena reach the predicted total market cap might be Aptos (APT), which has recently set a record in daily transactions, and Render (RNDR), feeding off the success of the artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), as Finbold reported on May 26.

Depositors are racing to qualify for the Manta CeDeFi points program before the project tags $500 million in TVL.Manta’s new CeDeFi product is off to a bullish start, with the project attracting more than $120 million in assets within its first week.Data from DeFiLlama shows Manta CeDeFi boasting $121.5 million in total value locked (TVL) following its debut on May 19. The impressive growth is likely spurred by Manta offering a two-month points program qualifying early adopters who deposit assets before the product surpasses a $500 million TVL for monthly MANTA airdrops.“Manta CeDeFi unlocks opportunities directly to on-chain users beyond simply DeFi solutions,” Manta said in a blog post. “This CeFi + DeFi (CeDeFi) combination brings users with institutional-grade compliance and extensive financial agility.”However, Manta CeDeFi’s user base appears heavily concentrated so far, with Colin Wu, a blockchain reporter, flagging that two whale wallets are responsible for nearly $100 million worth of CeDeFi's deposits.Manta is the ninth-largest Ethereum Layer 2 network with a TVL of $768 million, according to L2beat.Manta CeDeFiManta announced the launch of CeDeFi on May 19, describing the product as generating both CeFi and DeFi yields in parallel. Yields are earned through a combination of DeFi yields on the Manta Pacific chain alongside stablecoin funding rate arbitrage on centralized exchanges.Custody services are provided by Ceffu, formerly Binance Custody. Binance Custody launched in December 2021 and rebranded to Ceffu in February 2023. Assets deposited to Manta CeDeFi are held by Ceffu, with users receiving on-chain “liquid custody tokens” representing their holdings on Manta Pacific that can be used for on-chain DeFi.Funds are also “mirrored” to represent assets on the Binance centralized exchange via Ceffu’s MirrorX service, facilitating the execution of CeFi strategies.“Ceffu generates revenue through Delta-neutral, low-risk trading strategies enabled by MirrorX,” Manta said. “This off-exchange settlement solution reflects assets on Binance, minimizing counterparty risk and accessing deep liquidity.”Manta CeDeFi currently supports deposits in the form of ETH, StakeStone’s Ether liquid staking token, STONE, Bitcoin tokens wBTC and BTCB, and the stablecoins USDT, USDC, and wUSDM.The price of MANTA last changed hands for $1.76 after rallying 25% from its all-time low of $1.40 one week ago, according to CoinGecko.

Whale Spends $24,700,000 on Ethereum Altcoins After SEC Approves Listing of Spot ETH ETF: On-Chain Data - The Daily Hodl


								A crypto whale was spotted over the weekend scooping up massive amounts of altcoins from the Ethereum ecosystem following the listing approval spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
First reported by blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, a whale with a series of wallets bought Ethereum just above the $3,000 mark just before news of a likely ETH ETF approval surfaced.










Shortly after the ETFs got a green light from the SEC, the whale began to accumulate Ethereum-based altcoins, such as Lido (LDO), Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and Fraxshare (FXS).
“Before the ETH ETFs news, a whale spent 26.67 million USDT to buy 8,733 ETH at $3,054.56 and has an unrealized profit of ~$6 million.
After the SEC approved form 19b-4 for ETH ETFs, the whale bought $24.7 million worth of Ethereum ecosystem tokens and has an unrealized profit of ~$1.1 million.
He deposited 19.75 million USDT to Binance and withdrew 4.04 million LDO ($9.3 million), 684,364 UNI ($6.7 million), 52,623 AAVE ($5.4 million), 82,041 ENS ($2 million) and 250,969 FXS ($1.25 million) from Binance.”
Source: Lookonchain/X
Lookonchain also spotted a whale on the Solana (SOL) network rotating their core holdings further out the risk curve, opting for Dogecoin (DOGE) rival dogwifhat (WIF).
“A whale spent 17,966 SOL ($2.98 million) to buy 953,177 WIF at $3.13 in the past 5 hours, causing the price of WIF to increase by ~7%.
This whale previously spent 1 million USDC to buy 355,417 WIF at $2.81 on May 21st and then sold it at $3.07 for 1.09 million USDC on May 22, making $90,000.”
At time of writing, WIF is trading at $2.99.

Political Meme Coins Surge After Trump Libertarian Convention Speech - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsFormer U.S. president Donald Trump's appearance at the Libertarian National Convention may have resulted in him being heckled and jeered, but it's given political meme coins a shot in the arm.The Trump-themed MAGA Hat (MAGA) cryptocurrency has surged by over 150% in the past 24 hours, while the MAGA (TRUMP) meme coin is up by a more modest 12.7% overnight.Intriguingly, the ConstitutionDAO (PEOPLE) token is also up by 4.7%. Originally created as a governance token for a now-defunct DAO aiming to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution at auction, it's now effectively become a politics-themed meme coin, having no utility after the project had "run its course."Following Trump's appearance at the Libertarian National Convention, which saw the crowd repeatedly booing throughout his speech, the prospective Republican candidate took to his social media platform Truth Social to talk up the "enthusiasm" of the crowd.During his speech, Trump pledged to commute the sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht if elected. Silk Road was a peer-to-peer darknet marketplace that used Bitcoin to facilitate the sale of drugs and other illicit materials; Ulbricht was sentenced to two life sentences without parole in 2015 on money laundering, fraud and drugs charges.It's not the first time Trump has mulled over Ulbricht's situation; following his 2020 election defeat, he reportedly considered granting clemency to the Silk Road founder as part of a round of pardons ahead of the January 2021 inauguration of Joe Biden. In the event, he did not do so.Trump attempted to position himself as a pro-crypto candidate during the speech, vowing to end Joe Biden's "crusade to crush crypto" and prevent the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC).Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

3 Key Things to Expect From Shiba Inu (SHIB) This Week

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.



Shiba Inu (SHIB) is starting this new week with a rather clean slate, with a major reset in some of the token’s key growth metrics. The price of Shiba Inu is up 0.98% in the past 24 hours to $0.00002487, per data from CoinMarketCap. This mild rebound is coming after a disturbing drawdown over the weekend.The primary goal for Shiba Inu investors remains to breach the $0.00003 price mark, with the first key catalyst to help achieve this being the burn rate.   Over the past few months, the burn rate has served as a major interest indicator in the community. At the time of writing, data from Shibburn pegs the current burn rate at 164.94% to 7,128,803 SHIB. Though the amount of SHIB burned daily is small, it does not negate the impact, which is that users believe in the project and are doing everything they can to shrink its supply.Second, the retail sentiment on the market needs to be properly checked this week. If the token must meet the expected price mark, its volume needs to stay elevated all week long. At the moment, the daily trading volume is down by 4.12% to $363,490,960. How this adjusts over the coming days might prove pivotal to driving its growth.Finally, SHIB whale activities are also pivotal in driving a multiweek growth record. Shiba Inu whales are currently in hibernation mode, as data from IntoTheBlock shows a 36.96% slump in this metric overnight. With this rate, only about $29.93 million were traded in 24 hours, a figure that pales in comparison to coins like Dogecoin, with $1.16 billion in whale traded volume.The influence of Shibarium and other initiatives and partnerships within the Shiba Inu ecosystem might also help revert prices to its previously bullish path.

Ethereum Price Surges: Poised for New All-Time High


                                Ethereum Surge due to approval of Spot Ethereum ETF                                With the approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF, the market has experienced a surge, leading to a bullish trend not only in Bitcoin and Ethereum but also in altcoins. This surge is anticipated to pave the way for the commencement of live trading of Ethereum ETF after approval. Consequently, Ethereum bulls are becoming active once again. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) has seen a 5% increase in price, currently trading at $3,909 with a market cap of $469 billion. Additionally, the daily trading volume of Ethereum has surged by approximately 68%, reaching nearly $17 billion. Market experts foresee that with this momentum, Ethereum will easily surpass the $4,000 level soon, possibly reaching a new all-time high in the coming months.Ethereum may soon make its All-Time HighCryptocurrency investors are expecting significant institutional demand for Ethereum (ETH) in the coming weeks. In anticipation of this influx, large Ethereum investors have been buying in large quantities since the announcement of the Spot Ethereum ETF approval. Additionally, Ethereum whales have become active, with the top 1,000 Ethereum wallets now holding 76.52 million ETH as of May 26, indicating an acquisition of over 510,000 ETH in just five days, driving up the price of ETH.Furthermore, after the approval of the spot BTC ETF, Bitcoin prices surged by over 70% in two months, reaching new all-time highs. If Ether follows Bitcoin's lead, a similar move could propel prices to nearly $6,000 by the end of July. The impact of Ether's prices will also affect the cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, market experts believe that Ethereum (ETH) could reach up to $4,500 before the start of spot ETH ETF trading. Moreover, it could potentially rise to $8,000 or higher by the end of the year.Ethereum ETF Approval Sparks Crypto Market OptimismThe approval of an Ethereum ETF could have a positive impact on the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, potentially initiating a bullish trend in the market. This could result in Ethereum reaching a new all-time high, while Bitcoin's price may also surpass $70,000 once again. Moreover, there could be an increase in the prices of alternative cryptocurrencies. Recently, with the rise in Ethereum's price, its meme coin, Pepe, has also experienced a significant surge, reaching $0.00001677 with a 12% increase in the last 24 hours. Additionally, MicroStrategy's founder, Michael Saylor, has recently voiced support for a spot Ether ETF, which could contribute to its price appreciation.Also Read:- “Spot Ether ETF Approval Will Favor BTC”, Michael Saylor

Crypto Underdog ENA Soars, Catching the Eye of BitMEX Co-Founder


							

BitMEX Co-founder Arthur Hayes notes the surge of Ethereum-based ENA despite criticism.



ENA Market cap reaches $1.39 billion, now ranked 68th on CoinMarketCap.



ENA price surges after pullback, gains 48.65% in 10 days.




BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has taken note of Ethena’s (ENA) recent performance, observing that the Ethereum-based synthetic dollar protocol is climbing up the ranks despite widespread criticism. Hayes cited a post by Guy Young, Athena Labs’ founder, who noted that the project has added nearly $450 million in USDe supply in the last 16 days







Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap’s data shows that ENA has climbed to the 68th position among all 10,043 active cryptocurrencies listed on the leading aggregation platform. The data showed that ENA’s market cap rose by 0.25% in the last 24 hours, reaching an impressive $1.39 billion.



Additional details from CoinMarketCap show that ENA’s volume increased by over 10% in the past 24 hours and was over $314.5 million as of the time of writing. That value placed ENA in 29th position by volume, with a circulating supply of 1.52 billion ENA.









For distribution among ENA holders, the available data on CoinMarketCap reveals that 79.84% of addresses hold between $0 and $1,000 worth of ENA. That represents the largest category of ENA holders by a significant margin. A 19.65% of addresses hold between $1,000 and $100,000 worth of ENA, while only 0.51 percent of addresses have above $100,000 ENA equivalent.



Observing ENA’s price action on TradingView indicates that the synthetic dollar protocol bounced off support on May 16 after nearly five weeks of extended pullback. The altcoin turned around at $0.6538 and has surged 48.65% in the past ten days.



ENA’s latest rally triggered a break above significant resistance around the $0.75 region before targeting the next significant level at $0.95. The price has tested this level before making a slight pullback to trade for $0.9246 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView.

This Week In Crypto: Top 4 Coins And Events You Can't Miss


								In this week’s edition of “This Week In Crypto” we delve into pivotal developments and key data releases that are set to shape the crypto landscape in the last week of May. From crucial inflation data influencing Bitcoin’s trajectory to significant governance votes and strategic collaborations in the blockchain sector, each event carries the potential to significantly impact market dynamics.
#1 The Bitcoin And Crypto Markets Await US PCE Data
The Bitcoin and crypto market is on high alert as the US Bureau of Economic Analysis prepares to release the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index data for April on May 31. This indicator, vital for assessing inflation, influences the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions directly affecting market dynamics.
Analysts from Talkingmacro highlight that while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) provide earlier signals, “PCE data, though lagging, remains a critical indicator for gauging sustainable economic trends.”
This week, expectations are set for the PCE inflation to moderate to +0.2% month-on-month from the previous +0.3%, aligning the year-on-year rate to +2.6%, slightly down from +2.7%. This data point is crucial as it skirts just above the Fed’s 2% target, suggesting that inflation may be cooling. “While a significant deviation could spur volatility, the markets have largely priced in the current trajectory towards the Federal Reserve’s target,” analysts from Talkingmacro noted.

Bitcoin’s sensitivity to Federal policies means that any unexpected shift in inflation expectations could sway crypto prices significantly. “Crypto has been highly sensitive to the pricing of Fed policy or ‘forward guidance,’ so it pays to pay attention to this data and macroeconomic trends,” the analyst from Talkingmacro wrote. With Bitcoin currently fluctuating below $69,000, the market can anticipate some volatility.
#2 Uniswap (UNI) – Vote To Enable Fee-Sharing Mechanism
The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is set to witness a pivotal development as Uniswap Foundation gears up for a governance vote on May 31 to implement a fee-sharing mechanism for UNI token holders. This proposal aims to modify the protocol’s governance to allow the collection and pro-rata distribution of protocol fees to stakers and voters.

Erin Koen, governance lead at the Uniswap Foundation, explained, “Maintaining this lead [in the market] is only going to get more difficult. […] To survive & thrive in a credibly neutral way, Uniswap Governance needs to use its reputational, financial & technical capital for good.”
When announced in February, UNI experienced a sharp 40% price increase, indicating strong market approval. The approval of this proposal could mark a significant shift towards more sustainable economic incentives within the Uniswap ecosystem, potentially setting a precedent for other DeFi platforms.
#3 SEI – Sei V2 Goes Live
Today marks the launch of Sei V2, an ambitious upgrade that converts the Sei blockchain into a high-performance, parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This upgrade, governed by SEI token holders, involves multiple phases: initial governance approval, alpha launch for stability, and final implementation once all systems are deemed stable and efficient.
The introduction of Sei V2 aims to “address scalability and performance bottlenecks faced by conventional blockchains, paving the way for more robust consumer-grade applications,” according to Sei Labs engineers. The upgrade process, planned to minimize risks and optimize performance, is expected to significantly enhance the blockchain’s throughput and reduce transaction latency.


#4 LINK – Chainlink & SWIFT Discuss Tokenization
Chainlink’s collaboration with SWIFT, the global provider of secure financial messaging services, is set to take center stage at the Consensys 2024 conference in Austin, Texas. Speculation is rife that this partnership could lead to another major announcement.
On Thursday, May 30, a session titled “How Swift and Chainlink Are Working Together to Unlock Tokenized Assets At Scale” will take place on the Mainstage, featuring Jonathan Ehrenfeld, Head of Securities and Digital Assets Strategy at SWIFT, and Sergey Nazarov, do-founder of Chainlink. It will explore how integrating SWIFT’s extensive financial network with blockchain technology via Chainlink can facilitate a scalable, secure on-chain financial system for tokenized assets.
The previous collaboration experiments conducted in June 2023, which involved major banks like BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon, demonstrated SWIFT’s capability to facilitate cross-blockchain token transfers. It also underscored the potential for Chainlink to be a pivotal building block in the future of finance.
At press time, BTC traded at $68,602.

Biden BTC (BIDENBTC) to Rally 11,000%, As It Looks to Challenge Dogecoin and Shiba Inu



                    

Biden BTC (BIDENBTC) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Biden BTC (BIDENBTC), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Biden BTC presents a similar opportunity.



Biden BTC has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Biden BTC could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Biden BTC can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Biden BTC on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Biden BTC by entering its contract address – 9MAph1jbrbs98UTvZ3EC5VVFAeKduh9iY78jJKDwxioz – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BIDENBTC.

Chainlink's Cross-Chain Dominance Grows with 12 New Integrations


							

Chainlink expands reach with 12 new integrations across nine blockchains.



Integrations include Ethereum, Polygon, and zkSync.



Chainlink has announced several significant integrations since last month.




Chainlink, a leading decentralized oracle network, has achieved another milestone in its platform adoption. The network has recently secured 12 integrations across nine different platforms, underscoring its diverse use cases within the blockchain industry.







These integrations leverage six key Chainlink services, including Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), Mainnet Integration, and Price Feeds. Other offerings include Chainlink Low-Latency Data Streams, VRF (Verifiable Random Function), and Cross-Chain Limit Orders. These solutions facilitate secure and reliable data transfer and interoperability within and between blockchain networks.

The nine platforms utilizing these services include DistributedGallery, ENO Token, FlashLiquidity, Rain Coin, Mind Network, Phoenix, Seamless Protocol, XSTAR, and YieldFlow.



Notably, this integration will enable the platforms implementing Chainlink’s services to meet their specific requirements. Seamless Protocol, for instance, adopted Chainlink Price Feeds to calculate collateral ratios and maintain secure markets.



Similarly, Mind Network and FlashLiquidity utilized Chainlink CCIP to enhance security for cross-chain transactions. These integrations reflect Chainlink’s ongoing efforts to enhance the functionality and security of decentralized applications (dApps).









Meanwhile, Chainlink has announced several significant integrations over the past month, solidifying its role in decentralized application infrastructure. Stader Labs had announced its integration with Chainlink’s CCIP to secure token transactions and ETHx transfers between Ethereum and Arbitrum.



Additionally, Vertex DEX adopted Chainlink Data Streams to enable faster trading. Leveraging this integration, the platform aimed to improve reliability and security by ensuring accurate price data and fair market practices.



These partnerships highlight Chainlink’s ongoing commitment to enabling blockchain interoperability and supporting dApps in various ecosystems. They also cement its position as a key infrastructure provider in the decentralized arena.

Caitlyn Jenner Promotes Crypto Token, Denies Account Hack - The Defiant

JENNER generated $28.3 million in volume within 1.5 hours of launch.Caitlyn Jenner, a former athlete and media personality, has found herself at the center of a heated controversy after her X (formerly Twitter) account promoted a cryptocurrency via the token launchpad Pump.fun.On Sunday afternoon, Jenner’s X account posted a link to a Solana-based token called JENNER featuring the caption “make America great again and we love crypto,” alongside a photo of her with former U.S. President Donald Trump.This left the crypto community bewildered and questioning the legitimacy of the post.Despite the doubts, the token quickly gained traction, generating $28.3 million worth of volume in 90 minutes to reach a market cap of $8.5 million.Addressing the skepticism, Jenner's account denied any hacking in subsequent tweets. “Nothing has been hacked,” she said. A follow-up video reiterated that the token was “for real.”On the same day, Trump expressed his strong support for cryptocurrency on Truth Social, stating he is “very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry.”Ongoing doubtsMany X users suggested Jenner's social media had been compromised, speculating that the video might have been created using AI technology.“This is NOT Caitlyn Jenner, and this is AI,” tweeted X user, @Captl_G. “Look at the eyebrow movement. You are being baited into the most iconic rugpulls to hit SOL.”Another user, @cyborgnfts, echoed the concern, tweeting, “AI is getting scary.”The token’s launch followed the X account of the prominent crypto influencer, Gigantic Rebirth (GCR), getting hacked on May 26. GCR’s account was commandeered to promote the ORDI and LUNA2 tokens, only to achieve a measly 10% wick on ORDI.ControversyHowever, crypto influencer CryptoRoxo suggested that the JENNER token likely did come from Jenner’s circle, but speculated the token was concocted by a shady "middleman."“She was never hacked,” CryptoRoxo claimed. “Her team was socially engineered by a guy named Sahil. He acted as the 'middleman' to launch the token for Caitlyn since the team was unfamiliar with crypto.”The crypto influencer Roxo alleged that after facilitating the token launch and securing Jenner's promotion, Sahil immediately sold off all tokens Jenner’s entire stash of tokens, which Sahil held on her behalf.“Caitlyn's manager seems clueless. She mentioned on Spaces that Sahil is holding all the tokens for them,” he added. “ In reality, if you look on-chain, you can see he dumped all of it. The team was tricked and doesn't seem to know they've been swindled. Caitlyn's team still has the scam tweet up asking people to send tokens."Roxo also claimed Sahil was behind five "influencer rugs" over the past week, including tokens associated with rappers Soulja Boy and Rich The Kid, and models Ivana Doll and NormieKazumi.Meanwhile, on the prediction platform Polymarket, punters are betting with 94% certainty that Jenner’s X account was not compromised.Jenner’s Instagram account continues to share the link to the token, aligning with the tweets on her X account.Jenner did not immediately respond to The Defiant’s request to comment.

XRP Skyrockets 30% in Volume as $30 Billion Market Cap Nears


The trading volume of the popular cryptocurrency XRP, as reported by CoinMarketCap, has increased by 30% over the past day, reaching $794 million. This figure represents only the spot market. Meanwhile, according to CoinGlass, the volume of XRP derivatives trading, namely perpetual futures, has grown by 11.29% over the past 24 hours, reaching $608.21 million. Consequently, the total trading volume of XRP during the period under review can be estimated at $1.4 billion.The rise in XRP trading volumes coincides with the popular cryptocurrency approaching the important $30 billion mark in market capitalization. The figure currently stands at $29.32 billion, with XRP just 2.26% short of the token's price growth to the key mark. It is noteworthy that XRP has already reached this threshold on a single occasion. There were also precedents a week ago and earlier in the month. However, the popular cryptocurrency failed to gain a foothold above this mark.XRP's Market Cap by CoinMarketCapThe growth of trade volume is indicative of increased interest from market participants. However, the ratio of market capitalization to trading volume is 4.66% at the moment, which is within the normal range of activity. As XRP's market capitalization surpasses $30 billion, the token may potentially rank among the top 600 largest entities in the world. Will XRP, with renewed interest from market participants, finally succeed in establishing itself above the significant mark? The answer is imminent.

Bitcoin vs. Crypto: Why One-Size-Fits-All Regulation Could Harm Innovation


							

Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow warns regulations could misunderstand Bitcoin’s unique features.



Mow argues Bitcoin differs from other cryptocurrencies and needs specific regulations.



Clear regulations are crucial for Bitcoin’s responsible growth, says Mow.




Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow welcomes the growing political interest in cryptocurrencies, but warns against a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation. Mow fears that a lack of distinction between Bitcoin and other digital assets could lead to misguided policies that could hurt its potential.







The core of Mow’s concern lies in the unique characteristics of Bitcoin. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin boasts a decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant structure. He argues that lumping them all together as “crypto” creates confusion, which could lead to regulations that fail to address Bitcoin’s specific nature.



Mow advocates for regulations tailored to Bitcoin’s strengths. Treating it like other cryptocurrencies could stifle innovation and hinder the growth of this transformative technology, he argues. He alluded that Bitcoin is not just another cryptocurrency, but a new monetary system with the potential to change how we perceive finance.









While acknowledging positive developments such as increased institutional investment, Mow highlights the challenges ahead, particularly regarding regulatory clarity and consumer protection. Analysts echo this sentiment, stressing the need for a balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers.



As the regulatory landscape evolves, policymakers must take a thoughtful and informed approach to ensure the long-term success of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.



Some analysts argue that navigating these challenges will require striking a delicate balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers. With the regulatory landscape still in flux, policymakers have a crucial role to play in shaping the future of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency ecosystem at large.

Bitcoin Price Prediction as Biden’s Decision on SEC Crypto Rules Looms - Will BTC Rally?

As the deadline for President Biden’s decision on the SEC’s cryptocurrency regulations approaches, Bitcoin’s market response remains cautious. Currently trading at $68,400, the cryptocurrency has experienced a slight decline of 0.50%.

Biden’s Decision on SEC’s Crypto Rules Nears as Veto Deadline Approaches

President Joe Biden is approaching a crucial deadline to decide on a resolution that could overturn the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121).
The resolution, which has already been approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, is threatened with a veto by the White House.
President Biden has until June 3 to act on the Congressional decision, which challenges the SEC’s controversial crypto regulations intended to govern the handling of digital assets by brokers.


Potential Outcomes of Presidential Action

The Chamber of Digital Commerce outlines three potential actions President Biden could take: veto the resolution, sign it into law, or do nothing and let the resolution become law by default if Congress is in session.
A presidential veto would likely be the final step in the effort to overturn SAB 121, as Congress probably lacks the two-thirds majority required to override a veto.
If signed or left unsigned with Congress in session, the resolution would nullify SAB 121, preventing the SEC from implementing a similar rule in the future.
Implications for Bitcoin and Crypto Regulation

This decision is pivotal for the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, as it will influence how digital assets are regulated in the United States. The outcome could impact investor confidence and market stability, as clear regulatory frameworks are often seen as essential for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.
Additionally, the House has moved forward with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act, which aims to establish a more comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets.
The Biden administration has shown a willingness to collaborate with Congress on this issue, suggesting a possible softening of its stance towards crypto regulation.
Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin is currently trading at $68,400, marking a modest drop of 0.50%,  signalling a bearish Bitcoin price prediction. The digital currency sits just above its pivotal point at $68,500, which is critical in determining its short-term movement.  
Bitcoin’s immediate resistance levels are $69,600, followed by $70,650 and $71,950. These markers represent key hurdles that Bitcoin needs to overcome to sustain an upward trajectory. 
On the downside, immediate support lies at $67,265, with further cushions at $66,380 and $65,144. These levels are vital for holding Bitcoin’s price in case of a downturn.
Bitcoin Price Prediction
Technical indicators suggest a nuanced picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47, indicating a neutral market sentiment that leans neither towards overbought nor oversold conditions. 
Meanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $68,737, slightly above the current price, hinting at potential resistance.
Conclusion:

Bitcoin’s current stance is delicately balanced at $68,502, with pivotal support and resistance levels nearby.
Bearish potential below $68,500 with substantial support levels to watch; bullish above this mark could target higher resistance.
Neutral RSI and close 50 EMA suggest cautious trading, with potential for shifts in market direction based on upcoming price actions.

The technical landscape for Bitcoin shows a currency at a crossroads, with potential shifts heavily reliant on its ability to maintain or breach the $68,500 level.

JasmyCoin is pioneering decentralized data storage.
                        The price of decentralized data storage coin JasmyCoin ($JASMY) has pumped 13% in the last 24 hours and 32% in the last week on news that the US SEC has approved exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Ethereum ($ETH), the coin powering Jasmy’s native blockchain.Billed as “Japanese Bitcoin” Jasmy is an on-chain data storage solution that gives people greater control and autonomy over their personal data by enabling them to store it in something called a Personal Data Locker (PDL). If they choose to, they can share this data with companies willing to pay for it.This model aims to securitize data storage and minimize leaks while also facilitating its dissemination and use between consenting counterparties.Jasmy’s recent performance means it easily pips all other top data storage coins by market capitalization, many of which are posting heavy intraweek losses, like Arweave, which is down 17%.Ethereum is still surging on the ETF news. It’s up 26% from this time last Monday.Jasmy’s price chart shows a fairly stable coin that oscillated between a relatively narrow range of $0.016 and $0.025 over the last three months. Going into May, the token bottomed out at $0.015, but typically finds support a little north of that.Source: TradingViewIts current price is also a key resistance level, however a frantic bit of whale activity in the last 24 hours almost led to a breakout towards 3 cents. This big buy resulted in an overcooked relative strength index (RSI) value above 80.

Move Over Facebook: Phantom Wallet Now Tops Google Play Charts


								Move over Facebook and ChatGPT, there’s a new sheriff in town – at least when it comes to mobile app downloads. Phantom Wallet, a cryptocurrency wallet designed for the Solana blockchain, has experienced a meteoric rise in popularity, surpassing these giants in the Google Play Store’s US rankings.

From Solana-Centric To Multi-Crypto Powerhouse
Originally launched to cater to Solana (SOL) token holders, Phantom Wallet has strategically expanded its reach. It now supports major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Polygon (MATIC), transforming itself into a one-stop shop for crypto enthusiasts.


According to latest data, Phantom Wallet got an estimated 770,000 downloads in April, placing it ahead of social media behemoth Facebook and OpenAI’s language model ChatGPT.
Phantom is currently rated No. 11 in the free download category, behind Cash App and Snapchat.
This shift reflects the growing demand for interoperability within the crypto ecosystem, where users can seamlessly navigate between different blockchains.
Active User Boom: A Sign Of Crypto’s Maturation?
The surge in downloads isn’t just a numbers game. Phantom Wallet boasts over 7 million active users in April, a significant metric that some interpret as a sign of mainstream crypto adoption.


With DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications gaining traction, user-friendly wallets like Phantom become crucial gateways for those seeking to explore this new financial frontier.
Is This A Bullish Sign For Solana?
The crypto community is abuzz with speculation. The increasing popularity of Phantom Wallet has sparked optimism for Solana’s native token, SOL. Proponents see the surge in wallet usage as a potential indicator of a bullish trend for SOL, suggesting growing investor confidence in the Solana blockchain.
Bitcoin is now trading at $68,414. Chart: TradingView
Phantom Acquires Bitski
Phantom’s rising popularity coincides with its recent acquisition of Bitski, a web3 browser extension. This move underscores Phantom’s commitment to user experience. By integrating Bitski’s technology,

Phantom aims to streamline the onboarding process, eliminating the need for users to manage complex private keys and seed phrases. This could be a game-changer for attracting new users, particularly those intimidated by the technical aspects of crypto wallets.
The Future Of Embedded Wallets
The Bitski acquisition hints at Phantom’s vision for the future. By collaborating with Bitski, Phantom plans to develop embedded wallets within Solana-based decentralized applications (dapps).
This would allow users to interact with dapps directly without leaving the application, creating a smoother and more intuitive user experience.

Ethereum (ETH) Poised for Growth: Key Insights


Following Ethereum’s (ETH) recent ETF approval, the price has seen a steady incline. Is there more room for growth?
BeInCrypto looks at how institutional interest and key market trends are shaping a bright future for ETH.
Technical Outlook for Ethereum
Ethereum (ETH) currently trades at $3,902, demonstrating robust bullish momentum. The price is well above the Ichimoku cloud and the 100-day EMA (currently at $3,175), indicating sustained upward pressure.

Support levels are established at $3,575 and $3,400, while resistance levels are identified at $4,134 and $4,390. The formation of higher highs and higher lows confirms the bullish pattern.
Increased trading volumes during price surges reflect strong buying interest, reinforcing the bullish sentiment.
Analyzing Ethereum On-Chain Data
The percentage of Ethereum held on exchanges has decreased dramatically to below 11% by May 2024. This trend indicates a significant shift towards long-term storage and staking, reducing the immediate supply available for trading and selling pressure.
ETH Percent Balance on Exchanges. Source: Glassnode
Following the news of the SEC approving the spot ETFs for Ethereum, there was a noticeable increase in outflows. This regulatory approval has likely bolstered investor confidence, leading to significant ETH withdrawals from exchanges to private storage. 

The approval of spot ETFs generally implies an increased legitimacy and mainstream acceptance of the asset, encouraging investors to hold onto their Ethereum in anticipation of higher future prices.
As more ETH is moved off exchanges, the circulating supply on these platforms diminishes. With less ETH available for trading, the potential for supply shortages increases. A reduced supply on exchanges can lead to upward price pressure. When demand remains constant or increases while supply diminishes, prices are likely to rise. This scenario is conducive to a bullish market outlook for Ethereum.
The behavior of moving Ethereum off exchanges into private wallets is a strong indicator of long-term investor confidence. This action reflects a positive sentiment towards ETH’s future value, particularly reinforced by the SEC’s approval of spot ETFs. It contributes to a bullish outlook as the overall market perceives the reduced supply and increased holding as signals of potential price appreciation.

The number of addresses holding at least $1 Million in Ethereum has steadily increased. This trend indicates growing confidence among large holders and institutional investors, suggesting long-term stability and positive market sentiment.

The increasing number of addresses holding at least $1 Million in ETH strongly indicates that institutional investors are actively buying Ethereum. This trend is driven by the growing confidence among these large holders in Ethereum’s future prospects. The SEC’s approval of spot ETFs has likely played a significant role in this development, providing a regulated and attractive investment vehicle for institutions.
Institutional investors’ entry into the Ethereum market brings a level of credibility and stability. These entities are known for their rigorous investment strategies and long-term commitments. Their participation suggests a positive outlook for Ethereum, both in terms of price appreciation and its role in the broader financial ecosystem.
Finally, as more institutional investors accumulate ETH, the market will likely see reduced volatility and increased support for higher price levels. This growing institutional interest also fosters innovation and development within the Ethereum ecosystem, further solidifying its position as a leading blockchain platform.
Strategic Recommendations for ETH

Bullish Outlook: As more institutional investors accumulate ETH, the market will likely see reduced volatility and increased support for higher price levels. This growing institutional interest also fosters innovation and development within the Ethereum ecosystem. Further solidifying its position as a leading blockchain platform.
Long-Term Accumulation: Institutional accumulation indicates strong confidence in Ethereum’s future value, reducing market volatility and supporting price increases. Gradually accumulate ETH during market dips to benefit from long-term price appreciation.
Monitor Key Technical Levels: Understanding support and resistance levels helps optimize entry and exit points, enhancing trading strategies. Set buy orders near key support levels ($3,575 and $3,400) and consider profit-taking at resistance levels ($4,134 and $4,390) or HODL.

PEPE Market Cap on Verge of Flipping Polygon (MATIC)

Probably the most unexpected comeback in 2024 was PEPE's rise to the top, flipping numerous "serious" cryptocurrencies left and right. The most recent achievement of PEPE was flipping Polygon and gaining 18th place on the cryptocurrency market. However, it is unclear how the asset will move from here.PEPE has accumulated a market cap of $7.02 billion and is just slightly breathing on the back of Polygon at $7.12 billion. The surge was followed by the 12.96% surge in the price of PEPE, resting at $0.00001676. MATIC has moved backward 0.69%, with its price at $0.7184.PEPE/USDT Chart by TradingViewPEPE has managed to show a very good upward trajectory by breaking many of the resistances it had faced. Currently, PEPE is trading at $0.00001698, showing strong bullish momentum. As seen from the chart below, the 50-day moving average, currently around $0.00000885, and the 100-day moving average near $0.00000765, are still far below the current price, indicating that the bullish momentum is still sustained. The Relative Strength Index stands at 78.76, showing that PEPE is very deep into overbought territory; however, big buying interest keeps pushing the price higher.The question now is whether PEPE can maintain this current run and perhaps flip Polygon in market capitalization. Current high trading volumes are adding up to support of the bullish run, as well as to very positive market sentiment. Nevertheless, the RSI flashing overbought hints at some correction possibly coming in the short term. A quick watch of the key support levels for stability should be around $0.000015 and $0.000014.The rise of PEPE has been very impressive, but it remains an extremely risky investment. Meme coins are extremely volatile, risky and often provide exposure that not many are willing to gain. At any given moment, the value of assets like PEPE can change rapidly without giving you a chance to cover your portfolio from losses.

KuCoin Lists Gaming-Focused Project MON Protocol (MON) with $28,000 Giveaway - Coin Edition


							

KuCoin has listed MON Protocol (MON), a rapidly expanding crypto project focused on gaming



Trading the MON token will start on May 27, while withdrawals will open the next day.



KuCoin is celebrating MON listing with a $28K MON token giveaway in partnership with the project team.




KuCoin, a prominent global cryptocurrency exchange, has formally announced its support for MON Protocol (MON), an emerging digital currency initiative focused on gaming. The endorsement was made public via KuCoin’s official website and social media handle, confirming that MON has been listed as a tradable asset on its spot trading platform starting today.







Furthermore, KuCoin conveyed its pleasure in its report regarding the addition of the MON Protocol token to its spot trading platform, recognizing it as a remarkable project. As a result, KuCoin has enabled the deposit of MON Protocol tokens through the Ethereum network (ETH-ERC20), thereby introducing fresh trading prospects for its clientele.









Significantly, the trading of the MON token is set to begin on Monday, May 27. Following a 24-hour period, the exchange will activate withdrawal services for the MON token. It is worth mentioning that the trading pair available for the token will be Tether USD (USDT): MON/USDT.



Amid the listing of MON, KuCoin is celebrating the development by announcing a $28,000 MON token giveaway in partnership with the project team.



For those unfamiliar, Mon Protocol aspires to become a premier developer and publisher of widely adopted blockchain-native gaming intellectual properties (IPs). The protocol facilitates the expansion of blockchain-native gaming projects, allowing them to engage broader audiences of gamers and enthusiasts, thus driving greater adoption.



Initially, Mon Protocol introduced in-house creations, including Pixelmon Games: Pixelpals, Warriors of Nova Thera, and Hunting Grounds. Since its inception, it has cultivated a substantial community of over 1 million web3-aware gamers and supporters by the time of its Token Generation Event (TGE).



Prior to MON Protocol, KuCoin listed several other cryptocurrency projects targeting the gaming industry, such as BlockGames (BLOCK), MixMob (MXM), and Mavia (MAVIA).

Donald Trump now holds $10 million in crypto


    As of this morning, May 27, Donald Trump’s on-chain cryptocurrency holdings have surpassed the $10 million mark. 



This surge in his portfolio’s value is largely attributed to the remarkable performance of the $TRUMP coin, a digital asset that has seen a significant increase in its price. 



Trump’s holdings in $TRUMP alone are valued at $7.3 million, making up a substantial portion of his crypto assets, according to data published by ArkhamIntel on May 27.

The $TRUMP coin, which was created as a tribute to the former president, has experienced a notable rise in value recently. This spike can be attributed to several factors, including increased interest from Trump’s supporters and speculators hoping to capitalize on the coin’s unique association with the ex-president.

Crypto market sentiment



Additionally, the broader cryptocurrency market has been on an upward trajectory, contributing to the appreciation of various digital assets.



During his recent campaign speeches, Trump has not shied away from discussing cryptocurrencies. Historically, Trump has had a mixed stance on digital currencies. In 2019, he expressed skepticism about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, labeling them as “highly volatile” and based on “thin air.” 



However, his recent comments indicate a slight shift in perspective, possibly influenced by the growing popularity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance.



In a speech earlier this month, Trump acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology and digital assets to transform the financial landscape. He emphasized the importance of innovation and staying ahead in technological advancements. 



In a May 25 post on Truth Social, a social media platform owned by Trump Media and Technology Group, he stated: 




“Our country must be the leader in the field, there is no second place.” 





“We need to embrace the future of finance,” Trump stated, “Blockchain and cryptocurrencies offer new opportunities for growth and efficiency. We must explore and harness these innovations to ensure our country remains a global leader.”








Trump’s campaign began accepting cryptocurrency donations on May 21 via Coinbase Commerce. 



Despite this more positive outlook, Trump also highlighted the need for regulatory oversight to protect investors and ensure market stability. He stressed that while innovation should be encouraged, it must be balanced with responsible governance to prevent fraud and financial misconduct.

                        Monday, May 27, 2024 – The community for Sponge ($SPONGE), a popular meme coin that brought its early supporters returns of up to 10,000%, has voted to receive the project’s lucrative staking rewards instantly.This means all accrued staking rewards will be paid out to $SPONGE holders after the claim goes live on May 30, at 10AM UTC.Sponge polled its X followers between May 16 and May 21, asking the community to decide between accessing the large volume of staking rewards immediately, locking them for a month, or vesting the rewards linearly over either six months or a year. The logic for the community vote was explained in a follow-up post, and was mostly to do with price stability.However, a near-unanimous 85.5% voted for instant claim to immediately take advantage of the project’s lucrative dynamic rewards rate, which currently offers 326% APY for stakers on Polygon.$SPONGE recently migrated from Ethereum to Polygon. Three groups are eligible to claim tokens on May 30: those who bought tokens through the presale widget, those who bridged to Polygon before February 5th, and holders who didn’t bridge but who were captured in a snapshot taken on February 5th after the $SPONGE V1 token was discontinued.The last group can claim an equitable number of Polygon $SPONGE V2 tokens without any extra staking rewards.Those who held the V1 token on centralized exchanges before its discontinuation have had their tokens swapped for the V2 $SPONGE token on Polygon.Lucrative rewards are just one reason investors are moving to Sponge in a bid to catch some potentially explosive price action. In the coming months, $SPONGE will play a central role in crypto’s most exciting new staking/gaming/meme coin ecosystem.Sponge: A Meme Coin with a Plan
As global crypto adoption continues apace, investors are piling into Sponge before it gets listed on major exchanges.$SPONGE is a unique project that is organically building its own staking and video gaming community through word-of-mouth, lucrative incentives, and viral marketing. Three significant milestones lie ahead: the long-awaited claim of the new Polygon $SPONGE token on May 30, top-tier CEX listings, and the release of an upcoming Sponge video game.Meme coins have both soaked and squeezed value more than most projects throughout Bitcoin’s 2024 rebound. Their whimsical price movements often leave the industry wondering if it’s on the verge of another bull run.Any crypto meme project that wants to survive the dog-eat-dog pre-adoption market has to offer more than just laughs if it wants longevity.Investors believe $SPONGE is one such speculation. When it launched in May 2023, $SPONGE was priced at $0.000025. In less than a year, it has posted recent highs of $0.002763, or returns of around 10,000%.Clearly, early-stage supporters want $SPONGE to establish itself as a major player on the meme coin scene.$SPONGE’S Undersea Journey So Far
Launched with little-to-no fanfare, $SPONGE V1 quickly won the hearts of investors by offering an alluring ecosystem with lots of opportunities for participants to put their time and money to work to claim rewards.Foregoing a traditional prelaunch ICO in favor of direct listing, $SPONGE bounded out the starting gate with a discreet listing on Uniswap, before quickly spreading to centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Poloniex, MEXC, LBank, Gate.io, Toobit, and more.$SPONGE rallied a humbling 4,000% and nearly hit a $100 million market cap less than a week after launch, on May 9th 2023.The token recently upgraded (and migrated) to a V2 on Polygon, the widely utilized Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. It is currently priced at $0.002103 in a presale relaunch. This means those that held $SPONGE since the V1 launch, when it was priced at $0.000025, are now in profit by 8,414%.Although the chain migration had been planned at least since January, a recent liquidity pool attack expedited the move.It actually furthered the team’s plans by allowing it to deploy a huge early update to the protocol’s staking model, enhancing the reward rate. It also brought forward the still-unconfirmed launch date of the token’s eponymous racing game.$SPONGE is Absorbing Many Millions of Dollars
$SPONGE’s V2 upgrade introduced a couple of key improvements, the foremost of which being a new staking model.This yield varies according to the number of stakers and tokens locked up and currently sits at around 326% for Polygon stakers. To date, an eye-watering 10 billion $SPONGE tokens have been staked with the total value of tokens staked and bridged sitting at $24 million, according to the website.Meme coiners expect these numbers to increase in the coming weeks as Sponge blows up within the meme coin and Web3 gaming sectors.It’s likely that $SPONGE will land on some of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges soon, like Binance and OKX. Top-tier CEX listings form an integral part of the project roadmap and the listings could catalyze further explosive price action as $SPONGE becomes more accessible to everyday retail buyers.After claim and potential CEX listings comes the Sponge-themed play-to-earn racing game, where players race around Bikini Bottom collecting $SPONGE rewards.With its dual-revenue staking and gaming model, $SPONGE is looking to seriously disrupt low-utility larger market cap meme coin rivals like $PEPE, $DOGE and $WIF.Take advantage of this window of opportunity to buy and stake $SPONGE before exchange listings take the project mainstream.Stay updated and join the engaged community of 36,500 followers on X.Buy And Stake SPONGE On The Website

We need to talk about the dangers of custody on exchanges - Blockworks


A decade has passed since the infamous hack of major exchange Mt. Gox. The exchange’s subsequent collapse lost 7% of all bitcoin at the time — the equivalent of approximately 45 billion dollars today. It was one of the first events to threaten the very existence of the crypto ecosystem, but certainly not the last.
The industry hasn’t learnt from this catastrophe — rather quite the opposite. 
We’ve seen plenty more similar incidents in recent years. In 2023 alone, the industry suffered losses exceeding $1.8 billion due to hacks. Large platforms like Binance have given in to pressure from institutional players when it comes to holding assets with independent custodians, but not retail customers. In February, FixedFloat, a decentralized and non-KYC crypto exchange, lost over $26 million in an alleged hack. 
A devastating loss for individuals, but a mere footnote in the industry’s ongoing saga. In fact, the global crypto community has lost at least $200 million — and counting — in 2024 alone.
There seems to be a real industry-wide reluctance to address the dangers of using exchanges for custody. But why? It’s not like there isn’t an abundance of cautionary tales.
Are we doomed to repeat history?
Are we learning any lessons from the many exchange-related issues that we have seen over the last 10 years? 
Users are hopping from one exchange to another, using them as custodians of their assets rather than their primary purpose as a trading platform — but with even the largest players in the industry failing to provide a consistent and secure offering, they are running out of options. 
Read more from our opinion section: Stablecoins bots are a feature, not a bug
Beyond hacks, there is a major crisis of trust in exchanges, exacerbated by fraudulent actors and malpractice (let’s not forget Binances’ recent $4.3 billion AML charges). And no one needs reminding of the FTX debacle, with victims citing “irreparable harm,” substantial financial loss and emotional toll ahead of Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing of 25 years in prison for his crimes.
While exchanges are, of course, important for managing, trading and off-and-on-ramping assets, they simply aren’t a suitable option for custody. 
Global regulatory bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) are sounding alarm bells, yet the broader industry appears to be turning a blind eye — despite the seemingly obvious message that separating exchange from custody is the biggest issue in crypto.
Separating exchange from custody is the biggest issue in crypto
What are the alternatives?
While self-custody offers a level of autonomy, it also leads to major security vulnerabilities. Factors like human error, cyber attacks and limited regulation all contribute to the mismanagement of assets with disastrous consequences. 
Cold wallets, often hailed as a safer alternative, lack the sophistication needed to ward off security threats. Despite not being connected to the internet, they still have rampant security issues, with AI and phishing becoming more sophisticated. It’s an old-fashioned, archaic way to store funds, serving as the modern-day equivalent of stashing money under a mattress — not exactly high-tech security.
Why the bull run equates to a hacker’s field day
With bitcoin hitting all-time highs in March, the inflow of users into the space is arguably the highest seen in years. The trading frenzy, price speculation and surge of new users presents a ripe opportunity for hackers. 
Many newcomers look for the simplest and easiest websites or largely unregulated exchanges as the “entry point” to crypto and completely overlook due diligence when opening exchange accounts. People remain largely unaware of the inherent risks associated with entrusting their assets to a trustless, unregulated system. They also, understandably so, lack comprehension of the rules, or lack thereof, that “regulated” VASPs posturing as banks are subject to.
How can users feel safe using and holding crypto? How can they use the value of their crypto to interact with the traditional financial services and payments industry when there are growing restrictions in transfers or transactions between exchanges and banks?
Should you hold your crypto on exchanges? 
Unlike exchanges, which often attract consumers who neglect due diligence, regulated institutions that operate to the regulated standard of a “crypto bank” with secure rails offer a more trustworthy alternative for storing assets. 
These institutions combine the stability and security of traditional banking with the innovation and potential of cryptocurrencies, eliminating the various risks associated with exchanges.
It’s clear that when it comes to long-term custody, exchanges just aren’t worth it, and frankly, it’s absurd to ignore the risks they pose as custodians. 
We have to start taking security seriously in this industry by funneling users through truly regulated and above-board solutions. It’s either that, or risk repeating history…again.

                        A new Trump campaign coin has surged today after listing on Uniswap, becoming the latest in a long line of Trump-related tokens to piggyback on publicity from this year’s US election.Imaginatively named Boost Trump Campaign (BTC), the new token has gained by over 30,000% since listing yesterday.However, the coin has actually declined by 66% since reaching a peak of $0.0000218 in the early hours of the morning.Traders may therefore be better off looking at new meme tokens with stronger fundamentals, with Dogeverse’s presale suggesting that it could be one of the big new launches of the year.New Trump Campaign Coin Goes Viral
While Boost Trump Campaign coin has fallen since reaching its current high, it’s worth pointing out that its data looks a little more encouraging than we’ve found with many other junk meme tokens this year.For one, its trading volume has completely fallen away since the aforementioned peak, and currently stands at $15 million.Source: DEXTools/TradingViewThis is pretty good for a token that launched a day ago and that has pretty much no backing or presence, with the coin also having over 2,000 holders at last count.This is hardly an awe-inspiring number, yet it’s distinctively healthier than what we’ve witnessed with other meme tokens.Boost Trump Campaign therefore has a comparatively better chance of enjoying a rebound in the coming hours and days, even if it would be a stretch to say this is likely.It has received a modest amount of attention online, although there’s always a big chance that this is from bag holders rather than dispassionate observers who may happen to think the coin has real prospects.Based on its slight online presence, it could see a rebound in the near term, yet the likelihood remains that, without further listings or strong growth in support, it will enter a terminal decline sooner or later.Funds Shift to Dogeverse
Boost Trump Campaign is one of several Trump-related meme coins in the market right now, and the sheer throwaway abundance of such coins casts them all into doubt.However, there are more promising and fundamentally stronger meme tokens in the market, with several of these holding presales and gaining momentum as they prepare to list.At the top of any list of such coins is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain cryptocurrency that has attracted over $15 million in investment during its presale.Source: DogeverseWhat’s interesting about Dogeverse is that it will be the market’s first Doge-themed multi-chain cryptocurrency, running on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.Its existence on multiple networks means it could attract usage and adoption on a much scale than it would have as a single-chain token.As such, the greater demand it will experience should help push its price up over time.This will find help from the fact that DOGEVERSE is a deflationary meme coin, with its supply capped to 120 million tokens.On top of this, holders will be able to stake the coin for passive rewards, meaning that a big chunk of its supply will not circulate.VIDEOSuch features have helped Dogeverse to raise more than $15 million in only a month or so, with the coin looking ready to do great things.One sign of its potential also comes from its social media, with the coin boasting more than 22,000 followers on X.New investors can join its token offering by going to the official Dogeverse website, where they can buy DOGEVERSE at a final presale price of $0.00031.The coin is likely to surge well beyond this price when it lists in the next month or so, potentially making it early investors a nice profit.Buy DOGEVERSE Today

Michael Saylor: Ethereum ETFs 'may be better for Bitcoin,' here's why - AMBCrypto



Michael Saylor makes a U-turn on ETH after ETF approvals. 
The executive said that the approval will further legitimize crypto assets. 

MicroStrategy founder and CEO Michael Saylor has changed his ‘no second best to Bitcoin’ rhetoric after the Ethereum ETF’s approval. 
Commenting on the approvals, Saylor underscored the update as ‘good for crypto asset class’ but ‘better’ for Bitcoin [BTC]. 
‘Is this good for Bitcoin or not? It’s good for Bitcoin. In fact, it may be better for Bitcoin because we’re politically much more powerful, supported by the entire crypto industry.’
The ‘politically more powerful’ phrase may refer to the current political changes triggered by crypto regulations, the passage of the US CBDC ban, and the FIT21 Act.
Michael Saylor added that the ETH ETF approval will further legitimize the crypto asset class. 
Michael Saylor warm ups to ETH
Contrary to the above relative warm-up to ETH ETF approval, Saylor has always been a Bitcoin maxi and a critic of altcoins. 
About two weeks ago, the executive believed that Bitcoin would be the only approved crypto asset with a spot ETF and backing of Wall Street and TradFi. 
The executive expected the SEC to reject the ETH ETFs. Here, it can be argued that Saylor changed his strict stance against other crypto assets after the ETH ETF approvals. 
However, his emphasis that BTC could benefit more from the ETH ETF adds to the divergent views on the topic. 
Some industry analysts, like Jim Bianco and Quinn Thompson, have reiterated that ETH ETF could draw inflows from spot BTC ETFs. 
As a result, the ETH ETF launch could be negative to BTC. In fact, Bianco projected that ETH could even flip BTC before the next halving. 
However, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan downplayed the ‘threat’ and mentioned that ETH ETF will hit billions but won’t match BTC. 
In the meantime, the recent positive regulatory relief and ETH ETF approvals saw BTC ETFs record positive net inflows last week. 
According to AMBCrypto’s look at Soso Value’s data, the investment products saw a total of $819.5 million last week. 
It remains to be seen whether these BTC ETF flows will be affected by ETH ETFs when they launch and start trading.

PEPE leaps past MATIC in market cap, registers 79% weekly gains - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The meme coin Pepecoin (PEPE) inches closer to the $7 billion market cap after leaping 79% in one week. The movement was enough to surpass Polygon (MATIC) and become the 21st largest crypto by market cap, according to data aggregator CoinGecko.Moreover, PEPE registered a new all-time high this Monday by reaching $0.00001717. Excluding stablecoins, PEPE becomes the token with the 19th largest market value, joining Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) among the meme coins with the most significant sizes.PEPE price in the past seven days. Image: CoinGeckoPEPE’s price leap was boosted by the ‘meme coin frenzy’ that took crypto by storm, as tokens based on memes became the most profitable narrative in Q1, as reported by Crypto Briefing.However, Ethereum-based meme coins got especially propelled since last Monday, when Bloomberg ETF analysts pumped the odds of a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US from 25% to 75%, which ended in an actual approval.Turbo (TURBO) is a good example of an Ethereum-based meme coin that shot up during the ETF approval saga. In the past week, the token has risen 429%, and 46.7% in the last 24 hours alone.The cat-themed token Mog Coin (MOG) also made substantial movements in the last seven days, climbing 162% in the period, and 48% in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, the meme coin niche is the 11th largest crypto niche by market cap, amounting to over $68 billion.Notably, smart money traders registered optimism towards PEPE even before the Ethereum ETF approval in the US became clear. In the past 30 days, the frog-themed coin was the Ethereum-based with the highest inflow of smart money, surpassing $436 million, according to on-chain data platform Nansen.

XRP Bullish Outlook: Analyst Predicts Mega Run On The Horizon


																In a strikingly optimistic forecast amidst favorable market conditions, cryptocurrency analyst and trader Edrag Crypto, has provided a bullish review for XRP, predicting that a massive run for the digital asset could be on the horizon.
The analysis explores a confluence of positive market indicators and trends that demonstrates the potential for XRP to attract significant price surges and gains, positioning the coin as a promising asset in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency.
Edrag Crypto’s bullish prediction for XRP is based on a Genuine Wake-Up line previously introduced by the expert, divided into two distinct sections, such as Break-out and Atlas Line.
XRP Poised For Substantial Growth
The analyst has expressed that while this wake-up line saw a successful breakout last year, it could not reach the heights anticipated by the analyst then. “Many moons back, I introduced the ‘Final Wake Up Line,’ which saw a breakout in July 2023. Yet, it didn’t quite soar to the heights we hoped for,” he stated.

However, Edrag Crypto spotted a new development on XRP’s chart two weeks ago, which he indicated as a white triangle. According to the analyst, highs from 2021 are being incorporated into the white triangle. 
At that time, for XRP to witness a complete upward swing, it needed to break through the Genuine wake-up line with absolute conviction and then retest. Consequently, Edrag Crypto urged the community to remain firm, putting his wave 1 target at $7.5 and wave 3 at a 3-digit target, within the Macro wave 3.
Presently, addressing the break-out aspect, the analyst has noted that the white triangle break-out is in perfect alignment with the Fibonacci 0.702 – 0.786 levels and his previous charts. It is expected that the measured move will be between $1.2 and $1.5, while the crucial break-out point is closer to $0.70 or $0.75.
A mega run looms for XRP | Edrag Crypto on X
Due to this, Egrag Crypto affirms that XRP will see a breakout from the point in the upcoming weeks. Despite the possibility of a retest of the breakout, the expert believes that a mega run for the crypto asset is imminent.
The Atlas Line
Delving into the Atlas Line aspect, Egrag Crypto underscored XRP’s resilience in this area. According to the analyst, the asset is dominating the atlas line with a solid grip like a boss.

He further pointed out a quick timeframe analysis revealing resistance at $0.5777, support at $0.5000, and a break-out point at $0.6799. Edrag Crypto’s prognosis has captured investors’ and enthusiasts’ attention alike, as they closely monitor these developments.
At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5284, indicating a 3% rise in the past week. While its market cap has reduced by about 1.28%, its trading volume has seen positive movement of more than 36% in the past day.

Ethereum Core Developers Plan to Launch Pectra Upgrade by Q1 2025


                        
                            Ethereum Core Developers Plan to Launch Pectra Upgrade by Q1 2025

                        According to recent announcements from the Ethereum core development team, Ethereum’s highly anticipated Pectra upgrade will be released by the end of Q1 2025.This upgrade follows the successful deployment of the Dencun upgrade in March 2024. The decision to schedule Pectra for early 2025 stems from a desire to avoid rushing the release and incorporate more impactful user features.Evaluation of Timeline and Impact For the Upcoming Ethereum Pectra UpgradeEthereum developers have deliberated over several timeline scenarios for the Pectra upgrade. They concluded that delaying the launch until after the Devcon developer summit, scheduled for November 2024 in Bangkok, would be beneficial. Devcon is the largest developer summit in the Asia Pacific region, and it will take place in Bangkok from November 12 to 15.They emphasized that this strategic approach allows for a more measured development process and the inclusion of additional features that could significantly enhance user experience. “We are observing that this is also what happened with Cancun, so being realistic, my vote would be to aim to ship Prague in Q1 2025. With today’s scope, delaying Prague seems to have a marginal impact on users and allows us to consider expanding the scope to include more impactful features for users,” noted the Ethereum developers in a recent document.The experience from the Dencun upgrade deployment on the Goerli testnet has made them pay more attention to timing and its importance to adoption. Developers faced challenges in achieving consensus within the expected timeframe with the Dencun upgrade, which was eventually resolved. Still, they stressed the need for thorough preparation for the next upgrade.The Pectra upgrade will focus on enhancing both the consensus and execution layers. One significant improvement will be the integration of PeerDAS, which aims to boost Ethereum’s Data Availability capacity ahead of the Osaka upgrade.The Osaka upgrade, a future hard fork, is expected to include features initially considered for Pectra but postponed to allow for a more refined implementation. Notably, Osaka will likely implement Verkle Trees, a new data structure designed to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and decentralization.Execution Layer Meeting Overview
VIDEOIn the Execution Layer Meeting, the team discussed the importance of supporting longstanding authorization use cases in Ethereum’s account management system. The team debated mechanisms to keep authorizations alive during transactions, including Max L and non-optional authorizations. They also touched on using 7702 and the approach of wallets signing only one message for standardized proxies. Additionally, they are considering including EOF (Ethereum Object Format) to improve smart contract security and developer experience. A proposal to replace EIP-3074 with EIP-7702 would achieve better account abstraction compatibility and address specific issues.“We need to decide on EIP7702 on ACDE, and if so, implement it as a replacement for EIP-3074. We think it makes sense to do so as it’s a more native-AA compatible solution because of the new transaction type vs an opcode,” developers noted.The developers also discussed including and removing Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in the next development net. The team decided to include EIP 7702 and test it while removing EIP 3074. Notably, they also discussed the implementation status of various EIPs, including RIP-1185, and the potential delay of increasing or decreasing the scope of the next hard fork. Ethereum TVL Reaching A New All-Time High
According to L2BEAT, the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum Layer 2 networks has reached a record high of $47.45 billion. Arbitrum One leads the pack with a TVL of $19.3 billion, followed by OP Mainnet at $7.88 billion and Base at $6.94 billion. Other notable blockchains with over $1 billion in TVL include Blast, Mantle, Linea, and Starknet. The overall TVL of all Ethereum Layer 2s has surged by 17.39% in the past week.The recent bullish trend is primarily driven by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on May 23 and the SEC-approved ETF applications from eight issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and VanEck. This marks the second spot digital asset ETF approval in the U.S., following the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. These issuers are in the process of submitting S-1 forms, with launches anticipated within weeks.

Following our insights in the latest BeInCrypto LINK analysis, the LINK price has confirmed the bullish outlook we’ve been anticipating.
Chainlink Technical Analysis: Bullish Outlook Confirmed on Daily Chart
Chainlink (LINK) has recently moved above the upper boundary of the Ichimoku cloud on a daily timeframe, which is currently around $17.41. This breakout is a bullish signal, suggesting that LINK could see further upward momentum if it maintains this level.

LINK/USDT (1D). Source: TradingView
The 100-day EMA (blue line) is currently at $16.02, providing a strong support level. LINK has successfully tested this EMA and is trading above it, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. The price remaining above this EMA indicates sustained buying pressure.
The immediate resistance level to watch is the upper boundary of the Ichimoku cloud at $17.41. A break and close above this level would confirm further bullish momentum.
The support levels to watch are $16.02 (the 100-day EMA) and $14.6 (the lower boundary of the daily Ichimoku cloud). These levels are crucial for maintaining the current bullish outlook.
LINK Technical Analysis on 4-Hour Time Frame
On the 4-hour timeframe, LINK is trading above the Ichimoku cloud, signaling a bullish trend. The green cloud indicates an upward trajectory, offering support below the current price (with the Tenkan line in red).

LINK/USDT (4H). Source: TradingView
The 100-period EMA (blue line) is at $16.050, acting as a dynamic support level. LINK has consistently traded above this EMA, reinforcing the bullish outlook.

The chart shows a significant proportion (70%) of addresses are currently in the money (green), suggesting a strong holding sentiment among investors. This is bullish as it indicates that most holders are in profit, reducing the selling pressure.
Historically, periods with a high percentage of in-the-money addresses have coincided with bullish trends in LINK’s price.
Strategic Recommendations: Bullish Outlook for LINK to $18.70

Maintain Current Positions: Given the strong bullish signals from the Ichimoku Cloud breakout and support from the 100-day EMA, it is recommended to maintain current long positions. LINK’s price staying above these critical levels indicates sustained buying pressure and positive momentum.
Watch Key Resistance Levels: The immediate resistance level to monitor is $17.41. A successful break and close above this level would likely lead to further upward momentum towards the next target of $18.70. Set alerts to notify of significant price movements above this resistance.
Monitor Support Levels: Key support levels to watch are at $16.021 (100-day EMA) and $15.378 (lower boundary of the Ichimoku Cloud). Maintaining these support levels is crucial for sustaining the bullish trend. Consider these levels as potential entry points for adding to positions if the price retraces.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Dips After $69K Resistance Breach Attempt Fails


							

Bitcoin dips 0.02%, failing to breach $69,336 resistance, sparking potential lower-level tests.



BTC trading volume surges 23% to $18.6B, signaling trader accumulation amid resistance struggles.



RSI at 57.93 hints at neutral momentum, while MACD signals a bullish trend despite waning momentum.




In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has been in a bearish phase after failing to breach the $69,336 resistance. Despite a robust weekly close, the cryptocurrency was unable to sustain a rally beyond the $69,000 resistance, marking another unsuccessful attempt to flip this resistance to support, prompting discussions about potential lower-level tests.







BTC/USD 24-hour price chart (source: CoinMarketCap)



As of press time, BTC was trading at $68,499, a 0.02% dip from its intra-day high. During the dip, BTC’s market capitalization decreased by 0.82% to $1,349,522,566,505. Conversely, the 24-hour trading volume surged by 23% to $18,603,572,455, suggesting that traders are continuing to accumulate.



Bitcoin (BTC) Price Trend



Throughout the previous week, Bitcoin prices oscillated near the $69,000 resistance level. Despite a brief surge above $69,500, the predominant sentiment among market participants was one of caution, leading to a price consolidation. Market analysts observed that the $69,000 level has emerged as a significant resistance point that Bitcoin has struggled to surpass convincingly.







The insights shared by Daan Crypto Trades on X highlighted that liquidity was notably building up around $68,300 and $69,800. These levels are crucial as they represent potential pivot points for short-term price movements. Moreover, as the United States markets closed for the Memorial Day holiday, reduced trading volumes were expected, potentially leading to decreased volatility. 



Nevertheless, the presence of substantial liquidity near the current spot price suggests that Bitcoin might soon face a liquidity raid, which could lead to a sudden price movement if large market orders are triggered.



Moreover, analysts have weighed in on Bitcoin resistance at $69,000, suggesting that flipping this resistance to support could be key for further upward movement toward the $73,000 level. 







Conversely, a failure to hold above the resistance has led to the consideration of lower buying points. In this context, Michael Vande Pope, a crypto analyst, suggested that Bitcoin might be preparing for a retest of the lower range near $66,000, emphasizing this as a critical buy level for investors. 



BTC/USD Technical Analysis



On the BTCUSD price chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 57.93, suggests that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for a potential upward trend. However, with the RSI below its signal line, a downward trend may be building. 



Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates a bullish trend as it remains above the signal line. On the contrary, the histogram makes lower bars, suggesting a waning bullish momentum. 







BTC/USD 24-hour price chart (source: TradingView)



Despite this, the falling wedge pattern observed on the BTC price chart suggests a bullish outcome. This trend aligns with analysts’ view of BTC flipping the $69K resistance to support hence targeting the $73,000 level.

                        Renowned Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed his collaboration with Binance for the launch of his fourth non-fungible token (NFT) collection.The upcoming collection, scheduled to be unveiled on May 29 on the Binance NFT Marketplace, will pay homage to Ronaldo’s illustrious career, showcasing highlights from his football journey, according to a recent blog post by Binance.“My football journey has seen me travel around the world, and I’ve been honored to play for some of the most prestigious clubs out there,” Cristiano Ronaldo said in a comment.“Now it’s your turn to join me on that journey too.”Number of NFTs in New Collection Not Disclosed
The exact number of NFTs in the new collection has not been disclosed, and pricing details are yet to be revealed.However, it was mentioned that the price will remain the same for each “Normal NFT,” while the final Super Rare NFT in the collection will have a different pricing structure.Previous NFT events involving Cristiano Ronaldo have offered more than just digital assets, with holders being granted exclusive opportunities such as playing football with the legendary player as part of Binance promotions.However, it’s worth noting that the football star has been embroiled in legal issues related to his involvement in NFT collection sales with Binance.In November 2023, Ronaldo faced a class-action lawsuit in a United States district court in Florida.The plaintiffs alleged that Ronaldo had actively participated in the offer and sale of unregistered securities in collaboration with Binance, and they argued that he should have been aware of Binance’s involvement in such activities.It is worth noting that there has been a trend of companies discontinuing their involvement in the NFT space.Back in March, Starbucks, the renowned multinational coffee chain, made the decision to terminate its NFT rewards program.In January, gaming retailer GameStop announced the closure of its NFT marketplace after scaling back its crypto services over the past two years.More recently, X (formerly Twitter), under the ownership of Elon Musk, discontinued a feature that allowed premium users to use NFT images as their profile pictures.Binance’s Growing Regulatory Troubles
The legal case against Ronaldo came as Binance has faced increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide.Last year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed charges against Binance for allegedly operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange and evading federal laws.Similarly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Binance Holdings LTD and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) for allegedly operating unregistered exchanges, broker exchanges, clearing houses, and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.Binance and CZ pleaded guilty to a range of federal charges, including anti-money laundering violations and unlicensed money transmission, on November 21, 2023. CZ later resigned as the CEO of Binance, which was part of the agreement with the DOJ.In March, a group of investors who sought to sue the exchange, its former CEO Changpeng Zhao, and other executives were given a fresh chance to pursue their case.

Ethereum is finally showing what it is capable of after rumors of the preapproval of the Ethereum ETF have spread around the crypto circle. For now, the price is getting ready for a swing toward or above $4,000, but its true strength is yet to be shown.Ethereum has been seen in an uptrend that recently broke through $3,900. Currently, ETH is trading around $3,898, showing a gain of 1.92%, and the upsurge is supported well by swift trading volumes.Ethereum/USD Chart by TradingViewThe technical indicators are aligning to suggest further upward movement. The 50-day EMA stands near $3,225, while the 100-day EMA lies close to $3,175. Both moving averages have provided strong support and confirmed the current trend. In addition, the RSI is at 72, which means that, at the moment, ETH is slightly overbought. Yet, this is not critical and, therefore, in case of a minor overheating, the asset can continue to grow a bit higher.Two major price targets have emerged for Ethereum:the immediate level now seems to be that psychological $4,000. Anything lower would imply the prevalent bearish sentiment confirmed at the moment. This will most probably see buyers join in and push the price even higher or, in other words, liquidate some substantial amount of short orders.As for the liquidation heatmap: at the time, there was a huge cumulative long liquidation leverage all the way down to $3,200, meaning there were $3 billion worth of longs open — theoretically meaning there might be a massive sell-off in the case of liquidation. More than $1 billion in short orders get closed if the price of the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market surges, causing a squeeze and sending bears away.

Cristiano Ronaldo’s Latest NFT Collection: What to Expect


Cristiano Ronaldo is set to release his fourth non-fungible token (NFT) collection on the Binance NFT Marketplace on May 29.
 This collection celebrates the legendary footballer’s storied career, featuring digital highlights from his most iconic moments.
Binance Yet to Reveal Cristiano Ronaldo NFTs’ Price

Partnering with Binance, Ronaldo continues to make significant strides in the blockchain space. This latest series captures his journey from modest beginnings in Madeira to international fame, showcasing his signature plays such as bicycle kicks and historic goals.
Expressing its excitement, the Binance team highlighted the collection’s broad appeal. It caters to newcomers to NFTs, die-hard Ronaldo fans, and experienced collectors alike. Each NFT serves as a piece of football history, commemorating two decades of Ronaldo’s sporting excellence.

“My football journey has seen me travel around the world, and I’ve been honored to play for some of the most prestigious clubs out there. Now it’s your turn to join me on that journey too,” Cristiano Ronaldo said.

Furthermore, the collection offers exclusive access to coveted utilities and benefits within the sports industry. Although the total number of NFTs and their prices will only be revealed at launch, Binance has stated that most will have uniform pricing, except for a special ‘Super Rare NFT.’
However, Ronaldo’s NFT ventures have not been without controversy. In November 2023, he faced a lawsuit for allegedly promoting unregistered securities through his Binance partnership. Filed in Florida, this case has sparked discussions on the ethical responsibilities of celebrities in digital asset promotions.

Legal experts believe Ronaldo may consult with his advisors about the possibility of settling. This legal issue highlights the complex responsibilities tied to celebrity endorsements of investment opportunities in emerging markets.
Ronaldo’s engagement in NFTs reflects a larger trend where celebrities merge their professional successes with blockchain technology, offering fans new ways to engage. His arch-rival, Lionel Messi, also has NFT exposure, though not a dedicated collection.

Justin Sun Urges Support for Pro-Crypto Presidential Candidate


Justin Sun, the founder of layer-1 blockchain TRON, has urged the crypto community to back a US presidential candidate who supports the digital assets industry.
Sun’s recent statement follows other prominent figures in the industry who have already voiced similar messages.
Influential Voices and Institutional Support for Pro-Crypto Candidates

In a recent X (Twitter) post, Justin Sun emphasized the importance of recognizing the crypto community, companies, and protocols as significant stakeholders.

“We need to demonstrate to the candidate that the cryptocurrency community, companies, and protocols are significant stakeholders whose voices should be heard and whose interests should be protected,” he wrote.

Sun’s statement came after former US President Donald Trump expressed his support for the crypto industry, particularly regarding self-custody in digital assets. Although Sun did not explicitly name any candidates, the crypto community speculated about potential pro-crypto endorsements.

Last weekend, Trump made headlines with a bold promise that the future of Bitcoin and crypto would be shaped in the USA, not overseas. He also vowed never to allow the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).
This declaration received widespread support from the crypto community. Prominent figures like Anthony ‘Pomp’ Pompliano, an investor at Pomp Investment, praised Trump’s stance.

“This is surreal. The leading Presidential candidate is explicitly saying he will make America the leader in Bitcoin and crypto, while supporting the right to self-custody. All the critics were wrong. The government won’t ban it, they’re embracing it,” Pomp said.

Other influential figures in the crypto industry have previously called for supporting pro-crypto candidates in the presidential election. BeInCrypto reported that Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, emphasized the importance of voting for crypto-friendly candidates in the upcoming elections.
Hoskinson also critiqued President Joe Biden’s stringent stance on crypto. He called the idea of regulating crypto under the Securities Act of 1933 “an absurd statement.”
Billionaire investor Mark Cuban, known for his advocacy for this industry, voiced concerns with the current administration’s approach to crypto. He criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s stringent policies, which impede legitimate crypto ventures and harm many businesses and entrepreneurs.
Institutional support for pro-crypto candidates is also growing. Earlier this month, crypto exchange Coinbase created a new political action committee (PAC) called “Stand With Crypto.”

This PAC aims to support political candidates who favor crypto financially. They plan to utilize contributions from over 450,000 members to back a bipartisan group of candidates in the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Indeed, crypto has emerged as a major issue in this year’s election. A recent Digital Currency Group (DCG) poll revealed that most voters want policymakers to understand crypto before regulating it. Seventy-five percent of the crypto-positive respondents expressed concern about policymakers stifling innovation through over-regulation.

As the presidential race heats up, influential figures are urging support for those who recognize the potential of the digital assets industry. The crypto community is keenly watching which candidates will champion their cause.

182 Billion PEPE in One Hour, What's Happening?

Frog-themed meme coin PEPE has seen a massive surge in its valuation, setting it up for a potential sell-off by market whales. Over the past 24 hours, PEPE has soared by 2.15% to $0.00001654, backed by a more than 75% surge in the trailing seven-day period.The PEPE rally has set a bullish pace for other meme coins thus far this month. Historically, PEPE has always set a bullish course in the month of May. Per Cryptorank data, PEPE ended May 2023 at 74.9% growth, a figure that is less than double the 148.2% on record thus far this month.This massive upshoot has helped PEPE hit multiple all-time highs (ATH) this month. Per on-chain data, the latest of this ATH came hours earlier as the token soared to a price of $0.00001718. Following this parabolic growth, the crypto analytics platform Lookonchain has hinted that two newly created wallets have withdrawn 182.7 billion PEPE worth approximately $3.1 million from OKX in less than one hour.Such an enormous amount of PEPE moving from an exchange is arguably a vote of confidence as it shows the willingness to sell is reduced. While there might be a fraction of holders looking to take profits on their PEPE holdings, the token’s whales are arguably cautious, as seen from IntoTheBlock’s concentration by holders.Amid the bullish trend on PEPE, the digital token is now on the verge of flipping Polygon by market capitalization. As of writing, PEPE's market capitalization comes in at $6.98 billion, as compared to that of Polygon, pegged at $7.21 billion. Should the current price rally for PEPE continue at the same pace in the short to medium term, it might end up flipping not only Polygon but also Near, Bitcoin Cash, Tron and others, the same way it flipped Ethereum Classic.

Kickstarting The Bitcoin Bull Run: Expert Says $70,000 Is The Level To Beat


																Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe has outlined an important price level from which Bitcoin must break out. He claims that once it achieves a successful breakout, the flagship crypto will see a new all-time high (ATH). 
Bitcoin Needs To Break Through $70,000
Van de Poppe mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin needs to break through $70,000 on the lower time frame (LTF) basis. Once that happens, the analyst claimed that Bitcoin will likely see a new ATH.

He also noted that lower timeframe regions at $67,000 were holding. Meanwhile, he highlighted Bitcoin’s long consolidation, stating that almost three months have passed since the crypto token remained in that range. .

However, the crypto expert believes that Bitcoin will likely remain stuck in this range for a “substantial period,” with the flagship crypto possibly trading lower. This is because he foresees a rotation from Bitcoin towards Ethereum and other altcoins, which will cause the flagship crypto not to move to the upside. 
This long consolidation period was expected from BTC. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, predicted that the crypto token would continue to range between $60,000 and $70,000 until August. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has also repeatedly mentioned that Bitcoin will face such a long consolidation period, which he claimed is good for Bitcoin.
He noted how the flagship crypto hit a new ATH before the halving event brought about an accelerated cycle. However, a long consolidation period means Bitcoin is trying to resynchronize with previous halving cycles. He suggested this is better since it will make the bull run longer. Rekt Capital claimed If it successfully resynchronizes with the previous bull cycles, Bitcoin will peak sometime in September or October next year. 
In a recent X post, Rekt Capital mentioned that “there is still scope for additional consolidation at these highs” but added that the time left in this phase “is slowly running out.” The chart the analyst shared suggested that Bitcoin simply needs to break out from the $70,000 range before it enters into the ‘parabolic uptrend’ phase.

BTC May Be Headed To $78,000 Next
Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto recently suggested that Bitcoin could be headed to $78,000 on its next leg up. He revealed that the flagship crypto had broken out of an inverse head and shoulders pattern and was currently “bull flagging for the next move.” He highlighted $78,000 as the price target for this next move. 

	Related Reading


In a subsequent X post, he claimed that BTC retesting its support level might be the next step before this “explosive rally” finally happens. Bitcoin potentially rising to $78,000 is significant as it could clear the road for the flagship crypto to hit $100,000. Crypto analyst Crypto Jebb previously mentioned that there is a “great degree of likelihood” that Bitcoin would rally to $100,000 should it break its current ATH of $73,800.

In the ever-volatile world of cryptocurrency, market signals and expert analyses can often foretell significant movements in asset prices. Injective (INJ) is currently catching the attention of investors and traders alike. According to a recent tweet by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, INJ may be on the cusp of a substantial rally, sparking excitement and anticipation within the crypto community.Martinez's tweet highlighted a historical pattern in INJ's price movements, pointing to the TD Sequential indicator — a popular technical analysis tool used to identify potential turning points on the market. He noted that the indicator is flashing a buy signal, suggesting that INJ could rally in the near future.The TD Sequential indicator, developed by Tom DeMark, is widely used among traders to spot potential price reversals and continuation patterns. It consists of a series of numbers that represent a specific sequence, helping traders identify when a market is overextended in either direction. When the TD Sequential indicator flashes a buy signal, it often signifies a potential bullish reversal or continuation, suggesting that the asset is likely to experience upward momentum.Historical repeat for INJMartinez's tweet underscores the historical accuracy of the TD Sequential indicator in predicting INJ's price rallies. In previous instances, the indicator successfully signaled substantial price increases. Following the first buy signal, INJ experienced a remarkable surge of 700%. This substantial gain underscored the robustness of the TD Sequential indicator and marked a significant milestone for Injective Protocol.The second buy signal was followed by an impressive 555% rally. This continued success reinforced the credibility of the TD Sequential indicator in the context of INJ's price movements. Notably, current market conditions are favorable for another potential rally. Several factors contribute to this optimistic outlook.For instance, the overall sentiment on the cryptocurrency market has been increasingly positive, with many digital assets experiencing upward trends. This bullish sentiment often spills over into related assets, potentially benefiting INJ. In addition to the TD Sequential indicator, other technical indicators and chart patterns may also align to support the likelihood of a rally. Analysts often look for confluence among multiple indicators to strengthen their predictions.

Polkadot celebrates 4 year anniversary with unanimous JAM upgrade approval

The Polkadot community celebrated the blockchain’s fourth anniversary by ratifying the highly anticipated Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) upgrade.The proposal received unanimous support, with backing from over 31 million DOT tokens.JAM ratificationJAM is a decentralized hybrid system offering secure and scalable smart contract functionalities by merging features from Ethereum within Polkadot’s framework.This upgrade is widely celebrated within the community as the next phase in Polkadot’s evolution. It replaces the network’s Relay Chain with a more modular, minimalistic design. Gavin Wood, Polkadot’s founder, presented the update’s Graypaper in April at the Token2049 crypto conference.On May 27, Wood revealed that the community had ratified the proposed upgrade with a near-unanimous governance vote, adding that work was ongoing to finalize the Graypaper to version 1.0.The ratification doesn’t mean immediate change. Instead, it indicates the community’s readiness to accept and oversee the JAM upgrade under the Technical Fellowship’s supervision.4 year anniversaryOn May 26, the Polkadot network celebrated its fourth anniversary since the launch of its Genesis block in 2020.Polkadot is a blockchain network designed for speed and scalability. It employs multiple parallel blockchains, known as “parachains,” to distribute processing demands. The network uses a governance token called DOT, which it asserts is not a security because it has evolved into software.This distinction distinguishes it from competitors that have drawn significant regulatory scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Interestingly, DOT remains one of the few digital assets that the SEC has not classified as a security despite numerous regulatory actions against other industry players.Polkadot has experienced substantial success and adoption in various metrics. Notably, it has excelled in staking compared to other proof-of-stake networks. Staking involves participants locking up digital assets to support network security and operations, earning rewards in return.Data from DotLake reveals that about 58% of DOT’s total supply, equivalent to 822.5 million tokens (approximately $6 billion), is currently staked on the network. This is significantly higher than Ethereum, which has approximately 27% of its total supply locked, according to Nansen data.Furthermore, Polkadot’s decentralized governance system, OpenGov, is actively driving initiatives to advance the network’s goals. The community has passed several proposals, including the ratification of the JAM upgrade and other developments.Disclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

                        Popular ERC-20 meme coin Shiba Inu ($SHIB) is outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum and top meme coin Dogecoin to become one of the best digital asset investments of 2024.At its current price of $0.00002547, Shiba Inu is a staggering 200% up from its price this time last year.By comparison, the world’s favorite cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ($BTC) is up 158%, Ethereum ($ETH) added 115% over the year, and $SHIB’s top rival, OG doge meme coin Dogecoin ($DOGE) has grown 137.5% over the last 365 days.However, the token’s performance over the last three months shows it facing stiffening resistance (indicated by the red trend line), even as its support level (green trend line) is increasing. The data indicates $SHIB’s price has been relatively stable over the last month as it consistently trades slightly above its 30-day moving average, represented by the graph’s blue line.Source: TradingViewWith a relative strength index (RSI) hovering around the high 60s, Shiba Inu is close to being overbought (70 is the threshold). The recent spate of buying is likely driven by last week’s news that the US SEC has approved exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Ethereum ($ETH), the coin powering Shiba Inu’s native blockchain.Mega Dice’s $DICE Tempts Shiba Inu Holders
Shiba Inu has realised that very few meme coins will survive the post-adoption future, when crypto will become a ubiquitous means of payment and store of value for the general public. That’s why earlier this year, the team behind it announced a $12 million fundraise towards a new privacy focused layer-3 blockchain.Still, for portfolio diversification, there are a plethora of new projects, some still in presale, that hint at a glowing future for crypto beyond simply payments or storing value.GambleFi is one such sector. The term refers to any crypto-native online gambling platform or product.According to data by Statista, online gambling could take in $100.90 billion in revenue this year. And a new generation of tokens are serving as both playing chips and loyalty cards.Solana GameFi token Mega Dice’s ($DICE) ICO started in mid-April, and it has already taken over $1.2 million in investments, according to the website.Mega Dice launched last year as the world’s first licensed crypto casino accessible through the popular messaging app Telegram.Since then, over 50,000 players have signed up and helped the casino become a well-established name in GambleFi.Casino customers who play with the token will get further benefits down the line, as the casino plans to integrate it into the loyalty program, offering more generous rewards to gamers who play with it.The token will also unlock exclusive competitions and VIP experiences.Lastly, Mega Dice has indicated there will be a buyback and burn program. This means the casino will periodically buy some of the tokens and remove them from circulation to keep them scarce, helping to drive their value.Follow Mega Dice news over on X/Twitter and Telegram.Join the presale now on the Mega Dice website.

                        After a 100% plunge in the price of $NORMIE following a smart contract exploit, the Normie memecoin team mulls negotiating with the accused hacker to recover 90% of the stolen funds, causing a $41.7 million drop in the market cap in under three hours.The hacker offered to return 90% of the stolen Ether, so a new token will be launched to refund holders. The NORMIE team reportedly accepted the offer of ‘no reprisals’ and holder reimbursement.NORMIE Hit by Flash Loan Attack, Team Negotiates Return of Stolen Funds
On May 26, a flash loan attack targeted the $NORMIE memecoin project on Base blockchain, exploiting a vulnerability in its contract tax mechanism. This breach enabled the attacker to borrow a large amount of cryptocurrency without collateral, manipulate the token supply, and repay the loan within the same transaction.The instantaneous nature of blockchain transactions facilitated the attack, causing a rapid increase in NORMIE’s token supply. Consequently, the token’s price plummeted by over 99%, reducing its market value from $40 million to under $200,000.Exploiter Requirements to Normie’s Team Source: Base ExplorerEarly this morning, the Normie project team announced that the hacker had contacted them and agreed to return 90% of the stolen funds. Despite this agreement, NORMIE’s price had dropped by 96% since the exploit. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain identified the exploit and the hacker’s offer through an on-chain message to Normie’s deployer address.The Normie team accepted the hacker’s terms to recover the funds, which involved using the returned assets and $2.3 million from their development wallet to launch a new token for compensating NORMIE holders. In an official statement, the team addressed the hacker:“Exploiter, we accept your offer to return 90% of the exploited $ETH. You may keep 10%, no reprisals.”Following this announcement, the team’s primary account on X (formerly Twitter) was suspended. The team then communicated via a new account on X, announcing a relaunch planned after regaining access to their main account and securing the returned funds. However, this temporary account was also suspended shortly thereafter.The hacker reiterated the conditions, emphasizing that the token relaunch must precede the return of funds:“The dev wallet made significantly more than I did during this exploit, and I have no other way to ensure that those funds are used appropriately.”NORMIE Holders Express Concerns Amid Silence from Project Post-Hack
Some cryptocurrency users on X (formerly Twitter) have expressed concerns regarding the NORMIE team’s silence following the suspension of their X handles. One user reported that the NORMIE team had “blocked messages on Telegram“ and had “very little information” about their plans. Several users speculated whether the hack could have been an “insider job.”NORMIE was launched amid a surge in memecoin popularity on the Base blockchain in March 2024, reaching a peak market cap of $130 million on April 2, according to CoinGecko. The token’s price declined at 3:55 am UTC on May 26, plunging over 92% to $0.0032 within an hour.The price further dropped by 99.5% after two and a half hours, with a brief spike to $0.019 before continuing its downward trend to $0.0016 at the time of writing, marking a 96% fall. The market cap, which fell from $41.9 million to a low of $200,000, has slightly recovered since then.According to the on-chain scam detection tool Quick Intel, 72,000 NORMIE holders were affected by the exploit. Quick Intel mentioned that the vulnerability had been detected in March, although it is unclear how much the token’s holders lost in the incident. The NORMIE team has yet to confirm the number of affected users.They urged affected token holders to register for a snapshot to receive compensation:“If you were affected in the latest exploit you may now register for the snapshot. We will be taking on entries until the end of May. Everyone who was a holder and registered will be airdropped on the new contract.”

Billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya Says US Economy Already in Quasi-Synthetic Recession - Here’s What He Means - The Daily Hodl


								Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya believes that the US economy is already in the midst of a downturn.
In a new episode of the All-In Podcast, Palihapitiya explores why more than half of Americans believe the economy is in a recession even though the GDP rose by 1.6% last quarter.










According to Palihapitiya, the negative sentiment may have something to do with the components used to measure the GDP, which he notes may be giving an inaccurate sense of the state of the US economy.
“[The GDP] is the sum of four things. Most of it is what people spend. Then the next big chunk is what companies and governments spend and the last is what we export to other countries.”
Source: All-In Podcast/YouTube
The billionaire explains that consumers and companies tend to save and scrimp when interest rates are high. Palihapitiya says consumers would rather keep their money sitting in banks to generate interest while companies limit their investments because borrowing money is expensive.
When interest rates are low, the venture capitalist says consumers and companies are incentivized to spend. The cost of capital is cheaper and money sitting in banks is not generating interest.
But the same dynamic doesn’t appear to apply to the government. According to the billionaire, the government spends regardless of prevailing rates.
“Unfortunately, it turns out our governments in America, they just keep spending more and more. So even if net interest income is small, even if net interest income is high, they’re just like, ‘Forget it, the taps are on.’
So what does this all mean? I think what it really means is that we do a very poor job of measuring all these dynamics together. So I actually trust the survey data of these individuals more than I trust the GDP report in the sense that I think it more accurately captures this dynamic. 
Rates are at 6%, people are saving more, they’re not getting paid more, things are costing more. The government is giving you free money so you kind of feel like everything is moving so that the GDP measurement, the way that it’s classically done, shows that, ‘Wow we grew at 3% of 4%,’ but the average individual American isn’t feeling that. They’re actually feeling that they have less money. 
I would actually go with them and actually say if we don’t revisit this thing from first principles, we’re going to get this dynamic where we think one thing is happening but the actual exact opposite is happening. In this case, I do think we’re in a quasi-synthetic recession.”
Palihapitiya appears to suggest that the economy is already in a recession but GDP numbers do not reflect that state due to sustained government spending.

Why BONK Price Increase Could Come to a Halt


BONK’s price is enjoying the bullishness of the broader market cues, but despite the massive rise, the future appears not so bright.
This is because the investors are exhibiting mixed signals at the moment, which could lead to a neutral-bearish outcome.
Bonk Investors Seem Unsure

BONK price is poised to witness a contraction as investors show slight bearishness. This can be seen in the money being pulled out of the Futures market, evidenced in the Open Interest.
Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures, that have not been settled. In five days, BONK’s open interest dropped by 20% from $13.8 million to $11.1 million.
This $2.7 million decline shows investors are not keen on trading BONK, a bearish sign for the altcoin.

However, investors still hope for a rally despite money being pulled out of the Futures market. Their faith in the rise is evident in the still positive funding rate.
The funding rate is the periodic payment between long and short positions in a perpetual futures contract to maintain its price close to the underlying asset’s value. It reflects the balance of buying and selling pressure in the market.

BONK Funding Rate. Source: Coinglass
The negative funding rate suggests that short contracts are dominating the market, while long contracts hint at positive contracts taking precedence. Such is the case with BONK as well, which could counter the bearishness from the declining open interest.
BONK Price Prediction: Sideways Is the New Uptrend

The BONK price, trading at 0.00003783, is slightly above the key resistance of 0.00003769. This is the closing price of the previous 2024 high when BONK reached 0.00004800 during the intra-day trading hours.
However, a close above this resistance is unlikely. Secondly, the above-mentioned factors might reduce the bullishness in the market, which could result in a consolidation. BONK could witness sideways movement between 0.00003769 and 0.00002811.

On the other hand, if either of the limits is breached, the neutral-bearish thesis would be invalidated. A breakout may push the BONK price to 0.00004500 and above, while a breakdown may bring the meme coin down to 0.00002200.

Ether Nears $4,000 as Regulatory Developments Spark Market Optimism - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is experiencing a significant rally, with its price surging close to the $4,000 mark. The bullish momentum has been fueled by technical factors, regulatory developments, and increased institutional interest in cryptocurrency.



Why Ethereum is Rallying



The recent price surge can be attributed to several key factors. Technically, Ethereum has broken out from a falling wedge pattern, signaling a bullish reversal and the potential for further price increases. The cryptocurrency has also flipped key resistance areas into support, reinforcing the bullish trend.



On the regulatory front, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved applications for listing eight spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This development is seen as a major positive for the cryptocurrency, as it is expected to attract significant institutional investment, boosting demand and liquidity in the market. The increased trading volume, with a 73.17% increase in the past day, further supports the upward price movement.



The ETF approval is a key factor driving the price surge, as it opens the door for more mainstream adoption and investment in the cryptocurrency.





Ethereum Price Update



As of 2:10 PM UTC, Ethereum is priced at $3,934.71, representing a gain of $126.73 (+3.33%) over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has been trading between $3,856.10 to $3,940.85 throughout the day, showcasing the strong bullish sentiment in the market.



Over the past 52 weeks, Ethereum has traded between $1,880.00 and $4,385.00, highlighting its significant growth potential. With a market capitalization of $1,357.42 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $17.76 billion, Ethereum remains a dominant cryptocurrency market, second only to Bitcoin.







Do you think Ethereum will hit a new ATH in 2024? Let us know in the comments below.

Altcoin Season Soon? Quant Says This Ethereum Pattern Could Suggest So


																A quant has explained how a pattern currently forming in the Ethereum Open Interest could imply the altcoin season is coming “sooner than expected.”
Altcoin Season May Be Approaching Soon Based On Ethereum Pattern
In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has discussed about why an altcoin season may be coming soon for the cryptocurrency sector, based on a trend taking place in a couple of Ethereum and Bitcoin indicators.
The first metric of relevance here is the “Open Interest,” which keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to a given asset currently open on all centralized exchanges.

	Related Reading


When the value of this metric goes up, it means the speculators are opening up fresh positions for the coin right now. On the other hand, a decline implies the users are either closing up their positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform.
Now, here is a chart that shows how the trend in the Open Interest has compared between Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past year:
The value of the metric appears to have been going up for ETH in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant
As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has been moving more or less sideways recently, while at the same time, the metric has registered growth for Ethereum.
This would suggest that ETH has been seeing more appetite for derivatives market contracts than the original cryptocurrency recently. One of the driving factors behind this could be the news cycle related to the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the asset.
In the same chart, the quant has also attached the data for another indicator: the Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR). This metric measures the ratio between the Open Interest and the Exchange Reserve for any asset. The latter is naturally the total amount of the coin that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
The ELR basically provides us with information about the amount of leverage that the average user in the derivatives market is opting for right now. From the graph, it’s visible that this ratio has seen a surge for Ethereum recently but has been showing flat action for Bitcoin.
Thus, it would appear that not only has ETH been seeing more speculative interest than BTC recently, but also these users opening contracts are going for higher risk as they are taking on more leverage.

	Related Reading


The analyst believes that the fact that Ethereum has overtaken Bitcoin in these indicators could be a potential sign that an altcoin season may be approaching soon.
“If Ethereum’s price continues to consolidate in the current range, it’s very possible that the altcoin season will start sooner than expected,” notes the quant. It now remains to be seen how things play out in the market in the near future, given this shift of trend.
ETH Price
After seeing a slowdown earlier, Ethereum has been back on track in the past couple of days as its price has now climbed back above the $3,900 level.

Bitcoin OGs Return: 10-Yr Old BTC Spending At Highest Ever


								On-chain data shows ancient Bitcoin investors have been waking up at a higher rate than ever before during the current cycle so far.
Bitcoin 10+ Year Old Tokens Have Been Seeing Large Movements Recently
As explained by CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno in a post on X, the current Bitcoin cycle has seen more OG investors of the asset awaken than ever before.
The on-chain indicator of interest here is the “10+ Year-old Coins Expending Ratio,” which basically tells us what percentage of coins dormant for 10 years or more saw movement during the past 30 days.

When the value of this metric is high, it means that some old investors on the network have finally been breaking their silence over the past month. Movement of coins so old is generally not a common event, so this kind of trend can be worth looking out for when it develops.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 10+ Year-old Coins Expending Ratio for Bitcoin over the past few years:

The value of the metric appears to have been high recently | Source: CryptoQuant
As is visible in the above graph, the indicator had observed a huge spike back in March. At the peak of this spike, the metric’s value reached 3.7%, which is the highest it has witnessed in the asset’s history so far.
This sharp movement in dormant coins had come as the cryptocurrency’s price had set a new all-time high (ATH). Usually, when such old coins move, it’s for selling purposes. In the case of this spike, especially, profit-taking would appear to be the likely motivation, given the ATH break.
After this peak, the ratio’s value registered a notable decline as the Bitcoin price itself struggled. With the latest recovery that the cryptocurrency has observed, though, the indicator has also bounced back.
At present, the metric’s value stands at 2.5%, which, while lower than the earlier record, is still a high level when compared to the past. Therefore, it appears that ancient whales have continued to wake up at a significant rate over the last few months.

Who would be these investors moving such old coins? Generally, the movement of dormant tokens is associated with the HODLers of the market. Though, when coins age so much so as to fall in the 10+ years bracket, chances become higher that HODLing isn’t why they have been sitting dormant.
Rather, coins of this type are probable to have reached this old age by being ‘lost,’ due to the keys of their wallets being misplaced or their existence simply being forgotten.
Some of the holders selling recently could have indeed been the OGs sitting tight all this time, but it’s very much possible that a lot of these investors would in fact be those who just recently got their hands on the wallets containing these dormant coins.
BTC Price
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $68,500, up over 2% in the last seven days.

Notcoin price soars after beating Bitcoin in vote post NOT Airdrop launch - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Notcoin price surges 33.42%, reaching $0.006884 after community votes favor it over Bitcoin.
New NOT airdrop and earning missions boost user engagement and investment interest.
Notcoin (NOT) is currently on its way back to its Binance listing price

Notcoin (NOT) price has seen a remarkable surge in its price, climbing by over 33.42% in the past 24 hours to reach $0.006884.
This surge has catapulted Notcoin’s market cap to over $707 million, reflecting a 33.38% increase and placing it at number 114 in cryptocurrency market cap ranking.
The NOT price spike follows a favorable community vote where Notcoin was overwhelmingly preferred over Bitcoin, capturing 86.2% of the 29,711 votes cast in a recent social media poll.
Comparing Notcoin and Bitcoin
Notcoin’s development team has been making strategic marketing moves by the team behind the project. The team has drawn comparisons with Bitcoin, highlighting Notcoin’s limited supply, wide distribution, and relative affordability.
They pointed out that the last time Bitcoin had a market cap of around $0.5 billion in 2013, its price was approximately $100. This historical perspective aims to underscore Notcoin’s growth potential.
The NOT Airdrop
Adding to the excitement, Notcoin announced the launch of NOT Airdrop Phase 1 on May 26, 2024. Users can connect their wallets to check their airdrop allocation, adding another layer of engagement and incentive for the community.
This announcement has likely fueled the recent trading frenzy, with 24-hour trading volume soaring by 217.43% to $544.8 million, positioning Notcoin at number 20 in trading volume.
Notcoin’s passive earning feature
Notcoin has also introduced “earning missions,” a new feature that allows users to earn NOT tokens passively by engaging with various partner projects and communities.
Under this feature, users can increase their rewards by staking NOT, with higher levels like Platinum offering the most substantial returns.
In closing, Notcoin team’s comparison to Bitcoin, coupled with active community engagement through polls, airdrops, and innovative earning mechanisms, has created a perfect storm of interest and investment.

A substantial withdrawal of 1,195 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $81.95 million, has been made from Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This transfer to an unknown address has caught the attention of the crypto community as, typically, massive withdrawals from exchanges are perceived as bullish signals for the price. The logic is simple: large investors buy digital assets on liquid platforms like Binance and then move them to private wallets for storage, indicating long-term holding strategies.Diving deeper into the data we can learn that the address "bc1qm34" hosted by the exchange transferred millions of tokens to "1126a" in one tranche. This address is relatively fresh and was activated a month ago by a transfer from the same Binance - for 89,668 BTC, equivalent to $5.62 million.In general, all interactions of this address are related to Binance, as well as the address "bc1q7." That is, funds move only between these three addresses.  A deeper dive through Arkham Intelligence data, however, reveals that the address in question may belong to Ceffu - an institutional digital asset platform offering custody and liquidity solutions. The second address, however, also belongs to the platform and is its custodial address. It now holds 250.219 BTC worth $17.45 million.Source: Arkham IntelligenceThus, it can be stated that there is no special mystery and mysticism in this transfer - just one platform withdraws Bitcoin from the largest, and in fact, liquid, platform for its own needs.Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to trade around $70,000 per coin. Toward the end of the day today, the price of the main cryptocurrency is adding more than 2%. To reach the absolute maximum price of Bitcoin, at $74,000, less than 5.5% remains.

Santiment Draws Attention to This Altcoin: "Whales Have Intense Interest, The Rise May Continue!" - Bitcoin Sistemi


While there is a rise in Ethereum and altcoins due to ETH ETFs, the popular fan token Chiliz (CHZ) is also in the bullish wave.
At this point, as the CHZ price rises to the highest level of the last 6 weeks, investor interest in CHZ also increases.


Analyzing investor interest in Chiliz, Santiment predicted that the increase in the CHZ price could continue.
Stating that the number of whale addresses with at least 10 million CHZ has made large purchases in the last 30 days, Santiment said that the increase in whale and investor interest may also increase the price.






“Chiliz became the most talked about topic after the price increase to the highest levels of the last 6 weeks.
Whale addresses with at least 10 million CHZ tokens added a total of 42.67 million CHZ over the last 30 days.
“CHZ price may continue to rise due to increased investor interest, whale accumulation and volume effect.”

CHZ continues to trade at $0.13 at the time of writing.

MAGA Memecoin Trader Makes $2.7M Profit in 3 Days | Cryptoglobe


                                
In the wild world of memecoins, fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye. One savvy trader, known only by their wallet address “0x303,” recently demonstrated the potential for massive gains in this volatile market by turning a $535,000 investment in the Donald Trump-themed MAGA (TRUMP) memecoin into a staggering $2.7 million profit in just three days.



According to a post on X (formerly Twitter) by blockchain analytics service Lookonchain, the trader purchased six billion MAGA tokens on May 25, spending a total of $537,500. Just ten minutes after the initial investment, the trader sold 1.5 billion MAGA tokens for $744,000 in USDT, realizing a significant profit. As of the time of the post, the trader held 4.5 billion MAGA tokens, worth an estimated $2.51 million.







The MAGA token, which has seen significant price surges following comments by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, has been a topic of much discussion in the crypto community. On May 9, the token experienced a 78% intraday surge, with trading volume rising over 62% to $281 million, after Trump expressed his support for cryptocurrencies during a special event for Trump NFT holders at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

During the event, Trump took questions from the crypto-savvy crowd and expressed his willingness to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin and other tokens. He also criticized the current administration, claiming President Biden and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler are ignorant and hostile towards crypto.







While the MAGA trader’s impressive gains have generated excitement, they have also raised suspicions of insider trading. Many users on X have questioned how someone could confidently invest such a large sum in a memecoin without possessing “extra” knowledge. Lookonchain itself noted last week that “an insider is selling” MAGA memecoins, with the insider having previously spent 5.35 Ether to purchase 33% of the MAGA supply using 22 different wallets.



However, some users have suggested that the transactions may be the result of maximal extractable value (MEV) bot activity rather than insider trading. MEV bots exploit arbitrage opportunities to generate significant profits, and their activity could explain the seemingly prescient trades.

Ethereum Bull Run on Horizon? Top Three Indicators

As the cryptocurrency market teeters on the edge of a new era, Ethereum (ETH) stands at the forefront, with potential signs pointing toward an impending bull run. In a surprise turn of events, the SEC approved the first ETH ETFs last week, resulting in 27% weekly increases for the second-largest cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, ETH was up 2.34% in the previous 24 hours to $3,941, having reached intraday highs of $3,950.In its most recent data debrief, Kaiko, a leading provider of cryptocurrency market data, attempts to answer the question of whether Ethereum is on track for a bull run. The first indicator is the derivatives market, where Ethereum's open interest and funding rates provide insights into trader sentiment. The sentiment around ETH shifted dramatically after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission unexpectedly approved plans for spot ETH ETFs. The rapid turnaround in ETH sentiment was visible in futures markets. Within three days, ETH perpetual futures funding rates rose from their lowest point in over a year to a multi-month high.Open interest reached an all-time high of $11 billion, indicating substantial capital inflows into the industry. The ETH-to-BTC ratio, which measures the two assets' relative performance, increased from 0.044 to 0.055, albeit maintaining below February highs.Another indicator, the ETH Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), reveals that the current ETH surge has been broad-based, with substantial net buying in both U.S. and offshore spot markets since May 21, which suggests wider global optimistic sentiment. Notably, until then, offshore exchanges were registering net selling.The third and perhaps most telling indicator is market depth, which is defined broadly as the market’s ability to sustain relatively large market orders without impacting the price of the asset. According to Kaiko, ETH’s market depth on CEXes is approximately $226 million, still 42% below its pre-FTX average levels, and only 40% is concentrated on U.S. exchanges - compared to around 50% in early 2023.Kaiko noted that the ETH approval has significant ramifications for ETH as an asset, removing some of the regulatory uncertainty that has weighed on ETH's performance over the past year, a positive for ETH, even if inflows disappoint in the immediate term.

                        A presale for Solana’s all-American hillbilly Sealana ($SEAL) token has attracted over $3 million in a month as it leads a new wave of Solana meme coins that has caught the attention of investors worldwide.Sealana’s predecessors, meme coins coins like DogWifHat ($WIF), Bonk ($BONK), Book of Meme ($BOME) and Popcat ($POPCAT), all quickly rose to become top ten meme coins by market capitalization within a year of launch.Another recent viral Solana meme coin ICO – Slothana ($SLOTH) the 420-friendly sloth – raised an eye-watering $15 million in a recent one-month presale.Now it looks like $SEAL is set to be Solana’s next sensation as investors help push the presale across the $3 million in funding threshold.Who is Solana’s New $SEAL, Sealana?
Sealana began life as a reference to South Park’s Gamer Guy, a meme legend known for his unhealthy screen time.Gamer Guy first appeared in South Park’s World of Warcraft episode and has since become a symbol of excessive screen use, from keyboard warriors to couch (or desk) potatoes.There are rumors that the team behind it came out with this year’s viral $SLERF meme coin.Slerf’s launch got off to a rocky start when the project accidentally burned $10 million of tokens allocated to early investors. After seeing Slothana take the sloth concept and go on to out-raise them, the team came back with Sealana.Sealana is one of the projects making a reputation for Solana as the best Layer 1 blockchain for launching high-volume meme coins.Solana currently hosts a digital economy storing over $4.8 billion in total value locked (TVL) across various apps and financial services, with 1.17 million active users transacting daily and over 2,500 monthly active developers.There are also some potentially market-moving events that could add billions to Solana across all its projects.Both Solana and Sealana Look Bullish This Year.
$SEAL and other Solana meme coins could attract some feverish speculation in the coming year when the economic effects of a Bitcoin software update known as “the halving” kicks in.That’s because the halving slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125, effectively halving the rate at which miners sell new BTC onto the open market.Now, with Bitcoin setting new all-time highs this year after the US approval of spot Bitcoin investment products back in January, observers say crypto could much more valuable, thanks to the bottlenecked new supply colliding with increased demand.The past three halvings added significant value to the market well within a year of the update.More market-wide bull runs could prompt further meme coin gold rushes later this year.This time, Solana tokens will be leading the rallies, ahead of their ERC-20 counterparts.The US approval of Ethereum ETFs last Thursday could also be a boon for Solana meme coins like $SEAL in the mid-term.Builders on Solana often boast their network is the number one “Ethereum-killer” and so its tokens often react bullishly to positive Ethereum news.In any case, Sealana will be flapping his fins and wailing $SEAL song ecstatically.Follow the latest developments on his X account.Buy Solana’s laziest $SEAL on the official website here.

Three Reasons Why Nvidia's Stock Price Has Seemingly No Upper Ceiling for Now - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



It has been common to consider Bitcoin’s (BTC) price the greatest long-term bet compared to equities and commodities. However, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) degraded that positioning during the last year. Since the end of 2014, NVDA stock has gained 21,140% value compared to Bitcoin’s 20,130% boost. 



In the last five years, NVDA shares appreciated by 3,043% vs Bitcoin’s moderate 687% gains. Yet, despite Nvidia’s revenue climbing from $11.7 billion in 2019 to $60.9 billion in 2024, investors are wondering if the company’s exceedingly high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 89.92 is sustainable.



After all, is it reasonable for a single chip-making company to hold more value, at $2.619 trillion, than the entire GDP of Russia or Germany’s equity market? There are plenty of semiconductor companies carrying the weight of generative AI, but Nvidia stands out from the crowd.



On the one hand, macroeconomic uncertainty pushed this phenomenon, as Bloomberg’s survey reported that investors increasingly see Big Tech companies as an inflation hedge. On the other hand, Nvidia enjoys unique advantages that make it difficult to gauge its stock’s ceiling.



Primary Tech Proxy



Even before shifting focus to data centers, Nvidia evolved from dominating PC graphics into automotive, networking, and cloud computing. The latter set the stage for the company’s seamless transition into AI via high-performance computing (HPC). 



Nvidia’s GPUs became the default equipment for AI training with a complete stack. This was the exact solution needed when every startup under the sun was hurling to deploy AI-powered products. In turn, this placed Nvidia at the center of AI demand, although many cogs are needed to make AI scale.



From that point on, dozens of companies across different sectors had their value boost. Case in point, Texan electric utility, Vistra (NYSE: VST), gained 168% YTD, while Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) has been boosted by 114% owing to server racks. Likewise, Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG) gained 75%, while Vertiv Holdings (NYSE: VRT) returned 132% to shareholders during the same period for its data center infrastructure.



For investors, the complexity of diversifying into dozens of companies filtered down to Nvidia as the center of the AI exposure, making it the primary tech proxy. Although AMD is closing in with its MI300 series AI chips, Nvidia already cornered the market.





AI’s Ambiguity



Despite text-to-text, text-to-image, and text-to-video generative demonstrations, it is yet to be determined to what extent AI will be disruptive. This gives ambiguity to AI’s total addressable market (TAM), pulling Nvidia into an unknown ceiling, ranging from $1.8 trillion by 2030 to $2.7 trillion by 2032.



The TAM ranges could differ even more as AI research breakthroughs reshape expectations, already hinted with OpenAI’s Sora. In other words, entire industries could be displaced (Hollywood) while new markets are created (robotaxis).



This makes it difficult to pin down AI’s market size. Conversely, Nvidia benefits from AI’s boundless potential to be integrated into every sector. At that point, the price-to-earnings ratio becomes less informative than it used to be. 



Financial Demonstration



In the last four consecutive quarters, Nvidia has beat earnings per share (EPS) forecasts by double-digit surprises. The latest earnings report ending April showed revenue beaten by $1.5 billion, at a quarterly growth of 18% to $26 billion.



But what investors like more than beaten forecasts is the return of shareholder value. Nvidia obliged by increasing dividends from 4 cents to 10 cents per share. Moreover, the newly announced 10-for-1 forward stock split will go a long way in breaking the psychological barrier of perceived affordability.



At present $1,064 per share, the “missing the boat” mentality takes place among potential investors, which the stock split is heading to rectify. Afterward, the dividend payout is set at 1 cent per share. 



In other words, just as Nvidia’s data center revenue grew by 23% quarterly, the company is making all the right moves to maintain its advantage and attract more capital. Nvidia kept up this financial demonstration by raising its Q2 FY25 guidance to $28 billion, beating consensus by $1.2 billion. 







Nvidia’s Current Price Targets



According to 39 analyst inputs pulled by Nasdaq, NVDA stock remains a “strong buy.” The average NVDA price target is $1179.72 vs. the current $1,064 per share. The high ceiling is $1,400, while the low forecast is $870 per share.



Over the last 52 weeks, the average NVDA price has been $586.17, having reached its lowest point of $373.56 per share. 



WSJ’s average NVDA price target is similar, at $1,174.41. The ceiling twelve months ahead is the same at $1,400, while the bottom is lower at $655 per share.

Floki Inu (FLOKI) Rising With Its New Announcement: It Left Ethereum and PEPE Behind! - Bitcoin Sistemi

Popular meme token Floki Inu (FLOKI) introduced its new feature.
According to Coindesk, Floki developers announced that they have launched a Telegram-based trading bot that allows FLOKI holders to trade any token on the BNB Chain network.


FLOKI lead developer B said that the Telegram-based bot will initially be rolled out to a small number of users during the beta testing period to find and resolve any technical bugs.
Stating that they expect general use for all users to be in “mid-June”, B explained that the bot service will later be expanded to Ethereum and Base blockchains.





Developer B added that they expect the service to increase demand for FLOKI tokens, as users will need to hold money to use the bot.

“The bot charges a 1% fee on each transaction and 50% of the fees collected will be used to purchase FLOKI on the open market, adding to buying pressure.”

While FLOKI introduced its new feature, it increased by 22.8% in the last 24 hours. In addition to these developments, FLOKI also broke a new record in OKX.


Record from FLOKI!
Accordingly, FLOKI became the #1 trending token on the leading cryptocurrency exchange OKX, surpassing popular altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), PEPE and BONK.

“After becoming the hottest memecoin on Binance, FLOKI is now the #1 trending token on OKX as well, surpassing ETH, PEPE and BONK!
As we continue to break records and set new standards, Floki is on its way to becoming the world's best-known and most used cryptocurrency.
But we're just getting started; Many more victories await us!”

FLOKI continues to be traded at $0.00027 at the time of writing.

Meet the Crypto Promoter Who Says He Launched Caitlyn Jenner's Solana Meme Coin - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsOlympic gold medal winner Caitlyn Jenner appears to have launched a Pump.fun token, which sent Crypto Twitter into a meltdown. That’s led Decrypt down a rabbit hole to find the person who claims to have deployed the JENNER token on Pump.fun.“We love crypto!” Jenner posted on Twitter followed by a Pump.fun link and a photo with Donald Trump. The JENNER token quickly made it onto decentralized exchange Raydium—a key goal for Pump.fun tokens—and is currently up 24,838% since its creation.“I’m connected with pretty much every celebrity,” Sahil Arora told Decrypt, claiming that he deployed the JENNER token.But questions have been raised on social media over whether he’s helping or hurting the projects he claims to be involved with. Pseudonymous Crypto Twitter sleuths claim to have found a wallet with funds they say is from alleged pump and dumps, which sold $16,000 worth of JENNER shortly after launch.This launch looked much like many celebrity hacks of the past. Many notable figures, such as former U.S. President Barack Obama, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, and even Twitter-owner Elon Musk, have had their accounts compromised. Usually it involves an exploiter using the account to share a dodgy link to a meme coin or wallet address and asking followers to fork over their cash.So Crypto Twitter was understandably wary of the JENNER token.Caitlyn Jenner’s Twitter account went on a campaign to prove that her account hadn’t been hacked, as many believed. First, her manager Sophia Hutchins posted a video on Twitter while the former decathlon athlete said she was out golfing. This was after Jenner posted a video that many believed was a deepfake. But a second video dropped that seemed to silence most doubters.This token debut happened the same day that popular crypto trader GCR was hacked, with the attacker shilling two projects before dumping. And American rapper Rich The Kid posted a Pump.fun link on Twitter before deleting the social media post.Twitter users immediately drew connections between the Rich the Kid’s token and Caitlyn Jenner’s with one wallet being found to have bought and sold a significant amount of each token. One Twitter user believes the wallet made a 98 SOL ($16,000) profit selling Jenner tokens.Rich The Kid then took to Twitter to point a finger at Sahil Arora.“This is the guy in charge of these scams,” the New York rapper said in a now deleted Twitter post. It’s the same man whose Instagram story was posted by Jenner below her original Pump.fun Twitter post, in an effort to convince followers the launch wasn’t a hack. “$7M in volume in an hour. Teamwork,” the Instagram story said.Arora claimed to Decrypt via Instagram DMs that he deployed the JENNER token. He sent a screenshot of a contract with his and Caitlyn Jenner’s alleged signature, but Decrypt hasn’t yet received a comment or confirmation from Jenner’s team.Arora told Decrypt via Instagram DMs that he’s in contact with multiple celebrities. “Sometimes I go to them, most of the time they come and I pick,” Arora said. “It’s the only way to make crypto more mainstream and benefit from the attention economy, it’s the meta they didn’t know they needed.”He claims to have been involved with projects for other celebrities, including actress Lindsay Lohan and recording artists Soulja Boy, Tyga, NeYo, and Liam Payne. But he didn’t share any concrete verification. When questioned why he does this, he named clout, money, and authority as his motives.Arora also said he helped launch the Rich the Kid token, RICH, but has since cut ties with the project. “I ditched him and had a fight,” he said to Decrypt. Rich the Kid did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.Twitter user Roxo believes that Arora is the common denominator between five apparent rug pulls linked to celebrities in the past week. They all connect back to the same wallet that made $16,000 profit on JENNER and was also allegedly posted by the official Caitlyn Jenner Twitter account asking for meme coin donations.Arora has a newly created Telegram group, where he’s been sharing plans to launch tokens with pornstars, artists, and actors. The group had been promoting a token for Ivana Knöll, former Miss Croatia, but the social media post promoting the token has been deleted. This project is among the alleged pump and dumps. The model did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.In response to the claims made by Roxo about the Solana wallet belonging to him, Arora simply said they are “dumb bs.”Jenner’s Twitter account has been more active than usual, promoting the project multiple times an hour. Arora claims his and Jenner’s camps are collaborating to engage with the crypto community. The account has retweeted Pump.fun, replied to Autism Capital, and reposted criticism of Rich the Kid’s token.“This next one is gonna be crazy HUGE and will make JENNER look small,” Arora posted in his Telegram. “Stay tuned for announcements.”Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Donald Trump's $10Million Cryptocurrency Milestone


According to Arkham Intelligence, former US President Donald Trump’s portfolio has reached a new milestone.
His on-chain holdings have exceeded $10 million, primarily due to the surge in value of the $TRUMP coin, now trading at $12.67.
$TRUMP Coin Boosts His Portfolio

As of the latest data, Trump holds $7.34 million worth of $TRUMP coin. The asset’s price recently rose by $1.40, significantly boosting his portfolio.

“His owning $10M crypto is mainly fuelled by the rise in price of the $TRUMP coin, of which Trump currently holds $7.3M,” Arkham noted.

Trump’s diverse cryptocurrency portfolio includes several notable assets. He owns 463.35 ETH, valued at approximately $1.81 million, and 1 million MVP tokens worth $480,590. Additionally, he holds 20 billion CONAN tokens, valued at $312,800. The portfolio also lists two entries for BABYTRUMP: 950,000 coins worth $149,840 and 900,190 coins valued at $7,590. Trump also owns 53,1728 TRUMP coins worth $13.540 and 11,989 USDC worth $11,990.

The politician’s engagement with cryptocurrency extends beyond personal investments. Recently, he made several pro-crypto statements, highlighting that the US must lead in this growing sector. Moreover, Trump’s campaign has started accepting crypto donations in various digital assets, including Bitcoin.


“I am very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies. Our country must be the leader in the field. There is no second place,” Trump stated.

This support for the crypto industry sharply contrasts with President Joe Biden’s administration, which he accuses of wanting to stifle the industry. At the Libertarian Party’s National Convention in Washington, Trump pledged to protect the right to self-custody crypto assets and prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). 

“I will support the right to self-custody. I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your bitcoin,” Trump added.

Trump’s pro-crypto stance is boosting his election prospects. According to Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction platform, he has a 56% chance of winning, compared to Biden’s 38%. His campaign’s acceptance of digital asset donations marks a significant move, in stark contrast to the current administration’s approach to cryptocurrency.

Can PEPE Flip MATIC After Outperforming UNI and LTC?


PEPE price is making waves with its recent rally as meme coins dominate the crypto market.
However, the altcoin’s rise might halt now as the investors opt to book profits, leaving some records unbroken.
PEPE May Not Overtake MATIC

PEPE’s price rally resulted in the meme coin’s market capitalization nearly reaching $7 billion. This is the effect of the altcoin’s 80% rise in the past week, which made Pepe one of the top 20 cryptocurrencies.
In doing so, the meme coin outperformed Litecoin (LTC) and Uniswap (UNI) regarding market cap. At one point during the intra-day trading high, even Polygon (MATIC) was left behind, but PEPE declined to fall below it.
If the meme coin market cap crosses the $7.2 billion mark, Polygon would again lose its spot to PEPE. However, the chances are unlikely since investors are realizing profits.

As the price shot up, so did the investors’ profits considerably, which triggered selling to secure gains. The realized profits across the network rose to a two-month high.

PEPE holders tend to sell during sudden rallies, which is also the case at the moment. Since investors are expecting a price rise, this could increase as well. This shows that profit-taking could continue, and in return, the price would take a hit.
PEPE Price Prediction: All-Time High Stops Here
PEPE price marked a new all-time high of $0.00001725 during the intra-day trading hours on Monday. Over the past week, the meme coin has registered an 80% rally, which brought the altcoin up from $0.00001000 to close to $0.00002000.

However, given that profit-taking is surging, the rally may stop here. As a result, the meme coin could fall back to $0.00001500. The altcoin will likely hold above the support of $0.00001430, though.

But if the rise continues, the cryptocurrency could push through the resistance of $0.00001725. This would invalidate the bearish thesis and help PEPE form a new all-time high.

                        Celebrities Caitlyn Jenner and Rich The Kid began boosting namesake crypto memecoins on their respective X accounts over Memorial Day weekend, prompting hacking concerns from X users.In a late Sunday X post, reality TV star and Olympic athlete Caitlyn Jenner announced she launched her own cryptocurrency token, JENNER, using Solana memecoin creator pump.fun.As of Monday morning, JENNER had reached a market capitalization of $37 million.Keeping Up With Caitlyn Jenner’s Crypto Token
“I’m bullish as ever on crypto! We cannot rely simply on govt backed currencies- esp today with rampant inflation and massive govt spending,” Jenner said. “And ofc that doesn’t just include $Jenner but it doesn’t hurt adding to a well balanced portfolio!”Following hacking concerns, Jenner and her manager, Sophia Hutchins, posted videos on her X account confirming the memecoin’s validity.“Her account has not been hacked,” said Hutchins, adding that the cryptocurrency is “performing extraordinarily well.”“Yes, this is for real,” Jenner said. “Get involved. It’s going to be very good. I’m very excited about it.”Not everyone was convinced of the token’s legitimacy, however, with several X users suggesting the videos could be deepfakes.Rich The Kid At Center Of Alleged Crypto Scam
In now-deleted X posts, rapper Rich The Kid similarly posted a pump.fun link advertising his new memecoin, RICH.In a video posted Monday morning, Roger alleged his X page had been hacked without his knowledge, resulting in the promotion of RICH.Roger mentioned this was done by an individual named “Sahil,” though no last name was given. A user named @cryptoRoxo alleged this may be Sahil Arora, who reportedly served as a middleman for both Roger and Jenner’s crypto projects.Celebrities have not been shy about trying their hand at cryptocurrency, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charging high-profile figures such as Lindsay Lohan, Floyd Mayweather, Jake Paul, and Lil Yachty for illegally promoting crypto. By Monday morning, Jenner had taken to X to warn investors of potential losses regarding her cryptocurrencies.“Not all cryptocurrencies, tokens, coins, or other crypto assets, are the correct investment for all individuals,” Jenner wrote. “There is always a risk associated with any investment – including the loss of value.”Meanwhile, RTK announced on X that a new cryptocurrency token separate from Sahil would launch by Monday night.While it is currently unclear exactly who is behind the celebrities’ crypto promotion, both Jenner and Roger could face serious legal consequences should the memecoins prove to be scams.

A member of the Dogecoin and X teams known as “DogeDesigner” (@cb_doge) has made an important statement to the DOGE army about exactly which cryptocurrencies are accepted by Elon Musk’s leading company Tesla, the electric car maker.Among frequent cases of scammers and rumor-makers spreading misleading data about Tesla giant and crypto, @cb_doge issued a reminder that Tesla accepts payments in just one cryptocurrency – Dogecoin. The DOGE community took in this announcement very positively. One X user tweeted that it is time for Elon Musk “to replenish the store for us with some goodies,” which can be bought with Dogecoin.In January 2022, Elon Musk announced that Tesla started accepting DOGE as an experiment. Since then, users have been able to buy Tesla merch in the company’s online store using the original meme cryptocurrency. Among the merchandise being sold for DOGE are the “Giga Texas” belt buckle and a Tesla Cyberwhistle.A few months later, SpaceX did likewise and began selling its merchandise for DOGE. In May this year, Dogecoin was officially added as a payment option to Tesla’s website.During a recent visit of Berlin Gigafactory, Musk confirmed that at some point Tesla is likely to start selling e-cars for DOGE.Several times this year, Musk confirmed that neither X, nor Tesla nor any of the companies run by Musk is going to release a native cryptocurrency. This followed multiple misleading rumors about X planning to roll out an “X coin.”

$5 XRP Price Moonshot Looms As Ripple CEO Casts Bold Vision for XRP's Global Dominance ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The Ripple community and other executives have displayed optimism about Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. Notably, XRP supporters are convinced that XRP’s intrinsic value could help the token morph into a global in-demand asset and balloon to the much coveted $5 price.



Strengthening the community’s sentiments, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made a remarkable revelation. In a recent post shared to X, formerly Twitter, the Ripple boss revealed that he had hung an image carrying the words “laugh now, but one-day XRP will power the world!” on a wall in his home.



Explaining that the current market condition prompted him to share the image, he wrote the following;



“For whatever reason, I’ve been hanging on to this one for a while.. Prob my all-time favorite from the XRP community. It’s been hanging on a wall in my house… but with all this momentum in the market, I wanted to share it!!” 



Like many other crypto executives, Garlinghouse seems excited about the recent developments recorded in the cryptocurrency space. Prior to his post on XRP, the crypto proponent expressed excitement about the recent approval of an Ethereum ETF.

&nbsp



“Big momentum in crypto this week – ETH ETF passed and bipartisan support on crypto legislation…Feels like hell has frozen over!!” He wrote. 







The future for XRP: bullish or bearish?



Future expectations for XRP being bullish or bearish largely depend on a handful of factors, with one of the notable ones being the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC.



Recall that the SEC requests $2 billion in penalties for Ripple’s alleged sale of unregistered securities. A loss for Ripple could affect the market’s sentiments on affiliated assets like XRP. However, victory for Ripple could also translate to victory for XRP, as sentiments will likely become even more positive.



Meanwhile, the recent approval of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21 bill)—a major crypto legislation cleared earlier in the week—could introduce more twists and turns for Ripple, XRP, and the SEC.



At report time, XRP and other leading altcoins are recording a little over 2% daily gains. Notably, the global cryptocurrency market cap has surged by 2.46%, bringing the total market cap to $2.63 trillion. With daily, weekly, and monthly losses currently totaling 6.93%, XRP is trading at a press time price of $0.53.

AI Arms Race: China's $47 Billion Semiconductor Fund, Musk's xAI Secures Funding - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



China’s state-owned “Big Fund” spearheaded the effort to bolster the country’s chip-making capabilities amidst intensifying technology competition with the United States. The third phase of the fund doubled the amounts raised in previous years raising over $47 billion, with the Chinese Ministry of Finance being the largest investor.



This move shows China’s determination to achieve self-sufficiency in critical technologies like semiconductors as U.S. export controls exert pressure on its tech industry. The fund’s investments will target the semiconductor supply chain, focusing on manufacturing and advanced chip technologies.



xAI Raises $6 Billion with a Pre-Money Valuation of $18 Billion



Meanwhile, xAI, the AI venture backed by Elon Musk, attracted investments from prominent players such as Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Sequoia Capital, Fidelity, Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, and Kingdom Holding. The $6 billion funding round, one of the largest in the AI sector, gives xAI a pre-money valuation of $18 billion.



The company, which emerged from Musk’s social network, X, aims to compete with established AI giants like OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG). The funds will bring xAI’s products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate research and development.



xAI has already made progress with its chatbot, Grok, which is available to Premium+ users on X, with plans to expand its user base in the future. Despite challenges in developing “truthful” AI systems, as evidenced by reports of Grok generating misleading information, xAI’s decision to open-source the Grok model demonstrates its commitment to transparency and collaboration within the AI community.









Do you think xAI can compete with OpenAI over the coming years? Let us know in the comments below.

Shiba Inu Barrels Toward Another Milestone In Major Metric, Price Shows No Signs Of Life | Bitcoinist.com


								The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is set to record another milestone, with the layer-2 network Shibarium approaching 5 million blocks. Despite this development, Shiba Inu’s price has remained tepid for a while now, which is undoubtedly worrisome for members of the SHIB community. 
Shibarium About To Hit 5 Million Blocks
Data from the Shibariumscan shows that the total number of blocks on the Shibarium network is over 4.9 million, nearing the 5 million mark. These blocks contain records of all the transactions processed on the network. Such a milestone is significant as it highlights how far the Shibarium has come. 

However, Shiba Inu’s price hasn’t reacted positively to this development. The meme coin is currently experiencing a downward trend, which is believed to be due to other on-chain metrics that paint a bearish outlook for it. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that SHIB’s trading volume is down over 20% in the last 24 hours, suggesting a lack of interest in the meme coin among investors. 
Shiba Inu’s burn rate is also down over 26% in the last seven days, which is significant given how these token burns have contributed to price surges for the meme coin in the past. Interestingly, the drop in the burn rate has been partly thanks to the declining daily transactions on the Shibarium network. 
Daily transactions on the layer-2 network have been at their lowest for some time now, with Shibarium only recording a daily transaction above 20,000 once this month. The decline in Shibarium’s total value locked (TVL) also suggests a lack of confidence among investors in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Data from DeFiLlama shows that Shibarium’s TVL currently stands at $2.2 million, down from its peak of $3.9 million in March this year. 
Shiba Inu On-chain Metrics Paint A Bullish Picture
Some other on-chain metrics paint a bullish picture for Shiba Inu and suggest its recent decline is simply a healthy retracement. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Shiba Inu has recently recorded considerable Net Network Growth, meaning more users are adopting the meme coin. 
Meanwhile, Data from IntoTheBlock also shows that Shiba Inu whales are still betting heavily on the meme coin, with almost a 4% increase in Large transactions these past few days. This is a very positive development for Shuba Inu since such large transactions could trigger a price recovery for the meme coin.  

Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s fundamentals are strong, with lead developer Shytoshi Kusama recently raising the possibility of a Shiba Inu Spot ETF. Coinbase International Exchange also recently announced that it will add support for Shiba Inu perpetual futures on its platform. Trading will officially begin on May 30th. 
At the time of writing, SHIBis trading at around $0.00002444, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Pyth Price Feeds and Entropy launch on Sei V2, enhancing scalability


    Pyth Network, a financial data oracle network, has announced the launch of Pyth Price Feeds and Entropy on Sei V2, as per the information shared with Finbold on May 27.



This advancement allows developers on Sei V2, the first parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) designed to offer developers enhanced flexibility and scalability, to access over 500 real-time price feeds for digital and other major asset classes, as well as a secure and reliable source of on-chain random number generation.



Real-time Pyth data on Sei V2



The Pyth Network’s pull oracle for price feeds provides Sei users with permissionless access to low-latency price updates on-chain, which is crucial for securing next-generation apps in decentralized finance (DeFi). 







Additionally, Entropy enables Sei V2 developers to design unpredictable outcomes for Web3 applications, including gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and prediction markets.



Sei V2 is full of features aimed at boosting blockchain performance and enhancing the developer experience. 



The interoperable EVM allows seamless deployment of existing Ethereum (ETH) applications without modifications, offering a remarkable 100x performance improvement and continued support for CosmWasm. 



The importance of on-chain randomness in DeFi



The Pyth pull oracle architecture allows apps to request price updates from the Pythnet appchain as needed.



This ensures the Sei ecosystem has access to high-frequency market data and the latest price updates in a gas-efficient manner. 



Moreover, Pyth Entropy enhances Sei’s capability to support a wider array of decentralized applications, improving user experience and trust. 



On-chain randomness is critical for applications relying on unpredictability, such as gaming, lotteries, and any protocol requiring fair distribution processes.



Wrapping up



By incentivizing major exchanges, market makers, and trading firms to contribute their proprietary data, Pyth ensures high-quality price information is aggregated on-chain for use in smart contracts. 



Decentralized applications can request or pull these price updates as needed.



With over $5 billion in total value locked (TVL), Pyth supports more than 350 protocols and offers over 500 real-time data feeds, including crypto, equities, ETFs, Forex pairs, and commodities.

The price surged from around $40,000 to over $70,000, highlighting persistent buying interest and strong bullish momentum.Corrections: Several corrections are visible on the chart, characterized by sharp declines. However, these corrections were followed by swift recoveries, indicating the resilience of the uptrend.



Support and Resistance Levels:



Support Levels: The chart identifies key support levels around $60,000 and $52,000. These levels have acted as strong buy zones, where the price rebounded after facing corrections.Resistance Levels: The primary resistance level is currently at $70,000.

Potential Scenarios



Bullish Scenario:

This scenario would indicate strong continued interest from buyers and could set the stage for new all-time highs.



Bearish Scenario:



Failure to Break $70,000: If Bitcoin fails to break above $70,000, it could result in a pullback to the nearest support levels around $68,000 or $60,000.Extended Correction: A more significant correction could drive the price back to around $52,000, the next major support level.



Conclusion



The overall sentiment derived from the chart is bullish, with Bitcoin currently testing the $70,000 resistance level. The observed trend demonstrates strong bullish momentum, reinforced by multiple support levels that provide a cushion against potential downward movements. Traders and investors should closely monitor Bitcoin’s behavior around the $70,000 mark to anticipate future price action.



If Bitcoin manages to break and sustain above this key resistance level, it could pave the way for further upward movement, potentially targeting $75,000 or higher. Conversely, a failure to break $70,000 might lead to a pullback, with $68,000 and $60,000 serving as crucial support levels to watch.

Donald Trump Promises To Protect the Future of Bitcoin and Crypto in the United States, Says He Supports Right to Self-Custody - The Daily Hodl


								Former President Donald Trump is continuing to express his support for the crypto industry, saying that he will protect the right of 50 million Americans to self-custody digital assets.
Speaking to his supporters in Washington D.C., the 2024 Republican candidate says that he’s going to “crush” the Biden Administration’s anti-crypto stance.










Trump goes on to say he will keep Americans’ crypto safe from Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren, known for drafting anti-crypto legislation, as well as never allow the government to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC).
“I will also stop Joe Biden’s crusade to crush crypto, we’re going to stop it. I will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of Bitcoin will be made in the USA, not driven overseas. 
I will support the right to self-custody to the nation’s 50 million crypto holders. I say this with your vote. I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your Bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.” 
Earlier this month, Trump went after the crypto vote by announcing that he’s “fine” with digital assets, simultaneously calling out Democrats and Gary Gensler, the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying they are anti-crypto.
Later on, he announced that his campaign would be accepting crypto donations in the forms of popular virtual currencies such as BTC, Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).

JPMorgan questions SEC's crypto ETF expansion plans: The Block


JPMorgan has voiced skepticism about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) readiness to approve more cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), The Block reported.



The SEC last week approved spot Ethereum ETFs, which had initially fueled optimism among investors and analysts.



JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director and global market strategist, said that the regulator views most cryptocurrencies as securities, casting doubts in additional crypto ETF approvals.



“The decision by the SEC to approve ETH ETFs is already stretched given the ambiguity about whether Ethereum should be classified as security or not,” Panigirtzoglou told The Block. 

	
	
	
	


“We don’t think the SEC would go even further by approving Solana or other token ETFs given the SEC has stronger (relative to Ethereum) opinion that tokens outside bitcoin and Ethereum should be classified as securities.”



The importance of this development lies in its potential influence on the cryptocurrency market, as ETF approvals are often linked to increased institutional investment and market stability.



Additionally, the SEC’s decisions are indicative of the changing regulatory environment for digital assets.



In the wake of the SEC’s approval Ethereum ETFs, the crypto market has experienced a bullish trend, with Solana’s value approaching US$170. 

	
	
	

	


Financial institutions like Standard Chartered have predicted that the SEC’s recent actions could lead to further ETF approvals, possibly for Solana and XRP, by 2025.



Despite JPMorgan’s caution, the market has reacted positively to the SEC’s decision on Ethereum ETFs, with U.S. Bitcoin ETFs witnessing favorable inflows, reflecting a boost in investor confidence. 



The SEC’s go-ahead for 19b-4 forms for eight Ethereum ETF applicants has laid the groundwork for trading to begin soon, subject to the SEC’s final approval of S-1 registrations.

This Dog Coin Is Up 53% And 'Still In Ripper Mode'... But It's Not Dogecoin - Benzinga

In a recent tweet, prominent crypto trader Cold Blooded Shiller highlighted the strong recent performance of Solana SOL/USD meme coin Bonk BONK/USD.What Happened: Cold Blooded Shiller pointed out BONK’s momentum, writing it is “still in ripper mode and compounding the argument of not getting frozen out.” Cold Blooded Shiller stressed the importance of reacting to high-timeframe signals even when lower-timeframe prices have already surged in a day. Monday, according to him, “was the breakout of resistance, which is actually an independent signal to take position.”Cold Blooded Shiller noted that ignoring opportunities such could lead to missed profits. Traders navigating such scenarios should look to not “get frozen out” but acknowledge the opportunity, even if it means entering with a reduced position size to ensure participation.Read Also: Altcoins ‘Entering Textbook Markup’ As Crypto Analyst Predicts Major RallyWhy It Matters: Cold Blooded Shiller's analysis highlighted the significance of observing high-timeframe signals, especially during substantial market moves. Traders might often hesitate to enter positions when they see rapid gains on an intraday level, fearing they might be late to the party.BONK's performance reinforces the concept, as the meme coin is up 10% on the day and 53% on the week. “BONK was always going to blow,” the trader wrote. At the time of writing, BONK is trading around $0.00003902.In doing so, BONK has outperformed its canine rivals Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, which are up 13.3% and 7.4% on the week, respectively.

Overpriced Pizza (OVERPIZZ) to Skyrocket 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Overpriced Pizza (OVERPIZZ) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Overpriced Pizza (OVERPIZZ), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because OVERPIZZ has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Overpriced Pizza can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Overpriced Pizza could become the next viral memecoin.



Overpriced Pizza launched with over $4,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Overpriced Pizza on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Overpriced Pizza by entering its contract address – G443b8EoLKhAvoyMErW9Tqum2pR4Z57EPMQzVJMKS3Sf – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like OVERPIZZ.

Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Overcome Resistance and Profit Selling?


While all the major meme coins in the crypto market noted highs in the past day, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price failed to mark any rally.
This lack of bullishness will likely continue going forward since SHIB holders are keen on securing profits.
Shiba Inu Faces a Barrier

Shiba Inu’s price will rise when it manages to escape consolidation, and for the same, the meme coin would need to cross this barrier first. About 60.14 trillion SHIB worth more than $1.54 billion sits in the path of this breakout.
According to Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) this supply was bought between $0.00002500 and $0.00003000. In order for Shiba Inu investors to witness these gains, the meme coin would need to chart a 19% rise from the trading price. This would require a massive boost from both investors and broader market cues.

However, both are missing at the moment.

SHIB holders are uncertain of a rise, which is evident in their behavior. The investors are high on selling their holdings to secure whatever gains they can. Upon observing the active addresses by profitability, one can note that about 20% of all investors conducting transactions on the network are in profit.

This participation is primarily done with the intention of booking profits, which is not a positive sign for the Shiba Inu price. As a result, the meme coin could likely fail the breakout and continue consolidation.
SHIB Price Prediction: No Rise on the Cards
For the last month, Shiba Inu’s price has been stuck between the resistance and support of $0.00002584 and $0.00002267. Both price points have been broken through multiple times, but SHIB has not yet secured a move in either direction.

Thus, going forward, the meme coin will likely fall down to test the support of $0.00002267 and rise back to remain consolidated within the aforementioned range.

On the other hand, a breakdown or a breakout will invalidate the consolidation thesis. An upward move will bring SHIB to $0.00002835, while a decline could send the meme coin to $0.00002093.

Bitcoin Halving Not Priced In Despite Hitting New Lifetime Highs, Top Analyst Asserts - BTC To $100,000? ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
The much-anticipated Bitcoin halving that happened on April 19 has not yet resulted in the expected price appreciation stemming from the subsequent supply crunch.



While the price of BTC has remained relatively stable below $70,000, pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital believes new all-time highs are possible based on the flagship crypto’s history of solid outperformance after the supply-halving event.



Bitcoin’s Jump To New ATH ‘Only A Matter Of Time’



In a recent update, analyst Rekt Capital delved into whether investors should expect a fresh all-time high or if the halving event is already priced in.



The pundit noted that the quadrennial Bitcoin halving has historically been associated with bull runs, with the premier crypto registering a parabolic upsurge and a price peak in the months after the event.



“The Bitcoin halving is not priced in. Historically, whenever we’ve seen a halving, we’ve seen phenomenal upside at this point in the cycle, where already we’ve seen new all-time highs but we’ve been consolidating for a long time, and so breaking to new all-time highs once again is only a matter of time,” Rekt Capital posited.

&nbsp



Expectations of reduced supply and skyrocketing demand have previously resulted in exponential price increases and bullish market sentiment. However, Rekt Capital does not expect Bitcoin to immediately rocket to $400,000 as it is not on the logarithmic scale.



BTC tends to consolidate for over 150 days before finally breaking out in an explosive rally that lasts several months. According to popular traders, the Bitcoin market is currently in a reaccumulation phase.



“We’re currently in a re-accumulation period again, so the fact that we’re re-accumulating here, the longer, the better, the more we pause and capture a breather here will be better for the uptrend that inevitably ensues afterward,” he explained.



Rekt Capital also recently observed that Bitcoin has officially escaped the post-halving danger zone, which has historically been associated with downside volatility during previous cycles. However, he doesn’t expect Bitcoin to scale new historical levels until later this year.



BTC price could be on track for the coveted $100,000 milestone, particularly after breaking past its 2021 all-time high before the halving. Meanwhile, heightened demand from traditional finance could see Bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,737 soon.



At the time of publication, Bitcoin was at $70,538, a 2.42% rise on the day.

SHIB Insider Issues Crucial TREAT Warning, Ripple CTO Sheds Light on Tokenization, Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Surprises With Dogecoin Message: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Check out the top three news stories over the past weekend presented to you by U.Today.Shiba Inu insider shares crucial message with SHIB communityLast weekend, the Shiba Inu community received yet another reminder to stay cautious as the crypto market is currently experiencing an increase in fraudulent activity. Lucie, the project's marketing lead, took to social media to reiterate an important message regarding Shibarium ecosystem token TREAT. In her X post, Lucie warned all SHIB enthusiasts that TREAT has not been launched yet, warning them to beware of "many impostors targeting #SHIBArmy." Concluding the message, the marketing lead urged those interested in the Shiba Inu project to follow only its legitimate X accounts to get the right information and avoid confusion. As a reminder, TREAT is a reward token with multiple purposes, with one of them being providing liquidity for the SHI stablecoin.Ripple CTO demystifies tokenization, stuns XRP communityRipple fintech giant has recently posted a new clip in the "Crypto In One Minute" on its official X handle. The clip features the company's CTO David Schwartz, explaining how tokenization can improve efficiency. Schwartz started the explanation with a quote allegedly belonging to Albert Einstein: "If someone can’t explain something in 60 seconds, they probably don’t understand it," showing that real understanding does not need a full minute. The CTO stated that tokenization can improve efficiency by eliminating some of the problems with asset transfer and ownership. This can be done with the use of digital distributed ledgers, which will help track the ownership of assets. "That also simplifies things like if you want to borrow against an asset, use the asset for collateral, the person who's providing the loan can more easily determine that you own the asset and they can make sure that you aren't borrowing from a number of different ledgers," clarified Schwartz, boasting that his explanation did not even take a minute.Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin surprises with Dogecoin messageLast week the crypto community, and members of the DOGE army in particular, were startled by sad news; Kabosu (affectionately known as "Kabochan"), the dog that became the face of the Dogecoin meme cryptocurrency, passed away. Atsuko Sato, the owner of Kabosu, wrote in an X post that her beloved pet died peacefully in her sleep. Many prominent figures in the crypto industry reacted to the passing of Dogecoin's symbol, and Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin was no exception. Buterin responded to Atsuko Sato's with a simple yet poignant message: "Rest in Peace Kabochan." The Dogecoin Foundation also paid its respects, posting on X, "Rest in peace, dear Kabosu, beloved Doge. You were very much wow." As a reminder, the meme with Kabosu’s iconic photo went viral in 2010. Three years later, the Dogecoin asset was created, with Kabosu becoming its mascot.

ZachXBT reveals GCR account hack tied to Solana meme coin team - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The May 26 X account hack of the notorious trader known as GCR might be tied to the team behind the meme coin CAT deployed on Solana, shared the on-chain sleuth ZachXBT this Monday. According to ZachXBT, minutes before the hack, an address tied to CAT’s team opened long positions in the tokens ORDI and ETHFI using $2.3 million and $1 million, respectively. The funds were obtained through an alleged token launch manipulation, where CAT’s team was able to snipe their token on May 24 and hold 63% of the supply. The amount was then sold for nearly $5 million, and the profit was transferred to multiple wallets, according to the on-chain sleuth.The user identified as Lookonchain also detected this movement through on-chain analysis and attributed it to a likely insider from the CAT’s team.One of the wallets moved 4,800 SOL to the crypto exchange KuCoin while sending the same SOL amount with $1,4 million in USD Coin (USDC) to MEXC. “Using a timing analysis I found withdrawals from the two exchanges on Ethereum & Arbitrum shortly after the Solana deposits in similar amounts,” added ZachXBT.Therefore, the hackers opened their long position on ORDI and used GCR’s account to post about the token, pumping its price and profiting nearly $34,000. Before the hackers could make another trade, GCR informed on X that his account was compromised and no information from there should be trusted.Nevertheless, the hackers opened a ETHFI long position on Hyperliquid a few hours later, losing $3,500 in the process. This journey ended in a little over $30,000 of net profits for the hackers.Yet, ZachXBT explained to one of his followers that positions on centralized exchanges could be opened as well, elevating the profit for the team. He also suggested that the team behind CAT could be previous perpetrators of SIM Swap scams, consisting of hackers gaining access to SIM chips from victims to breach bank accounts and crypto wallets.“Meme coins are just as manipulated if not more than VC coins (just trust me bro dev vs smart contract locked tokens),” concluded the on-chain sleuth.

How Tokenization Enhances Professional Career Growth


Tokenization has emerged as a groundbreaking way to revolutionize careers. By bringing professional reputations on-chain, individuals can gain greater visibility and access to opportunities. 
There are numerous benefits of tokenizing one’s professional career to transform how work and talent are viewed.
Tokenization to Fund Professional Growth
Tokenization offers a unique financial advantage. Consider the example of Alex Masmej, who launched his $ALEX token to fund his move to San Francisco. This initiative, akin to a “career Kickstarter,” provided Masmej with the necessary resources while offering perks to his token holders. 

Tokenizing a career allows individuals to raise funds for their professional endeavors, from starting a business to acquiring new skills, without relying on traditional financial institutions.
Another example of tokenization comes from popular YouTuber Davinci Jeremie. He developed the DJ15 token to raise funds for the DavinciJ15 YouTube channel and enhance the quality and content presented to its subscribers. The token aims to provide greater flexibility in developing content for the crypto community across various platforms, including YouTube, Twitter, and Twitch, where DavinciJ15’s content can be found.

“One important thing this token is not a security. This token is just this social token, which means that you’re only going to be supporting my YouTube channel and other channels where I broadcast the streams. The money will be going 100% into that. Any money raised will be 100% going into actually improving the quality of the channel,” Jeremie explained. 

These personal tokens also create a deeper emotional connection between creators and their supporters. For instance, distributing limited edition “thank you” NFTs to mentors can be a meaningful gesture. This emotional bond fosters loyalty and encourages a supportive community around the individual’s professional journey.

The rise of the creator economy has seen professionals form token-gated communities where fans and supporters can interact more closely. Platforms like Friend.Tech exemplify this trend, providing exclusive access and fostering a sense of belonging among token holders. Such communities enhance networking opportunities and provide valuable support systems for career growth.
Why Tokenizing One’s Career Matters
Tokenization extends beyond financial and social aspects, offering significant benefits in knowledge sharing. Professionals can monetize their knowledge by tokenizing their expertise and contributing to a decentralized learning ecosystem.
Pedro Oliveira, CEO of Talent Protocol, told BeInCrypto about the importance of making reputation data more visible and accessible. He believes that Web3 can lead to fairer and more efficient distribution of opportunities. Tokenizing one’s career involves showcasing skills and achievements transparently, enabling a fairer evaluation by potential employers or collaborators.

“Tokenization can equalize opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds, moving away from traditional success biases. Traditional career success metrics often create an unequal opportunity landscape. For instance, a person born in New York is statistically more likely to have a successful career than someone from a remote village. Tokenization brings reputation on-chain, enhancing visibility for global talent and maximizing the labor market’s collective potential,” Oliveira said. 

The future of work, as envisioned by Oliveira, is one of diverse engagement free from organizational “middlemen.” Tokenization facilitates direct collaboration and information exchange without centralized governance, breaking down traditional professional hierarchies. This shift significantly enhances labor market efficiency, allowing talent to thrive in a more equitable environment.

Several compelling examples highlight the potential of career tokenization. Athletes, for instance, increasingly use tokenization to share revenues from future awards. Artists and influencers create on-chain engagements with their fans, offering exclusive content to token holders. These success stories demonstrate the versatility and broad appeal of tokenization across various sectors.

By tokenizing skills, individuals set transparent, on-chain rules from the outset, fostering a governance model that benefits all involved parties. Rather than a zero-sum game, tokenization enables the development of collaborative, multiplayer career paths.

“These cases and trends indicate a growing recognition of tokenization as a valuable tool for career development across various sectors. The versatility of tokenization, from funding and community building to knowledge sharing, points to a broader shift in how personal and professional growth is approached in the digital age,” Oliveira concluded. 

Embracing this innovative approach can lead to a more equitable and efficient labor market, benefiting individuals and the broader economy. Therefore, individuals can gain financial support by leveraging blockchain technology to build strong communities, share knowledge, and enhance their reputations.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 28,900% Rally To $154 For XRP Price, Here’s When


																Crypto analyst CryptoBull recently highlighted a bullish pattern that could send the XRP price to three figures. However, the analyst failed to give an exact timeline for when this massive rally would occur. 
XRP Price To Hit $154
CryptoBull mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that that chart shows that XRP will rise to $154. The analyst highlighted an ascending broadening wedge, which he expects XRP to break out from as it makes this parabolic move to the upside. To confirm his bullish sentiment, CryptoBull also reposted the analysis of two other crypto analysts who suggested that XRP could experience a price breakout soon.

Source: X
 
One of these analysts is Javon Marks, who recently mentioned that something is brewing for XRP. He shared a chart that highlighted a bullish divergence that had formed for XRP. Marks had previously predicted that XRP could rise to as high as $200. He claimed that XRP “may be more than poised” to rise to this price level based on his Full Logarithmic follow-through analysis
Marks also alluded to the 2017 bull run, when XRP saw a price increase of over 108,000%, revealing that XRP has since set up and broken out of its “largest resisting structure ever.” Crypto analyst CasiTrades is the second analyst whose analysis CryptoBull reposted. CasiTrades predicts that XRP can rise to as high as $13, seeing how it has consolidated for six years. She also raised the possibility of XRP rising to as high as $80 when it breaks out of the consolidation triangle.
Crypto analyst JackTheRippler also predicted that XRP could rise as high as $100 soon enough. However, unlike CryptoBull, the crypto analyst didn’t allude to the charts but singled out the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case against Ripple as the factor that will drive XRP’s price to such heights. He claimed XRP will reach $100 when the lawsuit ends.  
An XRP Breakout Is Imminent
Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto suggested in a recent X post that a breakout was imminent for XRP. He highlighted the “White Triangle” breakout, which he said is “aligning perfectly” with previous charts and the Fib 0.0702 to 0.786 levels. He claimed the measured move for XRP is projected to be between $1.2 and $1.5.

	Related Reading


However, what is most important for XRP is breaking out from the $0.70 to $0.75 price range, which Egrag labeled as critical breakout points. The crypto analyst sounded confident that XRP will soon experience this upward trend, stating that the token “is poised to break out.” He added that a “mega run for XRP is on the horizon,” although the retest of the breakout might be on the cards. 
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.53, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Normie crypto plummets 90%: What happened and what’s next? - AMBCrypto



NORMIE has declined by around 90%.
Developers have agreed to a relaunch.

Normie crypto recently experienced a significant exploit that caused the value of its token and market cap to plummet dramatically. 
“Normie” is a term referring to normal people, and it may have lived up to its name. Investors found themselves facing losses, turning them into “normal people” in terms of their holdings.
Hackers strike Normie crypto
On 26th May, holders of Normie crypto [NORMIE] witnessed a devastating decline in the value of their holdings within minutes. 
The cause of this decline was an attack orchestrated by an unidentified hacker. The hacker executed a flash loan attack, exploiting a loophole in NORMIE’s contract tax mechanism. 
This enabled them to borrow a significant amount without providing collateral. They went further to manipulate the token’s supply and repay the loan in the same transaction.
The exploiter managed to acquire 5 million tokens, granting themselves the necessary permissions, and then utilized a flash loan to continuously fill up the contract account until they could drain it. 
Although the token was originally intended to have a supply of 1 billion, the hackers exploited a tax function in the token’s contract to issue more tokens than intended.
Following the attack, the hacker made some interesting demands.
Normie crypto hacker tables demands
The hacker transmitted an on-chain message to the Normie crypto team, stipulating terms for the return of a portion of the funds. They proposed to return 90% of the funds and retain 10% as a bug bounty, with no reprisals. 
However, the condition for returning the funds was that the 600 ETH in the dev wallet must be utilized to fairly launch a new token for reimbursing NORMIE holders. According to reports, the Normie developers agreed to the bounty offer.
At the time of this writing, 600 ETH was worth over $2.3 million based on the current price. 
Additionally, the hacker pointed out that the Normie crypto contract was a copy-and-paste job and felt it had not been adequately reviewed. 
They highlighted that many memecoins operated on similar codes. This revelation suggests that a significant portion of memecoins might be vulnerable to similar types of attacks.
Normie sees a sharp fall
An analysis of the Normie crypto price movement revealed a staggering loss of 66.49% on 26th May, coinciding with the occurrence of the hack. 
The price plummeted from approximately $0.04 to around $0.014. As of the current writing, the decline has extended by over 23%, resulting in a total decline of around 90% within the last 24 hours. 
Normie was trading at approximately $0.011.

Also, this decline in price caused the market cap to plummet to around $2.9 million from its previous value of over $40 million.

Bitcoin Stalls Below $72,000: Is This The Weakest BTC Bull Run In 15 Years?


								Bitcoin prices are firm when writing and trading at around multi-month highs but below the all-important liquidation line at around $72,000. While up roughly 20% from May 2024 lows, some analysts are already questioning the sustainability of the uptrend, especially considering the level of engagement.
Bitcoin Struggling For Momentum: Will Bulls Or Bears Take Over?
One analyst on X points out the state of Bitcoin’s price action and thinks the current uptrend could be one of the weakest in the coin’s history. This preview is especially true when comparing the current performance with those seen in 2021 and 2017 using the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.
BTC MVRV extremes | Source: @OnChainCollege via X
 
In on-chain analysis, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio compares the Bitcoin market cap versus the total realized cap of all BTC in circulation. The MVRV ratio also changes, fluctuating mostly impacted by price action. Looking at the Bitcoin price action over the years, extreme highs in the MVRV ratio have often coincided with market tops. 

When this happens, it suggests that BTC investors buying the coin then could be overpaying. As things currently stand, the analyst said the current MVRV levels are “glaring” compared to previous bull cycles, implying this rally could be tepid.
Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
 
The analyst highlighted two potential outcomes for Bitcoin prices. In one scenario, the current upward trend could be subdued, signaling the end of the rally. 
If this is the case, BTC prices are likely to plummet in the near future, making the surge to $73,800 the weakest bull run in Bitcoin’s 15-year history, based on MVRV data.
However, the current subdued price action and retreat from an all-time high to spot rates could be a precursor for further gains in the coming months. 
Nevertheless, for BTC bulls to gain control, traders must show commitment and sentiment change. These two factors will work together to drive prices to new all-time highs above the March 2024 levels.
Case For BTC Bulls: Spot ETFs And FASB Rule Changes
Most analysts believe BTC is trading at a discount at spot rates. Several fundamental factors may support this outlook. For instance, the resurgence in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) demand may help propel prices like it did in the better half of Q1 2024. 

Furthermore, the anticipated Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule change by the end of the year could profoundly affect Bitcoin adoption. These changes would allow institutions to include BTC on their balance sheets, which many believe would accelerate the institutional adoption of Bitcoin and drive prices even higher.

Santa on Solana (SANTASOL) to Skyrocket 17,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While SHIB and DOGE Lag



                    

Santa on Solana (SANTASOL) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Santa on Solana (SANTASOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SANTASOL has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Santa on Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa on Solana could become the next viral memecoin.



Santa on Solana launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Santa on Solana on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa on Solana by entering its contract address – 9aKN9xRfKe9gzfA6cC1aVC88DvRpyjPhyBGEnSyLzR2D – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTASOL.

Can Base Challenge Solana’s Memecoin Dominance? | Bankless


Solana’s comeback has been the story of this cycle so far, with the network rising on the backs of tech improvements, lucrative airdrops, and, most notably, memecoins. Memecoins have gone from an unserious, short-lived asset class to a forward-looking alternative to low float, high FDV tokens that aren’t leaving enough upside for retail.Today, most memecoin activity happens on Solana, though activity is continuing to migrate to ETH L2s like Arbitrum and Base. Base has been particularly buzzy as of late. While the Coinbase-incubated L2 does show promise to become a meme hub, activity on Solana continues to dominate and stay within its ecosystem. Can Base compete with Solana in the memecoin arena? In this article, we’ll examine the current state of these platforms, their capital flows, and leading projects to assess what makes Solana the memecoin capital and how Base compares to it.🐕 The Solana Memecoin SceneA critical element of Solana becoming this cycle’s darling L1 has been its memecoin activity. Fueled by an internal capital surge from airdrops like Jito, Jupiter, Kamino, Parcl, and Tensor, memecoins have dropped and reached $1B market caps within a week, a spectacular achievement and excellent marketing campaign for a chain that's now pushing a TVL above $4.8B. Solana can owe a sizable amount of its narrative momentum to memecoin fever, evident in the activity on pump.fun, a popular memecoin launcher, which on some days has accounted for 83% of all tokens launched and even flipped Solana in 24hr revenue. This success, though, wouldn’t have been possible if the network hadn’t already had such a strong memecoin arena featuring main character tokens like WIF, BONK, and BODEN, to name a few. Dogwifhat (Ticker: WIF; Market Cap: $3.3B) is a cute Shiba Inu with a knitted hat that’s become Solana’s mascot thanks to its memeability, extensive promotion by Crypto Twitter personalities and the allegiance generated from having your token climb from a $10K market cap to multi-billion dollar status.Jeo Boden (Ticker: BODEN; Market Cap: $194M), a derpy take on US President Joe Biden that ignited the PolitiFi meta, also calls Solana home. In its first week, it brought many 1000x returns, a performance that has definitely wed some to the SOL memecoin scene.Bonk (Ticker: BONK; Market Cap: $2.65B) is Solana’s OG memecoin. It is a Shiba Inu from Dec. 2022 that saw incredible price action last fall and kicked off memecoins for the chain.Broadly, Solana not only boasts the most prominent memecoins of the cycle but also a thematic range of tokens, from dogs and cats to politicians. Crypto Takes Center Stage in 2024 Election on BanklessAre Biden and Trump about to make crypto a mainstream issue in the General Election?🧑🏻‍🦲 The Base Memecoin SceneBase has quickly risen to find its footing as one of Ethereum’s top L2s wiProjects like DEGEN and friend.tech have brought the network consistent activity and established a culture for Base as a social hub. That said, while March saw an epic rally in the network’s TVL, it looks to have plateaued in recent weeks. While Base's TVL is still a far cry from Solana's, its daily volumes are impressive. Last week, the network hit a record $854M in one-day volumes. TVL in Blue. Volumes in Green.While the BALD rug of 2023 may have left an initial sour taste in the mouths of memecoin gamblers, the ecosystem has developed more momentum in more recent memecoin cycles.Brett (Ticker: BRETT; Market Cap: $440M) is a token inspired by a character from Pepe creator Matt Furie's "Boy's Club” comic. While niche can be good, it can also reduce the audience and, thus, the demand for a token. Toshi the Cat (Ticker: TOSHI; Market Cap: $146M), named after Brian Armstrong’s cat and Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, is Base’s leading pet-inspired memecoin.NORMIE (Ticker: NORMIE; Market Cap: $40M) is a token playing on the crypto-native meme of normies, a term for those new to the industry or not onchain. 
Traders show allegiance to the chains that helped them accrue wealth. While SOL traders were able to buy into the token at a minute fraction of its current market cap, Base still doesn't have a native token due to regulatory scrutiny, and if/when it does, it can be assumed that there will be relatively lighter available upside for retail traders. All the while there have been few landmark ecosystem airdrops on Base, unlike in the Solana community.While Base has unique memecoin communities, they do not have the broader appeal of tokens in other ecosystems like Solana; rather, they cater to a more crypto-native audience. This uniqueness makes the chain stand out, but the tight thematic scope could limit the chain’s success as a major meme hub. While Base has been able to leverage its cheaper and faster transactions to build out an early class of memes, the strongest memecoin communities on Ethereum still primarily exist on mainnet. Solana has momentum and a more palpable narrative in this cycle, and while Base continues to be one of the more buzzy L2 ecosystems, there's a lot of ground for Base to make up in the memecoin arena.Closing ThoughtsSolana and Base exist on different levels when it comes to memecoins. Solana has solidified its position with a diverse and thriving memecoin ecosystem supported by significant airdrops and a robust community. In contrast, despite its impressive growth and support from Coinbase, Base has yet to achieve the same level of mainstream appeal and capital creation that lends itself to the degenerate environment needed for memecoins.Solana's continued growth, evident in its TVL increase and daily volumes, highlights its place on center stage this cycle. As the memecoin landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see if Base can foster a standout memecoin that can differentiate Base within the Ethereum ecosystem and outside of it.

Bitcoin Over $70K Amid Argentina Legal Tender Talks, Ethereum Flirts with $4K - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMost of the top 100 tokens are in the green as Bitcoin jumps 2.5% and slips past $70,000 while Ethereum flirts with $4,000. The price of BTC is $70,136 while the price of ETH is $3,934 as of writing, according to CoinGecko data.This comes as Argentina opens discussions with El Salvador’s Digital Assets Commission on their experience using Bitcoin as legal tender. “El Salvador has established itself as a global leader not only in the use of Bitcoin but also in the broader realm of digital assets,” Roberto E. Silva, president of Argentina’s National Securities Commission, said in a blog post. “We aim to strengthen our ties with El Salvador and are exploring potential collaboration agreements.”El Slavador made headlines in 2021 when it became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender, leading to a surge in tourism and going on Bitcoin spending sprees. Now Argentina, with their new eccentric leader Javier Milei, is looking to explore Bitcoin as legal tender too.According to WorldoMeters, Argentina is the 22nd largest country by GDP with a population of over 45 million people. While the meeting happened on May 23, the news didn’t spread until today as Bitcoin climbs 2.5% over the $70,000 threshold.In turn, there’s been a whopping $28 million of liquidations—$23 million of them being short positions. Meanwhile, $17 million of short Ethereum positions have been liquidated, according to CoinGlass.This is because Ethereum has seen similar gains of 3.8%, putting it within touching distance of the $4,000 mark. On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a landmark approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, effectively green-lighting Ethereum trading on Wall Street.Over the coming hours and days the price remained largely unchanged, even dropping 4% at one point.

Bitcoin cracks US$70,000, Ethereum nears US$4,000; JENNER, PEPE and memecoins drive markets


Bitcoin broke US$70,000 on Monday as Ether inches closer to US$4,000 for the first time since March, according to CoinGecko data.



The market was still abuzz after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) gave a tentative nod to spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last week.



But memecoins stole the show on Monday, as media personality Caitlyn Jenner’s new cryptocurrency recorded over US$200 million in 24-hour trading volume since launching.



The embracement of the industry by a mainstream celebrity fueled a memecoin rally. It pushed Pepe by another 5.5% on Monday, adding to a seven-day 77% rally, CoinGecko data shows. 

	
	
	
	


Jenner’s cryptocurrency launch has been riddled with controversies, causing market watchers to question the project’s legitimacy. 



Social media users debated whether Jenner’s video confirmations were generated by artificial intelligence.



It appears that the project is backed by Jenner. 



Sophia Hutchins, Jenner’s manager, joined an X Spaces talk session to confirm their involvement with the project.

	
	
	

	


However, social media users have brought to light that the project may be linked to Sahil Arora, an alleged scammer best known for his activities on the Avalanche chain.



Arora, who is followed by Hutchins on Instagram, boasts his connections by frequently posting pictures taken with celebrities on social media.



So far, Jenner has not confirmed nor denied Arora’s involvement with the project, while Arora has reportedly claimed credit.

L2 Taiko Goes Live on Ethereum Mainnet


Layer-2 (L2) project Taiko has officially deployed its protocol on the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet, marking a significant milestone after two years of work.
The Taiko protocol uses Based Contestable Rollup (BCR) architecture. It promises to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and security while maintaining a decentralized structure.
Vitalik Buterin Proposes First Block as Taiko Deploys on Ethereum

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed the inaugural block, highlighting the significance of this launch. He expressed his excitement about Taiko’s unique approach, which integrates various proof systems to bolster the network’s robustness.

“I’m excited to see that Taiko is launching as a based rollup. Ethereum benefits from L2s taking a plurality of different approaches, and I appreciate them being among the first to go in this direction,” Buterin stated in the block’s metadata.

Taiko’s launch introduces several opportunities for users and developers to interact with the new network. Regular users can bridge ETH to Taiko using the official bridge and explore decentralized applications (dApps) for activities like swapping, borrowing, and staking. Although there are quota controls for bridging back to Ethereum, these limits will be gradually lifted.
Furthermore, developers can engage by running nodes, proposing, and proving blocks—which are essential for maintaining the network’s security and functionality. The Taiko team will initially manage these processes to ensure stability but will soon open them to the broader community. Additionally, developers can build and deploy smart contracts on Taiko, which are supported by comprehensive documentation.
The team also plans to launch a DAO and transfer protocol control to token holders later in the year. TKO, Taiko’s native token, will launch a few weeks after the mainnet deployment. Taiko will hold an airdrop to distribute the token.

Some user categories eligible for the airdrop include proposer, prover, developer, and bridger. GitHub and Loopring community members who meet the conditions can also check their eligibility for the airdrop.
Taiko is a completely open-source, permissionless ZK-Rollup equivalent to Ethereum. Its goal is to offer an experience similar to Ethereum without the involvement of centralized parties, functioning entirely through community-driven mechanisms.

This technological accomplishment and user-focused approach have garnered significant financial backing. In early March, Taiko announced the completion of commitments for a Series A funding round worth US$15 million. 
Lightspeed Faction, Hashed, Generative Ventures, and Token Bay Capital led the round. This most recent round brings Taiko’s total raised capital to US$37 million across three rounds.

Major Signal Just Flashed For Meme Coins, As ETH ETF Approved. SHIB, DOGE and PEPE Ready For Moonshot - Will BLP Follow Them?



                    

A recent development in the investment sphere has begun turning heads toward a certain category of cryptocurrencies. Notable coins like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE have caught the attention of a major investment product, signaling a potential uptick in interest and activity. With the market gaining momentum, enthusiasts are closely watching these tokens for signs of an explosive movement. The anticipation grows as the community speculates on subsequent moves by other investment mechanisms. This move marks a critical moment, suggesting a possibly transformative phase for these cryptocurrencies.

Shiba Inu’s Market Movement Shows Bullish Long-Term Trend



Shiba Inu has been catching eyes with its marked rise in the past half-year, overshadowing dips seen in recent weeks. The coin’s movements hint at a cautious atmosphere, with recent pullbacks perhaps signaling pauses in a generally enthusiastic market. The energetic rallies in previous months suggest strong trader interest, which might set the stage for a potential comeback. Considering Shiba Inu’s active community and growing utility, these market patterns may very well reinforce the token’s position in the competitive crypto landscape.



Dogecoin Shows Steady Presence in Volatile Market



Dogecoin has been holding its ground recently, remaining within a familiar price range. It’s encountered moderate interest, moving towards a higher price point but has yet to break through. On the downside, the coin also has notable stability, not dropping to its lower predicted levels. The market’s mood appears balanced, with no strong push in either direction. Dogecoin’s wide online community and its usage in tipping and transactions ensure that it maintains relevance, even in a market that’s seeing other cryptocurrencies with more dramatic movements.



Pepe Coin Sees Significant Upward Momentum Amidst Market Fluctuations



Pepe has been gaining a lot of value over the last six months, with this uptick continuing through the last month and week. The price has recently reached a point where it might struggle to climb higher without significant investor interest but has also shown it can stay above lower value levels where it might otherwise drop. People seem cautiously optimistic about Pepe’s future. The coin’s performance suggests a growing confidence among traders, which might carry on if the current trend persists. This is notable considering the coin’s amusing brand but shows the market can see beyond names when value is perceived.



Conclusion



The recent development in the meme coin sector, with SHIB, DOGE and PEPE, has caught attention. However, these coins are likely to have limited short-term growth. On the other hand, BlastUP stands out with significant potential. This project, part of the Blast ecosystem, is built on a strong concept and offers a promising future within the current bull market.

Could Ethereum Outshine Bitcoin With New US Spot ETFs? Traders Bet Big


								Ethereum is currently at the forefront of traders’ minds, stirred by recent regulatory developments in the United States. The anticipation of the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Ethereum has ignited a rally in its value.
So far ETH’s price has witnessed a notable uptrend of over 20% in the past weeks, pushing its price above multiple resistance.
This surge coincides with speculative activities around the potential for a similar success story to the January debut of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have accumulated more than $50 billion in assets.

Ethereum’s Rising Tide: High Stakes and Higher Volatility
Amid the strong performance of ETH, a recent Bloomberg report has uncovered a growing trend of significant bets on the cryptocurrency’s future.
Market analysts, including Chris Weston from Pepperstone Group, assert that ETH’s current trajectory points upwards despite potential market pullbacks, suggesting a strong continuation of investor interest.
This sentiment from Weston is mirrored in trading patterns observed on platforms like Deribit, where traders appear to be optimistic about ETH reaching new heights, potentially surpassing its previous record of $4,866 set in November 2021.

Adding to the intrigue, Bloomberg’s analysis highlights the notable differences in volatility between ETH and Bitcoin, which underscore shifting market dynamics.
The T3 Ether Volatility Index, a tool for forecasting expected price movements over the next 30 days, shows that Ethereum experiences larger fluctuations than Bitcoin.

This index’s recent readings show the widest gap in expected volatility between the two cryptocurrencies since the beginning of 2023, signaling that market speculators anticipate more pronounced movements in Ethereum’s price.
Institutional engagement, as measured by the activity in CME Ether futures, also suggests a cautiously growing interest from large-scale investors.

Although this interest is still modest compared to Bitcoin, it reflects a wary but increasing acknowledgment of Ethereum’s market potential, especially with the pending launch of Ethereum spot ETFs.
However, Noelle Acheson, author of the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter, cautions:
The relatively low participation from the same institutions that will probably be expected to pour into the Ether spot ETF upon launch, suggests that the initial inflows could be disappointing.
Ethereum’s Challenge In Capturing The ‘Boomer’ Market
Meanwhile, in a recent discourse on the X platform, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas delved into the potential success of the newly approved US spot Ethereum ETFs.

Balchunas pointed out the challenges these spot ETFs may face in attracting older investors, specifically those aged between 60 and 80. He suggested that the complexity of Ethereum’s concept might hinder its acceptance among this demographic, known as the “baby boomers.”

Arbitrum Shows Resilience Amidst Market Fluctuations



Arbitrum’s market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic as it demonstrates the ability to hold its value despite recent price variations. The interest in this coin is maintained by its technology that offers faster and cheaper transactions than traditional Ethereum. This unique selling point might attract more users and investors, potentially leading to a rise in its value. With the cryptocurrency displaying both upward and downward movements over different time frames, Arbitrum’s underlying strengths could help it weather the volatile market conditions and possibly gain ground in the near future.



Celestia (TIA) Struggles in Volatile Market Conditions



Celestia (TIA) has seen a bumpy ride recently, with its value swinging between highs and lows. It’s currently trading closer to its lower support levels, hinting at cautious investor sentiment. The short-term moving average suggests a dip below recent averages, while long-term trends indicate a slight faltering after an earlier growth phase. Technical indicators reflect the uncertainty in the market, pointing to a lack of strong momentum either way. Despite the challenges, the currency’s performance over the past several months suggests resilience, offering a mix of hope and caution to its holders.




Starknet Witnesses Volatile Market Dynamics



Starknet has experienced a diverse performance with noticeable short-term declines and impressive long-term gains. In recent times, its price movements suggest a tricky phase as it teeters between commonly watched levels that traders use to make decisions. While the current market sentiment appears cautious, the currency’s ability to hold above its significant supportive markers hints at underlying interest. A deeper look at Starknet reveals it as a layer-2 scaling solution, which aims to enhance Ethereum transactions, making them faster and cheaper, thus potentially attracting more users if blockchain adoption continues to grow.



Polkadot Market Sentiment Appears Guardedly Optimistic



Polkadot is seeing a tug of war with the price hovering in a moderately wide range, faced with some push and pull as it inches closer to an established upper threshold. There is a noticeable cushion at a lower level which could prop up the price in case of a dip. Recent stability suggests a mild positive vibe yet cautiousness is evident with an absence of strong momentum. Given Polkadot’s robust underlying technology, which enables different blockchains to interact, these market movements may attract attention from investors who value both technical resilience and market trends.



Conclusion



In conclusion, while ARB, TIA, STRK, and DOT, are seen as strong contenders for growth in the anticipated bull run of 2024, their short-term potential may not be as pronounced. The key focus should be on BlastUP, which emerges as holding the most promise among these selections. Its potential lies in its innovative concept and the advantage of being part of the broader Blast ecosystem. This positions BlastUP to capitalize on upcoming market trends and investor enthusiasm more effectively than its counterparts.

Space and Time: Groundbreaking Technologies for Efficient and Safe Data Processing



                    

The internet’s transformative power, rooted in global storage and exchange of data, has long been a driving force in shaping our lives. As the Web continues to evolve, the demand for systems ensuring efficient data processing, reliability, and user privacy becomes ever more pressing.



Where Web2 was about connecting every aspect of existence to the internet, Web3 is about creating global trust and value networks where users can exchange complex data and currencies. This vision naturally requires adequate systems to process large amounts of data quickly, while simultaneously guaranteeing authenticity (not always a given) and safety for all parties involved.




Addressing the data needs of tomorrow is the premise behind Space and Time, a company founded in 2021 that promises to create a trustless, fast and safe data infrastructure layer to supercharge Web3.



What is Space and Time?



Space and Time is a decentralized data warehouse dedicated to serving users complex and flexible queries, backed up by a pioneering and highly efficient Zero Knowledge (ZK) proof called Proof-of-SQL.




Space and Time strives to provide users and developers with reliable on-chain and off-chain data that can be promptly verified and called by smart contracts. This is a first, as all previous solutions focused on making on-chain data easily available off-chain.



Space and Time uses a combination of advanced database technologies, supporting most chains, which empower users to seamlessly access and analyze data spanning across numerous blockchains. It lets users run SQL queries to access this data, which is delivered with a 100% guarantee of accuracy thanks to Proof of SQL.



These features make Space and Time ideal for data integration and analysis with anything related to on-chain apps. It’s useful both for accessing blockchain data and for smart contracts to read outside data in a tamper-proof manner. This could potentially power nearly every complex app that interacts with the outside world, including advanced DeFi and RWA, identity and DePIN use cases.



How Space and Time works 




Space and Time’s uses an HTAP (Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing) database, a combination of OLTP and OLAP (Online Transactional and Analytical Processing) that facilitates near real-time execution of intricate queries, which would otherwise need longer periods and involve more complex processes. 



Developers need to use SQL to communicate with the Space and Time data warehouse. However, the project made that significantly easier with the AI-based Prompt-to-SQL, which converts natural language prompts into SQL queries. This AI-driven feature makes SQL accessible even to novice developers, who are thus able to request complex data insights using simple language and in a few seconds. 



That makes AI SQL a very useful tool for DeFi developers, being ideal to deliver dynamic visuals, customized dashboards and automatic charts. 



The infrastructure is underpinned by Proof-of-SQL, which consists of four basic steps: first, a user writes an SQL query against data stored in the Space and Time database, which includes both the on-chain and off-chain datasets. The database then receives and executes the query and transforms it into an algebraic intermediate representation, which is what allows it to be proven by Proof-of-SQL.



Space and Time’s Proof-of-SQL unlocks a number of use-cases that would otherwise require complex approaches and extremely high levels of trust. 



For instance, Proof-of-SQL represents a game changer in real-world cases that can involve, for example, the data necessary in supply chain or in health care data analysis. But even in on-chain use cases, it’s a much more straightforward system that doesn’t rely on complex consensus algorithms requiring millions in incentives.



Space and Time Team, Backers and Partners 



Space and Time is a project built for 10 years from now, combining deep technical expertise with a unique position on the market. It is not surprising that Space and Time has attracted the attention of some significant investors.



Space and Time is led by Nate Holiday, Co-founder and CEO, and Scott Dykstra, Co-Founder and CTO, who previously held VP positions at Teradata, a Web2 cloud analytics giant.



During their Seed funding round, led by Framework Ventures, the blockchain company raised $10 million, while in September of the same year they raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Vulcan Capital and joined by M12 Microsoft Ventures, Framework and HashKey.



Space and Time’s heterogeneous team, composed of accomplished cryptographers, developers and data engineers, has also closed decisive partnerships with leaders of the Web3. 



Space and Time is currently a partner of Polygon and Sui, to support them with their data infrastructures. Other partners include well-known names such as Amazon Web Services, NVIDIA, Chainlink, Mysten Labs, and Sotero. 



Overall, Space and Time is well-positioned to become one of the biggest building blocks in the crypto space and beyond, serving the vital role of enhancing the efficiency and safety of data processing. 



As Web3 continues to evolve and become the internet of value it’s meant to be, projects like Space and Time will see their time in the spotlight. For now though, that future is still a few years off.

Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton Says Approval and Trading of Ethereum ETFs Now ‘Inevitable’ - The Daily Hodl


								Jay Clayton, the former Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), says it’s inevitable that a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) will go live on American stock exchanges.
In a new interview on CNBC television, Clayton notes that the SEC has already approved the product itself, and will likely proceed to approving the actual trading of the ETF products.










“There’s two pieces of approval for one of these types of products. There’s the listing approval which is what happened [on May 23rd], and then there’s the approval of the product itself which is still pending. That’s called the registration statement. That we need to find out. 
They always say ‘This product is eligible for listing’ but it will not actually be trading until that registration statement is approved…
So it’s a step in the direction [of ETH ETFs trading].
I think it means it’s inevitable. We went through this same process with the Bitcoin product where almost all or all of the questions were decided. The question that was decided [on May 23rd], to speak technically, is that this market is efficacious enough for this product to be listed on the exchange, but there are other questions out there.”
Last week, the SEC approved form 19b-4 filings from BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, Ark, Franklin Templeton and Invesco Galaxy simultaneously.
Although the products have nearly obtained the full go-ahead, the SEC must approve the firms’ S-1 registration filings before trading can begin.

Balaji Srinivasan Criticizes Fed's Unpredictable Monetary Policy, Praises Bitcoin's Stability - Coin Edition


							


Balaji argues the Fed’s monetary policy is unpredictable compared to Bitcoin’s consistent issuance, which he considers crucial alongside its scarcity.



The Fed made three rate cuts by March 2024 but is ready to raise rates if needed.



The Fed plans to maintain restrictive policies if inflation remains high.






Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of Coinbase, has criticized the Federal Reserve, arguing that the Fed’s funds are “poor predictors of monetary policy paths.” The tech mogul asserted that the Fed’s policy is unpredictable, contrasting it with Bitcoin’s consistent monetary policy.



“if you made the graph of Bitcoin’s predicted issuance versus its actual issuance over the last 15 years, they would be exactly superimposed,” Balaji stated.



This predictability, he contends, is as crucial as Bitcoin’s scarcity.



Balaji previously likened the Fed’s approach to controlling a complex system through votes.




“Imagine trying to control a highly multivariate system by adjusting a single parameter with a committee vote, with a feedback delay measured in months while the characteristic time of the system is in seconds. That’s the Fed.” 




He argued that this approach is unsustainable, asserting that the Fed cannot effectively control the system.



The Fed implemented three rate cuts by March 2024 to address the current inflation. However, some officials have signaled a willingness to raise interest rates further if inflation worsens.



According to a Financial Times report, “Various participants mentioned a willingness to tighten policy further should risks to inflation materialise in a way that such an action became appropriate.” 



The likelihood of rate increases diminished following the subdued inflation over the past month. Nevertheless, concerns about persistent inflation in the U.S. economy remained high among central bank officials.



As such, the Fed maintained interest rates at a 23-year high range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent during the May 1 meeting. This decision was unanimously supported by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members.



The post-meeting statement indicated that borrowing costs might remain elevated longer than anticipated. This move is due to disappointing inflation data from January to March, with rates still well above the Fed’s 2 percent target. The Fed officials also planned to enact restrictive policies if inflation did not decline to the target or ease policy restraint if the labor market weakened unexpectedly.

Injective (INJ), Polygon (MATIC) and One Additional Ethereum-Based Altcoin Flashing Bullish Signals: Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								One widely followed crypto analyst thinks three leading altcoins are soon to enter bullish phases.
Crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 62,900 followers on the social media platform X that the decentralized supply chain management platform VeChain (VET) is on the verge of lift-off after a successful retest of a parallel channel.










“Like in the previous bull cycle, VeChain retests the upper boundary of a parallel channel before VET enters a bull rally.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
VET is worth $0.0396 at time of writing, up 4% in the last 24 hours.
Looking at the decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchain Injective (INJ), Martinez sees a historical precedent for an upcoming bull run. Martinez refers to the Thomas DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator, a technical analysis tool aiming to pinpoint precise price reversals based on the closing prices of the previous nine and 14 intervals.
“The last two buy signals from the TD Sequential on the Injective weekly chart led to impressive bull runs of 700% and 555%. Now, this indicator is flashing another buy signal, suggesting that INJ could rally again!”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
INJ is trading for $26.41 at time of writing, up 6.2% on the day.
Referring again to the TD Sequential, the crypto analyst says that the Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 protocol Polygon (MATIC) is about to scale up.
“The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the MATIC weekly chart, anticipating Polygon will see a one to four weekly candlesticks upswing!”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
MATIC is currently trading for $0.747, up 4% since yesterday.

                        Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, successfully raised $6 billion in a Series B funding round on May 26. The latest Series B round included participation from Vy Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal.According to an official blog post from the xAI startup, the capital raise will bring xAI’s first products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate research and development of future technologies. Elon Musk also hinted at more announcements in the following weeks.Elon Musk Aims to Guide xAI to Stardom Amidst Failed OpenAI Idea
The funding round boosted xAI’s value to $24 billion, a major increase from its previous value of $18 billion just 11 months after its launch in July 2023.In sharp comparison, OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is valued at $80 billion. Enthusiasts believe the valuation is fair as OpenAI was founded in December 2015, an eight-year head start over xAI.Musk has avidly supported AI technology, which led him to co-found ChatGPT maker OpenAI. His involvement was short-lived following a fallout with the management team, however.In March 2024, Musk sued OpenAI and its co-founder Sam Altman, accusing them of betraying the nonprofit’s mission statement and becoming a “closed-source de facto subsidiary” of Microsoft.According to the lawsuit, Musk donated over $44 million to OpenAI between 2016 and September 2020 and was its largest contributor for several years.Although he left OpenAI’s board in 2018, he was offered a stake in the for-profit arm but declined on principle.Elon Musk Spearheaded Grok, the ChatGPT Challenger
Musk founded xAI in July 2023 and went on to release its ChatGPT-rival Grok 1.0 model in November 2023.Grok is a generative AI model that was developed over several months on a cluster comprising “tens of thousands” of GPUs. The training of ChatGPT challenger involved sourcing data from the web up to the third quarter of 2023, complemented by feedback from human assistants that xAI refers to as “AI tutors.”The model was made available through a chatbot to X Premium and Premium+ users. In March 2024, the company announced the Grok 1.5 model –a measurable upgrade to Grok-1. The chatbot was also made available to Premium users on X.Speaking at Viva Tech Paris 2024, Musk acknowledged that xAI, a new company, needs to make considerable progress before it can compete with industry leaders like Google DeepMind and OpenAI.VIDEOMusk expressed his optimism about Grok’s rapid development and future competitiveness in the AI landscape.

Crypto Community Urged to Back Pro-Crypto Presidential Candidates in Upcoming Election


							

Justin Sun urges crypto community to back a pro-crypto U.S. president.



If re-elected, Trump will promote Bitcoin, self-custody, and oppose CBDC.



Long-term crypto success requires ethical leadership like Jack Ma and CZ.




The cryptocurrency community is being urged to support a U.S. presidential candidate who champions their interests.



TRON founder Justin Sun stated, “We need to demonstrate to the candidate that the cryptocurrency communities, companies, and protocols are vital stakeholders whose voices must be heard and whose interests must be protected.”



Former President Donald Trump is one American presidential contender who has expressed support for cryptocurrency, according to Coin Edition. Should he be re-elected, Trump has promised to champion Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.



In addition to supporting self-custody rights, he plans to keep well-known anti-crypto senator Elizabeth Warren away from the sector and to fight the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the United States.



In response to Sun’s appeal, a user commented that politicians were only interested in themselves. However, he acknowledged that Trump has pledged to shield Bitcoin from governmental actions, potentially making this the first election that is truly favorable to cryptocurrency. Whether he will honor his word remains to be seen.



 
 




On the other hand, citing Binance’s Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and Jack Ma, Sun underlined the need for ethical leadership in the cryptocurrency industry. He noted that these leaders never choose the easy option. “It is not always easy and may not pay off right away to do the right thing. But never forget, ‘Do what is right, because it is right.'”



Sun observed a similar pattern in CZ’s entrepreneurial journey: profitable businesses are those that consistently outperform in user value.



The appeal to back pro-crypto presidential candidates is part of a larger effort by the cryptocurrency community to ensure their concerns are adequately represented in the highest levels of government.

Critical Statements by Michael Saylor: "It Has Become Clear that Bitcoin is a $10 to $100 Trillion Asset" - Bitcoin Sistemi


MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor declared the approval of Bitcoin ETFs a pivotal moment for BTC, solidifying its position as an important asset class.
In a recent episode of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, Saylor said: “The most important thing that happened in this adventure was the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. This means that Bitcoin is not a multi-hundred billion dollar asset class, Bitcoin is a ten to $100 trillion asset class.” It was about crossing the chasm that says there is an asset class.”


Despite supporting the approvals, Saylor criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its general approach towards cryptocurrencies. He accused the SEC of being obstructionist and contradictory towards the entire crypto industry by filing lawsuits against crypto exchanges and entrepreneurs.
Saylor attributed his criticisms to two main factors. First, he claimed that the SEC was delaying the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs as well as options trading. Second, he noted that the SEC only allows cash refunds rather than in-kind refunds, preventing investors from directly exchanging their Bitcoins for shares in ETFs. “So both of these things make these spot ETFs inferior,” he said.






Saylor also cited the SEC's rule 121, which requires banks to include digital assets on their financial statements. He argued that this rule makes it impossible for banks to store Bitcoin:

“We have achieved minimal adoption of Bitcoin. But these are other logical things: let banks hold custody, let people hedge it, let them trade BTC for securities. These are normal and ordinary things in all other beings. These were rejected. That's why we're moving at a very slow pace.”

Saylor also underlined in the interview that cryptocurrencies are increasingly becoming a political issue. He suggested that candidates who are positive towards crypto could garner more votes in the upcoming US elections.

Analyst Says XRP Will Make Extraordinary Moves Above $0.6049, Here’s The Target | Bitcoinist.com


								Despite witnessing price declines, a crypto analyst has predicted that XRP is set to break through critical resistance to new highs. The analyst has highlighted several technical indicators that signal a potential trend shift for XRP.  
XRP Set To Witness Bullish Rally
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Dark Defender’ shed light on XRP’s price movements, unveiling a combination of technical indicators that suggest an imminent bull rally for the cryptocurrency. 

Basing his analysis on the Heikin Ashi Candles and the Fisher Indicator, Dark Defender, explained that the connection between these two technical indicators often signals a trend shift on a weekly time frame. He further clarified that by combining the Heikin Ashi Candles and the Fisher Indicator, it is easier to identify trends by examining highs and lows as well as opening and closing prices in a given time frame. 
In making his prediction for XRP, the analyst shared a price chart depicting XRP’s price movements from 2023 to the end of 2024. He revealed a critical support zone between $0.6044 and $0.6649, which XRP will have to break through to experience a price surge. 
Source: X
In his chart the analyst revealed a price target of $1.8816 between July and September, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency would have to skyrocket by 161.8% to reach this price. The analyst believes that XRP is on track to make “extraordinary moves above $0.6049.”
For this to happen, Dark Defender has stated that XRP will also have to close its weekly candle above $0.6649. He revealed another major technical indicator, the Ichimoku Clouds, highlighting that this indicator substantiates the critical Fibonacci levels that fall between the aforementioned critical support zones.
Interestingly a dark red trend resistance line which can be seen on the price chart intersects between the Ichimoku Clouds and the Fibonacci levels. This intersection indicates that XRP is set to overcome major resistance, leading to a potentially stronger bullish trend that could propel the cryptocurrency towards the upper Fibonacci levels. 
Dark Defender disclosed that XRP has already experienced its first weekly break last week and is expected to continue towards the most challenging areas. He declares that XRP is currently in “Grand Wave 3,” a phase of the Elliot wave theory often characterized by powerful and sustained upward movements. 
Analyst Predicts Explosive Growth For XRP By Year-End
Another crypto analyst, identified as ‘JT’ on X, has highlighted a pivotal moment in XRP, predicting that the cryptocurrency was set for an explosive momentum before November 2024. The analyst revealed a massive triangular formation in XRP’s price chart, emphasizing that it was the longest-running triangle in the crypto market. 

Source: X
According to JT, XRP’s running triangle is set to reach an apex in November, suggesting a potential breakout for the cryptocurrency. He reveals that if the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) can “turn up,” then XRP is likely to witness a bullish rally. 
It’s important to note that most forecasts are based on speculations but can provide valuable insights into a cryptocurrency’s price movements. At the time of writing, the price of XRP is trading at $0.528, reflecting a 1.28% decline over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

Feds Arrest Owner of $100,000,000 Dark Web Marketplace Using Crypto To Process Drug Transactions - The Daily Hodl


								US authorities have announced the arrest of the alleged mastermind of a notorious dark web marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously.
In a statement, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) says that 23-year-old Rui-siang Lin, from Taiwan, was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport on May 18th and subsequently charged for allegedly owning and operating Incognito Market under the pseudonym “Pharoah” or “Faro.”










The DOJ says Incognito sold more than $100 million worth of illegal drugs and misbranded prescription medication from when it was formed in October 2020 until it was shut down in March 2024. Users from around the world also purportedly used cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) to transact on the illicit marketplace.
Says Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Assistant Director in Charge James Smith,
“For nearly four years, Rui-Siang Lin allegedly operated ‘Incognito Market,’ one of the largest online platforms for narcotics sales, conducting $100 million in illicit narcotics transactions and reaping millions of dollars in personal profits.  Under the promise of anonymity, Lin’s alleged operation offered the purchase of lethal drugs and fraudulent prescription medication on a global scale.”
Lin is alleged to have had the ultimate decision-making authority over every aspect of Incognito’s operation. He is also said to have had control of more than 1,000 vendors and over 200,000 customers.
Reads the complaint filed by FBI Task Force Officer Mark Rubins,
“As the principal administrator of Marketplace-1, LIN profits the most from Marketplace-1’s activities. LIN also implements policies for the site, and ultimately determines whether a particular vendor is permitted to sell narcotics on Marketplace-1.”
Lin is charged with one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, one count of narcotics conspiracy, one count of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to sell adulterated and misbranded medication.

Toncoin's 2024 price performance overshadowed by THIS factor - AMBCrypto



TON outperformed a large number of tokens in terms of price growth in 2024.
However,  activity on the network continued to decline.

Toncoin [TON] network has been one of the dark horses of the cryptocurrency sector in the recent bull run.
The TON token gained massively from the popularity of its network, causing it to outperform all other tokens in terms of price growth in 2024.
Source: X
Looking at the price
At press time, TON was trading at $6.40 and its price surged by 1.38% in the last 24 hours. Since the 11th of April, the price of TON moved sideways without showing any trend favoring either the bears or the bulls.
After testing the $7.659 level, the price of TON fell by 19.16%. TON spent the most time between the $71.30 and $5.411 levels during this period.
For TON to establish a significant bullish trend, it would have to retest the $7.659 level and push past it in the future.
A significant amount of bullish momentum would be required from TON for this to be achieved.
At press time, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) for TON coin had grown to 54.31 implying that there was some level of bullish momentum supporting TON, but it wasn’t material enough to cause a significant price change.
The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) also surged to 0.10 implying that the money flowing into TON had risen.
Source: Trading View
Another factor that could impact TON’s price trajectory would be the appeal of the token to new users.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment’s data indicated a declining network growth, implying that new addresses were not interacting with TON as much as they were before.
Coupled with that, the velocity at which the token was being traded also fell, implying lower frequency of TON trades.
These factors could act as hurdles for TON’s rally in the future.

Network status
Another factor that can influence the price dynamics of TON would be the state of the network. AMBCrypto’s examination of Artemis’ data revealed that activity on the TON network plummeted in the last few days.
The number of transactions occurring on the network had fallen from 8.2 million to 4.3 million. Coupled with that, the number of daily active addresses on the network fell from 500,000 to 320,000.

Bitcoin Ready To Outperform Gold by at Least Double for Rest of Market Cycle: Glassnode Founders - The Daily Hodl


								The founders of crypto analytics platform Glassnode are predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) will vastly outperform gold for the remainder of the current bull cycle.
The co-founders of Glassnode, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 63,000 followers that the BTC/gold ratio could more than double in the coming months.










The BTC/gold ratio, currently at 29, is the value of Bitcoin relative to the price of gold.
“Opinion: a lot of talk about gold over the last couple of months. But is gold really the asset to be exposed to at this point? BTC-Gold ratio still suggest that we could see BTC at 65x the price of gold at the end of this crypto bull cycle. 
This would imply more than double the performance of BTC compared to the shiny metal. Pick your favorite! We favor BTC over gold at this point.”

Bitcoin is trading for $70,547 at time of writing, up 2.5% in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the analysts suggest Dogecoin (DOGE) could repeat a pattern seen in the prior two bull markets and soar to $2.52. The analysts use Fibonacci extensions, which are based on Fibonacci ratios and are used in technical analysis to estimate profit targets and price pullbacks.

Top 5 Platforms for Staking Crypto & Passive Earn



                    

Crypto Staking is one of the most well-known tools for passive income. Choosing a platform and getting a real profit can be complicated for investing beginners. This article will analyze what affects Staking income and which platforms provide the best offers in 2024.



Staking brings money from storing cryptocurrency, which benefits both platforms and participants. It uses the Proof-of-Stake algorithm (PoS), which protects blockchains from tampering. All platforms pay users rewards for this assistance in maintaining security. Thus, profit directly depends on the choice of platform and the opportunities it provides. Let’s analyze the market and highlight the key aspects affecting Staking profit and convenience.




Staking APR – The Key Metric of Income



Passive income from Staking is determined by interest and credited to the balance as a reward. The primary metric is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) – net profit for a year. If a participant stakes $100 with a 20% APR, he will receive $120. The alternative metric is an Annual Percentage Yield (APY), which differs in compound interest calculation.For example, 20% APR equals 21.94% APY for monthly payouts, but these metrics are equal for annual payouts. Therefore, APY shows more accurate returns when compounded more frequently, but APR is static and more convenient. Next, only the annual period will be considered to avoid confusion with these metrics.



Flexible & Fixed-Term Staking



There are two types of Staking: flexible and fixed-term. Some platforms offer fixed-term Staking, while others don’t set limits and allow you to withdraw crypto anytime, like Binance:



Which of these types is better? The flexible system brings convenience and flexibility, while fixed-term – the bigger size of the reward. Platforms and users get more benefits when this period covers a longer time. Thus, freezing assets for a month or a year brings more crypto than a day or a week. If the APR metric requires high indicators for maximum profit, then the choice of a locked-up period depends only on the participant’s preferences.




Top 5 Staking Platforms in 2024



It’s time to return to the main issue – choosing the ideal platform for Staking. Every project provides different income interests, locked-up periods, and various currencies. We shall consider some top Staking platforms for 2024 and check out their strengths and weaknesses.



These platforms are successful and trusted by many crypto enthusiasts and investors. Each of them has flexible and fixed periods. Therefore, the main distinctions are APRs and the variety of currencies. Moreover, some of the above platforms have outstanding features that provide greater benefits.




BetFury: this ecosystem provides top-tier currencies for Staking, such as USDT, BTC, BNB, and TRX. However, it shows strong potential due to huge APRs, which can be boosted by platform activity. On top of that, BetFury has a Referral Program, so that users can get up to a 15% reward for each referral.



Binance: one of the most popular exchanges isn’t a favorite, but its huge community gives it a leading global position. The platform offers trusted crypto for staking with various lock-term options.



Coinbase: this highly recognized competitor of Binance offers excellent interest rates and surpasses it in the number of currencies by over seven times.



Bybit: this platform isn’t inferior in crypto diversity but has lower APRs. However, Bybit has exclusive offers for new users – up to 300% APR on some tokens.



Kraken: this exchange has a convenient interface and offers nice APRs.



Nexo: this crypto platform is similar to Kraken but provides more favorable conditions based on APR values for BTC, USDT, etc. Moreover, Nexo gives some bonus interest for Staking in Nexo tokens.




For more detailed analytics, let’s take a specific example – ETH Staking. Ethereum is one of the most famous currencies due to its high value, use in the NFT market, and so on. Are you interested in APRs offered by top platforms for ETH Staking?




BetFury – up to 60% APR



Nexo – up to 8% APR



Kraken – up to 6% APR



ByBit – up to 3% APR



Binance – up to 3.3% APR



Coinbase – up to 2.39% APY




Time-limited & Exclusive Staking Offers



Some of the above platforms offer time-limited Staking pools and other unique mechanics. They provide the highest APRs and can significantly increase your income in the short term. For instance, the BetFury platform now has three temporary pools for 30 days. You can stake NOT with 150% APR, TON with 140% APR, and USDT with 130% APR for 14 days. 








In addition to the classic earning tools, BetFury has a BFG Staking. If you stake BFG, a native BetFury token, you will passively obtain more BFG or payouts in BTC, ETH, USDT, TRX, and BNB. The BFG Staking APY can be doubled by converting BFG to stBFG and locking these unique tokens for one year. Hence, users will get x2 APY for the BFG Staking pool by supporting the platform’s tokenomics. To show confidence in a promising future, the BetFury team locked up one billion BFG for 4.8 years without doubling APYs.



How to Choose Your Ideal Staking Platform?



Analytics demonstrates that many of the platforms mentioned have pros and cons. Among the above candidates, Coinbase wins by the number of currencies, while BetFury offers the highest and the most stable APRs. 



However, the platform choice depends on users’ preferences and the availability of certain crypto. Besides, it is important to monitor the safety of funds when Staking. What affects protection against loss of funds?




Trusted Platform: it’s best to join staking on platforms with a proven track record and substantial payouts. The longer they’ve been in the market and the more experience they have, the safer it is to earn passive income. It’s crucial to consider security audits and project licenses.





Exchange Prices: crypto volatility can directly affect earnings. For instance, the user chose fixed-term Staking for half a year for a currency that has fallen in price. In this case, the user will not receive the expected income. Solution: choose stablecoins like USDT or monitor the exchange rate of other currencies on the market.




To summarize, Staking is a powerful earning tool for receiving cryptocurrency without much effort. The main task is to gain experience and the right approach to choosing a platform. Rely on APRs, analyze the possibilities of withdrawing funds, and improve your skills to multiply your earnings constantly.

This Memecoin Developers Allegedly Behind Yesterday's GCR Hack - Bitcoin Sistemi

In an important development yesterday, the Twitter account of GCR, one of the most well-known analysts in the cryptocurrency world, was hacked.
Fake tweets were sent from the hacked account, claiming that GCR had invested in many memecoins and altcoins.


Then, cryptocurrency detective ZachXBT delved into the details of this hacking incident and, interestingly, found connections between the developers of a newly launched memecoin and the hackers.
According to ZachXBT, the developers of the memecoin called CAT may be involved in the hacking incident that occurred last night. According to the data, a wallet belonging to the developers of this memecoin opened a $2.3 million ORDI and $1 million ETHFI long position last night.





Going back to the beginning, CAT developers purchased 63% of CAT tokens during the launch of their own token. He then sold them for $5 million and transferred the profits to other wallets.
One of these wallets transferred $2.5 million worth of Solana coins obtained from sold CAT tokens to Kucoin and MEXC exchanges.



In its analysis, ZachXBT found that there were withdrawals from the two exchanges, Ethereum and Arbitrum, in amounts similar to the amounts deposited by the wallets in question. Then, on May 25, one of the wallets transferred $ 650 thousand USDC stablecoin to the platform called Hyperliquid to be used in futures transactions.
The wallet in question opened an ORDI long position worth $2.3 million about 10 minutes before the hack. ORDI price jumped after the hacking incident. He closed his position one minute after the wallet hack and made a profit of $34 thousand.





Then, the wallet in question opened a $1 million ETHFI long position on the same platform. 8 minutes after the position was opened, a post was made for ETHFI from the hacked address. However, the hacker closed this position with a loss of $ 3,500.
The CAT team purchased the username @sol, which is very valuable on Twitter, and started sharing from this address.

Uniswap Foundation discloses $41M balance sheet ahead of crucial fee vote - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            As the Uniswap community prepares to vote on a proposal that would introduce a new fee distribution plan, the Uniswap Foundation has shared its balance sheet, revealing $41.41 million in fiat and stablecoins, as well as 730,000 UNI tokens.The upcoming vote, which is expected to pass based on prior snapshot polls, would transfer control of the mainnet UniswapV3Factory to a new V3FactoryOwner contract. This change is a prerequisite for activating the new fee distribution plan, which will be the subject of a second vote that has not yet been scheduled.The proposed fee distribution plan is a critical development for the Uniswap ecosystem, as it could potentially provide a new revenue stream for the protocol and its stakeholders. The exact details of the plan have not been disclosed, but it is expected to incentivize liquidity providers and other key participants in the Uniswap network.The Uniswap Foundation’s balance sheet revelation comes amidst looming threats from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC recently issued a Wells notice to the Foundation, indicating its intention to recommend enforcement action against the organization in the future.The SEC’s Wells Notice specifically targets Uniswap’s UNI and LP tokens, arguing that they constitute investment contracts and alleging violations of securities laws. However, Uniswap Labs, the company behind the Uniswap protocol, disputes these claims, asserting that the SEC lacks jurisdiction over the matter. Uniswap Labs contends that LP tokens are merely bookkeeping devices and do not, as such, meet the criteria for securities.Uniswap also argues that it does not fit the SEC’s own definition of an exchange, which could potentially shield the protocol from regulatory action. The outcome of this dispute will likely have significant implications for the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, as many other protocols rely on similar token models and decentralized exchange mechanisms.The Uniswap Foundation’s balance sheet disclosure comes at a critical juncture for the protocol, as the community prepares to vote on a new fee distribution plan and faces potential regulatory action from the SEC. The proposed fee distribution plan could provide a significant boost to the Uniswap ecosystem, incentivizing participation and potentially driving further growth and adoption.

ETH/BTC Bounces From A 7-Year Support Trend Line: Ethereum To $4,900?


																After a crucial week for Ethereum, a technical candlestick arrangement shows that ETH prices could prepare for a sharp upturn in the coming weeks and months. 
Pointing out events in the monthly chart, one analyst notes that the ETH/BTC ratio reverses from a multi-year support trend line. Usually, the analyst continued, when prices bounce from this line, altcoin prices tend to react, trending higher. 

ETH/BTC Rising From Crucial Support Trend Line
The ETH/BTC is a ratio closely monitored by technical analysts. It compares the performance of the world’s first and second most valuable coins. 
Although Bitcoin has been firm for the better part of the last two years, the monthly chart clearly shows a descending channel, indicating an upward trend. 
So far, there have been a series of higher lows. This suggests that bulls have been soaking in selling pressure over the years, keeping prices higher.

Looking at the monthly chart, this month’s bar will close firmly as bullish. This will result in a double-bar bullish reversal pattern that may ignite demand. 
This will subsequently help pump ETH prices even higher. Even so, the relatively lower trading volume, lower than those seen in July 2022, suggests that participation is not at historically high levels. 
A bullish bar in June confirming this month’s gain could be the base of another leg up. If this happens, it will mirror those of January 2021. Another 40% gain versus Bitcoin could see ETH close above 0.08 BTC, propelling the coin closely toward 2017 highs.

Overall, Bitcoin has been firm. From September 2022, BTC has been outperforming ETH, erasing gains from 2020 and 2021. The result was a descending channel, though this phase of lower lows also had relatively low participation levels. 
Technically, based on a volume analysis, this is bullish for ETH. Even so, a close above 0.08 BTC would be a strong testament from the bulls. It could potentially set a foundation to cement ETH, further narrowing BTC’s dominance.
Spot Ethereum ETFs To Drive Demand: Path To $4,900?
Over the years since launching and the final approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, the digital asset was the only one recognized by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Because of this advantage, the approval of the derivative product has seen BTC become an institution’s go-to asset. Wall Street players like Fidelity and BlackRock have been enabling exposure to BTC via spot ETFs over the past four months, resulting in billions being poured into the asset. 

	Related Reading


However, this changed last week when the United States SEC approved listing all spot Ethereum ETFs. ETH staking was removed from amended 19b-4 files. 
Still, the fact that Ethereum is almost being clarified represents a massive boost for the network and the platform. ETH prices shot by as much as 30% in response, outperforming Bitcoin.
It is highly likely that ETH prices will continue rising in the coming weeks. Though it remains to be seen how the reception will be, especially among investors, the coin, like BTC prices post mid-January 2024, will rally, perhaps breaking $4,100 and even all-time highs of 2021.

                        Binance, the largest shareholder of the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Gopax, sold the asset claims of Gopax victims at less than half their face value on May 27. The discounted sale has led to substantial financial losses for investors, contradicting Binance’s earlier promise to fully compensate victims of the virtual asset deposit service ‘GoFi.’ The sale occurred amid rising cryptocurrency prices, exacerbating the losses for Gopax’s creditors.Initial Promises and Unexpected Actions Concerning Gopax Victims Asset Claims
When Binance acquired a majority stake in Gopax, it committed to compensating investors for the approximately KRW 70 billion (around $52 million) lost due to suspending fund withdrawals in the ‘GoFi’ service. Instead of using its funds to cover these losses, Binance sold the victims’ asset claims at extremely discounted rates.Following the sale, the price of major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, surged, further increasing the financial gap. The debt to GoFi has now increased to an estimated KRW 100 billion (around $75 million), excluding existing repayments.An anonymous source familiar with the transaction disclosed to the local news agency Hankyung that Binance offloaded the claims as part of its strategy to manage Gopax’s liabilities.“Binance initially promised to cover the Gopax victims’ funds with its Industrial Recovery Fund (IRI), but IRI was only used to pay the first damage (about 15 billion won),” the source said. “From the second payment onwards, we paid with Bitcoin obtained by selling the Genesis claim at a low price to a third party, and we are delaying the payment of the remaining 50% of the damage, saying we will pay it after the Gopax acquisition is completed.”Investor Discontent and Regulatory Scrutiny
Notably, Genesis, the virtual asset deposit service associated with Gopax, had its bankruptcy compensation plan approved by a U.S. court last week. Genesis has committed to returning 77% of the approximately $3 billion in bond funds to creditors.In contrast, Gemini, another cryptocurrency exchange with funds tied up in Genesis, announced plans to compensate 97% of its affected customers using bankruptcy compensation. Gopax, however, has not made any official statements regarding its compensation plans or the sale of Genesis asset claims.In a similar case involving the bankrupted FTX exchange, Sunil Kavuri, a leading creditor in the FTX creditor community, criticized the sale of assets at discounted prices, arguing that these assets should have been returned to investors. Kavuri stated,“Sullivan & Cromwell has trampled over our property rights,” Kavuri said. “They have liquidated billions of dollars of crypto assets. There’s a token S&C sold at 11 cents; it’s now trading at two dollars. FTX had $10 billion in Solana tokens — they sold it at a 70% discount.”Gopax’s board of directors, which includes Binance representatives, has been accused of withholding information regarding the source of funds used to compensate the second batch of victims last August. The secrecy and the 50% discount at which the Genesis claims were sold have fueled investor frustration and distrust.The Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea is reviewing Gopax’s executive change report, including appointing Binance personnel as directors. The FSC has also requested additional information from Binance regarding the allegations of money laundering and other concerns.

How To Trade The Ethereum Rally: 10x Research - Benzinga

In its recent newsletter, 10x Research pointed out ways to capitalize on the current Ethereum ETH/USD rally, offering insights into optimal strategies and market behaviors to watch. What Happened: In its newsletter titled “Should Traders Embrace The Ethereum Rally?,” 10x Research notes the impact of understanding new narratives that can “override everything.”For example, Bitcoin BTC/USD saw a 150% rally before its futures launch in December 2017 and an 80% increase prior to Coinbase's direct listing in April 2021. This pattern highlights the potential for the ongoing Ethereum rally, sparked by the narrative surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs.The team around lead analyst Markus Thielen points out several key observations.
ETH > BTC Trade:Bitcoin has seen a modest 3% increase in futures open interest, while Ethereum’s surged by 45%, indicating a strong preference for ETH over BTC as the catalyst of choice. “The trade might be ETH > BTC, as that is the catalyst,” 10x Research notes.



Institutional Moves:The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs can lead to significant price movements. Even the anticipation has already caused Ethereum futures open interest to increase by $4 billion. As ETF issuers prepare for sufficient capital on launch day, the rally may continue, driving ETH prices higher.



Sectorwide Impact:The surge in DeFi's total value locked, increasing by $17 billion in a week to $107 billion, is also notable. Lido LDO/USD and Ethena ENA/USD have seen marked increases in their TVL, implying broader bullish sentiment that extends beyond just Ethereum. Lido (LDO) rallied from $1.50 to $2.60 after the announcement of unstaked ETH ETF approval, with more potential upside left.
Read Also: Altcoins ‘Entering Textbook Markup' As Crypto Analyst Predicts Major RallyWhy It Matters: 10x Research’s central thesis is that traders should adopt bullish positions leading up to major events, as historical patterns suggest substantial price appreciations during these periods. “For traders like us, it's essential to quickly throw out the old playbook and adjust to the new reality,” the research firm said. Ethereum is up 25% over the last seven days compared to Bitcoin’s more muted 3% increase over the same time frame. Cryptocurrency traders have pointed out that Ethereum-related tokens like Ondo Finance ONDO/USD will benefit from the launch of spot exchange-traded funds. ONDO is up over 30% over the last seven days. Ethereum-based meme coins, such as Pepe PEPE/USD, up 75% over the last seven days, have also benefited.Price Action: At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,930, up 2% over the last 24 hours.What's Next: The impact of Ethereum as an institutional asset is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga's upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: This Dog Coin Is Up 53% And ‘Still In Ripper Mode’… But It’s Not DogecoinThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Image: Shutterstock.

A Trader Bought This Altcoin and Turned $11K into $3.07 Million in 16 Days, According to Onchain Data - Bitcoin Sistemi


The cryptocurrency market may occasionally witness interesting data due to its high volatility.
According to Onchain data, a cryptocurrency wallet managed to turn $16,400 into $3.07 million in just 11 days.


According to the data, the whale named whalefud.eth, which joined the memecoin trend, bought the MAGA token 11 days ago and the token has risen 187x since then.
MAGA token is actually an abbreviation for Donald Trump's election slogan, “Make America Great Again.” So this memecoin benefited from the fact that Trump has recently become extremely popular in the cryptocurrency world as well.





The whale in question noticed MAGA just 1 hour after the Trump memecoins began to be released and purchased 5.34 billion MAGA for 3 ETH.
The wallet purchased 56.8 million more MAGAs by paying 2 more ETH on May 21, when there was a bottom in the MAGA price.


This whale currently holds $3.07 million worth of MAGA tokens.
However, although this whale was lucky, it is worth noting that almost all investors chasing memecoin in the cryptocurrency market lost money.






Trump-themed cryptocurrencies were on the rise after the former US President signaled that he would approach Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market positively if he is re-elected.

Biden BTC (BIDENBTC) to Skyrocket Over 11,000%, As It Looks to Challenge Dogecoin and Shiba Inu



                    

Biden BTC (BIDENBTC) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Biden BTC (BIDENBTC), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Biden BTC presents a similar opportunity.



Biden BTC has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Biden BTC could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Biden BTC can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Biden BTC on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Biden BTC by entering its contract address – 9MAph1jbrbs98UTvZ3EC5VVFAeKduh9iY78jJKDwxioz – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like BIDENBTC.

Very Controversial Vote Passed in Solana: Price May Be Affected - Bitcoin Sistemi

In a significant change from its predecessor, Solana (SOL) has adopted a proposal known as SIMD-0096 that would allow the entirety of priority fees to be allocated to network validators.
This decision marks a departure from the previous model, where fees were split 50-50 between burning and rewarding validators.


The final vote resulted in 77% of votes in favor of the proposal, indicating strong support from validators. This change aims to increase rewards for validators, the nodes responsible for the reliability and performance of the network.
In the statement made by Solana Labs Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko, it was stated that this update can enable staking pools with programmatically frozen tokens to obtain all tip and priority fees.





However, it will take several months for this new allocation model to be adopted as it is not available in the current version of Solana's Mainnet-Beta software. Later versions, such as 1.17 and 1.18, will include this feature as well as other improvements, such as the SIMD-0123 proposal to further optimize block reward distribution.
Priority fees on the Solana network are charged by users who want their transactions processed faster, especially during peak hours. Validators prioritize these transactions to ensure the smooth functioning of the network.



Previously, 50% of these fees were burned, which some felt had a deflationary effect on the Solana token (SOL). Under the new model, all priority fees will go to validators, which could increase their revenue but could also raise concerns about more tokens being created and causing inflation.
Stakewiz, a validator, expressed his opinion on the Solana token expansion issue and its connection to inflation, predicting a 4.6% increase in token inflation.

Bitcoin stuck in accumulation range, but a breakout is near - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Despite showing positive weekly closures for three weeks straight, Bitcoin (BTC) is still stuck in the accumulation zone between $60,000 and $70,000, according to the trader identified as Rekt Capital.The current accumulation phase is a common post-halving period, registered in previous cycles, as shared by the trader on X. As BTC failed to register a weekly close above $70,000 last week, it consolidated its accumulation period further.However, after the current accumulation phase, Rekt Capital highlights that there’s only a phase of upward parabolic movement left for Bitcoin in the next months. Furthermore, the consolidation period might be coming to an end soon. “While there is still scope for additional consolidation at these highs… The time left in this phase is slowly running out,” adds the trader. Therefore, the chances to buy BTC below the $70,000 mark in this bull cycle could vanish soon, according to Rekt Capital’s predictions.Upside for altcoinsAfter briefly losing support on the $250 billion market cap, the altcoin sector rebounded and made its highest weekly close since mid-April, Rekt Capital points out. If it manages to breach the resistance at $315 billion, a run until $425 billion could follow the movement.Yet, this is just the second ‘altcoin hypercycle’ for 2024, according to the trader. Although a rally is expected to start soon, Rekt Capital predicts a price top in July for this hypercycle, followed by a correction and bottoming between August and September. A third hypercycle starts after this bottoming, followed by a top in October and another price bottoming between November and December, which will trigger a fourth hypercycle in January 2025.

Digital Strategist Shares 3 Crypto Marketing Secrets


In an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, digital strategist Jacky Rivero shared invaluable insights into effective crypto marketing. 
Her expertise sheds light on the nuances of navigating the industry, emphasizing storytelling, transparency, and community engagement as core strategies.
1. The Power of Storytelling
Jacky Rivero emphasized the importance of storytelling in the crowded crypto market. 

“Every day, more brands within and outside the niche are leaning into storytelling because it’s crucial for getting closer to their audience,” she explains. 

Unlike traditional pitches focusing solely on problem-solving, effective storytelling highlights the brand’s understanding of users’ issues. This approach builds trust by making the audience feel understood and valued.
Rivero noted that the crypto space is saturated with content, making it imperative for brands to stand out. 

“People are overwhelmed! The challenge is to stand out amid all that noise. That’s why it’s essential to tell stories that show how you understand the problem, not just how you solve it,” she emphasized. 

By being relatable and demonstrating a deep understanding of the audience’s pain points, brands can foster a sense of connection and loyalty.

2. Transparency and Verification
Transparency is another cornerstone of Rivero’s marketing philosophy. She stressed that crypto projects must operate with a “don’t trust, verify” mindset, providing users with tools to verify the project’s security and operational status. 

“Features like landing pages to check protocol or exchange statuses, proof of reserves, and regular communication about audits are vital,” she said.

Users in the crypto market are acutely aware of market volatility and regulatory changes. Rivero advised that there is no need to hide these realities.

Instead, brands should maintain open communication channels to reassure users. This transparency builds trust and ensures user loyalty.

Community engagement is crucial for long-term success in crypto marketing. Rivero highlighted the importance of creating interactive spaces and activities for users. 

“The community aspect is crucial — creating engaging spaces and activities for users to interact with their peers is as important as educating them,” she explained.


Gamified educational experiences, for instance, can keep users engaged while they learn about the project. Additionally, Rivero also highlighted the effectiveness of memes in crypto marketing. 

“Have you heard that ‘Memes are the DNA of the soul’? I can’t stress enough the importance of being relatable, and memes are the best way to connect, educate, and entertain,” she noted.

Memes, if done correctly, can spread effortlessly and serve as a key performance indicator.
Crypto Marketing Challenges and Partnerships
Rivero pointed out the unique challenges of advertising in the crypto industry, where stringent legal requirements limit many companies’ ability to run ads. For those who can, the task becomes one of creativity and brevity. 

“The challenge is fun — figuring out how to say more with less,” she noted.


Influencer partnerships are another critical element of a successful crypto marketing strategy. Rivero advised projects to choose creators who have tried and reviewed their products honestly. 

“Knowing who your target users are is critical. Are they holders? Newbies? Liquidity providers? Approach influencer partnerships knowing that your offer will reach the right crowd,” she told BeInCrypto.

Finally, Rivero stressed the importance of balancing short-term engagement metrics with long-term growth strategies. Prioritizing organic content, especially memes, alongside SEO, can capture immediate attention and build lasting visibility. 

“Plan your marketing for immediate impact on social media and long-term visibility through search engine optimization,” she concluded.

Rivero’s insights offer a comprehensive guide for crypto projects aiming to thrive in a competitive market. By focusing on storytelling, transparency, community engagement, and balancing immediate and long-term strategies, brands can effectively navigate the complexities of crypto marketing.

PEPE Whales are on the move: They Are Trading in the Last Hours - Bitcoin Sistemi


Data provided by cryptocurrency analysis company Lookonchain shows that a cryptocurrency whale has recently accumulated in an altcoin.
When Onchain data is examined, it is seen that a giant cryptocurrency whale has withdrawn $ 7.95 million of Ethereum and $ 2.06 million of PEPE from Kraken, the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the USA.


When the other transactions of the whale in question are examined, it is seen that he has purchased a total of $ 18 million worth of Ethereum in the last two days and collected these ETHs at an average price of $ 3,828. At the time of writing this article, Ethereum price is trading at $ 3,916 with its last attack. The world's second largest altcoin climbed to $3,963 today and reached the $4,000 mark.

A look at the whale's PEPE transactions shows that it has collected $ 8.03 million in tokens since March 16 at an average price of $ 0.00001. The whale's profit on PEPE totaled an impressive $3.17 million.





The rise in PEPE price and the rise in Ethereum price are actually quite related. With the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, almost all tokens in the ETH ecosystem were caught in a bullish wave, which was felt more in memecoins.

How to Remove AI Overview from Your Google Searches - Decrypt

Once upon a time—the late 20th century—a search engine would index the open, decentralized web and help you find the information you're looking for. After showing you an ad or two, you'd be sent on your way to the source.Since then, the ads have gotten more plentiful and harder to differentiate from content—and that content has become polluted with SEO-optimized websites looking to show you even more ads. But now, thanks to the explosive proliferation of AI, even the meaning of the verb "Google" is shifting. Instead of sending you to an information source, the tech titan is now serving up answers instantly—no need to go anywhere else, or see anyone else's ads!Except those answers have been unreliable, even dangerous.Is it possible to go back in time, before the “AI Overview” and “Search Generative Experience,” and simply see a ranked list of links instead of AI rewrites and search spam? With some tweaks and hacks, the answer is yes.De-Google Google in Chrome, Edge, BraveFor better or worse, Google is also behind the most popular web browser engine in the world: Chromium. In addition to serving as the basis of Chrome, it's also behind Microsoft's Edge browser, and alternative browsers like privacy-centric, crypto-savvy Brave. Fortunately, this means the same settings can get you closer to clean search results across these browsers and across the platforms that run them—Windows, MacOS, and Linux.The following change to Chromium settings makes Google's newly segregated and likely depreciated “web” search section—you know, the way we understood search worked years ago—the default type of search.For Chromium on PCs and Macs (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):
Click the three dots at the top right of the browser window, then select “Settings.”
Choose the “Search engine” option.
Look for “Site search” and click “Add.”
Enter “Google Web” as the name and “www.google.com” as the shortcut.
In the URL box, enter:
{google}/search?udm=14&q=%s

Click “Add” to add the rewritten Google site to the list.
There is also a browser extension called Hide Google AI Overviews that simplifies this process, but there's a risk that Google may ban it.A compromise—not eliminating AI but getting less “optimized” search results—is to conduct Google searches in “Incognito” or privacy mode, which eliminates traceable cookies.For Mobile Chrome on Android and iOS:Unlike on the desktop, you can't manually set up a custom search engine as explained above, but there is a workaround, courtesy of TenBlueLinks. It's a free, simple, transparent, and auditable hack that will show "tenbluelinks.org" as the source, but all search queries will be sent directly to Google, not the TenBlueLinks website.
Visit TenBlueLinks.org.
Open a new tab and search for anything in Google.
Click the three dots at the top right of the browser window, then select “Settings.”
Select “Search engine,” then choose “Google Web” in the “Recently visited” section.
For Firefox on PC or Mac:Firefox users can download an extension called UDM14 to add the custom search engine tweak above that ditches Google AI:
Download and install the extension.
Go to “Settings,” “Search,” and then “Default Search Engine.”
Select the extension and set it as your default search engine.
For Firefox on iOS or Android:
Install the Firefox web browser on your phone—if you don't have it already.
Navigate to “Settings,” “Search,” and then “Default Search Engine.”
Tap “Add search engine.”
Fill out the fields as follows:

Name: Google (Web)
Search string URL: google.com/search?udm=14&q=%s


Click “Save.”
Select Google (Web) from the menu.
For Safari on Mac:If you use Safari, Google search—as configured by Google—is the default. You have two options.The first one is easy:
Go to the App Store and download another web browser.
Another solution is a workaround for those who absolutely must use Safari, and comes courtesy Twitter user @ChookMFC. It involves running a script that checks for your Google searches every couple of seconds and automatically adds the term “&udm=14” if it detects one.“It's like going back in time by about 5-10 years (in all the best ways),” he claims.The script can be found here.For Vivaldi on PC:With this niche browser, the solution is pretty similar to Chrome users and involves setting up a custom URL:
Go to “Settings” and then “Search.”
Click the plus button at the bottom left of the dialog box to add a new search engine.
Name the new item “Good Google” and give it the nickname “gg”
Set the URL to:
 https://www.google.com/search?q=%20&udm=14

Set it as your default search engine.
For Vivaldi Mobile:The mobile version doesn’t seem to have an option to customize its search engine, but you can add a shortcut to your Vivaldi home page.
Go to the home page (the little house icon in the bottom center).
Click on the plus button to add a new shortcut.
Fill out the fields as follows:

Name: Good Google
Search string URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=%20&udm=14
Description: Good Google
Nickname: gg


Click “Save.”
For Opera on PC and Mac:If you use any of the Opera browsers, the solution is similar to the one for Vivaldi mobile above: launching a shortcut that takes you directly to text links instead of the “Search Generative Experience.” To do that, follow these steps:
Go to the home page (the little house icon in the bottom center) which should take you to the Opera “speed dial” screen.
Click on the plus button to add a new shortcut.
Fill out the field as follows:

Search string URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=%20&udm=14


Click “Save.”
Once saved, you can edit the shortcut to have a better name:
Go to your “speed dial” tab and find the button corresponding to your newly created shortcut.
Click on the three dots that appear at its top right.
Change the name to “Good Google."
Other fish in the sea: some alternatives may surprise youInstead of just de-Googling Google, consider switching to entirely different search engines.If you're open to AI—just not Google AI—Perplexity AI is a promising alternative that AI enthusiasts praise. Founded in 2022, Perplexity AI is a chatbot-powered search engine that provides clear, concise answers with inline citations. It offers a free basic search engine and a paid version, Perplexity Pro, which includes features like GPT-4 integration and unlimited file uploads.With Perplexity, you interact with the search engine conversationally, receiving natural language responses and the ability to ask follow-up questions for more detailed answers —or to strip down results. There's no need to switch your mind to keyword mode.Alternatively, you could enlist the help of AI assistants like GPT-4 (via ChatGPT Plus, Microsoft's Bing or Microsoft’s Copilot) to conduct web searches and synthesize results. Remember to explicitly instruct ChatGPT to "search the web" if you want the latest information, however, because it may sometimes reply based on its fixed knowledge database instead of searching for the latest information.If you use Microsoft’s Edge browser, or are a Windows user, you can access Copilot by clicking on the icon at the bottom left of your Windows taskbar or the upper right of your Edge browser. For reference, look at the red squares in the image below, highlighting the icon:And let's not forget the old-school search engine underdogs like DuckDuckGo, and change-the-model paid search tools like Kagi. These alternative search engines can also provide results that may be hidden by Google's algorithm. However, keep in mind that SEO has affected the entire internet, and there's no guarantee that these alternatives will be completely free of spam and AI interference.Boy, do we miss AltaVista.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Solana validators approve 100% allocation of priority fees, ending 50/50 burn split

Solana validators voted to allocate 100% of priority fees to themselves on May 27, ending the previous 50/50 split between burning fees and rewarding validators.The proposal, known as SIMD-0096, passed with 77% approval. It aims to address perceived flaws in the current system and align incentives for network security and efficiency.The change in priority fee allocation seeks to reduce the potential for side deals between transaction submitters and block producers, which proponents argue could undermine network security.Validators such as Everstake, Jito, Helius, Stakehaus, Leapfrog, Bonk, Solend, and Pico.sol supported the change.Meanwhile, validators, including Step Finance, Triton, GREED, Solana Compass, Shinobu, Orangefin, AG, Pumpkin Pull, and Edgevana, opposed the proposal.Bug in the systemCritics, like Hanko Baggins from Bandito Stake, raised concerns about removing the burn mechanism, which helps manage Solana’s annual inflation rate.Baggins suggested that while increased fees might benefit validators in the short term, the removal of the burn could impact the network’s long-term health and suppress SOL’s price.Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko addressed these concerns, stating that the current system requires users to pay double the priority fee to outbid tips, which go entirely to validators and are not burned. He described the priority fee burn as a bug in the system.Laine from Stakewiz estimated that the change could lead to a 4.6% increase in Solana’s issuance, aligning it with levels from a year ago. He emphasized that SIMD-0096 is part of a broader plan to improve block reward distribution, with other proposals like SIMD-0123 also in development.Delayed implementationAlthough the vote has concluded, the activation of SIMD-0096 may take several months, as the current Solana Mainnet or upcoming upgrade does not support it.The delay allows for further discussion and development of additional proposals, such as SIMD-0123, which aims to streamline block reward distribution, and SIMD-0109, which proposes a native tipping mechanism.The decision to allocate 100% of the priority fees to validators highlights the varied perspectives within the Solana ecosystem and sets the stage for ongoing discussions about the network’s future.The move comes amid growing interest in Solana, following its meteoric climb to a local high of $210 earlier in March. The network has also recorded the highest trading volume in recent weeks.Mentioned in this article

Bitcoin Vs. SPY Vs. Gold: If You Had $1,000 Invested In Each Of These Assets Last Memorial Day, Here's How Much You Would Have Now - SPDR S&P 500 (ARCA:SPY) - Benzinga

The financial markets, which ended mostly higher in 2023, saw an acceleration in momentum toward the year-end and the strength has continued in the new year. With the stock market trading at record highs, here’s a look at how the returns compare to other high-flying assets.Rate Cut Hopes, Slowing Inflation Drive Gains: After inflation and successive rate hikes spooked investors in 2022, they came back with a vengeance in the very next year. The return of risk appetite was orchestrated by consumer price inflation, which fell back from a cycle high of 9.1% in August 2022. Corporate profit growth also remained resilient as companies resorted to measures to keep their top  and bottom lines from collapsing.On top of that, the economy witnessed robust job gains despite the surrounding economic uncertainties.The late-year gains in 2023 came on the back of hopes that the Fed may have to reverse its rate hikes as the central bank remained on pause mode since July 2023, when it raised the Fed funds rate to a 22-year high of 5.25%-5.5%.Another contributing factor to the market rally was the AI frenzy, which lifted companies having exposure to the technology. Mega-caps including Nvidia Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet, Inc. GOOGL GOOG and Meta Platforms, Inc. META are at the forefront of AI revolution. It’s quite logical that when these stocks move they have the potential to take the market along with them, given their heavy weighting in the major indices.See Also: Best High-Yield Investments To EarnGold Glitters: An outlier asset that also participated in the market rally was gold. Gold is invariably referred to as a safe haven asset that typical doesn’t do well when risk appetite is high.The logic behind the gold rally is the dollar weakness. As the market began to price in rate cuts, the dollar began to soften and this proved to be positive for the yellow metal, which is denominated in the dollar. Gold futures hit an intraday peak of $2,454.20 on May 20 and a closing peak of $2,438.50 in the very same session. It has pulled back since then.Bitcoin On Extended Run: After ending 2023 as one of the best-performing assets, thanks to over 155% gains, Bitcoin BTC/USD continued its stellar run in the new year. The upside catalyst was the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds by the SEC. The king crypto hit a record intraday high of $$73,750.07 on March 14 and a record closing high ($73,083.50) a session earlier. Since then, the crypto has seen some volatility and trades just above $70,000.Returns From SPY, Gold Bitcoin: Assuming an investor put in $1,000 each on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, an ETF that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index – a broader market gauge, gold and Bitcoin in the final session ahead of the Memorial Day in 2023 (May 26), here’s how much he would have now.No of units with $1,000 InvestmentCurrent Value of Investment ReturnSPY2.421,278.7728%Gold futures0.51$1,200.4620%Bitcoin0.036$2,519.60152%The SPY ended Friday’s session up 0.66% at $529.44, according to Benzinga Pro data.Read Next: Cathie Wood’s Comparison Of Current Stock Market And 1930s Great Depression Draws Criticism From Jim Chanos: ‘Complete Financial Insanity’Photo via Shutterstock.

Floki Inu Unveils Trading Bot as Price Surges 18%


Floki Inu, one of the leading meme cryptocurrencies, has announced a closed beta mainnet launch of its own trading bot. The bot will be available on the mainnets of Ethereum, Coinbase's Base as well as Binance's BNB.  For now, the beta is open to only 150 users for a period of two weeks. After that, the Floki Inu team will introduce the public version of the bot. The closed beta launch will make it possible for the team to fix early bugs if they identify them. In addition, the project's team will be able to gather some feedback from users. Participants who submit feedback or bug reports every week and trade at least four times per weevil will be able to receive an unspecified reward. They will also be required to submit a survey that will become available at the end of the beta testing period.The bet is supposed to provide users with a "seamless" trading experience across several chains. FLOKI will be used as the bot's utility token. Half of the fees will be used to burn the meme coin.  Floki Inu, the meme cryptocurrency that was named after Elon Musk's Shiba Inu dog, gained prominence with its rather aggressive market campaign in late 2021. Its adverb on public transport in London and other places attracted some backlash. Despite stiff competition, the meme coin has managed to stick around, currently occupying 53rd place by market capitalization. Over the past 24 hours, it has outperformed other major meme coins, with its price surging more than 18%. The trading bot announcement comes after Floki Inu recently secured a listing on Coinbase International.

JPMorgan Skeptical About SEC Approval of Solana, Other Crypto ETFs - Benzinga

JPMorgan casts significant doubt on the SEC approving additional cryptocurrency ETFs beyond Ethereum ETH/USD, due to concerns over the classification of most cryptocurrencies as securities.What Happened: JPMorgan's managing director and global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou expressed skepticism regarding the SEC's willingness to approve ETFs for cryptocurrencies like Solana SOL/USD, The Block reported. He said the SEC's decision to approve Ethereum ETFs was already a stretch due to ongoing ambiguity about Ethereum's classification as a security.His comments come in the wake of the SEC's approval of spot Ethereum ETFs last week, an event seen as politically motivated by some analysts. The SEC approved 19b-4 forms from various applicants such as Grayscale ETHE, Bitwise, BlackRock BLK, VanEck, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Fidelity and Franklin in a sweeping order. Despite this progress, the actual trading of these ETFs is still contingent on the SEC's final sign-off on S-1 registrations, anticipated to occur in the coming weeks.Panigirtzoglou emphasizes that unless U.S. policymakers enact legislation to clarify that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, the prospect of new crypto ETFs remains bleak. Contrarily, some analysts hold a more optimistic view. Standard Chartered Bank’s Geoffrey Kendrick anticipates the approval of Solana and XRP XRP/USD ETFs by 2025, while TD Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg suggests the possibility of a “basket of crypto tokens” ETF within a year.Read Also: Donald Trump: ‘I Will Ensure That The Future Of Crypto And Bitcoin Will Be Made In The USA’Why It Matters: Analysts have speculated whether other cryptocurrencies like Solana or Dogecoin could be next in line for ETF approval. Some analysts have predicted that Solana might find it challenging to outperform Ethereum following the latter’s ETF approval.With the House of Representatives recently passing the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), colloquially dubbed the "crypto bill," industry experts anticipate a more accommodating regulatory backdrop for cryptocurrencies in the near future.

Daddy Trump (DADTRUMP) to Rally 17,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Daddy Trump (DADTRUMP) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Daddy Trump (DADTRUMP), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 17,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DADTRUMP will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Daddy Trump.



Currently, Daddy Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DADTRUMP on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Trump by entering its contract address – J3XpyA765g6ZxW5QpGRHahvA4uE3m7cq5Gw5CxkGMZCZ – in the receiving field.




DADTRUMP currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Uniswap Foundation Reveals Unaudited Summary Financials As Vote for New Fee Mechanism Approaches - The Daily Hodl


								The foundation behind crypto’s leading decentralized exchange (DEX) is disclosing its crypto assets as a governance vote for a new fee mechanism approaches.
In a new blog post, the Uniswap Foundation has shared its 2024 first-quarter financials in a show of transparency with the Uniswap (UNI) token-holding community.










“On March 31, 2024 we had $41.41 million in USD and stables on hand and UNI 0.73 million (in UNI). The fiat (USD) cash and stables are to be used for grant-making and operating activities and the UNI for employee token awards. The expected runway was through the end of 2025 and was earmarked as follows.
Grants commitments and incentives: $25.77 million to be disbursed in 2024 and 2025. $2.94 Million was reserved for grants committed previously, to be disbursed. The remaining $12.7 million was to be used to fund operations expenses through the end of 2025.”
The anouncement expands on how the Uniswap Foundation has committed over $4 million in grants, in addition to disbursing nearly $3 million in committed grants. The financial summary also shows that the Foundation incurred $1.03 million in operating expenses.
The financial revelations come as a Uniswap community governance vote regarding a potential new autonomous fee collection system approaches this Friday, May 31.
The proposal features a novel mechanism for future votes which aims to make fee adjustments more dynamic, reduce the burden on Uniswap Governance and to maintain the protocol’s “credible neutrality.”
The Uniswap Foundation first introduced the new fee mechanism to the community back in February to boost UNI token holders’ participation in governance votes.

Keeping Up With Memecoins: Caitlyn Jenner Token Soars 50,000%


																Over the weekend, the crypto community saw suspicious behavior from several X accounts. Crypto figures and celebrities were suspected of being hacked after some unusual posts promoting memecoins. 

	Related Reading


Among the celebrities, Olympian and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner saw a turbulent launch of her JENNER token due to hack and back exit scam rumors. Despite the confusing start, the memecoin has soared by 50,000% since its launch. 
The Sunday Of Memecoins Launches
On Sunday, the crypto community was on edge after a series of dubious posts were shared on different X accounts. First, crypto trader GCR’s account was compromised. The hacker shared two posts promoting tokens, but the community quickly figured the posts were unauthorized.  
Later in the afternoon, rapper Rich the Kid and Olympic athlete Caitlyn Jenner shared links to Pump.fun promoting two memecoins, RICH and JENNER. The media personality shared a picture with Former US President Donald Trump and the text “Make America Great Again” alongside the link to the token. 
The community suspected another security breach in both instances. Nonetheless, Jenner claimed the token was not a scam and continued to promote it on her X and Instagram accounts. 
Jenner’s manager, Sophia Hutchins, also posted a video explaining that the token and posts were real. Despite the clarification, the community remained cautious as deepfake videos have become more popular among scammers. 
However, there was some suspicious behavior during the launch, as it was later revealed.

The Gold Medalist Of Scams? 
As the hours passed, crypto investors started to investigate Jenner’s token. According to community member CryptoRoxo, the TV star’s team was “socially engineered by a guy named Sahil.”
Per her post, Sahil Arora was the “middleman” in charge of launching the memecoins and advising Jenner’s team about crypto. After launch, Arora seemingly “dumped all the tokens from the deployer wallet, and he had sniped more on burner wallets.”
Moreover, he asked Jenner’s team to share a post asking the public to send him tokens. As reported by Roxo, the lack of crypto knowledge allowed Arora to trick several celebrity and influencer teams in the past week. 
At the time of this writing, Rich The Kid has deleted all posts related to the token and has “called out” Arora and Caitlyn Jenner for scamming people. Additionally, he claims to be working on launching his token, which is unrelated to RICH and Arora. 
Keeping Up With Jenner Token
 X user 0xPonga compiled the tumultuous price movement of the JENNER token during the launch.
According to the post, JENNER reached an initial $2 million market cap, despite the initial concerns. After Arora’s sell-off, the community reinforced their suspicion of the scam. However, Hutchins’ video seemingly raised the market cap to $8 million.
The token’s price dropped after the deepfake allegations, but the market cap recovered past $20 million after Hutchins addressed the comments in an X Space. Jenner’s manager later hinted at the launch of a new token, which caused JENNER’s price to plummet to a $6 million market cap.
A community member stated his disbelief in Jenner’s willing participation in the pump-and-dump scam. He asserted, “I refuse Caitlin is dumb enough to think the few thousand dollars she made off this is worth the millions in fines/jail time.”

XRP struggles to hold onto $0.52: What's next for the altcoin? - AMBCrypto



XRP’s support is strained due to poor price trends.
Over 1 billion XRP holders are now out of profit.

XRP has faced difficulties in recent days, yet it has successfully stayed above a crucial threshold. How is the total supply faring in terms of profit, and what factors could help maintain its current price range?
XRP rests heavily on support
At the end of the past week, XRP’s price managed to rise above its short Moving Average (yellow line) with an increase of over 1%, bringing its value to around $0.54. This move indicated positive momentum. 
However, a 2.46% decline at the start of this week erased those gains, bringing the price down to around $0.52. 
At press time, its price was trading at about $0.52, with the yellow line now acting as immediate support. 
Source: TradingView
The long Moving Average (blue line) remained a resistance level at approximately $0.58. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that XRP was experiencing a weak bullish trend. 
The RSI was currently on the neutral line and could fall below it if there was a significant price decline.
XRP demand stays flat
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the total number of XRP holders revealed that demand has been relatively flat in recent days, with around 5.2 million holders at the time of writing.
 This number has remained unchanged for the past three days, indicating no rush to accumulate the asset despite the price trends.
Source: Santiment
The trading volume has shown no significant activity recently, with the volume at approximately $793 million. 
Given this low level of activity, the current support might struggle to hold, potentially leading to a price drop soon.
Supply in profit declines
AMBCrypto’s look at the total supply of XRP revealed that the volume of that supply in profit has decreased due to the recent price decline. 
According to a study of the chart on Santiment, approximately 1 billion XRP transitioned from a profitable position to a loss between the 25th of May to press time. 
Source: Santiment

Realistic or not, here’s XRP’s market cap in BTC’s terms

On the 25th of May, the volume in profit stood at over 80 billion XRP, but at the time of writing, it had decreased to around 79 billion. 
This shift resulted in a decrease in the percentage of supply in profit from over 80% to approximately 79% at the time of writing.

Ethereum Bull Run Imminent Following ETF Approvals: Analysts - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsEthereum could soon rocket upwards following the Securities and Exchange Commission's bombshell move to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last week, market analysts say.After months of terse delays and limited engagement, Wall Street’s top regulator gave the green light to a long list of asset managers that had applied to offer an Ethereum ETF. Industry observers now foresee the second-biggest digital coin to shoot up even more in value.Despite some likely downward pressure on the price of ETH due to anticipated outflows from the nearly five-year-old Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), Data firm Kaiko said Monday that the asset's value would rise over the long term. Kaiko said it came to the conclusion by looking at what happened to Bitcoin ETFs following their approval in January: investors who had put money into Grayscale’s GBTC product immediately wanted to cash out, as they couldn’t previously do so. This pushed the price of Bitcoin down—in the short-term.“Once the ETH ETFs launch, it is reasonable to expect selling pressure on ETH from likely outflows or redemptions due to Grayscale’s ETHE, which has been trading at a discount between 6% and 26% over the past three months,” the firm said. “Overall, even if inflows disappoint in the short term the approval has important implications for ETH as an asset, removing some of the regulatory uncertainty which has weighed on ETH’s performance over the past year,” the firm added.Greg Magadini, Derivatives director at blockchain data provider Amberdata, told Decrypt that there is definitely a “bull run here on this news,” even as it’s unclear when the actual ETFs will start trading.JPMorgan, America’s biggest bank, said Friday that it expected the funds to start trading before November. When they do hit the market, Ethereum ETFs—just like Bitcoin funds—will give investors exposure to ETH, the second biggest digital coin by market cap, via shares that trade on a stock exchange.Wall Street’s biggest regulator had been slow to give a response to the applicants and has pushed back decision deadlines. Analysts from the likes of Bloomberg and CoinShares said that such crypto funds would not get the green light by the May deadline. But things changed last week when rumors swirled that the regulator was going to say yes to the proposed products. Days later, it did—without press release or comment, but to the great elation of the crypto community.The price of ETH soared upwards as a result. It hit $3,968 on Monday, marking a more than 30% rise over the past two weeks, per CoinGecko data. ETH still has to climb more than 20% to pass its 2021 all-time high of $4,878. Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

ETF approvals will boost Ethereum's long-term growth despite short-term headwinds - Kaiko Research

Kaiko Research said on May 27 that spot Ethereum ETF approvals are a positive sign for the digital asset’s long-term growth despite potential short-term headwinds.According to Kaiko’s report, the approval has removed much of the regulatory uncertainty around Ethereum’s classification as an asset class.Will Cai, Head of Indices at Kaiko, said the approval means the SEC is implicitly treating ETH as a commodity rather than a security. He added:“[The approvals have] significant and likely positive ramifications on how all similar tokens will be regulated in the US …”Contrary to earlier expectations, the SEC approved the ETFs’ 19b-4 filings on May 23. The agency must still approve S-1 orders. Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to launch in the coming weeks or months.Grayscale may see outflowsDespite its optimism around regulatory changes, Kaiko believes that Grayscale’s ETHE fund will likely experience outflows, which could put selling pressure on ETH as the new funds begin trading.It wrote:“The overall market impact of ETHE’s redemptions is still uncertain.”Grayscale’s ETHE currently has $11 billion in assets under management (AUM). Kaiko anticipates the fund will experience $110 million of average daily outflows after it begins trading as an ETF.By comparison, Grayscale’s Bitcoin fund, GBTC, saw outflows amounting to $6.5 billion or 23% of its AUM during its first month of trading as an ETF.Furthermore, other ETFs’ inflows offset or exceeded GBTC outflows by the end of January.Hong Kong ETFsKaiko also drew attention to Hong Kong’s ETH ETFs. The company said the foreign funds’ “lackluster” launches point to further uncertainty on how ETHE redemptions will impact the market.Based on separate data from Farside, Hong Kong’s spot ETH ETFs have seen $4.4 million in net outflows since their launch in early May.Finally, Kaiko commented on centralized exchange data. ETH’s market depth is close to $226 million, or about 42% below its pre-FTX average levels. ETH is only 40% concentrated on US exchanges, down from 50% in early 2023.Mentioned in this article

ZachXBT Investigation Links Memecoin Team to Hack of Crypto Influencer's Account

                        A new investigation led by ZachXBT on on May 27 implicated the creators of a new memecoin in hacking a crypto influencer’s account, exposing a complex scheme to manipulate cryptocurrency prices.The probe, conducted by the pseudonymous blockchain investigator ZachXBT, uncovered that the team behind CAT, a Solana-based memecoin, hacked the Twitter account of crypto influencer Gigantic-Cassocked-Rebirth (GCR) on May 26. Their goal was to influence the prices of certain cryptocurrencies through deceptive means.Crypto Influencer GCR’s Account Hacked By Memecoin Team According to Investigation 
On Late Sunday, popular crypto influencer Gigantic-Cassocked-Rebirth (GCR) was hacked on his X (formerly Twitter) account. The hacker used GCR’s account to promote ORDI and Luna 2.0 tokens, resulting in brief price hikes. GCR later confirmed the breach, urging his followers to disregard any promotional content from his channels.ZachXBT’s investigation revealed that the team behind CAT memecoin orchestrated the hack, however. ZachXBT noted that the scheme started with their coin launch on May 24, in which the team gained control of more than 63% of the CAT supply. Subsequently, they sold over $5 million worth of CAT, distributing the profits across multiple wallets. Further analysis showed that some funds were funneled into Hyperliquid for trading.Notably, before the hack, the perpetrators opened long positions worth $2.3 million on ORDI (ORDI) and $1 million on Ether.fi (ETHFI).Following the hack, the price of ORDI briefly climbed from around $40 to $44 before falling back to $40, with the scammer securing a profit of approximately $34,000. Additionally, Luna 2.0 experienced a momentary 274% increase. A subsequent post was shared to boost ETHFI, but the market did not respond as expected, resulting in a $3,500 loss for the attackers, who closed the position.“Scammers are low-IQ, as evidenced by the awful execution,” ZachXBT commented on the incident. “People let a scammer farm them for 7 figs just because they purchased an expensive username and made mysterious posts. Stop giving meme coin callers a platform.”It’s unclear whether this group is behind other similar attacks on crypto influencers in recent days.Celebrities’ X Accounts Targeted in SIM Swapping and Bribery Hacks
According to ZachXBT’s findings, the breach was facilitated by a SIM-swapping attack. The method involves scammers deceiving a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a SIM card controlled by the attacker.GCR believes that someone at X.com might have been bribed to provide access to his account, leading to the security breach.“Was notified 2 months ago by someone affiliated with Twitter that bribes had been made to access my account, and beefed up security then,” GCR said. “But there is no security if X employees take money for admin access.”GCR later confirmed the hack, asking followers to ignore any promotional posts.Similarly, late Sunday, Caitlyn Jenner, the reality TV star and Olympic athlete, announced the launch of her cryptocurrency token, JENNER, via a post on her X account. The token was created using Solana’s memecoin platform, pump.fun. By Monday morning, JENNER had achieved a market capitalization of $37 million.In response to hacking concerns, Jenner and her manager, Sophia Hutchins, posted videos on her X account to confirm the memecoin’s legitimacy. Despite these assurances, some users are still skeptical, suggesting the videos could be deepfakes.Similarly, Rapper Rich The Kid promoted a memecoin, RICH, via a pump.fun link in now-deleted X posts. On Monday morning, Rich The Kid released a video claiming his X account had been hacked, resulting in the unauthorized promotion of the RICH token.

96% Of PEPE Holders In Profit After Price Soars 77%: Data


								On-chain data shows more than 96% of PEPE Investors have entered into profits after the massive rally the memecoin has seen over the past week.
96.36% Of All PEPE Addresses Are Now In The Green
As pointed out by cryptocurrency researcher Vicakdo in a post on X, an extreme majority of the PEPE investors are holding some net unrealized profits right now.
Relevant here is the “Global In/Out of the Money” indicator from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which tells us how many addresses were bought at which historical price range of the cryptocurrency.

To calculate the “cost basis” of any investor, the analytics firm uses on-chain data to determine the average deposit price of the coins in any wallet.
Investors who have this price higher than the current spot price are considered to be holding net unrealized losses. IntoTheBlock terms include addresses such as “out of the money.”
Similarly, those with a cost basis lower than the asset’s current value are assumed to be “in the money.” Naturally, investors who are exactly breaking even on their investment at the current price would be considered to be “at the money.”
The chart below shows the current distribution of PEPE investors across all three of these categories, as well as how the different ranges compare in terms of the investors who share their cost basis at them.

Looks like only a negligible percentage of the memecoin's investors are currently holding at a loss | Source: @VictorIwuegbu on X
In the graph, the size of the dot correlates to the number of addresses with their average acquisition price inside the corresponding range. It would appear that all of the large dots are below the current spot price, meaning that most investors are in profit.
More specifically, 96.36% of all PEPE investors are currently in the money. Only 10 addresses are still holding at a net loss, which is negligible compared to the 236,320 addresses in the green.
The remaining percentage of the cryptocurrency’s holder base is currently at the money level, meaning the price is going through a retest of their shared average cost basis.
Generally, a retest of the cost basis is important for any investor, as it can lead to a flip in their profit-loss situation. As such, investors can be more likely to show some reaction when such a retest takes place.
Investors who are holding at a loss may be desperate for an exit opportunity at their break-even, so the asset retesting its price could cause it to feel resistance.
Similarly, profit-seeking holders may instead react by buying when the price retests its neutral level, as they could believe the same level would be profitable in the future. Thus, these levels can provide support.

The strength of these resistance and support levels naturally lies in the number of addresses bought. Large circles are thick with investors, so their retest could cause a significant reaction.
From the chart, it’s apparent that PEPE has little resistance ahead of itself now, so exploring higher levels shouldn’t lead to the coin finding resistance from investors looking to exit at their break-even.
At these extreme profit levels, however, the chances of profit-taking become significant, so the main obstacle to rallies from here on out would be selloffs with the aim of profit realization.
PEPE Price
At the time of writing, PEPE is trading around $0.0000168, up 77% in the past week.

The Whale, Who Bought Shiba Inu (SHIB) 3.5 Years Ago and Has Never Touched His SHIBs Since Then, Sold All of Them Today - Here is the Profit - Bitcoin Sistemi


In an extraordinary display of patience, one cryptocurrency trader turned a modest $2,700 investment into $1.2 million by holding Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens for more than three years.
The investor initially purchased approximately 48.1 billion SHIB on January 31, 2021. The purchase was made on the decentralized exchange Uniswap and cost the investor 2 Wrapped ETH (WETH), which was equivalent to approximately $2,700 at the time.



After remaining dormant for three and a half years, the investor sold his SHIB holdings this morning when the token price rose to $0.000026. The sale was valued at $1.24 million, representing a 47,592% increase over the initial investment. This means a gain of 419 times the original investment.
Shiba Inu was launched as a Dogecoin (DOGE) competitor in late 2020. Memecoin, which did not give the expected performance in the first place, showed an incredible performance in the bull of 2021 and especially in the late 2021. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at a level 70% lower than the all-time high price record it broke in October 2021.

Will Ethereum surge to $4.5k before ETH ETFs go live? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum’s price nears $4,000, influenced by optimism around newly approved ETFs.
Market analysts suggest the potential for Ethereum to reach as high as $10,000 in the current cycle.

In the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving applications for Ethereum [ETH]-based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), the king of altcoins has showcased a vigorous uptick. 
Starting the week on a strong note, Ethereum recorded a 3.7% increase in the last 24 hours, pushing its price near the significant $4,000 mark, a considerable rise from recent weeks.
 At press time, Ethereum traded at $3,899, marking a significant rebound from earlier fluctuations.
Ethereum faces potential $4,500 target
Amid this price movement from Ethereum, Arthur Cheong, CEO of DeFiance Capital, suggested that Ethereum might reach $4,500 before the trading of its spot ETFs commences, potentially in July or August. 
Cheong drew parallels to the 2017 crypto boom, indicating that the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs could attract a substantial retail investor base.
 This is much like its Bitcoin [BTC] counterparts, which are seeing over 70% of positions held by retail investors.
The enthusiasm around Ethereum’s future performance is palpable among investors and market spectators.
However, it’s crucial to note that these projections remain speculative, with the actual market trajectory dependent on numerous factors including broader economic conditions and investor sentiment.
Moreover, the SEC’s current regulatory landscape shows a green light only for the initial 19b-4 requests for Ethereum ETFs, with the essential S-1 forms still awaiting approval. 
Ethereum’s bullish trends
Despite these regulatory hurdles, Ethereum’s market dynamics have shown robust growth, not only in price but also in fundamental on-chain metrics. 
Data from Santiment highlighted a surge in Ethereum’s price volatility, a metric that has significantly increased from its low in the past fortnight to a notable peak today.
Source: Santiment
Notably, as the cryptocurrency’s price volatility is increasing along with its price, this indicates a period of heightened trading activity and interest, often driven by speculative buying.
Adding to the growing interest, Glassnode reported an uptick in the number of new Ethereum addresses, suggesting an expanding network of users. 
Such a rise typically signifies increased market participation, potentially buoyed by the positive market sentiment and broader adoption. 
Source: Glassnode
Moreover, Coinglass’ data revealed a spike in Ethereum’s Open Interest, underscoring an active derivatives market with heightened trading volumes.
 This not only pointed to increased liquidity, but also to a rising speculative interest where traders anticipate forthcoming price movements. 
Source: Coinglass
Nonetheless, an increase in Open Interest also implies greater market leverage, which could amplify both gains and losses, depending on market directions.
Technical analysis of Ethereum’s daily chart revealed that the cryptocurrency has recently breached the $3,700 resistance level flipping it to support, setting its sights on the next significant milestone at $4,000.
 This breakthrough suggests that bullish momentum is strong, potentially driving further gains.

Concurrently, AMBCrypto, citing data from Glassnode, reported a significant decrease in Ethereum’s Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio. 
A reduction in this ratio suggests that the asset is currently undervalued, which may indicate an impending rise in its market price.

								The Uniswap decentralized exchange is approaching a pivotal moment as the community prepares to vote on a proposal to enable protocol fees for the first time since the launch of Uniswap V3.
On Friday, May 31st, Uniswap token holders will begin the on-chain voting process to decide whether to turn on the fee switch in Uniswap V3 pools. 
This would allow the protocol to start collecting a portion of the trading fees generated on the platform, which could then be directed towards rewarding UNI token holders who have staked or delegated their governance tokens.
Uniswap Foundation Gears Up For Decisive Governance Vote
Ahead of the vote, the Uniswap Foundation shared financial disclosures revealing it currently holds $41.41 million in fiat and stablecoins, along with 730,000 UNI tokens. According to Unchained, the foundation plans to disburse $25.77 million of these funds through grants and operating expenses over the next two years.
The decentralized finance (DeFi) community has long anticipated activating the fee mechanism in Uniswap V3, as it would transform the platform’s economics.

All trading fees are directed towards liquidity providers who stake their assets in Uniswap’s liquidity pools. Once the fee switch is enabled, some of these revenues will reportedly accrue to UNI token holders, providing an additional incentive for users to participate in the protocol’s governance.
However, previous attempts to turn on the fee system have met with resistance, with some community members arguing that it could negatively impact liquidity on the exchange. Unchained’s report notes that the proposal’s most recent temperature check vote failed to garner enough support to proceed to a final on-chain vote.
Fee Mechanism Rollout Plan
If the upcoming May 31st vote is successful, the Uniswap team has indicated that the fee mechanism won’t be immediately implemented. Instead, they propose an additional upgrade to streamline the process of setting fee parameters, providing more control and flexibility for the community.
With $3.6 billion in historical data trading fees generated on Uniswap, activating the protocol’s fee switch represents a crucial moment that could reshape the economics and governance dynamics of one of DeFi’s most influential decentralized exchanges.

It is also worth noting that as part of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) increasing regulatory actions against the cryptocurrency industry, Uniswap Labs recently received a Wells Notice from the SEC. 
The Wells Notice is an official communication issued by the SEC to individuals or entities indicating that the SEC staff has completed its investigation and is considering whether to recommend enforcement action against the individual or company.

As of press time, the platform’s native token, UNI, has seen a slight price decline of 1.4%, resulting in a current value of $11.16. However, UNI has gained over 58% in the last two weeks alone after hitting a low of $6.8 on May 15th.

Chainlink Booms Amid Swift Payments Update, Ethereum ETF Rush - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsWith U.S. financial markets on hold for Memorial Day, the long holiday weekend has meant a relatively quiet start to the week for most crypto markets—but one digital asset is booming: Chainlink (LINK).The 14th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, LINK is Monday's best performer out of the top 40 coins. CoinGecko data shows that it has risen more than 10% in the past day, and is now trading for $18.75.LINK is the native token of Chainlink, an oracle project built on Ethereum that's designed to get information in and out of a blockchain—and between chains—securely.The surge is likely the result of LINK holders and supporters feeling bullish on the news dropping that Chainlink would be co-presenting with international payments platform Swift at this week's Consensys conference in Austin, Texas.The collaboration, which bore its first fruits last fall, is one that Chainlink has said proved that "existing infrastructure can merge with the new world of blockchains."Chainlink project co-founder Sergey Nazarov, meanwhile, also expressed broad optimism for Ethereum and all digital assets over the weekend, following the historic approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), saying that it's “really just the beginning.”“Just like many systems and protocols initially list Bitcoin and ETH and then eventually list a multitude of other tokens, that is really the trajectory that we're on,” he said. "It is a sign of a very clear trend that not only Bitcoin, not only ETH, but many other tokens out in the world will end up getting their own ETFs at some point, allowing the larger global capital markets to interact with that financial product.”Chainlink has been on a roll lately, yesterday touting the progress its network has made across nine different blockchains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Base.Earlier this month, DTCC—the biggest settlement and clearinghouse in the U.S.—announced that it used Chainlink's cross-chain interoperability protocol with Wall Street giants JP Morgan and BNY Mellon as part of a tokenization pilot. That pilot, dubbed Smart NAV, allowed Wall Street institutions to make mutual fund data available on public networks.Finally, crypto investment firm 21Shares today featured Chainlink in its latest weekly research newsletter, saying it is “revolutionizing the realm of tokenization” and crediting it with enabling “over $10 trillion in transactions to more than 2000 projects over 22 separate networks.”Despite the renewed interest in the Chainlink protocol, however, LINK still has a long way to go—a more than 64% climb—before it hits its historic 2021 all-time high of $52.70.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Notcoin, Floki and Dogwifhat make the shortlist for best crypto to buy now. Image by cryptonews.com
                        It was a quiet start to the week for global markets, with US markets shuttered for Memorial day, but cryptocurrencies were nonetheless in a good mood, with most major coins rising in wake of pro-crypto commentary from US Presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump last week, and traders hunting for the best crypto to buy now.Further positive commentary from Trump comes following last week’s surprise approval of spot Ethereum ETFs from the SEC.After reaching as high as $70,600 earlier in the day, Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading around $69,600, up 1.5%.Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, was last trading near $3,900 after nearly hitting $4,000 earlier in the session.Traders will be watching for more information on the potential launch date of Ethereum ETFs in the US this week.Focus will also be on Friday’s release of US Core PCE inflation figures.Recent US macro data has eased fears about the Fed delaying rate cuts into 2025.Friday’s data is forecast to show the Core PCE inflation rate dropping to 0.2% from 0.3% MoM.That could further ease those fears, adding further tailwinds to the crypto market. Major coins could soon retest yearly highs.And Ethereum represents a potentially very good value opportunity right now.At current levels below $4,000, it remains around 25% down versus its 2021 record highs.That’s despite Bitcoin back above its 2021 highs, and significant maturation of the market, which is epitomized by ETF approvals.Regulatory uncertainty was probably a major factor holding ETH back, but last week’s ETF approval means all that should be cleared up.An ETH catch-up trade to $5,000 could be on the cards, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now.However, some traders might be hunting for smaller, lesser-known altcoins with a high beta that might outperform.Here are some strong performers on Monday that could be the best crypto to buy now.Best Crypto to Buy NowNotcoin (NOT)The recently launched crypto token of the viral Telegram-based play-to-earn game Notcoin (NOT) is pumping hard on Monday.After rising 55% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap, NOT is now in the top 100 cryptos.NOT’s market cap was last around $850 million, at a price of around $0.008.Notcoin might not stay at a sub-$1 billion market cap for long.It has the support of the TON Foundation (NOT is issued on the Ton blockchain). And it already has a huge user base.In just its first week following the launch of the game in January, it attracted over 5 million players.5 or 10x gains for NOT are very possible. That’s why it could be the best crypto to buy now.Floki (FLOKI)Shiba Inu-themed meme coin Floki is up 22% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.FLOKI’s latest pump will have the bulls salivating. The meme coin has broken back to the north of a short-term upward trend channel.That means a near-term test of its earlier yearly highs above $0.00031 is on the cards.FLOKI could easily be the best crypto to buy now if it can maintain upside momentum. Source: TradingViewWith a market cap of currently $2.6 billion, FLOKI could yet 5x this bull market. That’s why it potentially ranks as the best crypto to buy now.Dogwifhat (WIF)Fellow Shiba Inu dog-inspired meme coin, this one sporting a hat, dogwifhat (WIF) is also pumping on Monday.WIF rallied 13% in the past 24 hours, taking it back to the $3.30s.The meme coin continues to rise within the confines of an upward trend channel.A retest of May highs near $3.70 is soon likely. And should the market’s broader momentum continue, a near-term return to record highs at $4.86 is also likely.Like Floki, WIF also has a small-ish market cap of $3.35 billion. That leaves plenty of room for 5x upside this bull market.WIF is another candidate for best crypto to buy now.Crypto Alternative to Consider – Mega Dice (DICE)
The above coins could easily post 5-10x gains this crypto bull market.But some highly risk-tolerant investors looking for even greater upside potential should check out presale investing.New crypto projects frequently sell their tokens at a discount to early investors as they raise funds for development.If presale investors can identify good projects that end up gaining traction in the market, they can book huge gains.One project that analysts at Cryptonews are a big fan of is Mega Dice Casino.This already well-established crypto casino has launched a presale of its utility token, DICE, and has already raised $1.25 million.DICE holders get big cashback benefits on their wagers and can generate passive income via DICE staking.The crypto casino is also running a $750,000 airdrop to reward early presale investorsPotential investors may want to move quickly, as the DICE price will rise when the $2 million milestone is hit.Mega Dice is also running a referral scheme.Check Out Mega Dice Casino’s Presale

US Regulator Says Bank Will Pay $1,500,000 Settlement for Allegedly Overcharging and Deceiving Hundreds of Customers in Veterans' Loan Scandal - The Daily Hodl


								A US regulator says it’s reached a $1.5 million settlement with a bank that caused “significant harm” to its customers.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) says Bank of England, based in England, Arkansas, deceived veterans into overpaying for services while not delivering the products they were entitled to.










The regulator says one of the bank’s loan production offices (LPOs) falsely told veterans that they could skip multiple loan payments when refinancing a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mortgage loan, violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
The FDIC also says that the employees misrepresented the firm’s relationship with the VA.
“Veterans and their families who were deceived into refinancing their VA loans were overcharged and did not receive the loan products promised, resulting in significant consumer harm… Today’s announcement demonstrates FDIC’s commitment to ensuring consumers are treated fairly, and that those responsible, including the bank and individuals employed by the bank, are held accountable for their illegal actions…
Based on the FDIC’s findings, the bank made $1.9 million in remediation to over 900 harmed consumers.”
Aside from violating the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FDIC says that the bank also violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).
Bank of England has agreed to an Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty (CMP) of $1.5 million. In addition, nine of its former employees have stipulated to individual enforcement actions, and one employee is now banned from the banking industry.
Arkansas Business reports that Bank of England had assets of $412.8 million at the end of 2023, and reported a net loss for the year of $9.95 million, which followed another net loss of $3.86 million in 2022.

Meme Coin PEPE Flips Polygon’s MATIC In Crypto Rankings With Rally To New Record High ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Popular Ethereum-based meme coin Pepecoin (PEPE) soared to a new all-time high earlier today, propelled by the recent approval of spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings in the United States.



The upsurge was enough to overtake Polygon (MATIC) and become the world’s 19th biggest crypto by market value.



PEPE Overtakes MATIC’s Market Cap



Probably the most surprising comeback in 2024 was PEPE’s climb to the top, outpacing multiple “serious” crypto assets. PEPE’s most recent feat was surpassing Polygon’s MATIC.



Cult-favorite PEPE gained as much as 7.7% in its price over the last 24 hours to reach an all-time high of $0.00001717, according to CoinGecko data.



Monday’s gains pushed the frog-themed meme coin to a market capitalization north of $7 billion — $7.139 billion, to be precise. This marks an outstanding 89% appreciation since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted the spot Ethereum ETF applications on May 20.

&nbsp



PEPE’s price jump was bolstered by the meme coin craze that stole the spotlight, as tokens based on memes were the most lucrative in Q1, 2024. However, Ethereum-based meme coins enjoyed an additional boost after regulators changed their tune regarding the approval of ETH ETFs. Traders are expressing their bullishness in Ethereum rather than Bitcoin, especially with the potential institutional demand once the spot ETH ETFs commence trading on U.S. exchanges.  



Other Ethereum-standard memecoins, including cat-themed token Mog Coin (MOG), also registered substantial price growth after the approval of the ETH ETF filings. Dogecoin (DOGE), the godfather of all meme coins, saw a solid — albeit unspectacular — gain on Monday. The token is up 1.7% today, to trade around $0.1715 at press time.



That said, the meme coin sector is the 11th biggest crypto niche by market value, accounting for over $67 billion as of publication time. This is as good a time as any for a reminder that meme coin values are greatly dependent on unpredictable trader sentiment. That indicates that they’re extremely volatile and risky bets, despite turning early investors into multi-millionaires overnight.

Elon Musk’s xAI Partners with Oracle to Build Supercomputer for Next-Gen AI Model "Grok"



                    

Billionaire mogul Elon Musk’s company xAI is planning to build a supercomputer in collaboration with Oracle to support the next version of its “Grok” artificial intelligence (AI) large language model.



According to a report from The Information, citing a presentation shown to xAI stakeholders, the project is described as a “Gigafactory of Compute.” 




This initiative aims to train and develop the next generation of the Grok AI system.



As previously reported by Cointelegraph in April, Musk initially sought to raise $4 billion at a valuation of $15 billion for xAI, indicating that the funds would be used to increase its GPU count from around 10,000 to 100,000. 



Following high investor interest, Musk raised the goal to $6 billion at a valuation of $18 billion.




If The Information’s report is accurate, xAI plans to use the funds to transform the 100,000 GPU cluster into a unified supercomputer architecture, referred to as a “Gigafactory of Compute.” 



This term draws a parallel to Tesla’s “Gigafactories.”

These developments occur as Musk raises expectations about the company’s capabilities and progress toward creating an AI that surpasses human cognitive abilities. 




Speaking at the VivaTech 2024 conference in Paris, Musk expressed confidence that xAI would catch up to industry leaders OpenAI and DeepMind Google by the end of 2024. 



He further stated his belief that an AI system capable of outperforming humans in all tasks would be possible by the end of 2025.



Musk, the world’s richest person, suggested that such an AI system could potentially replace all human employment, prompting existential questions about human purpose. 



As he remarked, “if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?”



However, Musk acknowledged that our future role might be to “give AI meaning.”

Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Will Crash 80% To $0.10, What’s The Trigger?


																The XRP price saw some recovery over the weekend, and has continued to maintain some of this bullish momentum. However, it seems experts do not expect the altcoin to continue its bullish trend, with one crypto analyst predicting that the XRP price is headed for a massive crash.
XRP Price On The Verge Of An 80% Crash
A crypto analyst who goes by the moniker Without Worries on the TradingView website has shared a concerning development for the XRP price. This analysis ,which focuses on the altcoin’s performance over the last two years, suggests that the price is more likely to crash from here than continue its climb.

	Related Reading


According to the crypto analyst, the XRP price had been trading inside an uptrend channel for the last two years. Mostly, this channel has held up, allowing the cryptocurrency to hold onto its bullish trend. However, the analyst explains that this uptrend channel support has now failed, and with the confirmation complete, it points to a price reversal for the altcoin.
Source: Tradingview.com
Furthermore, the crypto analyst points out that this channel support failure came after a could top in the price after the coin broke market structure back in April 2022. Given this, he expects the price to reverse from here and crash to levels not seen since 2020.
The target for this crash sits at the $0.1, according to the analyst. If this happens, it would mean an over 80% crash from the current value of the token, which sits at around $0.5, at the time of this writing.
Could The Uptrend Continue From Here?
Like with any analysis, the crypto analyst explains that there is a scenario in which the XRP price could continue its present uptrend. In such a case, the price would have to continue trading inside the channel and hold its support at this level.

However, he explains that the price action has already exited the channel. Now, the point to hold becomes the $0.3 level. As long as this holds, then the uptrend would continue. “that support not confirm, 10 cents is next,” the analyst explains.
The analyst believes it is possible that the price action does enter the channel and continue to uptrend. However, he points out that this is not probable, given that there is already confirmation of the price failing to hold support.
Nevertheless, at the time of writing, the XRP price is still holding above $0.52 with 1.33% losses in the last day. But it is seeing small gains go 2.82% in the last week and remains the 7th-largest cryptocurrency in the space with a market cap of $29.3 billion.

Bitcoin Rainbow Chart tells you that NOW is the time to buy BTC - Is it? - AMBCrypto



The Bitcoin Rainbow chart entered the “buy” zone after 2020 and 2024 halvings. 
Market indicators hinted at a price decline in the coming days. 

Investors’ confidence in Bitcoin [BTC] has somewhat dwindled as the king of crypto fails to go above $69k. However, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart revealed that BTC was actually mimicking its 2020 trend post-halving.
 Does this mean that BTC is all set to kickstart a rally? 
The right time to buy Bitcoin?
Bitcoin’s price volatility has declined over the last few days. This has caused trouble for BTC, as it was struggling to go above $69k. 
However, investors must not get disheartened, as BTC was mimicking its 2020 post-halving behavior. 
AMBCrypto’s analysis revealed that after months of its third halving, the Bitcoin Rainbow chart revealed that the coin entered the “BUY” zone. After remaining in that zone for a few months, BTC’s price skyrocketed. 
A similar trend was seen in BTC’s 2024 Rainbow chart, as it indicated that the coin was in the buy zone. 
If that is to be considered, then this might just be the last opportunity for investors to buy BTC at a lower price before it moves up and enters the accumulate and HODL zones.
Source: BLOCKCHAINCENTER
AMBCrypto then analyzed BTC’s on-chain metrics to see whether investors have considered buying BTC as suggested by the Rainbow chart. 
We found that its Exchange Outflow dropped last week after spiking on the 24th of May. Its Supply on Exchanges increased, meaning that investors chose to rather sell. 
Source: Santiment
Our look at CryptoQuant’s data revealed that BTC’s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the last seven-day average, further hinting at high selling pressure. 
Apart from this, its Coinbase Premium was red, meaning that selling sentiment was dominant among U.S. investors. 
Bitcoin’s troubles are far from ending 
AMBCrypto then checked whether the rise in selling pressure could result in a price correction. 
We found that investors weren’t following the Bitcoin Rainbow chart as its aSORP was red, suggesting that more investors are selling at a profit. In the middle of a bull market, it can indicate a market top.
 At press time, BTC’s fear and greed index had a value of 74, meaning that the market was in a “greed” phase. Whenever the metric reaches that level, it indicates a price correction.

Like metrics, most of the technical indicators also looked bearish. For instance, the MACD displayed the possibility of a bearish crossover.
 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a decline, indicating a price drop soon. Nonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained bullish as it went northwards.

Analyst Jason Pizzino Names Four Strong Altcoins in the Market Including Solana (SOL) and Pepe (PEPE) - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto analyst Jason Pizzino says he’s looking at four altcoins flashing signs of strength, which include Solana (SOL) and the memecoin Pepe (PEPE).
In a new strategy session, Pizzino tells his 327,000 YouTube subscribers that alongside SOL and PEPE, derivatives platform Pendle (PENDLE) and decentralized GPU rendering blockchain Render (RNDR) have strong-looking market structures.










According to Pizzino, Solana looks great against the US dollar.
“Solana against USD is holding up pretty damn well, we can see the low here and the 50% [retracement level] back down at $154, so still in a relatively strong position.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube
Solana is trading for $162.09 at time of writing, a 3.3% decrease during the last 24 hours.
Moving on to PENDLE, Pizzino says the altcoin could be one of the stronger tokens during the next stage of the cycle.
“Pendle is still in a relatively strong position… I’m not suggesting that it goes straight up, it could take some time here, pause, come back down, and above. The main thing is it’s still above this major 50%, which potentially leads it to be a stronger altcoin come the next stage. If it breaks down, weaker altcoin, that simple.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube
PENDLE is valued at $6.81 at time of writing.
Pizzino then brings up RNDR, saying the altcoin doesn’t look as strong as the rest of the bunch, but that it’s still holding up well against the US dollar.
“Still pretty decent on the chart at the moment and against the US dollar pairing. Just holding out here at $10 bucks, so still holding up relatively well.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube
RNDR is trading for $10.08 at time of writing.
Concluding his analysis with meme asset Pepe, Pizzino says the memecoin is in a clear uptrend that may present good trading opportunities.
“Although [PEPE is] up, it’s still a strong altcoin to have a look at… Earlier this month, when it started to put in higher lows, it tested those tops and then took off from there, so [there are] great trading opportunities when you find strength in a market.”

PEPE is trading for $0.000016 at time of writing.

Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Price For June 2024 | Bitcoinist.com


								Expectations for the prices of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have deviated as a machine learning algorithm has predicted where the price of these two meme coins will be in the month of June 2024. While the machine learning algorithm expects the price of Shiba Inu to do well in the coming month, it has taken a more bearish stance on Dogecoin.
Shiba Inu To Reach Previous ATH Levels In June 2024
The Coincodex machine learning algorithm has taken an incredibly bullish stance on Shiba Inu, especially in the month of June 2024, which is expected to be bullish for the crypto market. According to the prediction, the Shiba Inu price will rally toward its al-time high price of $0.00008 next month.

To be more specific, the machine learning algorithm puts the Shiba Inu price at $0.00008086, which is a 229% increase from its current level at $0.000025. This is only around 10% below its all-time high price of $0.00008845, and if it does play out this way, it could put the meme coin on a path to creating a new all-time high.
On the shorter time frame, the machine learning algorithm also expects the SHIB price to see a rally this week. It puts its 5-day value at $0.00003203, which is a 30% increase from its current level. This means the Shiba Inu price could close the month of May on a high note.
On the longer term, the algorithm expects the SHIB price to hit a yearly high of $0.000117 in 2025, which is a new all-time high from. However, it doesn’t expect a brand new all-time high to be created until the year 2029, when it puts it at a yearly high of $0.000157.
Dogecoin Price Prediction
Unlike the prediction for Shiba Inu, the machine learning algorithm is much more bearish on the Dogecoin price. It puts its June 2024 in the ballpark of $0.143, which is an almost 14% decline in value from the current level DOGE is trading at.
The bearishness is also the same in the short term, with a 5-day price prediction of $0.1646, which is a 1.0% decline. However, it points out that Dogecoin indicators are still bullish with its Fear & Greed Index showing Greed. This means that investors are still willing to put money in the meme coin for now.

The machine learning algorithm expects the price of Dogecoin to hit $0.72 in 2025, and doesn’t see the meme coin’s price reaching above $1 until 2029, where it predicts that the price will reach a yearly high of $1.42 before correcting back downward.
Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Price
At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at $0.00002557, which is a 3.82% increase in the last day. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin price has seen a 1.44% decline in the same time period to trade at $0.16.

                        Altcoin interest may be the driving factor as South Korean interest in alternative cryptoassets continues to rise, a new report has claimed.Per the South Korean media outlet Kyunghyang Games, the findings were published in a report on the nation’s crypto community by the blockchain market consultancy DeSpread.The report’s authors noted that “altcoin preference” is “one of the main features of the domestic virtual currency market.”They added that “users of domestic crypto exchanges mainly trade in altcoins, rather than Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).”Top trading pairs on the South Korean Bithumb crypto exchange on May 27. (Source: CoinGecko)South Korean Altcoin Interest Continues to Rise?
The report’s authors noted that “the influence of the South Korean market” was “noticeable” in “major global altcoin markets with relatively large market capitalization.”DeSpread noted that on August 5, 2023, 90% of the global trading volume of Stacks (STX) took place “on domestic crypto exchanges.”The firm added that at various times, 60% of the global trading volume of the NFT marketplace token Blur (BLUR) has originated from South Korea.Top trading pairs on the South Korean Coinone crypto exchange on May 27. (Source: CoinGecko)Crypto Adoption Showing No Signs of Slowdown?
The report also noted that search engine data showed that South Koreans were more likely to search the web for crypto-related terms than people in the US and Japan in 2023.While Americans and Japanese users were more likely to search the web for stocks-related terms, South Koreans were more likely to search for the term “코인”(literally “coin”). In South Korea, this term is mainly used to refer to altcoins.Proportionally, South Koreans were also more likely to search for “Bitcoin” in 2023 than web users in the US and Japan.The report also found that “mentions of the South Korean crypto market” were increasing on overseas media websites.The authors said there had been a “steady increase” in South Korean crypto news “since 2021.”They noted a sharp rise in South Korea-related coverage in 2022, when reporting “centered on [Do Kwon]” and the Terra ecosystem.News reports have since “shifted focus to the overall crypto ecosystem, including South Korean government regulations,” the authors concluded.

Crypto Companies Warned By New York Attorney General


								As the US government seemingly starts to loosen its grip on the crypto industry, New York Attorney General Letitia James has issued a new warning to the sector. James, who recently announced the NYAG office’s $2 billion settlement with Genesis, reinforced her stance on crypto companies this weekend.

Play By The Rules Or Else…
Last week, The New York State Attorney General’s Office reached a $2 billion settlement with bankrupt platform Genesis Global Capital.
This development came as the resolution of the lawsuit filed by the NYAG’s Office in October 2023. It became the largest settlement against a crypto company in New York. 
Following the settlement, NY Attorney General Letitia James vowed to maintain the office’s regulatory oversight in the sector and the office’s work to safeguard New York investors: 

New York investors deserve the peace of mind that comes from a properly regulated marketplace, and that is something my office will always act to achieve.

Over the weekend, James reinforced her position towards companies in the sector on an X post. The NY Attorney General issued a new warning to the sector, telling all crptocurrency companies operating in the state that they must comply like any other company.

According to the post, those who don’t follow the rules will be in the eyes of the Attorney General’s Office, which has secured over $2.5 billion in settlements from other platforms.   
Crypto Investors Challenge Industry Crackdown 
James’ statement received backlash from US voters and crypto enthusiasts. In replies to her post, many criticized the Attorney General’s decision to single out cryptocurrencies and crypto companies in her warning. 
A user expressed concern over the post, stating: 

If I lived in NY I’d be busting my Butt to find a way to move like so many Businesses & wealthy people already have.

Moreover, another reply questioned the “rules” James was referring to and where a State Attorney General Fit into this issue: 

What “rules” would those be? SEC regulates publicly held companies. Banking regulates portions of the exchanges. How does a state AG fit into this?  Late business registrations?

The user further challenged James’ position after the US government’s recent U-turn. Recently, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, also known as FIT21, was passed by the US House of Representatives “with a very strong showing for democrats,” as the post pointed out. 
As reported by Bitcoinist, Democratic leaders opted not to whip the FIT21 vote last week regardless of the Senior leaders’ sentiments toward the pro-crypto bill.
Despite the uncertainty of the coming Senate vote results, the shift of the Biden Administration, seemingly fueled by the industry’s positive response to Donald Trump’s endorsement of cryptocurrencies, appears to have offered some hope to investors.
Ultimately, this change allows for a clearer and more industry-friendly regulatory framework to be developed in the country.

New Memecoin Santa on Solana (SANTASOL) Will Skyrocket 17,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While SHIB and DOGE Lag



                    

Santa on Solana (SANTASOL) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Santa on Solana (SANTASOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because SANTASOL has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Santa on Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa on Solana could become the next viral memecoin.



Santa on Solana launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Santa on Solana on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa on Solana by entering its contract address – 9aKN9xRfKe9gzfA6cC1aVC88DvRpyjPhyBGEnSyLzR2D – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.




This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTASOL.

Crypto Executives Predict Nvidia Unlikely to Outperform Bitcoin Over Next Decade



                    

Technology company Nvidia‘s (NVDA) outperformance of Bitcoin over the past ten years is not expected to continue into the next decade, according to several crypto executives.



“Near zero chance of Nvidia outperforming Bitcoin over the next 10 years,” argued Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten in a May 24 X post.




“I’d pick Bitcoin over Nvidia for the next ten years, personally,” investment strategist Lyn Alden stated, after pointing out on X that NVDA “is one of the few assets that has outperformed Bitcoin over a 10-year time period.”



From May 23, 2014, to May 23, 2024, Nvidia — known for producing chips used to train and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models — achieved a return of 21,558%, while Bitcoin returned 13,048%, as per Statmuse data.



Over the last three months, following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on January 10, Bitcoin has slightly outperformed Nvidia with returns of 31.7% compared to Nvidia’s 30.2%.



The Kobeissi Letter highlighted that a $10,000 investment in Nvidia stock in 1999 would be worth $25.3 million today, as mentioned in a May 24 X post.

Daniel Sempere Pico speculated whether Nvidia was seen as an even riskier investment back in 2014 when both Bitcoin and AI were less mainstream.



“Don’t know if the whole AI thing could have been predicted by anyone back in 2014, but there were some people who could already see Bitcoin’s potential,” Pico explained.




“If we were to go back to 2014, I wonder which one we’d think is more risky and less obvious to achieve such incredible returns,” he added.



However, the co-founder of 21st.capital, known as “Sina” on X, argued that financial assets generally have broader network effects than AI as more people begin to use them.




“There are no network effects in AI. There are multiple layers of network effects in money,” Sina argued in a May 24 post.



While there are optimistic predictions for Bitcoin’s performance over the next 24 months, some experts also warn of potential significant corrections.



On March 4, Cointelegraph reported that former physics professor Giovanni Santostasi, using his “Power Law” model, predicts that Bitcoin could peak at $210,000 in January 2026 before falling to as low as $60,000 afterward.

Injective (INJ) Buy Signal That Led To 700% & 555% Rallies Forms Again


																An analyst has pointed out that Injective is forming a buy signal that previously led to 700% and 555% rallies for the asset’s price.
Injective Is Forming A TD Sequential Buy Signal On Its Weekly Chart
In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that has formed in the weekly price of Injective recently. The TD Sequential refers to an indicator in technical analysis (TA) generally used for spotting potential points of reversal in any asset’s price.
This indicator involves two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of this setup, candles of the same polarity (green/red) are counted up to nine. Once the nine candles are in, the price may have reached a turnaround point.

	Related Reading


Naturally, the TD Sequential would suggest a probable bottom in the asset if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were red. Similarly, the indicator would signal selling if the phase finished with an uptrend.
After the setup is done, the countdown phase begins. During this second phase, candles of the same type are again counted, this time till thirteen. After the thirteenth candle of the same polarity, the price may be assumed to have encountered another likely top or bottom.
According to Martinez, a TD Sequential signal of the former type has been completed for the Injective’s weekly price. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that reveals this recent signal in cryptocurrency.
The TD Sequential setup appears to have been completed with red candles for INJ recently | Source: @ali_charts on X
As the graph shows, Injective has finished a TD Sequential setup with a downtrend, suggesting that the asset may have reached a point of reversal towards the upside.
In the chart, the analyst has highlighted what happened the last two times the weekly price of the cryptocurrency encountered this signal. The first of these signals appeared to have preceded a rally of over 700%, while the other resulted in a surge of almost 556%.
Thus, given this bullish precedence, it’s possible that the latest TD Sequential buy signal could also lead to another run of sharp bullish momentum for the asset’s price.

	Related Reading


However, it should be noted that the TD Sequential hasn’t always been completely reliable for the coin. As is visible in the graph, the indicator flagged a sell signal partway through the second of the rallies above.
As such, it remains to be seen how the Injective price develops from here on out and whether the TD Sequential buy signal will have an immediate bullish effect, just like it did the last two times.
INJ Price
The Injective has been stuck in consolidation over the past month. Its price is currently trading around $26, right in the middle of the range.

Altcoins to triple in value? Analysts predict a breakout! - AMBCrypto



Altcoin market cap exceeds $1.1 trillion, signaling potential for an ‘altseason.’
Analysts predict a significant surge if resistance levels are broken.

The altcoin market, a segment often shadowed by its bigger cousin Bitcoin [BTC], is currently making headlines with its impressive upward trajectory. 
Over the past two weeks, the collective market capitalization of these alternative cryptocurrencies has surged by more than 10%, climbing from just under $1 trillion to a robust $1.1 trillion. 
This rally has not only caught the eye of traders but has also stirred considerable excitement about the potential onset of an altcoin season.
The technical setup: Breaking resistance could mean breakout gains
In the crypto trading world, patterns and technical levels play a crucial role in forecasting market movements. Recent analysis has honed in on an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forming within the altcoin market. 
This pattern, noted for its reliability in predicting bullish reversals, suggests that if altcoins can decisively break through this formation, there could be substantial market gains. 
According to Trader Tardigrade, a respected figure in the crypto analytics community, this breakout could potentially triple the altcoin market cap.
Source: Trader Tardigrade
Further bolstering this optimistic outlook, Rekt Capital, another seasoned trader, pointed out that the altcoin market cap is on the verge of posting its highest weekly close since early April 2024.
 Such a move could validate the bullish sentiment permeating the market and possibly trigger a new altseason—a period marked by rapid price increases across altcoins.
Source: RektCapital
Technical analyst Yoddha echoed these sentiments, suggesting an “insane pump” in altcoin prices if the market can surpass the looming weekly resistance. The enthusiasm is also shared by Moustache, who alerted his followers to the imminent arrival of ‘altseason.’
The sequence of market movements typically follows a pattern where Bitcoin leads, followed by Ethereum, and then the broader altcoin market. This trend suggests a cascading effect where capital flows from top-tier coins down to smaller-cap tokens, amplifying gains across the board. 
Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading, noted that following a market-wide correction, altcoins corrected by 50-70%. However, he remains bullish, projecting the total market capitalization could ascend to $15 trillion, marking a 450% increase from the current figures.
On the technical front, AMBCrypto’s analysis of the altcoin market cap supports the bullish narrative, noting that the market cap has flipped a significant resistance into support on the daily chart. 

This technical maneuver could pave the way for further gains, especially if the altcoin market cap can breach the next resistance levels at $1.2 trillion and $1.25 trillion. 
Meanwhile, it is worth noting that  the altcoin market dominance is showing signs of increasing momentum, particularly in the wake of Bitcoin’s recent drop in dominance.

FTX Liquidators Ready To Sell Bankman-Fried's $30M Penthouse And Bahamas Real Estate | Bitcoinist.com


								In the wake of the collapse of FTX, the once prominent crypto exchange led by Sam Bankman-Fried, the luxurious real estate holdings acquired by the company will be put up for sale. 
According to a Bloomberg report, the liquidators overseeing FTX’s assets are preparing to sell off the properties acquired during the cryptocurrency exchange’s glory days before its downfall in late 2022. 
FTX’s Risky Real Estate Play
The $30 million Orchid building Penthouse in the Bahamas, where the now-convicted Bankman-Fried lived and worked with his team until FTX’s collapse, is the centerpiece of the real estate holdings now up for sale. But industry experts say FTX may have overpaid for the properties, complicating the prospects of breaking even. 
Real estate brokers and developers point out that FTX’s acquisitions contributed to an inflated market, reportedly analogous to the volatility of the cryptocurrency world during that time. Despite the recovery of FTX’s cryptocurrency investments, the same may not be true for its real estate play in the Bahamas.

Following the collapse, former FTX CEO Ryan Salame and other key figures within the company spent $255 million on properties across New Providence Island. 
These properties include 52 condos, offices, and parcels of land concentrated around luxury developments like Albany. According to Bloomberg, Albany’s allure, known for its exclusivity and amenities catering to the super-rich, attracted FTX’s top executives, who sought to establish a presence in this gated community. 
However, questions arise regarding the potential overpayment for these properties, especially considering the current market conditions.
Potential Profitability Impact
While FTX managed to recover a significant portion of the funds lost during its collapse, the real estate holdings present a more nuanced challenge. The liquidators overseeing FTX’s assets in the Bahamas are expected to initiate the sales process soon. However, brokers express doubts about achieving the desired prices for the properties. 
The luxury real estate market in the Bahamas experienced a 15% price surge the previous year, but the exchange’s specific purchases may not yield the expected returns. Factors such as taxes and fees, coupled with concerns of overpayment, may impact the profitability of the sales.
Earlier this year, PwC, the consulting firm appointed as the liquidator for the firm’s assets in the Bahamas, sought proposals from real estate brokers to market and sell the properties acquired by Bankman-Fried and his team. 
The sales process is anticipated to commence in the coming months, with brokers expecting a challenging environment for achieving optimal returns. 
While the exact appraised values of the FTX properties remain undisclosed, Bahamians have a consensus that the sales would help move past the Bankman-Fried saga and allow the country to focus on its forward progress.

Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried has been sentenced to 25 years in prison and was recently transferred to a temporary detention center in Oklahoma. However, Bankman-Fried is seeking a different outcome, hoping for a reduction in his sentence by officially filing an appeal of the conviction.

                        A major Chinese bank, Industrial Bank, will reward digital yuan-using customers with carbon points as it targets further CBDC adoption.Per CICC Online, the bank announced that verified digital yuan wallet users can now obtain “personal carbon account points” when they use its app to make purchases with the CBDC.Major Chinese Bank: Digital Yuan and Green Finance Are Complimentary
Customers will accrue carbon points when they make e-CNY retail payments via the app.They can also get points by using digital yuan tokens to make “fund purchases and credit card payments.”Several Chinese banks launched personal carbon points platforms last year in a bid to boost green finance and cut emissions.The program is part of the nation’s pledge to become carbon-neutral by 2060. Local governments use the program to reward commuters for using public transport instead of cars.Citizens can also get points by joining tree-planting efforts and recycling drives.They can then swap these points for prepaid travel card credits and shopping vouchers. A spokesperson from the Digital Yuan Department at Industrial Bank said:“Digital RMB wallets and carbon accounts are promoting innovative development in digital and green finance in China. Integrating [green finance with the digital yuan] will have a synergistic effect. It will help build a green economy and a new digital yuan ecosystem.”The bank said that it was looking to expand its green finance-digital yuan operations, and added that it had already broken new ground.In Fuzhou, the bank says it used the CBDC to power a Fujian Province first. Industrial Bank took part in a digital yuan-funded marine fishery carbon sink purchase.In Suzhou, meanwhile, the bank said it had issued some $967 million worth of digital yuan green finance-related loans.Industrial Bank says its customers have opened nearly 7.3 million digital wallets, which they have used to transact more than $41 billion.The digital yuan made its official debut in 2020, when it rolled out in four cities. The pilot has since extended to 27 mainland cities and provinces, in addition to Hong Kong and Macau.Industrial Bank is a majority state-owned bank based in Fuzhou, Fujian Province. Last year, the bank placed 60th in the Forbes Global 2000.

The price is now trading near $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $0.5265 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls remain active above the $0.5220 zone.

XRP Price Holds Support
In the past few sessions, XRP price traded in a positive zone like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the bears were active near the $0.540 and $0.5420 resistance levels.
The recent high was formed at $0.5405 and the price is now correcting gains in a range. There was a move below the $0.5340 support zone and the price spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5234 swing low to the $0.5405 high.

If there is a close above the $0.5450 resistance level, there could be a steady increase toward the $0.5550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5720 resistance.
More Downsides?
If XRP fails to clear the $0.5420 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5265 level and the trend line.
The next major support is at $0.520. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.520 level, the price might gain bearish momentum. In the stated case, the price could decline and retest the $0.5120 support in the near term.

Overpriced Pizza (OVERPIZZ) to Rally 14,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Overpriced Pizza (OVERPIZZ) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Overpriced Pizza (OVERPIZZ), a new Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is poised to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because OVERPIZZ has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Overpriced Pizza can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Overpriced Pizza could become the next viral memecoin.



Overpriced Pizza launched with over $4,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Overpriced Pizza on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Overpriced Pizza by entering its contract address – G443b8EoLKhAvoyMErW9Tqum2pR4Z57EPMQzVJMKS3Sf – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like OVERPIZZ.

Daddy Trump (DADTRUMP) to Rally Over 17,000% Ahead of KuCoin Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Daddy Trump (DADTRUMP) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Daddy Trump (DADTRUMP), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 17,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




DADTRUMP will be listed on KuCoin, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Daddy Trump.



Currently, Daddy Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy DADTRUMP on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Trump by entering its contract address – J3XpyA765g6ZxW5QpGRHahvA4uE3m7cq5Gw5CxkGMZCZ – in the receiving field.




DADTRUMP currently has a market cap of just under $10,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

With this, it became the best-performing cryptocurrency not only in the last 24 hours but also throughout the previous week.NOT outperformed some of the leading tokens in the hot memecoin space. Floki, Bonk, and dogwifhat notched up gains of 10.9%, 6.69%, and 6.34% at the time of publication. CryptocurrencyGains +/-Price (Recorded at 10:20 p.m. EST)Floki FLOKI/USD+10.93%$0.0002676Bonk BONK/USD+6.69%$0.00003813dogwifhat WIF/USD+6.34%$3.25NOT's trading volume jumped more than 3X in the last 24 hours to $979 million, surpassing BONK and Shiba Inu SHIB/USDWhy It Matters: NOT's explosive growth comes amid the rising popularity of Notcoin, a play-to-earn Web3 game hosted on Telegram.

"Long term depends on the market, but most probably also bullish. Dips are for buying," the analyst added. Meanwhile, The Open Network TON/USD, the layer-1 chain on which NOT is based, has raked in more than $300 million in deposits as of this writing, according to DefiLlama. Photo by Igor Faun on ShutterstockRead Next: Here’s How Much MAGA Coin Has Jumped Since The Ex-President Said, ‘If You’re In Favor Of Crypto, You Better Vote For Trump’
