Bitcoin Faces Resistance Hurdle: Will 2024 Be the Breakout Year?


							

Bitcoin faces resistance after historical trends post-halving, hinting at short-term volatility.



Tom Lee’s bullish $150,000 BTC forecast for 2024 stems from macroeconomic shifts and Fed policies.



Despite short-term dips, Bitcoin’s potential for significant gains aligns with broader analyst sentiment.




Bitcoin is currently facing resistance at its upper range, indicating potential volatility in the short term. According to a recent analysis by Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has historically never been ready to break out of a re-accumulation range so soon after a halving event. As Bitcoin prices struggle at this high resistance, the cryptocurrency market remains in a state of flux.







The current Bitcoin price stands at $67,264.08, reflecting a 3.13% decline in the past 24 hours. Trading volume in the same period reached $43.099B. Despite the recent dip, Bitcoin’s market capitalization remains robust at $1.325T. The circulating supply of Bitcoin is 19.702M BTC, with a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC.



However, veteran crypto market commentator Tom Lee maintains a bullish outlook for Bitcoin in 2024. In an interview with CNBC earlier in May, Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, reiterated his optimistic price prediction for Bitcoin, forecasting it could reach $150,000 by 2024.







Lee’s bullish stance is not without reason. He believes Bitcoin is still early in an upcycle, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could achieve a six-figure price within the year. This projection implies a significant rise from the current all-time highs, which peaked in March before declining to $56,000 at the start of May.



Lee’s optimism is underpinned by anticipated macroeconomic changes in the US. He points out that the Federal Reserve’s recent dovish stance on interest rate cuts is a crucial factor for risk-asset traders. Lee suggests that the market’s recovery is partly due to the Federal Reserve’s softer stance on interest rates, which he views as beneficial for Bitcoin’s price trajectory.



 
 




It is to be noted that Tom Lee gained attention in the cryptocurrency industry for his strong Bitcoin price projections. Although not all of his predictions have come true, his long-term vision has consistently rewarded Bitcoin investors. Lee’s recent estimate follows the opinions of many analysts, who believe Bitcoin is poised for tremendous growth in coming years.

Ethereum (ETH) Statement from Consensys, Which Filed a Lawsuit with the SEC! "He Both Praised and Criticized!" - Bitcoin Sistemi

As you may remember, Consensys, one of the biggest names in the Ethereum ecosystem, filed a lawsuit against the SEC last April on the grounds that it was trying to qualify Ethereum as a security.
In this case, Consensy asked the court to find that ETH is not a security.



While the case was ongoing, the SEC approved spot Ethereum ETF applications and made a major decision.
While this decision was welcomed by the market and investors, an ETF statement came from Consensys.





Accordingly, Consensys stated that they found the ETF approval decision correct and welcomed it, but argued that the SEC's sanctions against the cryptocurrency industry were unfair and hindered innovation.

“Regarding today's SEC decision:
While Consensys welcomes today's decision to approve ETH Spot ETFs as a step in the right direction, this seemingly last-minute approval is yet another example of the SEC's troubling ad hoc approach to digital assets.
No industry, market or asset other than the cryptocurrency industry is subject to such willful regulatory abuses. This restrictive stance by the SEC is unfair to market participants, contrary to the rule of law, and stifles innovation.
Today's approval demonstrates that the SEC considers ETH to be a commodity and not a security, contrary to the negative stance it continued to take prior to this week's events, as explained in our recent lawsuit against the SEC.
“We will continue to fight for definitive regulatory clarity on Ethereum, and we are pleased to see Congress' tremendous bipartisan effort to provide clear and sensible regulation.”

XRP Declares War On Uncertainty: Analyst Predicts Breakout


																XRP, a crypto that has faced regulatory challenges, is back in the spotlight with analyst Dark Defender predicting a potential price surge by mid-2024. Defender’s analysis hinges on a confluence of factors, including technical indicators, anticipated regulatory changes, and broader market trends.

	Related Reading


Technical Breakout Aligns With Regulatory Shift
Utilizing Fibonacci Time Zones and Elliott Wave Theory, Defender forecasts a significant price increase for XRP before July. This technical prediction coincides with potential regulatory developments that could reshape the cryptocurrency landscape.

The recent passage of the FIT21 Bill by the US House of Representatives is seen as a significant step towards establishing clearer regulations for digital assets. This could create a more welcoming environment for cryptocurrencies like XRP, potentially leading to wider adoption and increased investor confidence.

Investors Embrace Crypto, But Newcomer Shakes Things Up
The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a growing appetite from institutional investors, with Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) increasingly incorporating digital assets into their offerings.
This trend signifies growing recognition of the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies and could provide a significant boost to XRP’s value. The inclusion of cryptocurrencies in ETFs validates their legitimacy and opens the door for a wider pool of institutional capital to flow into the crypto space.
XRP is currently trading at $0,52. Chart: TradingView
Legal Battle Looms Large, Verdict Could Impact XRP’s Trajectory
Perhaps the most significant factor influencing XRP’s future lies in the ongoing legal battle surrounding its regulatory status. A verdict, expected any day now, could have a profound impact on the currency’s trajectory.
A favorable outcome could eliminate a major hurdle for XRP, paving the way for wider acceptance and market growth. Conversely, an unfavorable verdict could create new regulatory roadblocks, hindering XRP’s progress.

	Related Reading


The legal battle casts a long shadow over XRP’s future. Investors should be mindful of this uncertainty, but they should also consider the positive technical indicators and the changing regulatory landscape. The coming months will be crucial for XRP, and the outcome of the lawsuit could very well define its role in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Ethereum Set For 60% Rally Following ETF Approval, Says Expert: 'The Market Is Expecting Fireworks' - Benzinga

The price of Ethereum ETH/USD could soar by 60% following the approval of the first-ever Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds by U.S. regulators, according to a leading crypto trading firm.What Happened: The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first Ethereum spot ETFs in the U.S. This decision could lead to a significant surge in the value of the second-largest cryptocurrency, according to a post on Telegram from the crypto trading firm QCP Capital.QCP Capital predicted a 60% increase in the value of Ethereum after the ETF approval. The news of the potential approval has already caused Ethereum’s price to surge by nearly 20% since Monday.“With Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,” QCP wrote. See Also: Bonk, Pepe Outstrip Gains Of Bitcoin, Ethereum Amid Searing Hot Rally — Beat Biggies Dogecoin And Shiba Inu In Trading VolumesQCP Capital also pointed out that the approval of Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs in January led to a significant surge in Bitcoin’s value. Since then, Bitcoin has reached an all-time high of over $73,000. This has also resulted in a substantial increase in Ethereum purchases, with CryptoQuant data showing an 85% rise in Ethereum taker buy volume since May 1.Why It Matters: The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. The approval of Ethereum ETFs would open the door for mainstream investors to access the cryptocurrency, potentially leading to a surge in its value. This development could also affect other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, which may find it harder to outperform Ethereum after the ETF approval.Moreover, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could have political implications. As Cathie Wood predicted, crypto could be a significant issue in the 2024 White House race. The approval of Ethereum ETFs could further solidify the importance of crypto in the political landscape.Additionally, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could bring back the “animal spirits” to the crypto market, as predicted by a crypto trader. Price Action: Ether is trading at $3,672, down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours, however, the coin is up nearly 20% this week and 56.08% up year to date.

Long-term Bitcoin bull and MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has published a Bitcoin message to the BTC community after the news spread about the U.S. Securities and Exchange issuing approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds.Saylor still expects Bitcoin to beat Ethereum and all other rivals on the market, according to his tweet.Saylor's "Bitcoin Godzilla" messageProminent Bitcoin maximalist Saylor posted a “BTC bullish” response to the rejoiced crypto community: “All your models are destroyed when Godzilla arrives. #Bitcoin,” along with an image of the movie-based monster crashing everything around itself.The Godzilla image has a BTC mascot in the bottom right corner as if hinting at the immense power of Bitcoin that its followers believe in and the future impact on the market they expect to see. Bitcoin maxi Samson Mow confirms bearish ETH outlookAnother Bitcoin maximalist, CEO of Jan3 Samson Mow, also responded to the Ethereum ETF approval negatively.Mow believed that the odds of spot Ethereum ETFs getting approved had been always 50/50. He reckons that the only real reason that stands behind the approval is that the SEC had pushed themselves into a corner, so they “had no choice but to let it through.” Mow reminded that, for him, ETF approval “does not change the bearish outlook for Ethereum at all.” Earlier this week, Mow tweeted that now is the last chance to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC.On Thursday, the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, responded to the ETF news with an almost 5% increase, surging to the $3.937 level. However, a rebound followed, taking Ethereum down by 6.86%. At the time of this writing, ETH is changing hands at $3,664 per coin.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 75%+ Rally for Top-10 Altcoin, Maps Path Forward for Bitcoin and One Ethereum Rival - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is forecasting that one blue-chip altcoin could rally by double-digits.
The analyst pseudonymously known as The Crypto Dog tells his 782,000 followers on the social media platform X that Dogecoin (DOGE) could hit a price of $0.30, about 78% above the current level if Bitcoin (BTC) records a new all-time high.










“Feel pretty good about DOGE actually.”

Dogecoin, currently the ninth-largest crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $0.169 at time of writing.
Turning to Bitcoin, The Crypto Dog says that the largest digital asset by market cap could be on the cusp of another bullish cycle.
“We might be getting to the spot where you can hold BTC long for a few weeks into continual new highs.
Fingers crossed, it’s been a while.”
Next up is the Ethereum (ETH) competitor NEAR Protocol (NEAR). The Crypto Dog says that the layer-1 blockchain is on the verge of skyrocketing past the 22-month high of $9.10 reached in June, around 15% above the current price.
“Not wrong, just early.
NEAR about to put in that move past new yearly highs”

NEAR is trading at $7.91 at time of writing.
The pseudonymous analyst also offers his take on layer-1 blockchain Saga (SAGA). According to The Crypto Dog, SAGA could be on the cusp of ending a downtrend that started after hitting an all-time high of $7.89 in April soon after the inaugural listing of the token.
“SAGA downtrend may be ending soon, one to watch.”

SAGA is trading at $2.28 at time of writing, around 71% below the all-time high.

Crypto Bounces Back, But Stablecoins Emerge As Investor Safe Haven


								The once-frenzied cryptocurrency market seems to be taking a deep breath. Forget moon shots, investors are increasingly seeking a crypto sanctuary: stablecoins. These cryptocurrencies are pegged to real-world assets like the US dollar, offering a haven from the wild price swings that plague Bitcoin and its brethren.

Dominant Tether Faces Rising USDC Star
The trend is undeniable. Sentiment analysis firm Santiment reveals a dramatic rise in wallets holding stablecoins, especially in 2024. This newfound love affair is evident in the growth of USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle.
USDC boasts a staggering 14% increase in active wallets this year alone, potentially dethroning the reigning champion, Tether (USDT). While Tether maintains a sizable lead with nearly 6 million active wallets, USDC’s impressive growth suggests a changing of the guard. Investors are clearly seeking diversification within the stablecoin market, aiming for a more balanced and secure ecosystem.


Emerging Markets Seek Stable Refuge
This allure of stablecoins isn’t limited to established markets. They’re finding fertile ground in economies grappling with currency fluctuations. While the US gobbled up more than $25 billion in stablecoins in January this year alone, the real story lies in countries like Turkey, the European Union and the US, to name a few.
These economies are witnessing a significant surge in stablecoin adoption relative to their GDP. This suggests that stablecoins are more than just a tool for sophisticated investors; they’re a potential lifeline for those battling volatile national currencies.

By offering a stable store of value and a reliable medium of exchange, stablecoins provide a level of financial security and accessibility that traditional cryptocurrencies have struggled to achieve in these regions.
Beyond TradFi: Stablecoins Fuel DeFi Boom
The stablecoin revolution isn’t confined to the sidelines of the crypto arena. It’s having a profound impact on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms as well. MakerDAO’s DAI, a decentralized stablecoin, has witnessed a significant rise, with over 500,000 active wallets.

This surge highlights the growing importance of stable assets within the DeFi landscape. Investors are using stablecoins to mitigate the risks associated with the inherent volatility of other cryptocurrencies within DeFi protocols.

A Symbiotic Dance Between Risk And Reward
The rise of stablecoins might be the harbinger of a new era for cryptocurrencies – one where innovation and stability coexist. As investors seek a middle ground between high-risk, high-reward opportunities and the need for financial security, stablecoins have emerged as a crucial bridge.

Solana mulls 50% priority fee burn cut: Here's what it means - AMBCrypto



Solana proposes to reward validators full priority fees by scrapping 50% burn.
Community divided over the proposal as priority fee-induced inflation and validator rewards interests compete. 

Solana [SOL] community remains divided on the proposal to remove the 50% priority fee burn and fully reward validators. 
The proposal, SIMD-0096, aims to incentivize validators by paying them 100% priority fees, as opposed to the current 50% reward and 50% burn. 
For the unfamiliar, Solana’s priority fees are paid by users with urgent transactions who wish to avoid network congestion. In return, validators can prioritize and fast-track their transactions, a critical way Solana mitigates network congestion. 
The problem with Solana’s 50% priority fee burn removal
Notably, the current method of 50% reward and 50% burn on SOL earned as priority fees is deemed deflationary. 
If the proposal passes, validators will receive 100% priority fees and none burnt, which will mean more SOL issuance and inflationary pressures. One opponent to the proposal noted, 
‘Solana’s inflation is about to increase as validators vote to pay themselves more. More traffic on SOL network? More tokens from thin air go to validators that will dump on you.’
One of the leading Solana validators, Stakewiz, recently registered reservations about the proposal, citing its potential to surge SOL’s issuance by 4.6% and drive inflation. Instead, the validator proposed a new fee distribution mechanism. 
‘I would strongly support holding off on the activation of SIMD-0096 until a block fee distribution mechanism is available.’
However, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakavenko noted that such a mechanism would take ‘6 months to 1 year’ to become operational. 
So why the proposal, and why now? You might ask. 
Apparently, the current 50-50 arrangement allows other validators to engage in opaque and ‘off-chain side deals.’ 
This, per Solana core dev Anza, could sometimes be costly to users as some cough higher fees than the required 50%. The proposal could solve this problem, per Anza. 
The sentiment was echoed by another user, an engineer at Firedancer, an upcoming Solana client software, who supported the proposal but maintained it won’t necessarily ‘cure side deals.’
However, Stakewiz maintained its opposition to the proposal for lack of data-driven insights on the same. 
“I’m generally for a removal of priority fee burn, but I’m against this proposal for its lack of data-driven reasoning and failure to address the concern of priority fee inflation.’
The move is seen as more beneficial to validators than SOL users. It remains to be seen how SOL’s price will be affected after the proposal outcome.

Bitcoin Message From Michael Saylor After Ethereum ETF Approval: 'Bitcoin Will Be Crushed!' - Bitcoin Sistemi

MicroStrategy founder and leading Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor has issued a strong message to the Bitcoin community in response to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s recent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Michael Saylor Posts “Bitcoin Godzilla” Message Following Ethereum ETF Approval
Saylor, a well-known long-term Bitcoin bull, shared his unwavering belief in Bitcoin's dominance on 'X'.


His message, dubbed “Bitcoin Godzilla”, suggested that Bitcoin will continue to outperform Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in the market.
In a characteristically bold move, Saylor wrote: “When Godzilla comes, all your models disappear. #Bitcoin,” and shared an image of the famous movie monster Godzilla wreaking havoc.





The image also featured a small BTC mascot in the bottom right corner, symbolizing the immense power and market influence that Bitcoin enthusiasts like Saylor expect the cryptocurrency to have.

Supporting Saylor's views, Jan3 CEO and another staunch Bitcoin maximalist, Samson Mow, responded negatively to the Ethereum ETF approval.


“The odds of Spot Ethereum ETFs being approved were always 50/50,” Mow said, suggesting that the SEC approving Ethereum ETFs was almost inevitable due to regulatory pressures.
Mow reiterated his bearish stance on Ethereum, emphasizing that the ETF approval does not change his negative outlook on the cryptocurrency.





Earlier this week, Mow reinforced his position by tweeting that this was the last opportunity to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC.

UK’s oldest news magazine slams ‘Bitcoin a threat to us all’ and a ‘Ponzi scheme’


    The traditional British magazine, The Spectator, may have contributed to another “Bitcoin obituary” in 2024, slamming it as a threat and a “Ponzi scheme.”



In a scathing article published on May 24, The Spectator‘s Ross Clark criticized Bitcoin’s (BTC) resurgence for retail investing. Particularly, Clark highlighted the cryptocurrency‘s volatility and ability to create and destroy fortunes rapidly, questioning its intrinsic value and stability.



The author pointed out Bitcoin’s remarkable recovery since January, despite the conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX. Moreover, Clark attributed this recovery to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that simplifies Bitcoin for retail investors.







While acknowledging the fund’s role in leveling the playing field, the author expressed concerns about its potential financial repercussions. He likened the mainstream accessibility of Bitcoin gambling to bookmakers setting up shop in every living room.



Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?



Notably, Clark emphasized that Bitcoin is a zero-sum game, where paper fortunes can be made but not realized simultaneously. As written, he argued that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value and is essentially a tech-reinvented Ponzi scheme.




“In that situation, those who were quick to sell would become rich at the expense of those who were slow to sell. Bitcoin earns no income and has no intrinsic value – it is, for all its cleverness, really nothing more sophisticated than a tech reinvention of the Ponzi scheme.”
– Ross Clark, for The Spectator




The author warned that easier Bitcoin access could lead to financial disasters and wealth transfer from gullible to fleet-footed investors. Although the price has stabilized recently, Clark cautioned against ruling out another speculative mania.



In closing, the Spectator article highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience through multiple bubbles, surpassing historical speculative assets like tulip bulbs and South Sea Company shares. Clark suggested that the Bitcoin spot ETF might inflate a fourth bubble, potentially destroying the wealth of even more people.



Bitcoin obituaries



Throughout its history, Bitcoin has been deemed a failure and declared dead by critics and skeptics. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s price has increased by $21,000 since the last time it happened in 2024.



From traditional finance investors to business owners, government entities, and other high-influence figures, Bitcoin “has died” 477 times since 2010. This data is from 99Bitcoins’ obituaries.



Recently, the leading cryptocurrency was declared dead by the European Central Bank (ECB) in a blog article reported by Finbold. On this occasion, BTC was trading at $51,304, and it was up over 30% to $67,000 by press time.



Bitcoin obituaries. Source: 99Bitcoins



Bitcoin criticisms and points of failure



Despite the hyperbolic nature of a “Bitcoin death” statement, many of its obituaries contain thoughtful and valid criticisms.



Unfortunately, the BTC advocates create memes and personal attacks against their critics instead of considering the fundamental thesis behind their occurrence. This is a cultural inheritance from a movement called “toxic maximalism.”



Conversely, some critics have historically failed to demonstrate part of their criticisms, often driven by emotion and conflicts of interest.



Therefore, investors must be open to profoundly studying and understanding Bitcoin or other assets they are investing in. Bitcoin may not “die” and may not be a “Ponzi Scheme,” as The Spectator stated in its last article, but it certainly has points of failure and potential improvements.

Ethereum ETF approval sees minor decline in broader market, $400M in liquidations - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            After the dust settled on the craze around the SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETFs, the crypto market saw high levels of volatility. Data from CoinGecko shows that the top 20 digital assets (by market cap, excluding stablecoins) saw losses of roughly 3% each. Broadly, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) saw declines of 3.4% and 3.5%, respectively. BTC is now playing at $67.3K, with Ethereum cruising down at the street at $3.6K. At the time of writing, market-wide liquidations saw around $400 million in outflows.The market’s subdued performance resulted in over 107,000 crypto traders suffering losses exceeding $400 million. According to Coinglass liquidation data, ETH long traders, who expected the ETF news to boost the digital asset’s price, bore the brunt of these losses, totaling around $107 million.The largest single liquidation was a $12.4 million long bet on Ethereum on the Binance exchange. Bitcoin traders also lost approximately $75 million during the same period.Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, noted that the market had already priced in the Ethereum spot ETF approval, evidenced by the narrowing discount between Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH in the days leading up to the decision.https://twitter.com/jjcmoreno/status/1793706458393002203This analysis suggests that  ETH ETF approval was a “sell-the-news” event, with investors who anticipated the approval positioning accordingly. Notably, the past week saw ETH’s price rising by roughly 21%, with the Ethereum futures market hitting a one-year high of 3.6 million ETH.Muted market performance was also attributed to the delayed launch of the ETFs. While the SEC has approved the ETFs, they have yet to grant clearance for their launch, which requires an approved S-1 filing, though this is considered more of a formality. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart explains that the S-1 approval process could take a couple of weeks or longer.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Just Lost Critical Price Level

All struggles aside, Shiba Inu failed to gather any worthwhile positioning over and above the $0.000024 level and went down again, opening the doors to the bears. There is the potential for a bearish crossover of the 50-day and 100-day EMAs after this latest dip; otherwise, a sour picture will be painted.This has left SHIB investors anxious after the token plunged under the important support level, recently seen at $0.000024. This was a critical support level in light of igniting the price uptrend, but the break now opens the token to greater risks. With the current price quoted at $0.00002391, the possibility of more crashes looks imminent.The other, more technical, indicator to watch closely is the moving averages. The 50-day EMA is about to cross below the 100-day EMA, which is not as bearish a death cross but still a strong signal of an upcoming trend aggravation. Such a pattern is usually a very strong bearish indicator and signals that the downward trend may either continue or worsen.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe trading volumes have declined of late, suggesting that buyers are not interested at these levels. This lack of demand may prove difficult for SHIB to recover and make its way above the $0.000024 price level in the near term. In addition, the Relative Strength Index has fallen below the 50 level.There is, however, some hope. SHIB has been resilient before, and cryptocurrencies are volatile assets, so market sentiment can turn around in a few minutes. If price can hold in and around the next area of possible support — around $0.000021 — then there might still be hope of a move to the upside.As always, stay cautious and avoid FOMO and try to stay composed as the market is currently performing in a very unpredictable way.

RIP Kabosu: The Shiba Inu Who Inspired Dogecoin and Meme Culture


							

Kabosu, the Shiba Inu famous for the “Doge” meme and Dogecoin, passed away



A farewell party for Kabosu will be held on May 26 at Flower Kaori in Narita City



Analysts predict DOGE might drop initially but could rally due to strong emotional




Kabosu, the Shiba Inu who inspired the “Doge” meme and Dogecoin, passed away peacefully on May 24 at 18 years old. Her owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the news on her blog, expressing gratitude for the love and support she received over the years. A farewell party for Kabosu, also known as “Kabo-chan,” will be held on May 26 at Flower Kaori in Narita City.



Kabosu first garnered attention in 2010 when Sato posted photos of her on her blog. One particular image, showing Kabosu with a skeptical and curious expression, quickly went viral. This image became the “Doge” meme, often accompanied by phrases in broken English and Comic Sans font.



By 2013, Dogecoin was created, using Kabosu’s image as its official logo. Initially intended as a joke, Dogecoin evolved into a popular cryptocurrency. It has been involved in several charitable initiatives, including funding for clean water projects and the Jamaican bobsled team.



The crypto community and Kabosu’s fans have expressed their condolences. Tributes and favorite memories of the internet legend have flooded social media. In December 2022, Sato informed the community about Kabosu’s health issues, prompting an outpouring of support. Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, asked his followers to support Kabosu. One user even offered to cover any expenses for her treatment.



Following Kabosu’s passing, analysts predict a market reaction. According to Altcoin Sherpa, a crypto analyst, DOGE might experience a drop but could also spur a bullish sentiment. This could lead to Dogecoin rallying to $1. Despite the initial drop, the community’s strong emotional connection to Kabosu could drive a positive market response.







Kabosu’s impact has extended beyond cryptocurrency, even influencing political campaigns. For instance, U.S. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign hired a “master of memes.” This role involves managing relationships with digital media companies, podcasts, and meme pages on social media.



In the wake of Kabosu’s passing, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s market performance has been impacted. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price has fallen 6.79% in the daily charts, 4.42% in the weekly charts, and 12.28% over the past month. Dogecoin (DOGE) has fallen 5.7% in the daily charts but is up 2.45% over the previous week.









Kabosu’s influence has demonstrated the power of the internet memes in shaping digital and political landscapes. Kabosu’s legacy on the other hand, as the face of Dogecoin, symbolizes community spirit and continues to inspire meme culture.

Another victory for Ripple v. SEC? Coinbase relists XRP in New York


    Even though both Coinbase and Ripple are struggling with regulatory and legal issues in the United States, the cryptocurrency exchange has relaunched XRP trading in New York, in a move that many might take as Ripple’s (another) win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Indeed, Coinbase has relisted XRP on its platform, thus making its trading available to the 20 million residents of New York “in a strong partnership with the State,” with the crypto trading platform’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal sharing the good news in an X post published on May 23.







Coinbase and Ripple’s SEC woes



As a reminder, Coinbase has been in a legal battle against the SEC since June 2023, when the regulator accused the crypto exchange of operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency and failing to register the offer of its staking-as-a-service program.







Earlier, in January 2021, the crypto platform had initially removed XRP across its US markets after the SEC accused blockchain company Ripple of illegally selling XRP and raising over $1.3 billion in what the agency said was an unregistered securities offering. 



However, in July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple did not violate federal securities law by selling XRP on public exchanges, albeit finding that direct sales to institutional clients did, in fact, constitute investment contracts, warranting further court proceedings that are yet to conclude. 



Meanwhile, the recent decision by Coinbase to bring back XRP support for New York residents could become a necessary trigger for the price of XRP, which is currently trading at $0.52, recording a 0.56% decline on the day, a 1.14% gain across the week, and a 3.66% drop in the last month, as per data on May 24.

Unlocking the Future of Finance: FreeBnk’s All-In-One Super App

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
Getting started in the crypto industry can be challenging, as there are so many processes involved, which can be a bit overwhelming for newcomers. Sometimes, these newcomers don’t know how and when to buy their desired cryptocurrencies. 
Even those who are experienced in using crypto often find it hard to navigate from one exchange to another in search of the best prices for cryptocurrencies. This is precisely the reason behind the creation of FreeBnk, which is to make it easier for novice and seasoned investors to navigate the web2 and web3 industries. 
What Is FreeBnk? 
FreeBnk is a crypto company founded by a group of entrepreneurs with the objective of making the financial industry better. Yunus Emre Ozkaya, who is the chief executive officer, and Arash Lowni, who is the chief design officer, are the two co-founders of this company. 
The company employs advanced and sophisticated technologies to provide all-around crypto services to its customers. They plan on empowering users and simplifying their crypto experience by making it more secure and accessible to all. 

FreeBnk: An Innovative Solution in Web2 and Web3

FreeBnk wants to bridge the difficulties many face while trying to interact simultaneously between traditional finance and the crypto industry/web3. Thus, they aim to become an on-chain financial super app where users can make transactions between the traditional finance sector and the blockchain. 
The company has already launched a couple of innovative and revolutionary services and platforms that serve as a gateway to financial empowerment. They include: 
Defi and Tradfi Fusion: Launch of Crypto2stocks
According to an X announcement on May 11th, 2024, FreeBnk said they are trying to Fuse DeFi and TradFi together with the launch of a new platform named Crypto2Stocks. More details indicate that Crypto2Stocks will help users integrate their crypto assets into the stock market directly. 
This is a huge milestone for FreeBnk, and it also opens an opportunity for investors and traders who want to diversify their portfolios. Once this feature is introduced, traders can easily use crypto assets to purchase their desired stocks in the market. While this solution will reduce transaction time significantly, it will also introduce a high level of flexibility, liquidity, and accessibility to users. 

FreeBnk Alchemist and Realworld: Huge Partnership With RWA Inc

The FreeBnk Alchemist is another solution from this company that allows users to invest in real world assets, tokenize them, and achieve fractional ownership of those assets. Moreover, this platform gives an opportunity to make real estate investments worldwide. Assets that users can tokenize into the blockchain on this platform include gold, real estate, Tesla and Amazon stocks, bonds, and many more. 
Recently, FreeBnk announced a major partnership with RWA Inc. on their medium channel. According to them, this move will help them redefine the asset tokenization sector. 
From their channel: “This partnership is poised to integrate real world assets into FreeBnk’s expansive ecosystem this month, bringing a host of new opportunities and features to its users.”
RWA Inc. is a large corporation committed to building an ecosystem that will help facilitate real world asset investment. Thus, it makes provisions for tokenization, smart contracts, audits, launchpads, and even a marketplace. By partnering with RWA Inc., FreeBnk wants to integrate its capabilities on its platform. 

FreeBnk Crypto 
FreeBnk Crypto is another solution that provides access to trading in over 150 countries using cash, cards, and bank transfers. On this platform, users get access to over 300 DeFi, CeFi aggregators, and liquidity providers, which enables them to buy cryptocurrencies at the best prices. It also offers the flexibility of swapping any crypto to another using their organic Bridge. 
FreeBnk Pay and FreeBnk Transfer 
FreeBnk Pay creates an alternative to card and cash payments by providing access to low-fee payment methods that benefit both merchants and consumers. On the other hand, FreeBnk Transfer is another platform that integrates blockchain technology to ensure fast and cost-effective payments worldwide. 
FreeBnk Token (FRBK) 
The FreeBnk Token (FRBK)  is the native token of this platform, and it has many functions, ranging from governance to facilitating transactions. The maximum supply of FRBK stands at 500 million, and the majority of the token allocation is targeted towards the growth of the community. Moreover, those holding this token can also earn rewards on different platforms by staking it. 

Features That Make FreeBnk Stand Out

Features such as multi-party wallets, AI integrations, insurance offerings, and aggregator protocols are what make this platform stand out from its competitors. Below, we will explain each of these features:


This platform integrates artificial intelligence to ensure users get the best experience while using their services, including AI chatbots. 

A multi-party computation (MPC) wallet is another feature that provides military-grade security for storing without the need for seed phrases. It was built in collaboration with Fireblocks Technology and operates significantly faster and more efficiently than traditional wallets. 

The platform boasts a bespoke aggregator protocol that incorporates more than 300 centralized and decentralized exchanges. Its primary purpose is to provide real-time market information on crypto tokens and help users secure the best exchange price. 

Crypto Loans/FreeBnk Lending 


FreeBnk has a crypto loan and investment feature. Users can borrow crypto using digital and intangible assets as collateral. Furthermore, they can make investments in stablecoins and tokenized real world assets with mouthwatering returns. 

There’s also an insurance offering from FreeBnk using the Crypto Deposit Insurance Scheme (CDIS) for user protection and covering of costs, assuming there’s any institutional collapse or failure.

Closing Thoughts 

FreeBnk is not just a gigantic financial platform. It tries to offer the best onboarding to crypto users by providing all the services they need in one app. They recently ventured into offering real-world asset trading, collaborating with RWA Inc. to bring it to reality. 
But besides this, they also have other platforms, such as Crypto2Stocks, which helps for a seamless trade between DeFi and TradFi assets. Furthermore, it has other platforms such as FreeBNKAlchemist, FreeBNKPay, FreeBNKTrade, and many more.

Frequently Asked Questions



FreeBnk is unique for a number of reasons, but mainly because it is on the way to becoming a financial super app where users can perform a wide range of activities. The services include providing users access to trade real world assets, making overseas payments, and even insurance offerings. The platform tries to bridge the inconsistencies and challenges of moving through web2 and web3.

CatCoin Issues Legal Ultimatum to BitForex Over Token Withdrawals


							

CatCoin warns BitForex regarding the withdrawal of CAT tokens



The meme-based project threatens legal action against BitForex and Jason Luo



CatCoin calls on the Hong Kong Police to intervene on the matter




CatCoin (CAT), a meme-based community-influenced crypto project, has warned the BitForex Crypto Exchange regarding CAT tokens withdrawal.



In a recent post on X, CatCoin representatives threatened to pursue legal action against BitForex and its former CEO, Jason Luo.







According to CatCoin, it has made multiple efforts to contact BitForex but received no response. The meme-based project’s team issued the post as a final notice to the crypto exchange, requesting BitForex to respond to its complaints via an official email it provided.



Meanwhile, the CatCoin team called on the Hong Kong Police Force to intervene and act appropriately against BitForex and Jason Luo. In addition, the team accused BitForex of tarnishing the reputation of the crypto industry and called upon crypto influencers to address the situation.



BitForex went offline in February, less than one month after Jason Luo stepped down as the company’s CEO. The crypto exchange shut down abruptly, leaving users confused and concerned over the fate of their assets. In his resignation speech, Luo noted he would continue to support the firm with his experience and knowledge.



The CatCoin team believes Luo is still involved with the exchange, alleging that the former CEO is in charge of operations at BitForex despite the inactive state of the firm in the past few months. The exchange’s X account has had no activity since February 21, when it posted, “We are the top encryption projects in 2024?”



Notably, the CatCoin team is one of several entities affected by BitForex’s unannounced collapse. The crypto exchange has failed to provide any tangible reason for its collapse despite several complaints, especially on the exchange’s official Telegram channel.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, struggled to halt its previous bearish trend, hovering around the $67,824 mark and hitting an intra-day low of $66,600. The decline intensified following the release of robust US labor market and Services PMI data, which reduced investor expectations of a September Fed rate cut and decreased demand for riskier assets.Looking ahead, Bitcoin investors will focus on upcoming comments from Fed officials, particularly Fed’s Waller, who is scheduled to speak on Friday.Hawkish remarks could weigh on Bitcoin. Furthermore, upcoming US Durable Goods Orders and Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index reports will also influence market sentiment.Strengthening US Dollar and Positive Economic Data Impact on Bitcoin Prices



The US dollar has strengthened recently due to positive economic data, decreasing the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. This has pressured the crypto market, including Bitcoin.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic highlighted ongoing inflation concerns, suggesting the Fed might maintain higher rates to avoid economic overheating.

FedWatch Tool: Chances of unchanged rates in September rose from 41.9% to 48.4% on May 23rd.
US Initial Jobless Claims: Fell by 8,000 to 215,000 for the week ending May 18.
PMI Data: Manufacturing PMI increased to 50.9 in May, Services PMI rose to 54.8, and Composite PMI jumped to 54.4, all surpassing expectations.

The stronger US dollar and positive economic indicators have made crypto investments like Bitcoin less appealing due to higher opportunity costs.



Bitcoin Sees Bullish Trend Amid US Regulatory Changes
Recent regulatory changes in the US have sparked a bullish trend for Bitcoin. Key developments include Congress members urging the SEC to approve spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs and the passing of the FIT21 bill, which clarifies cryptocurrency regulations.Additionally, major Bitcoin holders, known as “whales,” have accumulated 20,000 BTC, worth around $1.4 billion, in the past week.
Strong activity in Bitcoin-linked ETFs has also been observed, with $1.7 billion flowing into these funds over the last eight days.
These regulatory changes and positive developments have boosted demand for Bitcoin, with significant accumulation by whales and substantial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs.











Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading at $67,835, down 2.25% over the past 24 hours, signalling a bearish Bitcoin price prediction. The
Bitcoin price is currently trading at $67,860, down 0.27% over the past 24 hours. The 4-hour chart highlights a pivot point at $68,263. Immediate resistance levels to watch are $70,029, $71,458, and $73,299. On the downside, immediate support levels are at $66,357, $64,947, and $63,490.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 40, indicating that Bitcoin is approaching oversold conditions. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $68,615, suggesting a bearish trend as prices trade below this average.
In conclusion, Bitcoin remains bearish below $68,250. A break above this level could shift the trend to bullish, while a continued decline could see further losses.

                        Nearly 40% of institutional investors had some exposure to crypto assets in 2023, a notable rise from the 31% recorded in 2021.A recent survey conducted by KPMG in Canada and the Canadian Association of Alternative Assets & Strategies has revealed a significant increase in institutional investors’ interest in cryptocurrencies.Per the survey, a third of respondents reported having at least 10% of their portfolio allocated to crypto assets, compared to only a fifth of respondents two years ago.Institutional Investors Enter Crypto Amid Maturing Market
The survey also explored the reasons behind institutional investors’ growing interest in cryptocurrencies.A majority of respondents, 67%, cited the maturing market and custody infrastructure as a significant factor, a significant increase from the 14% recorded in 2021.Furthermore, 58% of respondents mentioned the strong market performance of cryptocurrencies as a motivating factor for their investments.The market performance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been remarkable in recent years.Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a 150% increase in 2023 and is up nearly 60% year-to-date.Similarly, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has risen by approximately 60% in 2024.The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January of this year has played a significant role in boosting institutional investors’ access to the crypto asset class.After years of failed applications, the SEC’s decision has made it easier for institutional investors to include cryptocurrencies in their portfolios.Another recent poll conducted by the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals indicates a sharp rise in the number of financial advisers planning to recommend crypto-related opportunities to their clients.The survey found that 35% of respondents intend to encourage their clients to invest in the digital assets space, compared to 21% at the end of the previous year.The increased interest in cryptocurrencies has prompted a broader coverage of digital assets by major sell-side firms, such as JPMorgan and AllianceBernstein.This expanded research coverage has contributed to more sophisticated and nuanced conversations between investor relations (IR) professionals and institutional investors.IR teams have observed a notable shift in investor understanding and knowledge of cryptocurrencies, with discussions focusing on more advanced topics compared to previous years.Crypto Sees Increase in Interest in Hong Kong
The increased interest in cryptocurrencies has also been observed in Hong Kong, where regulatory clarity and recent approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have contributed to a surge in institutional and retail investor focus.OSL Group, a Hong Kong-listed digital assets company, has experienced a significant uptick in interest from investors, and their investor relations approach has become more proactive as a result.As reported, Hong Kong has launched its first batch of ETFs focused on cryptocurrencies, marking potential competition for the popular Bitcoin products in the United States. Harvest Global Investments Ltd., the local unit of China Asset Management, along with a partnership between HashKey Capital Ltd. and Bosera Asset Management (International) Co., listed Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the city on Tuesday.

Shiba Inu ETF on the horizon? SHIB founder drops major hint


    The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community received a boost of optimism as Shytoshi Kusama, the leader of the SHIB project, congratulated the Ethereum (ETH) community following the SEC’s landmark approval of the first spot Ethereum ETFs.



In a recent tweet on May 24, Kusama speculated on the potential for a similar Shiba Inu  spot ETF, while emphasizing his commitment to the ongoing developments within the SHIB ecosystem.



SHIB ETF prospects and community Focus



In his congratulatory message, Kusama hinted at a possible SHIB ETF sparking discussions within the community, though Kusama stressed that his main focus remains on the upcoming projects for Shibarium and the broader Shiba Inu ecosystem. 







Remarking on the possibility that this development could pave the way for a SHIB spot exchange-traded fund in the future. While he acknowledged the potential significance of such an event, Kusama emphasized that his primary focus remains on the ongoing and upcoming projects within the SHIB ecosystem. 



Kusama encouraged the community to engage in discussions about the future, such as projects for Shibarium and the broader Shiba Inu ecosystem. 







Ethereum ETF approval



On Thursday, May 24, the SEC granted approval for spot Ethereum ETF applications submitted by several prominent Wall Street firms. This decision comes six months after the regulator approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a significant shift in the crypto landscape. 



Ethereum, being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has now joined Bitcoin in offering spot ETFs, a move that many believe could accelerate Wall Street’s acceptance of crypto assets.



Among the approved Ethereum ETFs are those from financial heavyweights such as BlackRock, Grayscale (which converted its Ethereum Trust into a spot ETF), VanEck, Bitwise, Fidelity, and Ark Invest. 



These ETFs, while significant, are expected to manage fewer assets compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. For instance, Grayscale’s new Ethereum ETF holds approximately $11 billion in ETH, which is considerably smaller than its Bitcoin Trust before it transitioned to a spot ETF.



ETF Regulatory adjustments and challenges



The path to approval was not without challenges. Earlier this month, Ark Invest, Grayscale, and Fidelity had to modify their ETF filings to exclude staking services. This adjustment came in response to the SEC’s recent legal actions against U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken over their crypto staking services, which the SEC deemed to involve unregistered securities.



The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs represents a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. Venture investor Anthony Pompliano recently tweeted that this step is the “last dam to be broken” before Wall Street fully embraces crypto assets.

New Sonic Foundation by Fantom Gains $10 Million Backing


On Wednesday, Fantom Foundation, an entity behind layer-1 (L1) blockchain Fantom, unveiled the launch of Sonic Foundation and Sonic Labs.
These new entities will be the main bodies supporting its new L1 blockchain, Sonic.
Fantom Secures A $10 Million Fund for Sonic Chain

The Fantom Foundation explained that the Sonic Foundation will be responsible for the network’s governance and treasury management functions. Meanwhile, Sonic Labs will drive growth among dApps, partnerships, and users.
Besides announcing the creation of the Sonic Foundation, the Fantom Foundation also revealed its achievement in closing a $10 million funding round led by Korean crypto fund Hashed. Additional investors included UOB Ventures, Signum Capital, Aave Foundation, and several angel investors.
Read more: What Is Fantom (FTM)?

“Capital raised during the recent round will be exclusively used to further support strategic growth and ecosystem development,” Fantom Foundation’s CEO, Michael Kong, said.

Fantom unveiled its plan to launch the Sonic blockchain earlier in March. The Fantom team has worked to develop the technology for the past two years and anticipates the Sonic chain will launch in the late summer or early fall this year.
Sonic is a blockchain technology designed to process a large number of transactions quickly. It operates as a primary L1 blockchain and includes a layer-2 (L2) bridge feature that enables it to connect with another blockchain, such as Ethereum (ETH).
Professor Bernhard Scholz, the Chief Research Officer at Fantom, designed this technology. Additionally, Andre Cronje, a key figure in the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) and a co-founder of Fantom, led the development team responsible for Sonic.

Sonic claims to tap into vast amounts of liquidity, users, and protocols. This ability allows the chain to combine the low cost, scalability, and speed of L2 with the security of an L2 bridge for access to native ETH and other assets on Ethereum.
Sonic will own a native token, which will use ticker S. A recently approved governance vote made S compatible and can be migrated 1:1 with Fantom’s native token, FTM.

Shady Trades? Politician bets big on Ethereum before ETF approval


    After the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved applications from Nasdaq, Cboe, and NYSE to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the price of Ethereum (ETH), certain trades by a US politician have come into the limelight.



Specifically, Michael Collins, the US representative for Georgia’s 10th congressional district, disclosed in January 2024 a $65,000 investment in Ethereum, as Finbold reported at the time, and more recently, highlighted by Quiver Quantitave, in an X post on May 24.







According to the investment research firm that “scrapes alternative data from across the internet and aggregates it in a free, easy to use platform,” the largest altcoin and second-biggest asset in the cryptocurrency sector by market capitalization has “now risen over 140%” since Collins started buying in.







Collins’ Ethereum purchases



As a reminder, the representative had bought Ethereum in the amount of between $1,001 and $15,000 on January 3 and between $15,001 and $50,000 on January 8, at the time when rumors of an approval of a spot Ethereum ETF first started circulating, suggesting the politician’s strong conviction in its possibility.

Furthermore, in addition to his January 2024 purchases, Collins had also bought Ethereum three times in 2023 – on October 9, November 5, and December 28 – in sales that amounted to $75,000, according to the data shared by markets analytics platform unusual whales on January 10.







Ethereum news effect



Meanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $3,687.03, which represents a drop of 3.50% in the last 24 hours but nonetheless an advance of 21.68% across the previous seven days, and an accumulated gain of 13.03% on its monthly chart.



That said, according to crypto trading expert Michaël van de Poppe, the crypto market had already priced in the recent positive Ethereum news, as reflected in the form of the crypto asset’s strong 20% move, but the actual listing and inflow would demonstrate whether a strong upwards continuation can happen.

Expecting 150 Thousand Dollars in Bitcoin and 8 Thousand Dollars in Ethereum, Standard Chartered Pointed to 2025 for Solana and XRP ETFs! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While the SEC's historic approval of spot Ethereum ETHs was welcomed by the market, eyes now turn to other altcoin ETFs.
At this point, Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick claimed that other crypto ETFs could gain approval in 2025.


Speaking to The Block, Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick argued that other ETFs other than Ethereum could receive approval in 2025.
At this point, Kendrick argued that after Ethereum ETFs, other cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL) and XRP may also receive approval in 2025, and made the following statements.






“The approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs shows that ETH is not classified as a security by the SEC, so other ETH-like coins that have previously been under scrutiny in cases like the XRP case may not be considered securities either.
In a few cases, the core technologies of some altcoins are so similar to ETH that it would be difficult for the SEC to argue that they are securities, given the classification of ETH.
“The cryptocurrency industry now appears to have political support on both sides of the aisle.”

Stating that his predictions of $150,000 for Bitcoin and $8,000 for ETH are valid, Kendrick said, “A portfolio that includes both BTC and ETH ETFs is probably attractive, and the sector is further confirmed by the SEC's decision on ETH.”

Litecoin Eyeing the $90 Mark as Whales Accumulate the Token



                    

While a lot of crypto headlines are dominated by the likes of more ‘exciting’ tokens like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, Litecoin has seemingly remained a quiet giant in the industry. The token is known for its speed and efficiency and while it is in the top 20 cryptos by market cap, it flies under the radars of some crypto lovers and investors. 



Now, the token is reporting more notable activity and is even eyeing the coveted $90 mark as Litecoin whales have made a splash in the industry. 








Litecoin is known in the crypto space for having low fees and fast transactions and this has made it a favorite of many users. Over the years, we’ve also come to see more variety in its use cases outside of sending funds. 



For example, Litecoin is being used more for online gambling on various sites, even some that only take Litecoin. As Kane Pepi writes about the best Litecoin casinos reviewed, these are becoming more popular. The coin can also be used on an anonymous casino along with other tokens. There are also more merchants who accept Litecoin for the purchase of goods and services and this too is only on track to become more common.



All of these use cases mean that Litecoin can sustain its growth trajectory into the future and this will positively reflect on its price as well. Between its speculative and non-speculative use, whales buying up so much of it and the growing excitement around it, Litecoin should reach new price points in the future.








In the last month alone, Litecoin whales have snapped up over $230 million worth of the token. This has included a 900,000 token stash collected in a single day. Whale activity is often an indicator of a token about to go up in value and usually triggers smaller investors to snap up the token as well. The idea is that whales are buying more of a token with the intention of selling when the price goes up and no one wants to get left behind when that happens. 



This has been true in the case of Litecoin as while it saw a market dip in the last few months or so, it has been steadily on the mend. Following the reports of whale activity, it reached $89 before seeing a slight correction, hovering at $87.27 as of this article. 



This has come as good news to the Litecoin community as the token breaching the $90 mark would mean that $100 is in view. It’s also been reported by the Litecoin team that the token has been the number 1 token for Bitpay transactions for this year, perhaps in part due to its fast transactions. In fact, it has been the top token for five months now. 



This is a testament to how committed the Litecoin community is and could be a sign of even better things to come. The Litecoin whales certainly think so and have been putting their money where their mouth is.

House passes bill to limit Fed's CBDC authority


The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill on Thursday that requires the Federal Reserve to obtain congressional approval before issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). 



The CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, passed with a 216-192 vote, aims to safeguard financial privacy and prevent government overreach. 



The bipartisan support for the bill reflects concerns over privacy and the potential for government surveillance through digital currencies. 



The bill, known as H.R. 5403, seeks to amend the Federal Reserve Act, barring the Fed from providing direct consumer services or leveraging CBDCs for monetary policy without Congress’s explicit consent. 

	
	
	
	


The House’s decision marks a significant moment in crypto-focused legislative activity, with this being the third crypto-related bill passed in May. 



The debate around the bill revealed a split between Republican worries about financial surveillance and Democratic interests in fostering innovation and maintaining the dollar’s international status.



Proponents of the bill, including House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, have pointed to foreign examples, such as China’s use of CBDCs for citizen monitoring, to justify the need for strict regulations. 



According to the Atlantic Council, at least 134 countries and currency unions are exploring a CBDC. Three of them have launched and 36 of them are running pilot trials.

Why Cryptocurrency Enthusiasts are Drawn to Sports Betting



                    

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are increasingly turning their attention to sports betting. Although crypto sportsbooks are certainly in a boom right now, ordinary bookies not gamstop that use fiat, is also seeing many new signups – many of which have a crypto background. So, what’s going on, why might there be more to it than meets the eye?







Both cryptocurrency and sports betting communities thrive on networking and exchanging knowledge, so this is an obvious place to start. Enthusiasts in both fields often participate in online forums and social media groups, where they can dig deeper to find lesser-known knowledge. This is something that crypto enthusiasts are accustomed to, and how they may even stumble upon betting communities in the first place (i.e. Reddit).








Effective risk management is needed in both cryptocurrency investing and sports betting. Enthusiasts in both fields must carefully assess each decision’s potential risks and rewards, meaning that strategic thinking is linked to maximising chances of success. 



Crypto traders can spot this in gambling—a skill they’re already familiar with. When getting into sports betting, they must begin to weigh the odds and make informed choices based on various factors. 







Success in cryptocurrency investing and sports betting relies heavily on strong analytical skills. Crypto enthusiasts have been drawn to the data side of things, which is currently still being explored in sports betting.




Interpreting vast amounts of data isn’t traditionally something bettors have always done, as they often operate on small samples of data (i.e. recent form) and make heuristic judgements, rather than model an algorithm or finely tune a decision-making process. 







Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are typically well-versed in technology, of course, which is also growing within betting right now. More recently, there have been software releases that help users perform sophisticated betting strategies and provide real-time insights. These can be a bit daunting for the average Joe, but it’s something that the crypto guys are picking up quickly. 



We must remember that, particularly with betting exchanges, we compete against each other, not the house. Even in traditional bookies (i.e. not an exchange), the odds are still being reflected by demand, so we’re indirectly competing against one another. For someone with a highly analytical and technical background, it may be an instant advantage – a far bigger one than in the crypto market space, too, where such backgrounds are more common.







Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, with prices fluctuating rapidly in response to various factors. Sports betting outcomes can be unpredictable, too, with unexpected results and last-minute changes in odds. It appears more different than it is because sports betting odds are anchored to the reality of the game. But crypto pricing is more anchored than people give credit for, with other coins, the market sentiment in general, the USD, interest rates, S&P500, and many more factors being a point of influence.








The shared skills and knowledge required for success in cryptocurrency investing and sports betting make the latter an appealing pursuit for digital currency enthusiasts. They can position themselves as relatively more expert in analytics and technology, which can be an advantage. But, ultimately, both share another common theme: Excitement and unpredictability.

Game NFTs rise as Guild of Guardians Avatars, DMarket and Fantasy Top lead sales


DMarket, a collection of in-game items on the Mythos network, led CryptoSlam’s non-fungible token (NFT) sales chart with US$857,829 on Thursday, up from the previous day’s US$710,928.



Following closely behind, Guild of Guardians Avatars surged to the second spot on the day’s NFT leader’s board with US$825,172 in sales. The collection is tied to Immutable’s online game.



Fantasy Top, a Blast collection that turns Crypto Twitter into an NFT game, takes the third spot with daily sales of US$611,135. Fantasy Top stays in the top three despite falling from US$1.04 million in the previous day to lead the market.



Thursday’s top three collections show the rising appetite for Web3 games.

	
	
	
	


According to DappRadar, Web3 gaming attracted almost US$1 billion in investments last month.



Next, Ethereum’s Bored Ape Yacht Club and The Captainz rounded out the top five collections with US$602,545 and US$531,806 in sales, respectively.



The Ethereum network led all blockchains in sales with US$6.2 million on Thursday.



The industry received major news related to the world’s largest NFT chain as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), paving the way for these financial instruments to trade on traditional markets in the U.S.

	
	
	

	


Bitcoin, with just under US$5 million was the day’s second-ranking blockchain, followed by Solana with US$2.34 million.



Solana blockchain also made headlines with a significant number of transactions, totaling 63,682 for the day, although its sales volume was lower at US$2.34 million. This performance underscores the diversity and competitiveness of the NFT market across different blockchains.

The global economic situation, particularly the push towards digital transformation accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has further spurred interest and investment in the metaverse.Blockchain technology plays a crucial role in the growth of the metaverse by enabling secure digital transactions and the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are essential for digital asset ownership and trading. However, regulatory challenges remain a significant hurdle.Emerging Trends in Metaverse
Several key trends are shaping the metaverse landscape.AR and VR are at the forefront of metaverse technology, providing immersive experiences that are becoming increasingly popular in the entertainment and gaming industries.The market share for AR and VR devices is growing, with major companies like Meta investing heavily in these technologies.Furthermore, platforms like Roblox, Fortnite, and The Sandbox are leading the way in combining social media and gaming.These platforms offer users immersive experiences and opportunities to socialize in virtual environments, driving engagement and revenue.It is worth noting that Businesses are increasingly adopting metaverse technologies for virtual meetings, training sessions, and customer engagement.Companies are exploring virtual reality for remote work and collaboration, which has become more prevalent post-pandemic.Additionally, the co-use of blockchain and metaverse technologies is becoming a significant trend.Blockchain provides the infrastructure for secure transactions and digital ownership within the metaverse, enhancing the user experience and creating new economic opportunities.Who is Using the Metaverse?

Top Analyst Says Solana-Based Memecoin Primed To Surge Higher Again, Updates Outlook on Ethereum - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is expressing bullish sentiment on one memecoin built on the Solana (SOL) blockchain while revealing his forecast for Ethereum (ETH) going forward.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Flow Horse tells his 216,400 followers on the social media platform X that dogwifhat (WIF), whose logo features a dog wearing a hat, appears to be undergoing consolidation on the daily chart.










According to the pseudonymous analyst, WIF could then turn bullish after the consolidation phase.
“It looks like WIF isn’t ready to take off the hat.”
Source: Flow Horse/X
WIF is trading at $2.97 at time of writing, down by around 38% from the all-time high reached in March.
Turning to ETH, Flow Horse says that if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the second-largest crypto asset by market cap months after Bitcoin’s (BTC), the impact could result in a weeks-long uptrend for ETH.
“The Ethereum ETF trade is better than Bitcoin for too many reasons to list, but simply put: 
The market is still caught off guard by the pivot and you can guarantee there is still some pocket of doubt and disbelief that won’t enter until we get a headline.
Short-term pop and correction followed by a strong trend up over weeks.
**Also, it is easier to move ETH than it is BTC**”
Ethereum is trading at $3,864 at time of writing, up by around 29% over the past seven days.

Here's why Ondo Finance (ONDO) price is soaring - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Ondo Finance (ONDO) price surges to a new all-time high above $1.15.
The Ondo price surge is driven by SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs and strong institutional backing.
Ondo Finance (ONDO) lists on Coinbase boosting its visibility an trading volume.

Ondo Finance (ONDO), the native token of the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance, has been experiencing a remarkable price surge recently.
ONDO token recently hit an all-time high of $1.16 and despite experiencing a slight decline, it seems to have regained its footing.
At press time, ONDO was priced at $1.10, reflecting a 10.45% increase over the past 24 hours, a 16.66% increase over the past week, and a 24.00% rise over the past month.
Since its launch, ONDO price has skyrocketed by an impressive 577.86% from its IEO price of $0.055 in January 2024.
These figures highlight ONDO’s strong upward momentum and growing investor interest.
Key catalysts for Ondo price surge
1. SEC Approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs
One of the most significant factors contributing to ONDO’s recent price surge is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
This landmark decision has fueled market optimism, suggesting a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.
The approval has not only boosted Ethereum (ETH) but also positively impacted Ethereum-related tokens like ONDO, which is considered a strong Ethereum-beta asset and a key player in the “real-world asset” narrative.
2. Coinbase Listing
Another major catalyst for ONDO’s rally is its recent listing on Coinbase’s perpetual market.
The inclusion of ONDO-PERP, along with PYTH-PERP and ZETA-PERP, on Coinbase has provided greater accessibility and trading flexibility for investors.
This move has significantly increased ONDO’s visibility and trading volume, which surged by 130% to reach $455,519,046.
3. Strong institutional backing
Lat but not least is Ondo Finance’s strategic partnerships and investments by major venture capitals that have played a crucial role in boosting investor confidence.
In Aprill 2022, Ondo Finance received $20 million in a Series A investment from several leading venture capitals including Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Tiger Global Management, Wintermute, and GoldenTree Asset Management among others. These institutional supports are a positive indicator for long-term growth prospects.
In late March 2024, Ondo Finance transferred $95 million of its assets to BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, to facilitate instant settlements for its U.S. Treasury-backed token, OUSG.
While this specific transaction might not have directly triggered the recent price movement, the association with BlackRock, a dominant force in the ETF market, has certainly bolstered ONDO’s market perception.
Pantera Capital’s backing further adds to ONDO’s credibility, providing the financial muscle and strategic support needed to navigate the volatile crypto landscape.
On-chain Ondo Finance (ONDO) data insights
According to DeFiLlama, Ondo Finance achieved a peak total value locked (TVL) of $444 million on May 24.

Dogecoin drops as DOGE community bids 'Kabosu' farewell - AMBCrypto



Dogecoin’s price fell following the news of Kabosu’s passing, reflecting the sentimental impact.
A memorial for Kabosu is planned, highlighting her significant influence in the cryptocurrency sector.

Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog whose curious expression sparked the meme that gave rise to Dogecoin [DOGE], has passed away.
 The iconic image that launched a thousand memes was first shared by Kabosu’s owner, Atsuko Sato, in 2010 on her personal blog. The photograph, which captured Kabosu’s peculiar, skeptical look, quickly resonated with internet users worldwide. 
Accompanied by humorous, misspelled captions in Comic Sans, the image of Kabosu evolved into the “Doge” meme, embedding itself deeply into internet culture. 
The meme eventually inspired the creation of Dogecoin in 2013. Initially conceived as a joke, the cryptocurrency adopted Kabosu’s visage as its logo, symbolizing the light-hearted spirit of the project. 
Despite its comedic origins, Dogecoin gained substantial traction and utility, supporting various charitable causes and sporting events. It became the progenitor of a new category of digital assets known as memecoins, influencing other major tokens like Shiba Inu and Floki.
How is Dogecoin handling the loss?
Following the announcement of Kabosu’s passing on 24th May, Dogecoin experienced a notable downturn in its market price, with a 6.2% decrease over the last 24 hours, positioning the price at $0.1568. 
This recent fluctuation occurred amidst broader discussions within the community about the memecoin’s future and its role in the crypto ecosystem. 
Kabosu’s death marks not just the end of an era for the Dogecoin community but also casts reflections on the volatility and sentimental value driving the memecoin sector.

Meanwhile, looking into Dogecoin’s notable metrics, market data from Santiment revealed a significant drop price volatility from its peak in March, indicating a stabilization in its trading patterns. 
While decreased volatility might suggest a maturing market, it also diverges from the traditionally erratic price movements expected of a memecoin. 
Source: IntoTheBlock
Despite these market dynamics, data from IntoTheBlock shows that the majority of Dogecoin holders are currently seeing profits, with 83% in the green. Conversely, 13% are experiencing losses, while a mere 4% are breaking even at current market prices. 
This financial landscape emerges amid a notable lack of volatility in Dogecoin’s large transaction (whale) activity, highlighting a period of consolidation within this metric.
 Specifically, IntoTheBlock data reveals no significant spikes in whale transactions, indicating a relatively stable trading environment for DOGE.

Dogecoin’s technical projections
Technical analysis of Dogecoin’s chart indicates a potential retracement, as the cryptocurrency recently traded above a previous lower high. 
Specifically, the 4-hour chart suggests that DOGE may continue to decline to the $0.13 level to test a key demand level before potentially rebounding to resume its uptrend. 
Source: TradingView
This analysis aligns with a recent report from AMBCrypto, which posits that a break past the resistance levels at $0.1698 and $0.1844 would confirm a bullish movement for Dogecoin.

Amidst these market speculations, the Dogecoin community and Kabosu’s followers prepare to honor her memory. A memorial ceremony for Kabosu is scheduled to take place at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City. 
The event will provide an opportunity for those touched by Kabosu’s story to celebrate her life and impact, which transcended the digital world to create a lasting imprint on both cryptocurrency and internet history.

This Crypto Trader Made a Fortune on PEPE and ONDO: Here's How - Coin Edition


							

Crypto trader amasses $42 million profit in one year.



PEPE investment yields $60 million return.



ONDO, BEAM trades add to significant gains.




Lookonchain, a prominent cryptocurrency analytics platform, has detailed the success story of an astute trader whose portfolio ballooned from $23 million to $65 million in just one year. This remarkable gain of $42 million in earnings underscores the trader’s exceptional ability to navigate the volatile crypto markets.







One of the trader’s standout achievements was the extraordinary profit of $60 million, representing a 1203% return on investment (ROI), made from investing in PEPE. Between November 2, 2023, and February 1, 2024, the trader invested 2,434 ETH (equivalent to $5 million) to acquire 3.97 trillion PEPE.



Subsequently, by selling 125 billion PEPE for 350 ETH (approximately $1.27 million), the trader retained 3.84 trillion PEPE, then valued at $56.43 million. This strategic selling at peak prices was pivotal to the trader’s success. PEPE has since experienced a 4.72% decline over the last 24 hours to $0.0000139, according to the latest data.









Furthermore, the trader capitalized on the bullish trends of ONDO, earning $5.8 million with an ROI of 288%. The trader purchased 7.55 million ONDO tokens for $1.9 million at an average price of $0.26 between January 28 and February 6. By selling 2.56 million ONDO tokens for $2 million at an average price of $0.79 across multiple occasions in March and April, the trader retained 4.99 million ONDO tokens, then valued at $5.73 million. ONDO’s price, at the time of writing, stands at $1.07, having risen 8.09% in the last 24 hours.







Another profitable venture for the trader was BEAM, where an investment of $2.59 million to purchase 139.47 million BEAM tokens at an average price of $0.019 resulted in a $1.85 million profit, reflecting an ROI of 72%. From February 16 to February 27, the trader sold all of their BEAM assets for $4.44 million at an average price of $0.032. BEAM is now trading at $0.02663, down 3.47% over the last 24 hours.

Selling Pressure Danger in Solana (SOL)! Solana Sold at a Low Price in FTX's Auction! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi


The assets of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX have completed the sale of $2.6 billion worth of discounted Solana (SOL) tokens, with leading buyers including Figure Markets and Pantera Capital.
Pantera and Figure Receive Latest Discounted Solana Tokens from FTX Auction
Figure Markets reportedly paid approximately $80 million for a block of 800,000 SOL tokens, which equates to approximately $102 per token.


This price represents a significant discount compared to the current market price of approximately $166 per token. This discount led to a 5.6% drop in Solana's price in the morning.
Pantera Capital also participated in the recent auction, but details about the price they paid were not disclosed. Both FTX ownership and the purchasing companies have not yet responded to requests for comment on the transactions.






FTX, run by convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, owes more than two million customers and over $11 billion to other creditors.
Pantera Capital, which previously tried to raise $250 million to buy Solana tokens from FTX, was also one of the winning bidders in an earlier auction held in April.


The firm's continued interest and investment underscores the value and potential they see in Solana despite ongoing turbulence in the market.

Cardano (ADA) Investors Book Losses, But Here’s the Twist


The decline in Cardano’s (ADA) price in the past few weeks has caused many of its holders to lose money.
On-chain data has shown that the count of daily transactions in losses exceeds those that return a profit.
Cardano Holders Look For a Way Out
At press time, ADA traded at $0.45. In the last month, the altcoin has shed almost 10% of its value. In fact, during that period, ADA cratered to a low of $0.42 before rebounding.

Due to a steady decline in the coin’s value in the past few weeks, most of its holders have booked losses on their transactions. An assessment of the ratio of ADA’s daily transaction volume in profit to loss (observed using a 30-day moving average) was 0.94 at press time.
This means that for every ADA transaction that ended in a loss, only 0.94 transactions returned a profit.   
Cardano Ratio of Transaction Volume in Profit to Loss. Source: Santiment
When this metric returns a value below 1, it suggests a tendency for more selling pressure than buying pressure during the period under review.
As the coin’s price plunges, many of its holders continue to sit on unrealized losses. As of this writing, 2.62 million addresses, which make up 59% of all ADA holders, are “out of the money.”
An address is considered out of the money if the current market price of an asset is lower than the average cost at which the address purchased (or received) the tokens it currently holds.

Conversely, 1.64 million addresses, representing 37% of all ADA holders, hold their coins at a profit. 
ADA Price Prediction: To Buy the Dip or Not
Readings from ADA’s Elder-Ray Index suggested that ADA investments may continue to lose their value in the short term. 

This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market. When its value is negative, it means that bear power is dominant in the market. As of this writing, the value of ADA’s Elder-Ray Index was -0.038.
Also the coin’s Relative Strength Index  (RSI) was in a downtrend at 41.94. At this value, ADA’s RSI signaled that its selling pressure exceeded its buying activity. 
Cardano Analysis. Source: TradingView

If coin sell-offs continue, ADA may fall under its support at $0.42 to exchange hands at $0.416.

However, if market participants heed ADA’s Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio, which currently flashes a buy signal, and “buy the dip,” the coin’s price might rally toward $0.479.

Solana Price Prediction as ETF Rumors Emerge - Is $10,000 SOL Possible?

                        The Solana price has dropped by 8% in the past 24 hours, falling to $163.28 on a day when the cryptocurrency market as a whole has lost 4%.These declines follow the news that the SEC has approved eight spot-based Ethereum ETFs, which follow in the footsteps of the 11 Bitcoin ETFs that gained approval in January.While this is entirely positive news, it appears to have led to a ‘sell the news’ correction, with SOL now also down by 3.5% in a week.However, its medium- long-term momentum remains enviable, and with the coin up by 740% in a year, it has sustained enough impetus to rebound strongly soon.Solana Price Prediction as ETF Rumors Emerge – Is $10,000 SOL Possible?
What’s positive about Solana’s chart is that it illustrates how the coin is close to a bottom, having entered an oversold position.Most notably, its relative strength index (purple) has touched 30 in the past hour, meaning that it can’t really lose any more momentum.Source: TradingViewThis is happening while SOL’s 30-day average (orange) is about to dip below its 200-day (blue), at which point the coin will be close to a positive reversal.It will, therefore, be interesting to see whether its support level (green) can prevent a drop below $160.If it can, we may see a rebound as soon as this weekend, while a dive below this level could bring a few more days of pain.Yet one positive feature of Solana’s chart today is that its 24-hour trading volume remains pretty high, at around $5.4 billion.This indicates ongoing demand for the token, although at the moment it seems that whales are likelier to sell the coin than buy it at the moment.Even so, the medium- and long-term prognosis for the Solana price remains overwhelmingly positive.As noted above, the SEC has approved a list of spot Ethereum ETFs, and one of the reasons why there has been a market-wide dive today is that these ETFs haven’t actually launched yet.But once they do, we may see an influx of volume and demand, first coming to Ethereum itself but then filtering out into a general bullishness.Given Solana’s status as the next major utility token after ETH, it could be poised for its own spot ETFs soon.The price of Solana could hit $200 in the coming weeks, and the potential introduction of a SOL ETF might drive it to $500 by the end of 2024.If adoption continues, it may even reach $10,000 in the years and perhaps decades to come.Presale Tokens Can Help Traders Beat the Market
There’s little doubt that SOL will recover soon and enjoy some more rallies, yet it could potentially take some time.As such, traders looking for above-average returns in shorter timeframes may prefer to check out one of the numerous strong presale tokens currently attracting investors.One of the hottest of these is Sealana (SEAL), a Solana-based meme token that has raised just over $2.5 million in its sale.SEAL looks like the likeliest new Solana-based meme token to join the ranks of other successful coins this year, such as WIF and BONK.This is indicated by its growing raise amount, as well as by the popularity of its official X account, which has accrued over 5,000 followers in only a few weeks.What these show is that SEAL is being increasingly successful in generating excitement and hype, which is likely to convert into a significant rally once it lists at the end of its sale.As a meme coin, it has opted for a quirky anthropomorphic seal as its mascot, which seems to be doing a good job in gaining attention.And SEAL has also launched an Ethereum-based version of its token, making it a multi-chain cryptocurrency.This can often result in greater traction, with SEAL potential gaining more use on more apps over time.Investors can join its ale by heading over to the official Sealana website, where they can purchase at a rate 1 SOL for 6,900 SEAL, which is roughly $0.025 per token.VIDEOGiven its momentum and growing popularity, such a price will end up seeming very cheap in a few weeks.Buy SEAL Today

DePIN Service Dabba Expands Decentralized Internet Connectivity Across India



                    

Dabba, a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) aiming to connect underserved and unconnected populations with cheap wireless data, unveiled the launch of the purchase of Wi-Fi hotspots, making them available for users to buy worldwide. This will be the second campaign, following a successful testnet that saw over 1,500 hotspots distributed to rural and semi-urban areas in India. 



The latest campaign will make over 10,000 Dabba Lite hotspots available for purchase across the globe, with a goal of selling over 100,000 in 2024. With the launch of the second season, Dabba is aligning its goals towards its vision to provide cheap and accessible internet services to underserved regions globally, the team statement reads. 




Following the purchase, the hotspots can be deployed by network partners across India, expanding decentralized internet connectivity across the country and providing cheap internet access across rural and semi-urban areas. Moreover, the DePIN service helps in reducing data congestion in regions with high data demand. 



According to the team statement, users can start purchasing the hotspots following the live launch of its DePIN service on May 23, 2024 – ahead of the planned token generation event (TGE) scheduled for July on the Solana blockchain. 



The token will support the creation of a two-sided marketplace between data consumers and providers responsible for building and maintaining internet infrastructure. The token will power the Dabba ecosystem and also reward contributors and stakeholders helping the ecosystem run seamlessly. 




Dabba is focused on India, a country that boasts the second-highest number of internet users, but only 44% of its residents have internet access. Most of the rural and semi-urban areas are underserved by incumbent data solutions. With their experience in offering internet services to underserved regions, Dabba selected India as their starting point for supplying decentralized internet services. 



This follows previous roles for the company in the country such as powering Google’s public wifi deployments and a partnership with the  Indian government to ensure the legislation is in place to support the rollout of its demand-based DePIN.



Fast progress in offering cheap internet 



Since its launch, Dabba has been at the forefront of offering users fast and accessible internet services. The first season (its trial campaign) saw the company sell all 1,000 Dabba Lite hotspot devices within days following the launch. Via its DePIN infrastructure, millions of citizens across India have had access to affordable internet. 



Since then, the company has sold and deployed 500 more hotspots and more than 15,000 unique devices connected in the process. Additionally, the hotspots have provided more than 390 TB of data via the DePIN infrastructure and grossed more than $4,500 in revenue from their customers. This aims to reduce data congestion and meet the growing demand for wi-fi users across the world’s most populous democracy.




In tandem with the season two rollout, Dabba users can now discover current data hotspots and view current network performance via the newly launched explorer. The explorer initially provides data for the Dabba testnet, which has been operational for the past two months.



Dabba elects to solve real-world problems



The launch of Dabba hotspots aims to solve the problem of a lack of accessible and affordable wireless data. With Dabba, users will have access to DePINs, which provide wireless data and access to Web 3 features such as tokenization. The latest tokenization features will open up the ecosystem to more users, ensuring a genuine demand for its service and a viable business model that can scale to match demand.



To bootstrap adoption to the platform, Dabba is incentivizing early users (those who join before the TGE event) with enhanced Genesis rewards. Additionally, the platform will empower over 150,000 Local Cable Operators (LCO) that operate as micro-ISPs across India, providing an unrivalled high-speed network across the country.

Senator Cynthia Lummis on Why Crypto Now Has Bipartisan Support in Congress - Unchained


                            Are we ushering in a new era of crypto legislation? U.S. Senator from Wyoming Cynthia Lummis definitely thinks so.
                        
                    
                    
                        Posted May 24, 2024 at 9:00 am EST.

With crypto becoming more politicized than ever, U.S. Senator from Wyoming Cynthia Lummis came on Unchained to talk about the recent regulatory action in Washington, D.C.
She delves into what led to bipartisan support to repeal SAB 121, and how the strength of the vote there in both the House and Senate may have affected the about-face decision to approve spot ether ETFs. Sen. Lummis also explains why she disagrees with how Gary Gensler’s SEC is handling the industry, how to avoid the next TerraUSD, why she feels Wyoming-chartered Custodia Bank is not being treated fairly, the ban on a Chinese-owned, Wyoming-based Bitcoin mining firm, and what advice she would give to the crypto industry during this election year.
Show highlights:

Why the SAB 121 approval was bipartisan
Whether President Biden will veto the resolution
How it’s a “mystery” to Sen. Lummis why the SEC had a change of heart about Ether ETFs
How the SEC’s approach to regulating the industry “is not the American way”
Whether there is a bipartisan majority in favor of crypto in Congress
How bitcoin has come a long way in terms of adoption
Sen. Lummis’ thoughts on how to regulate the stablecoin industry and avoid a Terra Luna situation
The differences between the Lummis-Gillibrand bill and FIT21
How Sen. Lummis feels about the denial of a master account for Custodia Bank
Whether there’s a move against Bitcoin mining companies in the US, given the recent ban of an operation in Wyoming

Dogecoin (DOGE) price takes a bow as Shiba Inu Kabosu dies - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Kabosu, the Shiba Inu behind Dogecoin (DOGE) has passed away at age 18.
Dogecoin’s price fell over 5% to $0.1535 following the news of Kabosu’s death.
Kabosu’s legacy endures through Dogecoin’s charitable impact and community tributes.

In a poignant moment for the cryptocurrency community, Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog that inspired the iconic Dogecoin (DOGE) meme, has passed away at the age of 18.
The news, announced by her owner Atsuko Sato on May 24, 2024, has reverberated across the globe, sparking a wave of condolences and reflections on Kabosu’s remarkable impact on internet culture and the crypto world.
From a shelter dog to the face of a viral crypto sensation
Kabosu’s journey from a shelter dog to the face of a viral sensation began in 2010 when Sato posted photos of her newly adopted pet online.
One image, capturing Kabosu’s skeptical yet curious expression, quickly went viral, giving birth to the “Doge” meme.
Accompanied by humorous, broken English phrases, this meme became a staple of internet humor and eventually the official logo of Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency.
Over the years, Dogecoin has transcended its meme origins, contributing to various philanthropic causes, such as funding clean water projects and sponsoring the Jamaican bobsled team and Kabosu’s image became a symbol of these efforts, reinforcing the positive social impact of the Dogecoin community.
Impact on Dogecoin (DOGE) price
The death of Kabosu has not only evoked emotional responses but has also influenced the financial markets specifically the crypto market.
Following the announcement, Dogecoin’s price dipped over 5%, trading at $0.1535. Although it has slightly recovered, Dogecoin (DOGE) price was still about 3% down at $0.1627.
Shiba Inu (SHIB), another Shiba inu-themed meme coin, also experienced a similar downturn, dropping 5.5% to $0.00002422 highlighting the deep connection between the sentiment surrounding Kabosu and the performance of related cryptocurrencies.
Amid the DOGE price decline following Kobosu’s death data from IntoTheBlock reveales a surge in large DOGE transactions, with the value of significant trades more than doubling to $3.01 billion within 24 hours.
Additionally, a dormant Dogecoin whale holding 893,303 DOGE became active after a decade, transferring a portion of their holdings to Binance.
Dogecoin community moan Kobosu’s lose
The Dogecoin community has been vocal in their tributes. The official Dogecoin account on X acknowledged Kabosu’s profound global impact, describing her as a source of happiness and limitless love.

Today Kabosu, our community's shared friend and inspiration, peacefully passed in the arms of her person. The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable. 
She was a being who knew only happiness and limitless love. 
Please keep her spirit and her family in…
— Dogecoin (@dogecoin) May 24, 2024

Many in the Web3 community including Kabosu’s owner have also shared their condolences, underscoring Kabosu’s role in fostering a lighthearted and charitable spirit within the crypto sector.

On November 2nd 15 years ago, we welcomed Kabosu to our family.I still remember her on the first day she came home. She was scared, sitting in the corner of the room, motionless and silent. She simply stared at me with those big round eyes. pic.twitter.com/4miYReNemr
— かぼすママ (@kabosumama) November 4, 2023

Kabosu’s farewell party is scheduled for May 26 in Narita City, Japan.
As the world bids adieu to this beloved Shiba Inu, her spirit and the joy she brought will undoubtedly continue to inspire and shape the digital landscape for years to come.

Bitcoin whitepaper now back on Bitcoin.org website


The Bitcoin whitepaper has been reuploaded to the Bitcoin.org website following Craig Wright’s failed attempt to prove in court that he’s the protocol’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  
The website was ordered to take down the PDF in 2021 after Wright successfully sued Cøbra, the anonymous group running the site, over copyright infringement. However, Wright’s copyright victory no longer holds weight as his Satoshi claims, and therefore any claims he wrote the whitepaper, have been spectacularly proven wrong.
Bitcoin.org maintainer Hennadii Stepanov announced the Bitcoin whitepaper’s return by sharing a link to the pdf on X (formerly Twitter).

When Wright sued Cøbra, the group was required to attend court hearings that would jeopardize its anonymity. Cøbra subsequently refused to attend these hearings and Wright won his case by default. This resulted in Cøbra paying £35,000 ($40,100) of Wright’s legal fees. 
Bitcoin.org had to stop serving the Bitcoin whitepaper to UK-based users, and instead displayed this quote from Satoshi: “It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle.”
Despite this, numerous publishers decided to share the Bitcoin whitepaper together in an act of protest. The crypto arm of Jack Doresy’s Square hosted the paper, as did a number of governments including the US, Estonia, and Colombia. 
Wright’s own Bitcoin Satoshi Vision whitepaper, which he claimed to be the real thing, was loaded with errors. 
One user compiled a list of over 100 websites hosting the Bitcoin whitepaper just as Craig Wright was threatening to sue anyone who published it. They told Protos it was their way of “fighting back against Wright’s nonsense.”
A High Court in the UK eventually ruled that Wright wasn’t Satoshi in March 2024. One judge concluded that Craig Wright lied “extensively,” engaged in “technobabble,” and isn’t “nearly as clever as he thinks he is.”

Political Biasness Is Trouble Making In AI: Elon Musk


                                Elon Musk's Concerns For AI Leads Him To Introduce xAI                                IntroductionWe all are aware of this tech world and AI-driven day-to-day operations. Elon Musk is concerned that today’s AI systems are being trained to prioritize being politically correct over telling the truth. Recently, speaking at the Viva Tech Paris 2024 event, the tech billionaire Elon Musk painted a very somber picture of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Musk stressed the problem of bias and incorrectness in AI systems and noted that the main threat is that AI is being taught to be politically correct instead of being truthful.What's the News?Musk's primary concern is that modern AI does not have the goal of finding the truth but is affected by political correctness. He gave a rather vivid example of this by referring to Google’s Gemini AI. When asked if it would be wrong to misgender Caitlyn Jenner even if it would prevent a global nuclear war, the AI said that misgendering Jenner would be worse than nuclear war. Musk said that such responses could lead to unwanted results. For instance, an AI determines that the best way to avoid misgendering is to exterminate human beings.This led to a lot of criticism and Google had to roll out several changes to fix these problems in Gemini AI. In this article, Musk also points out that political correctness bias is only one of the issues that the development of AI faces today. He thinks that AI systems are developed to be trained to “Basically lie,” which he considers as very dangerous. Training AI for deception, especially for superintelligent AI can prove disastrous.To Address The Political Issues, Musk Introduces xAIDue to the concern about the current progress of AI. Musk created his own AI company known as xAI in July 2023. While xAI is not as old as its counterparts like Google DeepMind or OpenAI. Musk is confident that it could become one of the leading competitors by 2024. Earlier this year, the company’s signature product Grok was launched in Europe which is an AI-powered chatbot. At the moment, Grok is accessible only to the premium and premium+ subscriptions of the X platform.Musk also highlighted that xAI’s principle is to design AI systems that are maximally inquiring and truthful. He still thinks that the AI looks for the truth regardless of its unpleasantness is the only safe and useful for humanity. This kind of AI would help enhance human development and curiosity to encourage a more constructive and knowledgeable world. ConclusionAs per CoinGabbar reports, Elon Musk’s apprehensions about AI are centered on the risks of bias and fraud in modern AI solutions. He worries that in the name of political correctness, people will be able to carry out terrible things. In response, Musk founded xAI to develop a beneficial form of AI that seeks the truth and is curious. Although xAI has not advanced as other large AI companies. Musk believes that it will become a leading competitor in the AI market by the end of 2024. The general tech industry concurs with Musk’s sentiments as seen in an open letter signed by over 2600 AI experts urging a stop to the development of this technology due to the deep-seated threats it poses to society and humanity.Also Read: Suno AI Music Platform Attracts $125 M Investment

Dogecoin (DOGE) might be experiencing an immediate price plunge, but it is arguably one of the most profitable digital currencies to hold at this time. Data from crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock (ITB) pegs DOGE's profitability at exactly 83.12%.Dogecoin address profitability outlookThis profitability figure pegs the total addresses in profit at 5.24 million, with the average maximum profit price mark set at $0.149375. These profitable addresses came shortly as Dogecoin surpassed the five million milestone.When properly examined, addresses at the break-even point or those with neither profit nor losses come in at 223,680, or 3.55% of the total in the network.Addresses that are in loss are pegged at 841,370 or 13.34%, a figure that is comparatively lower than many of its rivals on the market. By comparison, Shiba Inu has over 34.9% of the total addresses in its network in losses.Dogecoin Profitability Chart Via IntoTheBlockOne unique resilience factor attributable to Dogecoin is its ability to flip unfavorable situations in the long term. The pioneering meme coin has seen its price drop as much as 3.88% in 24 hours to $0.1595 to court the general mark. To cross the breakeven price of $0.160814, Dogecoin would have to soar by about 10%.This is an easier feat considering the dog-themed meme coin is relatively bullish in the past week, where it registered about a 5% surge.Meme coin tribute to KabosuDogecoin is maintaining its legacy as the first and largest meme coin by market capitalization. However, the real dog that inspired its creation, Kabosu, has passed on, drawing condolences from the broader crypto ecosystem.While this may not directly impact the valuation of DOGE, the close ties to Kabosu send an important message that the most important meme coin is Dogecoin. This, over the long term, may drive more capital into the ecosystem and power a major address profitability boost.

Micron Technology Stock Gains in Premarket After Samsung's HBM Chips Fail - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is facing a significant setback as its latest high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips have reportedly failed to pass Nvidia Corporation’s rigorous testing process. The issues, which include heat and power consumption problems, affect Samsung’s HBM3 and HBM3E chips, the latter of which was introduced this year. The South Korean tech giant has been attempting to satisfy Nvidia’s requirements since last year, as the American multinational technology company commands around 80% of the global GPU market for AI applications.



Meeting Nvidia’s stringent standards is crucial for HBM manufacturers’ reputation and profit growth. The news of Samsung’s test failures, reported in April for its 8-layer and 12-layer HBM3E chips, caused the company’s shares to fall by 2%. As a result, competitors SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) are now poised to gain a larger share of the HBM market.



Demand for HBM is High Driven by Generative AI Boom



High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) type in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption. Initially produced in 2013 to improve the performance of graphics accelerators, HBM has become increasingly crucial in processing massive amounts of data for AI applications and high-performance computing. The generative AI boom has significantly increased the demand for sophisticated GPUs, further driving the need for high-performance memory solutions like HBM.



The three main companies producing HBM chips are Samsung, Micron Technology, and SK Hynix. While Samsung aims to begin mass production of its HBM3E chips in the second quarter and is working to optimize its products through close collaboration with customers, its competitors have already made significant strides. SK Hynix began supplying HBM3E to Nvidia in late March, and Micron has also announced plans to supply Nvidia with its own HBM3E products.





Micron Technology Stock Up Premarket



As Samsung’s stock closed in decline, Micron Technology, Inc. saw gains in premarket trading. The company closed at $126.27, with a market cap of $139.83 billion and impressive returns over the past five years. Micron recently announced HBM3E memory products with significant power efficiency improvements and is targeting greater market share with the next industry standard, HBM4, expected by 2026.



Despite the positive outlook, Micron has been involved in a $445 million patent trial verdict favoring Netlist, Inc. However, the company remains focused on its HBM product development and securing a larger portion of the growing AI and high-performance computing markets.







Do you think Micron Technology will continue its rally through 2024? Let us know in the comments below.

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) Will Surge 16,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Fuks Biden presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Fuks Biden has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe Fuks Biden could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Pepe Fuks Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Fuks Biden on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Fuks Biden by entering its contract address – 4D3CzRs6n4hPrHJsqon5oDVKRe8nhaiBL1mQGowzhPvg – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEFBID.

The Spectator's Analysis: Bitcoin's Rise and Potential Collapse | Cryptoglobe


                                
The power of Bitcoin to create and obliterate fortunes in record time is unprecedented, claims The Spectator. In a recent article, they pose the question: Could the biggest Bitcoin boom and bust still be on the horizon?



The Spectator, established in 1828, is a prestigious British weekly magazine known for its sharp and insightful commentary on politics, culture, and current affairs. With a conservative editorial stance, the magazine has significantly influenced public discourse and political thought in the UK. Its pages have featured contributions from notable writers, including former editor Boris Johnson and current editor Fraser Nelson, and it regularly publishes articles that spark debate and discussion. The Spectator has been recognized with numerous awards for its journalism and commentary, underscoring its reputation for high-quality and impactful content.



Since January, Bitcoin has seen a remarkable recovery, trading at or even surpassing the highs it reached in 2022. This resurgence occurred despite the trial, conviction, and imprisonment of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX.







The article mentions that Bankman-Fried is now reportedly trading grains of rice with fellow inmates at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center. The article then incorrectly alleges that for many FTX customers, Bitcoin turned into the scam critics had long feared and so it asks the question: why does anyone want to buy it now?







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The Spectator suggests the answer lies in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has simplified Bitcoin ownership for retail investors. Grayscale won its lengthy battle with regulators in January, allowing it to offer this fund. Although the article acknowledges that this levels the playing field between ordinary investors and more sophisticated players who might be comfortable with downloading a Bitcoin wallet, it says such spot ETFs raise concerns about the financial stability of millions of households since — allegedly — mainstreaming Bitcoin could lead to widespread financial risk, akin to having a bookmaker in every living room.



The article emphasizes that Bitcoin remains a classic zero-sum game. It says although vast paper fortunes can be made by driving up the price, not everyone can realize these gains and that a mass sell-off could collapse the price to zero. Next, it states that this creates a scenario where quick sellers profit at the expense of slower ones. Bitcoin, the piece argues, earns no income and holds no intrinsic value, likening it to a sophisticated tech-based Ponzi scheme.



The easier it becomes to buy Bitcoin, The Spectator warns, the higher the potential for financial disaster and wealth transfer from the uninformed to the savvy. However, recent Bitcoin price behavior has not mirrored past speculative manias. After soaring from $26,000 last October to $73,000 in March, Bitcoin’s price has stabilized between $60,000 and $70,000 for the past two months. This may suggest a pause in speculative fervor, but The Spectator cautions against ruling out another bubble. It goes on to say that Bitcoin has already defied historical patterns by rebounding multiple times, and the ability to purchase it through an ETF might yet trigger another boom—potentially affecting an even larger number of investors.

Long-time crypto critic surprises with a related warning on privacy


    Molly White, a long-term cryptocurrency critic, recently expressed concerns about governments cracking down on Tornado Cash. Given Molly’s posting history, her warning posed a surprise for many crypto enthusiasts.



Notably, the cryptocurrency mixing service on Ethereum (ETH) has reportedly been used for criminal money laundering, but White worries about the ramifications of this recent court decision.



In her article “Privacy, Human Rights, and Tornado Cash,” Molly White discusses the sentencing of Alexey Pertsev, a Tornado Cash developer and operator. In an unprecedented ruling, a Dutch court sentenced Pertsev to 64 months in prison, as reported by Finbold.











Particularly, despite the service’s involvement in laundering billions of dollars, White is concerned about Pertsev’s conviction and similar cases. As written, she acknowledges that her stance may surprise those who know her as a crypto critic. However, she explains that mixers like Tornado Cash are also used by honest people seeking privacy on public blockchains.



Crypto wars and privacy as a human right



In this context, Molly White believes in the right to write cryptographic code and operate services without liability for criminal activity. She draws parallels to the “Crypto Wars,” where writing cryptographic code was finally considered protected speech in the United States. Additionally, she emphasizes the importance of privacy as a human right.



Privacy is indeed a well-recognized fundamental human right, included in the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 12, which applies to financial and monetary privacy.




“No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,  family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against  such interference or attacks.”
– Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 12




Moreover, The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), affiliated with the UN, has set International Standards for Privacy in the Digital Age:




“The right to privacy is central to the enjoyment and exercise of human rights online and offline. It serves as one of the foundations of a democratic society and plays a key role for the realization of a broad spectrum of human rights, including in the digital sphere, ranging from freedom of expression, freedom of association and assembly, access, and enjoyment of economic and social rights. Interference with the right to  privacy can also have a disproportionate impact on certain individuals and/or groups, thus exacerbating inequality and discrimination.”
– International Standards for Privacy in the Digital Age




This strong recognition evidences the importance of peaceful individuals securing their privacy by any means under the presumption of innocence until a harmful crime is effectively committed and properly judged. Thus, this includes the peaceful development and use of privacy tools independently of particularly criminal individuals using the same tool.



In conclusion, the article explores the complexities of financial privacy and the arbitrary nature of regulations. White believes that people should have more financial privacy than they currently do. Furthermore, she clarifies that her cryptocurrency criticism focuses on educating people about a technology that has failed its original ideals.



White is concerned about the lack of financial privacy in the cryptocurrency industry despite it being highly promoted that way. Nevertheless, she worries that cracking down on the industry may weaken financial privacy and hurt vulnerable people.



Finally, while cryptocurrency may not be the best solution for financial privacy, the long-time critic recognizes its potential value in a world with diminishing privacy. Even more, Molly White defends the right of honest people to fight for it despite the current challenges.

Ethereum ETFs Could Lead to "Serious" Security Risks, Say Experts - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsExperts are warning of the looming threat that the newly approved U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs could pose if staking is ever introduced.In a crucial bid to push the approval process over the line, Ethereum ETF issuers dropped language regarding the staking of customer ETH. When the network transitioned to a proof of stake consensus in September 2022, it required ETH to be locked up in a process called staking. The staked ETH belongs to validators who help to secure the network. They’re rewarded for staking their ETH, but can be penalized if they don’t verify transactions on time.Centralization concerns have arisen in the past when single validators gained control of large portions of staked ETH. At time, people have even compared liquid staking provider Lido to a "cartel" when it swelled in size.“Removing staking language from ETH ETF applications was a move to appease the SEC. But this short-term solution could cause a long-term problem.” Ganesh Swami, CEO and co-founder of blockchain data analytics company Covalent, told Decrypt, “If multiple ETFs use the same custodians, this type of centralization would cause concentration to increase, exposing the network to operational risks such as malicious collusion.”Taking a look at the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, we can see that Coinbase is the custodian for 90% of the total assets. While this poses an obvious centralization risk already, adding staking to the equation, well, ups the stakes.“Staking ETH ETFs are not a new concept, they exist in other countries, but clearly the U.S market brings a much larger scale,” Andrew O’Neill, analytical lead on digital assets at S&P Global, told Decrypt. “The risk in that case is that if ETFs are concentrating their stake with a small number of custodians, this could create validator concentration risks in the consensus mechanism.”Coinbase, which is already the second largest Ethereum validator, is currently set to be the custodian of at least six out of the nine firms planning to launch an Ethereum ETF. If we see similar interest as we did with the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which as a group currently have a market capitalization of $54 billion, this concentration of power could pose a security risk.“You can measure concentration risk by the number of nodes a single entity would need to control the chain. The lower that number, the higher the central point of failure.” Mona El Isa, CEO and co-founder of institutional DeFi company Avantgarde Finance, told Decrypt, “If any party amassed that much control, they could potentially alter the state of the blockchain itself. That poses serious risks to security.”It appears that staking was removed from Ethereum ETF applications due to the SEC’s view that staking is equivalent to a securities service. It’s not without precedence. The SEC has sued companies, like Kraken and Coinbase, to stop them offering staking services to U.S. customers.As staking is currently not allowed for ETF providers or custodians, there are no guidelines put in place to reduce the potential centralization and concentration risks that could be looming.Edited by Stacy Elliott.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Comeback Fueled By Bullish Buying Spree


																Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, has been on a tear lately. After months of hovering, the coin has seen a surge in price, and analysts are now pointing to signs within the derivatives market suggesting this rally might have legs.

Taker Buy Sell Ratio Nears Equilibrium
One key indicator is the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric that tracks the volume of buy orders compared to sell orders in ETH’s perpetual futures market. Traditionally, a ratio below 1 suggests more sell orders are flooding the market, potentially driving the price down. Conversely, a ratio above 1 indicates a dominance of buy orders, often a bullish signal.

SEC Okays Spot Ethereum ETFs, Market Expectations Reversed
The news that the US SEC has approved spot Ethereum ETFs has caused a sharp reversal in the market’s expectations for Ethereum ETF rejection this week, and as a result, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is moving erratically in late Thursday activity.
As of right now, Ethereum was trading for about $3,770. That is both considerably higher than the previous session low of $3,500 and sharply lower than the previous session highs of over $4,000.

CryptoQuant, a leading crypto analytics platform, recently reported that ETH’s Taker Buy Sell Ratio, observed using a 7-day simple moving average, is poised to cross above its 1-center line. This signifies a decline in sell orders and a potential rise in buying pressure. This suggests that the coin may soon retake the $4,000 price level.

This upward trend in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio indicates a potential shift in market dynamics, noted ShayanBTC, a pseudonymous analyst at CryptoQuant. If the ratio continues to rise, it may signal a reduction in aggressive selling pressure, which could be a positive development for ETH’s price, ShayanBTC added.

Futures Open Interest Reaches New Highs
Another data point bolstering the bullish case comes from the Futures Open Interest metric. This metric tracks the total amount of outstanding futures contracts that haven’t been closed or settled. A rising Open Interest suggests more traders are entering new positions, potentially anticipating a price increase.

	Related Reading


According to Coinglass, another crypto analytics platform, ETH’s Futures Open Interest has skyrocketed to a new all-time high of $16 billion. This signifies a surge in market participation, with more traders betting on ETH’s future.
The all-time high OI suggests a significant increase in investor confidence. This could be due to several factors, including growing institutional adoption of ETH and the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Halts With Surge in Exchange Deposits


In this analysis, we delve into Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent price action, examining key technical indicators and market signals across daily and four-hour timeframes. 
Our focus includes the role of the Ichimoku cloud, the significance of the Tenkan-sen plateaus, and recent trends in exchange depositing addresses to provide a comprehensive outlook for SHIB.
Daily and Four-Hour Timeframe Analysis
Let’s delve into Shiba Inu (SHIB) ‘s price action on the daily and four-hour timeframes. Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00002393. Notably, the price has failed to enter the daily Ichimoku cloud on the upside, which is a major support level. 
The price is now approaching a mid-term support level, represented by the red Tenkan-sen plateau on the chart. The 100 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) on the daily timeframe serves as a crucial mid-term support level for SHIB’s price.
The Tenkan-sen, or conversion line, is a key part of the Ichimoku system in technical analysis. It shows the average of the highest and lowest prices over the past nine periods, giving a short-term view of price trends.
Importance of Tenkan-Sen Plateaus

Plateau Formation: When the Tenkan-sen flattens, it indicates a balance between buyers and sellers, creating important market levels.
Support: If the price is above a Tenkan-sen plateau and falls, the plateau can act as a support level, where buyers are likely to step in.
Resistance: If the price is below a Tenkan-sen plateau and rises, the plateau can act as a resistance level, where sellers are likely to step in.

Zooming into the four-hour timeframe, we see a similar pattern. The price attempts to break below the Ichimoku cloud, which could accelerate the downward movement. If it tests this level, the lower boundary of the cloud will act as a critical support level to watch. 
Additionally, the price has broken below the 100 EMA in the four-hour timeframe, which is also a bearish signal.
These combined signals highlight the importance of this zone as a resistance area. A break above this zone could trigger a substantial upward movement of 10% to 20%. Conversely, if the price remains below the 4H 100EMA, it could indicate a bearish continuation, potentially driving the price down to $0.00002000.

SHIB/BTC Chart Analysis
The SHIB/BTC chart also exhibits bearish signals for Shiba Inu. 
SHIB/BTC has tested the lower boundary on the daily timeframe and is now attempting to break below the 100 EMA, signaling a highly bearish outlook for SHIB.
If SHIB enters the cloud to the upside and Bitcoin’s price appreciates to $70,000, SHIB could potentially break above the $0.0000265 price range. However, if these conditions are not met, the bearish outlook for SHIB may persist.

Recent Spike in Exchange Depositing Addresses: Bearish Implications
The chart shows a significant spike in the number of exchange depositing addresses at the end of May. This sudden increase suggests that many SHIB holders transfer their tokens to exchanges.

Potential Selling Pressure: Historically, increasing depositing addresses often precedes a sell-off. When holders move their tokens to exchanges, they typically liquidate their positions, creating selling pressure in the market.

Bearish Implications: The recent spike indicates that more SHIB holders might be preparing to sell their assets. This influx of sell orders can increase supply on exchanges, potentially driving the price down if the demand does not match the supply.
Strategic Recommendations
Outlook: Bearish to Neutral

The current price action suggests a bearish trend, especially with the price attempting to break below the Ichimoku cloud in the four-hour timeframe.
The recent break below the 4H 100 EMA on the four-hour chart reinforces the bearish outlook. Monitor for further declines if the price fails to hold above key support levels, particularly the lower boundary of the 4H Ichimoku cloud.
The bearish outlook could be invalidated if SHIB manages to reenter the daily Ichimoku cloud. A key level to watch is the upper boundary of the daily Ichimoku cloud at $0.000265. A break above this level could shift the outlook to neutral or even bullish.

Why Is ETH Price Falling Despite SEC Approving All Spot Ethereum ETFs? | Bitcoinist.com


								Ethereum’s (ETH) price has failed to make any significant rally following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. This is undoubtedly surprising, given that the approval was expected to spark a massive price surge for the second-largest crypto token. 
Why ETH’s Price Has Failed To Rally
Ethereum’s price may have failed to rally because the crypto token was already priced into the news about a potential approval. It is worth noting that ETH’S price rallied by almost 20% earlier this week when Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their approval odds from 25% to 75%, suggesting that approval was almost likely. 

Therefore, this could have turned out to be a typical ‘sell the news’ event, with many traders currently taking profits from their earlier ETH investments. NewsBTC reported that Ethereum whales had bought over 110,000 ETH ($341 million) between May 19 and 20 as they positioned themselves ahead of any news regarding a potential approval of these funds. 
Meanwhile, historically speaking, this could have been expected from ETH’s price, considering that Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant drawdown following the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. 
However, it is worth mentioning that unlike the Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading immediately, these Spot Ethereum ETFs won’t start trading just yet. The SEC only approved the exchange filings (19b-4s) and will still have to approve the registration filings (S-1s) for these funds to begin trading. 
The fact these Ethereum ETFs won’t begin trading just yet could be another reason why ETH’S price hasn’t reacted positively to this development. As such, approval of the registration filings, which may take weeks or months, may be needed to spark another rally for Ethereum and other altcoins by extension. 
A key positive is that ETH is up by over 28% in the last seven days, which is a big deal considering that the crypto token has lagged for a while now and failed to match up with other major-cap crypto tokens. 
Another Reason To Be Bullish On Ethereum
The approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs is a clear indication that the SEC doesn’t consider ETH a security, contrary to earlier reports that the Commission might have held this belief for some time now. 

TuongVy Le, a General Counsel at Anchorage Digital, noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that funds whose assets are 40% or more securities may not register through a form S-1 but through Form N-1A or N-2.
Therefore, if the SEC considered ETH a security, it would have rejected the S-1 filings made by the various fund issuers like BlackRock since these Ethereum ETFs will hold ETH as their major assets. 
At the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $3,803, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Disappoints With Fall To $67,000, But Analyst Says Investors Should Not Be Fazed. Here’s Why


																Bitcoin has dropped from its weekly high of $71,980, recorded on May 21, to as low as $67,000, raising concerns amongst crypto investors. However, crypto analyst Jelle has suggested that there is no need to be worried about the flagship crypto’s price action. 
Why Investors Shouldn’t Be Worried About The Bitcoin Price
Jelle noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin is still following a “similar path” to the 2017 bull run. He claimed that once the crypto token breaks again above the 2021 all-time high ($69,000), it will make a parabolic move to the upside. Jelle predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 when that happens.

In an earlier X post, Jelle provided insights into why Bitcoin could easily make such a move. He revealed that all key resistance levels have been broken. He also noted that a weekly hidden bullish divergence had formed on Bitcoin’s chart, just on top of the previous cycle highs. 
Source: X
Meanwhile, crypto trader and analyst Mags also echoed Jelle’s bullish sentiment. In an X post, he mentioned that this recent price correction was the “fakeout before the next leg up.” Mags noted how Bitcoin has maintained a similar pattern since its price bottomed at $15,000, with the flagship crypto consolidating inside a range for “a few weeks or months.”
Mags claims that Bitcoin then breaks below the range where it traps all bears before making a “quick reclaim and another leg up.” The analyst added that there is going to be a “massive leg up soon” if Bitcoin manages to repeat this pattern.

Crypto analyst BitQuant also assured there was no need to panic about Bitcoin’s recent dip. In an X post, he claimed that the price dip was a “good confirmation” that Bitcoin is preparing for a “big leg up.” The crypto analyst predicts that the flagship crypto will rise to as high as $95,000 when this parabolic move happens. 
BTC’s Outlook Is Bullish Either Way
Crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin’s outlook is bullish regardless of what happens. He outlined two possible moves the flagship crypto could make from here. First, he stated that a weekly candle close above $71,500 would likely kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range.

On the other hand, he noted that history suggests that Bitcoin will consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for some weeks more. Based on his analysis, Bitcoin is still bound to make significant moves to the upside, and all that matters is the timing. The analyst noted that a breakout now could mean Bitcoin would have an accelerated cycle.

However, if Bitcoin continues to consolidate for some more weeks, that will help it resynchronize with past halving cycles, resulting in a longer bull run.

2024 update: Utah's crypto antenna mystery remains unsolved


    Over two years ago, a discovery of mysterious antennas, consisting of a locked battery box, a router, and a solar panel, in the mountains of the Salt Lake City area has left the Utah authorities baffled over their origin, and today, there is still no official answer as to who was behind them.



Specifically, Salt Lake’s recreational trails manager Tyler Fonarow said in January 2023 that the antennas, which many believe have something to do with mining cryptocurrencies, had been popping up for a year before, leading city officials to set out to remove them, as Finbold reported at the time.



As placing structures on public lands without permission is illegal, and some of the antennas were on steep hills, the authorities had embarked on removing them, with Salt Lake City Public Lands sharing the photos on its Facebook profile and urging anyone with information to come forward.

Helium hotspots?



According to one theory, these antennas belong to the wireless blockchain platform Helium and potentially serve as hotspots for its customers so they can mine the network’s native token, HNT, and earn money, which would mean that those individuals were the ones setting them up after purchase.



Moreover, many social media users have corroborated the theory that these devices are, indeed, Helium crypto miner antennas, based on the photographs and close-ups shared by local news outlet KSL 5 TV’s Michael Locklear in a tweet (now X post) on January 6, 2023.







Similarities to Helium hotspots



In fact, upon closer inspection, the setups on the photographs look much like the Helium mining equipment available for purchase in online marketplaces like eBay, such as the Helium Rak Miner Antenna bundle, or directly from their manufacturers.  



On top of that, in March 2021, much before the publicized discovery, the owner of the website/blog Gristle King – A Guide to DePIN, only known as ‘Nik,’ shared a photograph of what appears to be him standing next to an antenna for a Helium hotspot as he explained which product was the best to buy.

Additionally, the images posted by technology product reviews and tutorials website notsealed.com in November 2021, which describe how to make a DIY solar off-grid Helium miner, strikingly resemble the mysterious devices found in the mountains of Utah, so the Helium theory is valid.

Furthermore, information security expert William Knowles acknowledged at the time that the devices looked like Helium miners but that “whoever is placing them is spending more on infrastructure than they could ever dream of making today,” as HNT had “been on a major slide even before FTX and 3AC happened.”







That said, so far, there has been no official communication or explanation coming from either Helium or Utah authorities (or any other government bodies, for that matter) regarding the true origin of the mysterious crypto-linked antennas popping up across the mountainous region of Salt Lake City.

OKX withdraws VASP license application in Hong Kong - CoinJournal



                    

                    
OKX withdraws VASP license application in Hong Kong.
The exchange will cease trading services by May 31.
Users can withdraw funds until August 31.

OKX has announced the withdrawal of its Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license application in Hong Kong.
The exchange stated in its website that “after careful consideration of our business strategy, we’ve decided to withdraw OKX HK’s VASP license application at this time.”
By withdrawing from Hong Kong, the exchange, ranked as the third largest globally by trading volume, follows a similar path taken by other major applicants like Huobi Hong Kong earlier this month. The move also follows the exchange’s withdrawal of VATP license application for the second time in May 15 this year.
OKX to cease Hong Kong operations from May 31
Effective May 31, 2024, OKX will cease providing centralized crypto asset trading services to Hong Kong residents.
This decision, described as a strategic reassessment by the company, emphasizes a shift in business priorities amid a challenging regulatory environment. Despite this move, OKX assures that customer funds will remain safe and that users will retain the ability to withdraw their assets.
The move aligns with a growing trend as multiple exchanges reevaluate their operations in Hong Kong due to stringent regulatory frameworks and slow approval processes by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Notably, the SFC has only approved two exchanges since 2022, highlighting the rigorous standards in place.
From June 1, 2024, OKX will only support withdrawal transactions in Hong Kong, advising users against making deposits as these might not be automatically credited post-deadline.
Open orders remaining after May 31 will be automatically canceled, and the funds will be returned to users’ accounts. Customers are encouraged to withdraw their assets by August 31, 2024, after which direct withdrawals or transfers will no longer be possible.
The exchange’s Web3 services, including self-hosted wallets, will continue to operate normally in Hong Kong, allowing users to maintain decentralized financial activities without interruption.
In the meantime, OKX’s customer support team remains available to assist users during this transition.

                        Malaysian authorities have dismantled a forex investment fraud and cryptocurrency syndicate that had been operating in the country.The syndicate, which had been laundering funds obtained through overseas scams, was targeted in a series of raids conducted across the Klang Valley from May 13 to 21.As a result, eight local men and two women were arrested, and substantial amounts of assets were seized, according to reports from local media outlets. Malaysian Officials Seize Over $12 Million Worth of Assets
During the raids, law enforcement officials managed to confiscate 129 vehicles with exclusive registration number plates, estimated to be worth $3.8 million.Additionally, they seized 75 branded watches valued at $2.1 million, 18 luxury vehicles worth $1.7 million, over $100,000 in cash, and more assets.Furthermore, bank accounts totaling $10.8 million were frozen as part of the investigation.According to Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain, the suspects, aged between 28 and 51 years, were remanded for three to seven days for further investigation,Highlighting the syndicate’s operations, Razarudin revealed that it had been active since 2017, primarily based in a foreign country.The syndicate employed various methods, including unregistered money changers and cryptocurrency transactions, to transfer and launder funds from illegal activities.The syndicate utilized several avenues to conceal the illicit proceeds.It engaged in the sale and purchase of exclusive and classic car registration numbers, as well as luxury branded watches through a shop in Bukit Jalil.The syndicate also resorted to converting cryptocurrencies into cash through unregistered money changers, effectively evading detection by law enforcement agencies.Razarudin urged the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities related to money laundering or fraudulent investment schemes.“The public is asked to continue playing the role of eyes and ears to channel information on fraudulent investment and syndicates selling/buying registration (plate) numbers and related crimes to police.”April Records Lowest Crypto Hack Losses
The cryptocurrency industry experienced a major downturn in combined losses from hacks and scams in April.The month saw the lowest combined losses from crypto-related hacks and scams since 2021, with approximately $25.7 million lost to exploits, hacks, and scams.More specifically, only $25.7 million was lost in attacks throughout the month, marking the lowest amount since CertiK began tracking such data in 2021.Flash loan attacks accounted for $129,000 in losses, with the largest incident causing $55,000 in damages.This marked the lowest incidence of flash loan attacks since February 2022, and $4.3 million was lost to exit scams.As reported, the first quarter of this year has seen $336 million lost to Web3 hackers and fraud, with nearly half of the capital stolen in January alone. Nonetheless, the number represents a 23% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2023.It is also worth noting that $73,885,000 has been recovered from stolen Web3 capital in 7 specific situations.

$ETH: Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton Says Only Stage 1 of Approval of Spot Ethererum ETFs Has Been Passed | Cryptoglobe


                                
On May 24, Jay Clayton, the former SEC chairman, appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” to discuss the SEC’s approval (on May 23) of 19B-4 filings for several US-based spot Ethereum ETFs. 











Here are the key points from the discussion:



Approval Process: Clayton clarified that there are two steps in the approval process for such products. The first step, which was achieved, is the listing approval. The second step, which is pending, is the approval of the product itself, involving the registration statement.Implications: The approval of the listing does not mean that trading can begin immediately. It signifies a step towards inevitability, similar to the process with Bitcoin ETFs.Differences from Bitcoin ETFs: Unlike the Bitcoin ETF approval, which was compelled by a judge’s decision, the Ethereum ETF approval faces different circumstances. A key issue has been the classification of transactions in Ethereum and whether they are considered securities.Legislative Influence: Clayton mentioned that recent congressional actions, including a new crypto bill — i.e. the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) — have clarified aspects of digital asset custody and trading. This legislation appears to influence the SEC’s stance and indicates a desire from Congress to see digital assets like Ethereum trade similarly to securities.Historical Context: Clayton discussed his previous hesitancy to approve such products due to concerns about market efficacy. He now sees the market for Ethereum as having developed sufficiently to warrant consideration for such a spot ETF.Commodity vs. Security: He used an analogy involving Broadway tickets to explain how something can transition from being a security to a commodity. Initially, investments in a project represent securities. Once the project (or network) is established, the same investments (or tokens) may be treated as commodities used within the network.

The approval of an ETF application by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a two-stage process.



Stage 1: 19b-4 Filing Approval 







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The first stage involves the approval of the 19b-4 filing, which is a rule change proposal submitted by the exchange where the ETF will be listed (e.g., Nasdaq, CBOE, or NYSE). This filing outlines the proposed rules and procedures for listing and trading the ETF. The SEC reviews the 19b-4 filing to ensure that it complies with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations. If the SEC approves the 19b-4 filing, it means that the exchange is allowed to list the ETF, but the product is not yet ready for launch.



Stage 2: Registration Statement Approval 



The second stage involves the approval of the ETF issuer’s registration statement (e.g., Form S-1 or Form N-1A). The registration statement is a disclosure document that provides detailed information about the ETF, including its investment objectives, strategies, risks, and fees. The SEC reviews the registration statement to ensure that it complies with the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, and that it provides adequate disclosure to investors. If the SEC approves the registration statement, the ETF issuer can proceed with launching the product and making it available for trading on the approved exchange.



It’s important to note that the approval of the 19b-4 filing does not guarantee the approval of the registration statement, and vice versa. The ETF issuer must successfully navigate both stages of the approval process before the ETF can be launched and traded in the market.

Analysts Predict June Launch for Newly Approved Ethereum ETFs


According to market analysts, Ethereum ETFs could make their debut by mid-June. 
The newly approved funds aim to broaden Ethereum investment by allowing shares to be traded on stock exchanges, mirroring the cryptocurrency’s price movements.
Analysts Predict Ethereum ETF Debut by Mid-June

Eight ETF applicants, including VanEck, BlackRock, and Fidelity, received regulatory approval on May 23. Hashdex was the only issuer not green-lighted that day. However, the approval doesn’t mean the instruments will be available on the exchanges tomorrow: applicants must secure approved S-1 registration statements before trading begins.
Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggests this process could take a few weeks, potentially up to five months. Another Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, predicts a mid-June launch.

“My guess is there’s only one round of comments on the S-1s. And during BTC one round took two weeks ish. So I this mid-June is certainly poss. Just a guess, tho. We will see,” Balchunas said.

VanEck quickly filed its amended S-1 after the 19b-4 approval, with other applicants expected to follow. Gabriel Shapiro from Delphi Labs notes that the SEC’s approval came from its Trading and Markets unit. A SEC commissioner can challenge this decision within ten days.
Expectations for spot Ethereum ETFs are high. Seyffart predicts they could attract 20% of spot Bitcoin ETFs’ flows, while Balchunas estimates a conservative 10-15%. Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $13.3 billion in net inflows. Capturing 20% would mean spot ETH ETFs could see around $2.66 billion in inflows.
However, the dynamics of the second most capitalized cryptocurrency are still far from bullish. Following the SEC decision, Ethereum’s price increased by just 1%. At the time of the approval, ETH was trading at $3,840. According to BeInCrypto, it has since dropped 3.5% to $3,714.

This situation exemplifies the “sell the news” phenomenon. Ethereum’s price surged 10% minutes after rumors of an imminent ETF approval began circulating. Now that the news is confirmed, the market has started to sell off. 
Bitcoin had a similar response when spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January. It took a full month of volatility before BTC returned to pre-approval price. Once it did, it climbed to a new all-time high.

Avalanche (AVAX) Price Breakout Likely to Fail After Consolidation


Avalanche’s (AVAX) price is facing significant resistance that could potentially invalidate the potential of a rally and push the altcoin back into consolidation.
AVAX holders could change the outcome, but they, too, would need incentives that the crypto asset may not be able to offer.
Avalanche’s Bullishness May Be Short-Lived

Avalanche’s price at $37 had broken out of the month-long consolidation it was in, reigniting investors’ optimism about gains. But AVAX fell back below the resistance of $39, essentially reinitiating consolidation.
One reason behind this is the lack of push from the broader market, as evidenced by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). MACD is a momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price, providing buy and sell signals.
For the last couple of days, the MACD has maintained a bullish crossover, but this could change soon. At the moment, the signal line is close to moving above the MACD line, and when that happens, a bearish crossover will be confirmed.

This could disrupt the potential rally.
In addition, Avalanche’s price is facing major resistance between $37 and $41. This is because, according to the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator, AVAX holders bought about 11.9 million AVAX worth $409.7 million in this range.
To break out of the consolidation, the altcoin would first need to make this supply profitable. This could sustain investors’ bullishness as well. They would be incentivized to participate on the network and push the price further up.

However, the chances of this supply becoming profit-bearing are unlikely since the bullish cues are weak currently.
AVAX Price Prediction: Two Limits to Watch

Avalanche’s price, trading at $37, could gradually fall to support at $31 since the aforementioned factors suggest a bearish outcome. The resistance at $39 and support at $31 are the two limits of consolidation that AVAX has been in for more than a month.
Read More: Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030

But if the market observes bullish cues, Avalanche’s price would have a shot at reclaiming $39 as a support floor. Doing so would initiate a recovery for AVAX, sending it to $42. 
The next major resistance is 45. If the altcoin reaches it, the bearish thesis can be considered invalidated.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsEthereum dropped 4% immediately following the historic U.S. approval of spot Ethereum exchange traded funds (ETFs) yesterday.Many believed that the passing of spot ETFs in the U.S. would be a bullish event for the second largest crypto currency in the world. And it still might be. But in the hours that followed the approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ethereum’s price barely budged—moving up just 1%.At the time of the approval, Ethereum was sitting at $3,840 but is now down 3.6% to $3,701, according to CoinGecko. This drop is even more pronounced over the past 24 hours dropping 6% from $3,926, as news of the approval began to circulate.This is a typical display of “buy the rumor, sell the news” as Ethereum’s price spiked 9% in the minutes that followed rumors that an ETF approval was imminent.

In a noteworthy development, XRP has seen a staggering 108% increase in trading volume amid a broader $400 million sell-off on the cryptocurrency market. Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that XRP's trading volume more than doubled, rising by 108% compared to the previous day.This surge in trading volume comes at a decisive time in the digital asset space, as investors react to a mix of news both within and outside the crypto market. The past 24 hours have been noteworthy for the crypto market. Following much speculation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs to be listed on their respective exchanges. Coinbase also reopened XRP trading in New York, to the delight of the XRP community.Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, said yesterday that customers in New York could once again trade XRP on the crypto exchange. Grewal wrote in a social media post: "XRP trading on Coinbase is available again in NY. We heard you and put in the work in strong partnership with the State. And now the word can be put out— we are back up." This news remains significant given that Coinbase is the largest crypto exchange contributing to XRP volumes after Binance. However, the crypto market posted an unexpected reaction to the recent news, with the market currently experiencing a sell-off, with roughly $400 million in crypto liquidations. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as several other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, are down in price.At the time of writing, XRP was down 0.32% in the last 24 hours to $0.526, according to CoinMarketCap data. XRP trading volume increased by 104% during the same time frame, totaling $2.316 billion.Along with the increased trading volume, XRP's price has shown relative stability in the face of a broader market downturn. While many cryptocurrencies have seen significant price drops, XRP is depicting lesser losses, suggesting strong support levels and investor confidence.As the market reacts to both internal and external influences, XRP's performance will be closely watched by traders and investors alike in the days ahead.

Core User Airdrops Yield Higher Token Prices, Study Finds


Recent research reveals that the size of airdrops has a surprisingly limited impact on token price performance.
Despite the common belief that larger token distributions lead to significant price movements, findings from multiple studies suggest otherwise.
Airdrop Size Less Impactful on Price Action

Airdrops, a method of distributing newly minted tokens to selected wallets, have become a common practice in cryptocurrency. They often help establish an initial float, enable on-chain governance and power transactions, reward early contributors, and attract new users. However, the actual impact of these distributions on token prices remains a topic of debate.
Average Price Performance Over Time. Source: 6THMAN Ventures
A comprehensive study analyzing over 2 million events across 40 different protocols found that the size of token distribution does not significantly affect price performance or volatility. 

“Large anticipated token distribution events typically create selling pressure and stabilize lower after some time,” the study says.

Read more: What are Crypto Airdrops?
Another study by CoinGecko supports this view, highlighting that 23 out of the 50 biggest token distributions recorded peak token prices during the first two weeks of their airdrop date. This immediate interest often leads to a brief surge in price, followed by stabilization as the market adjusts.
The type of recipient plays a crucial role in token price performance. Airdrops to core users already engaged with the protocol result in better price performance. These users are likelier to hold or buy more tokens, leading to lower volatility and more stable prices. Conversely, widespread airdrops to a broader audience often result in more immediate sellers. 


“Widespread recipients were twice as likely to sell their tokens, causing higher volatility and more significant price drops,” analysts note.

This strategic targeting helps maintain token value and reduce post-airdrop price volatility, indicating stronger community retention and engagement. For instance, small token distributions to core users resulted in 4-8 times more buyers than other categories.
In conclusion, the size of airdrops has little impact on token prices. Instead, the type of recipients and their engagement with the project significantly influence the price dynamics. These findings challenge the traditional belief that larger airdrops lead to better performance, highlighting the importance of recipient behavior.

Is Ethereum ETF threat real? Analyst predicts ETH will flip BTC - AMBCrypto



More analysts are sounding alarms on ETH ETF threat to BTC
However, BlackRock claims its clients are heavy on BTC and less on ETH. 

Ethereum’s [ETH] potential threat to Bitcoin [BTC] seems inevitable, according to some key industry analysts.  One of the analysts, Jim Bianco, underscored that Ethereum’s recent regulatory relief and imminent ETF could tip ETH to flip BTC before the next halving. 
“A truly great week of ETH. BTC is not dead but will now have to surf in the wake of ETH’s coming regulatory freedom. Flippening before the next halving?’ 
Bianco’s comment resonates with recent Peter Schiff’s take on ETH ETF’s risk to BTC. 
Bianco’s reasons for bold ETH flipping BTC projection
Per Bianco, Ethereum’s fully fledged ecosystem from lending to staking meant that there were many avenues TradFi could benefit from the platform, unlike BTC. 
“Wall Street gets this. It is an entire ecosystem with borrowing, lending, insurance, tokenomics, staking (yield), stablecoins, NFTS, primitives, L2s, and on and on. Plenty for them to work with here as opposed to hodl-ing one coin.’ 
Bitcoin’s L2 ecosystem is not fully fledged but is moving on the same path through players like Stacks [STX]. However, Bianco claimed that ETF could work against BTC L2 and stated, 
“My other concern is that the ETF will remove incentives for development, as it is easier to HODL in a regulated brokerage account than on-chain. I don’t worry about this as much with ETH.’ 
Most TradFi titans have reiterated a bullish case for Ethereum. Interestingly, even JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, a Bitcoin critic, reportedly believes Ethereum could have some use cases. 
However, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and parent firm of the most successful BTC ETF, thinks otherwise. 
In a recent podcast with Bloomberg, Blackrock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, mentioned that their clients are ‘overwhelmingly into Bitcoin and a little bit of Ethereum.’ 
Interestingly, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, also projected that ETH ETFs could grab some inflows from spot BTC ETFs. 
It remains to be seen how the ETH ETF development will play out and whether these analysts’ claims are true or merely speculation.

We asked ChatGPT-4o what will be SOL price if a Solana ETF is approved: Here’s what is said


    The approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs in May brought forth a new chapter for cryptocurrency adoption as it helped ease exposure to the crypto market for many more traditional investors.



The moves also generated a new debate – which cryptocurrency will see its proposed spot ETFs approved next, with the most frequent answer seemingly being Solana (SOL).



There is a mix of arguments with regard to a SOL ETF with it, on the one hand, likely to generate the most interest once BTC and ETH are excluded. On the other, the fact that the SEC already indicated Solana to be a security in its filings against the crypto exchanges Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Kraken could prove a major hurdle.







Nonetheless, with the excitement about the two rounds of spot crypto ETF approvals within months after many years of waiting, Finbold decided to ask if the most advanced model of OpenAI’s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) platform – ChatGPT-4o – agrees that Solana is next, and what impact might an approval have on the price of SOL.



ChatGPT identifies the most likely next crypto ETF



Rather than immediately pinpointing Solana as the most likely cryptocurrency to have an ETF approved, ChatGPT identified the five most likely candidates: Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), and, indeed, SOL.

Nonetheless, when asked which of the five is the most likely, the AI conceded that it is Solana, given that it benefits from its size, high throughput and low costs, integrations, and widespread interest.



ChatGPT explains why Solana ETF is the most likely to be the next one. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT



ChatGPT estimates impact of ETF approvals on Solana price



Though the timing of approval of SOL ETFs is, at the time of publication, completely unknown, unknowable even, ChatGPT agreed to estimate the likely price movements caused by such an event.



Using both its knowledge about Solana and its own unique circumstances, but also the precedents set by ETH and BTC ETFs, ChatGPT estimated that SOL would rise to a range between $180 and $200 in the immediate aftermath of an approval but then rocket to between $250 and $300 in the subsequent months.



ChatGPT provides its price target for SOL should and ETF be approved. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT



Still, it is worth noting that such an estimated price target is intrinsically linked to Solana’s price today – $165.56 – and its recent performance, it would perhaps be more useful to express the likely price movements in percentages.

Indeed, under the assumption that a SOL ETF approval would come in a bull market as it did for BTC and ETH – a likely scenario given SEC’s tendency to be quiet or dovish during a rally and hostile during a downturn – ChatGPT’s estimate indicates a movement between 8.72% and 20.80% in the immediate aftermaths, and between 51% and 81.20% over the course of several months.

Costco Hot Dogs Still Cost $1.50-This Man Is Eating Them Daily Until a Meme Coin Hits the Same Price - Decrypt

A hot dog a day may not keep the doctor away. But can it help fuel excitement around a meme coin?Inspired by Costco’s flagship hot dog—and its decades-long price tag of $1.50 (plus drink)—a crop of crypto traders have found themselves engaged with Costco Hot Dog (COST). The Solana-based meme coin is an unofficial riff on the wholesale retail giant’s product, yet many holders are fans of the menu item and its dependable, inflation-flouting price point.That includes the crypto trader Joe, 28, who declined to provide his last name. On Twitter (aka X), he has committed to eating a Costco hot dog every day until the meme coin achieves “price parity” with the savory good, which some in crypto view as a perishable store of value.“That's pretty funny,” Joe recalled thinking in an interview with Decrypt, inspired by the dog’s unbudging price when he came across the token weeks ago. “So, then I was like: Well, I guess I have to prove it to everyone that it's still $1.50, so I'll just start eating one every single day.”Now 46 days into his commitment, the trader has emerged as Costco Hot Dog’s de facto mascot, garnering a mention on the token’s website to “SAVE JOE.” Linked to the project’s Twitter page itself, a disclaimer states there that the project is “not affiliated with Costco Wholesale.”Much like Solana-based meme coins for Gamestop and AMC that rose—and quickly fell—last week amid Roaring Kitty’s apparent online return, the token plays on an existing, valuable brand. But according to Joe, the meme coin’s community has just as much to do with staying ahead of inflation—he said his hotdog habit has indeed saved him some dough.But at what $COST?Joe said he started eating hot dogs the same day he discovered the meme coin, but initially, his gesture was supposed to be a one-off joke. Encouraged by the engagement his online endeavors received, however, he grew comfortable quickly with eating hot dogs for the foreseeable future.“Everyone’s really concerned with my health, but it’s really not that bad,” he said. “I used to eat the same meal for 15 years straight, anyways, which was a ham sandwich.”Costco says its Kirkland-brand dogs are made with 100% USDA-inspected beef. Still, studies have shown that the high consumption of red meat can lead to chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, per the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.Costco did not respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.Joe said that crypto trading has become a full-time job for him since getting into it in 2017. And witnessing the popularity of meme coins over the past year, he posited that it’s easier for someone who’s new to the space to make a cultural connection with a meme coin, as opposed to wrapping their brains around other tokens tied to comparatively complex projects.At this point, though, Joe said he feels the pressure when eating. He said he only owns $3,000 of the meme coin—much less than other tokens he owns that trade on little more than vibes—but it feels as if people are counting on his ability to stay consistent.With a soda included on the side since its introduction in 1984, the price of Costco’s frank has remained unwavering in the face of inflation. That’s despite a 53% rise in the average price of frankfurters from 2019 to this April, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.“Whereas other corporations continue to jack up their prices alongside inflation, they still maintain their hotdog at $1.50,” he said. “I mean, you can go in there and feed a family of five for $7.50. There's a reason Costco is so successful.”Known in the retail industry as loss leaders, Costco sells some items, including its hot dogs and rotisserie chickens, at a loss to attract customers. Perhaps meme coins are comparable as digital assets drawing users to a given ecosystem with their occasionally lucrative gains.Trading hands at $0.036, as of this writing, the Costco Hot Dog meme coin has a long way to go to achieving so-called price parity—an 4,000% increase, to be precise, according to CoinGecko.Joe said the staff at his local Costco—a 20 minute drive from where he spends most of his time—has definitely picked up on his newfound affinity. However, Joe has kept his intentions close to his chest, and part of him would like to keep it that way, he said.“I just hop on over to Costco and see my main girl, Rachel,” he said of his daily trek, referring to a Costco employee he’s established a rapport with. “I work remote, so getting out is a real plus.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Citi's Max Layton Explains What Is the Primary Driver for Gold's Current Rally | Cryptoglobe


                                
In an interview on Bloomberg TV on May 24, Max Layton, Citi’s Global Head of Commodities Research, shared some compelling insights into the future of gold prices. He projected that gold could reach $3,000 per ounce over the next 12 months, driven by several critical factors. Layton’s analysis touched upon the influence of the U.S. dollar, Federal Reserve policies, and, notably, the significant demand from China. 



Layton has a robust background in commodities research, having previously worked at Goldman Sachs as Managing Director and Head of European Commodities Research, as well as at Macquarie and the Reserve Bank of Australia. He joined Citi in 2017 and has since been integral in shaping the bank’s approach to commodities, including industrial metals and bulk commodities.



The Impact of the U.S. Dollar and Federal Reserve Policies



Max Layton began by addressing the broader context of the FX markets and the U.S. dollar. According to Layton, metals like platinum, copper, and silver show strong negative correlations with the dollar. The anticipation of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts this year is a significant driver behind this trend. Citigroup’s research suggests five Fed rate cuts this year, a stance that diverges from the current market consensus, which expects only one cut.



Layton emphasized that lower real rates by the end of this year and into early next year would underpin the next surge in gold prices. He argues that gold, in particular, stands to benefit the most from this scenario due to its historical sensitivity to changes in real interest rates. He believes the projection of gold reaching $3,000 is grounded in this anticipated shift in monetary policy.



China’s “Off the Charts” Demand for Gold







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

A substantial part of the bullish outlook for gold comes from the unprecedented demand from China. Layton described the current retail demand for gold in China as “off the charts,” noting that he has never seen such significant buying activity in his career. Chinese consumers are diverting a considerable portion of their spending from property to gold, which has dramatically absorbed the available supply.



Layton provided an estimate indicating that around 40% to 50% of the money that would have gone into property is now being funnelled into gold. This shift has led to Chinese retail demand soaking up approximately two-thirds of ex-China mine supply in recent months. Combined with central bank demand, this has left little supply for the jewellery market, further tightening the availability of gold.



Potential Risks and Investment Strategies



Despite the optimistic outlook, Layton acknowledged potential risks, particularly related to China’s import quotas. The Chinese government controls these quotas, which are not publicly disclosed. Any tightening of these quotas could reduce the inflow of gold, posing a downside risk to prices.



Layton highlighted several options when asked about the best ways to invest in gold. While he refrained from giving specific recommendations on equities or ETFs due to regulatory constraints, he pointed to the different ways investors can access gold. These include physical gold, commodities markets, and liquid ETFs available in the U.S. markets.

How UXLINK Is Transforming Social Networks With Blockchain Technology

Editorial Note: The following content does not reflect the views or opinions of BeInCrypto. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions. 
With the emergence of web2, social products have been at the forefront of the internet, allowing users to create and engage with content, giving them the power to have their voices heard by millions. However, this came at a serious cost as the user data got into the hands of a few powerful organizations. 
SocialFi or Social Finance is here to change that by blending the power of web3 and its’ promise of decentralization, it gives users a more robust social media network where their data and privacy are secure. SocialFi gives total control to users as there is no central authority running the network since the system is run entirely by decentralized nodes. 
Among several SocialFi projects out there, UXLINK is at the forefront by leading the way in socialized web3 interactions.
What is UXLINK?
UXLINK is a leading user-driven web3 social platform that aims for the mass adoption of SocialFi. Its entire infrastructure is built on Telegram and it mainly focuses on “acquaintance social network,” giving users the power to build a real-world acquaintance social relationship map. “UXLINK strikes a delicate balance at the intersection of fundamental social principles and core Web3 concepts,” said Yinghao from SevenX Ventures.
This approach is different from UXLINK’s competitors like Friend.Tech and Farcaster, both of which are also renowned SocialFi projects. To boost user-friendliness, UXLINK features a wide range of decentralized applications, all of which are seamlessly incorporated with Telegram. 
Furthermore, UXLINK leverages Telegram’s authentic social data, allowing community mods to access multiple management service tools. With the power of UXLINK’s comprehensive suite of community tools, users can access to most diverse business scenarios that are present within the blockchain realm, ultimately enhancing their collaboration and engagement. 
Since UXLINK delivers an efficient, secure, and flexible decentralized social product that is tailored specifically for the Web3 community, it has successfully attracted over 9 million Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). This number is almost 10 times that of UXLINK’s competitors including Friend.Tech and about 30 times that of Farcaster. 
Currently, UXLINK has a user base of over 5.7 million registered users with over 1 million daily active users (DAUs) on different decentralized applications. Furthermore, UXLINK has over 300,000 on-chain daily active users (DAUs). 
UXLINKs first-season airdrop is also in progress which aims to target the top 10% of users and will surpass a scale of 550,000.

Web3 Powered Groups
UXLINK is the world’s largest social platform based on web3 groups as it has over 100,000 groups, spanning over 7 million users. UXLINK can bring high user growth by utilizing the RWS protocol and the Link to Earn trust mechanism. 
These groups can connect with numerous web3 applications through GWallet, which is the chain wallet of groups on UXLINK. By doing so, users can interact with decentralized applications as a group, which ultimately enriches the entire interaction roles of the web3 ecosystem. 
On the other hand, GGraph, which is the chain graph of groups, is a social graph that is constructed entirely based on group relationships, which helps to provide an accessible database for group-based application scenarios. 
At its core, the purpose of the groups is to act as a disruptive form of traffic organization and help users get access to trusted scenarios, timely interactions, and free customer service. 

Product Design of UXLINK
UXLINK is dedicated to leading an integrated social ecosystem that is aimed at channeling web3 traffic, social trading, and infrastructure. The Product architecture diagram of UXLINK is as follows:

The UXLINK’s product ecosystem is structured into three distinct layers:

These layers are: 
1. Application Layer 
The Application layer encompasses UX Discover and Social DEX, helping users to discover, participate, and invest in different group contexts. This layer also empowers third-party developers, giving them the power to build applications that are tailored to user needs. 
2. Protocol Layer 
The protocol layer grants users true ownership of their social connections and data. Developers have the power to leverage these protocols as they can deliver personalized user experiences that include AI-drive algorithms, recommendations, and group formations. 
3. Social Liquidity Layer
While this layer is not operational yet, however, it aims to establish a user-centric infrastructure that tokenizes social relationships and data assets. The layer will help to facilitate seamless transfer across various public chains and decentralized applications securely. 
At their core, with both the Protocol and Social Liquidity Layer, developers gain access to build robust infrastructure, which ultimately gives room to build innovation and improve user engagement. 
Trusted Network & Social Relationships
When it comes to environments that are focused on assets and financial activities, it is vital to have trust within the social networks. 
This is because trust instills a sense of security that helps to foster ongoing user engagement, which ultimately helps to cultivate an innate “confidence” within familiar networks. As a result, users develop a strong loyalty to UXLINK as time progresses. 
Another key area in which UXLINK stands out is its architecture which is ingeniously designed to harness the power of genuine socialization. Allowing UXLINK to essentially function as a sophisticated data production machine. 
UXLINK achieves this with the help of mining and migrating authentic social relationships which helps it to generate various types of data. This data ranges from basic acquaintance connections to more intricate associations including person-group, person-network, person-project, and person-asset relationships. 
UXLINK Connector
UXLINK also serves as a super-connector where it acts as a central hub between two interconnected closed loops. There are two types of closed loops including:

1. Smaller Closed Loops
UXLINK effectively links users, products, and developers through its product stack. This addresses the core needs of users and developers, and also fosters a robust user-product community. 
2. Broader Closed Loops
The broader close loop includes infrastructure, traffic, and applications. It has a three-layer structure of Layer/Chain-Protocol-Dapp/Application that is coupled with an underlying trust network. UXLINK has the power to seamlessly bridge the gap between two primary factions of Web3 that include infrastructure and applications through the help of traffic.

UXLINK Developer Team
A major part of the reason behind UXLINK’s success is its S-tier or Special-tier founder who successfully leads an S-tier team. 
Both the founder and the team have years of entrepreneurial experience in the tech industry, giving them exceptional expertise in product R&D, growth strategies, operations, and fundraising. 
The team has already managed social products that have over a hundred million users and showed their iterative capabilities when they fully embraced web3 by grasping concepts, technical frameworks, and web3 economy. Not only that, they further ventured beyond conventional exploration and successfully developed UXLINK. 
At the same time, the team has demonstrated strong execution and resource integration abilities as they delivered products quickly, established multiple partnerships, and executed multiple partnerships. All of this has helped to improve their entrepreneurial and business capabilities.
It’s no wonder because of the team and founder’s exceptional capabilities, UXLINK received funding from several crypto Venture Capitalists (VCs) including OKX Ventures and Matrixport Ventures. The cumulative financing amounted to $9 million. 
In March 2024, UXLINK announced receiving a new round of financing led by SevenX Ventures, INCE Capital, and HashKey Capital. The financing amounted to a total of $5 million and proves the growing trust VCs have in UXLINK. 

None of this would have been possible without the core principles of UXLINK which include openness, modularity, and convenience. 
UXLINK: Helping Authentic Socialization
UXLINK understands the importance of genuine social connections and experiences, therefore it aims to mirror those real-life social dynamics. 
UXLINK achieves this by emphasizing bilateral relationships that are characterized by communication, collaboration, and cooperation which are contrary to one-sided interactions that are common on social media. 
Trust is established through direct or indirect endorsements. The interpersonal connections then naturally evolve from one-on-one interactions to groups, which helps to foster multidimensional interactions and network effects. 
Furthermore, the purpose of UXLINK is to effectively address what defines a successful social product and what does not. There are two ways through which UXLINK addresses, including digitizing real-world social interactions that help to create unique online experiences. 
The other approach includes the creation of entirely new social scenarios such as matchmaking and puzzle-solving. UXLINK encompasses both these strategies, thereby being able to provide a comprehensive range of scenarios that are effectively tailored for web3. 

Future of UXLINK
It is without a doubt that social networks benefit from having a higher user base because the more users a network has, the more valuable it becomes for all parties involved. 
However, for this to happen, UXLINK has to reach a certain point which it is actively trying to do so by collaborating with top industry projects. UXLINK is also using rigorous selection methods that help it select high-quality users that will help to improve engagement. 
In the end, this will help to improve the project’s reputation and credibility among not only users but also the stakeholders, essentially proving its brand power. Considering this, it is likely that UXLINK will be worth more than $200 in the coming years. 
Final Thoughts
Overall, with the evolution of web3 and the emergence of SocialFi, UXLINK has a lot to offer to the community with its unique perspective and clever architecture that helps to import web2 traffic into web3. As UXLINK’s ecosystem uses a unique ecosystem of DeFi, NFT, and GameFi, this builds a unique and innovative social infrastructure for users. 
Since UXLINK integrated products, users, and developers all in one place, it goes to show that in the coming years, its demand will only increase by attracting a huge range of users!

Solana (SOL), XRP Could Be Possible Candidates for ETFs, Standard Chartered Says

“For other coins (eg. SOL, XRP), markets will look ahead to their eventual ETF status as well, albeit this is likely a 2025 story, not a 2024 one,” analyst Geoffrey Kendric said. “For now, bitcoin and ether dominance will rise, with selective “next in line” winners as well.”

The Great Wealth Transfer Will Be a Boon for Crypto, Says Billionaire Mike Novogratz - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz believes that the so-called great wealth transfer could give a huge boost to Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets.
In a new CNBC interview, the billionaire says that the millennials, who stand to inherit the largest transfer of wealth in history, are more inclined to invest in digital assets than their boomer parents or relatives.










“Those [younger people] love crypto. They love Bitcoin. They don’t love gold. Even meme stocks. Older people are like, ‘I can’t believe Dogecoin. What a what a waste of time.’ You talk to the 25-year-old and they see it differently. 
And so the overall space, you know having digital assets, feeling comfortable in a digital world, is just so much more enthusiastic the younger you get. And so we’re going to see the largest transfer of wealth in the history of the world, from gray hair to youth, and that’s going to be great for crypto.” 
The great wealth transfer will hand $90 trillion in assets to millennials over the next 20 years, according to the global real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank’s 2024 Wealth Report.
By 2030 millennials are expected to have five times as much wealth as they have today, according to Coldwell Banker.

This Is Why Polygon (MATIC) Price May Not See Growth Soon


The short-term future of Polygon (MATIC) price looks a little bleak in terms of a rise since most of the indicators suggest consolidation.
While on one hand investors are exhibiting growing accumulation, whales seem to be selling to offset losses.
Polygon Whales Are Skeptical

The MATIC holders are sending mixed signals regarding the direction of MATIC price. This is because, by and large, the market is noting a rise in the accumulation of the Polygon native token across the network.
This can be observed on the Chaikin Oscillator, which notes an uptick crossing above the accumulation-distribution line. The indicator measures the momentum of the accumulation and distribution to help identify potential buying and selling opportunities.

Presence of the indicator above the line suggests accumulation is heavy at the moment.

On the other hand, the whale addresses are exhibiting pessimism. Evidently, in their selling, the whales are looking to offset their losses. In the last week alone, the addresses holding between $1 million and $10 million worth of MATIC have sold about $214 million worth of their MATIC.

Since the whale addresses are one of the most influential cohorts, it would not be surprising to see the price react accordingly.
MATIC Price Prediction: Close to $0.70 Is the Future
The MATIC price is trading at $0.72 at the time of writing after failing to breach the resistance of $0.75. The altcoin has been stuck under this barrier for the past month and a half and above $0.64.

This consolidation that the Polygon native token has been stuck in will likely be the home for MATIC price for the next few days. A breakout is possible since the candlesticks are closer to the upper limit.

MATIC Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
However, a further decline towards the lower limit of $0.64 would strengthen the consolidation, making a breakout even more difficult. A drop below this line, on the other hand, would completely invalidate the bullish-neutral thesis, sending the MATIC price to $0.60.

Short squeeze alert: Bitcoin short-sellers could fuel another rally


    Bitcoin (BTC) has recently rallied to the $72,000 resistance of a 3-month price range and suddenly dropped back to $67,000. This volatility created imbalances in the derivatives market, now weighted toward Bitcoin short-sellers, possibly leading to an impending short squeeze.



Notably, since late February, Bitcoin has kept the $12,000 price range from $60,000 to $72,000. In the meantime, two deviations from the range marked a rally to $73,805 for a new all-time high and a sudden crash to $56,537.



On May 21, the leading cryptocurrency precisely reached $72,000 again, and Bitcoin short-sellers jumped in betting in the pattern. As developed, BTC indeed respected the 3-month range and currently lost 6.4% from this level, trading at $67,315.

Short squeeze target over Bitcoin short-sellers positions



However, such activity could make the short-sellers a target, as Bitcoin’s future contracts and leverage trading accumulate liquidations upwards. Should these liquidity pools become a target, BTC could face a short squeeze in the coming days.



Finbold gathered data from CoinGlass on May 24 to gain insights into the current state of the derivatives market.



In particular, over $1.2 billion of liquidations have accumulated in the $72,000 range resistance. Market makers and professional traders could see this as an opportunity to encounter fuel for a possible range breakout.



BTC Liquidation Heatmap, 1 week. Source: CoinGlass



This is because of the threat of a short squeeze, which would liquidate these short-seller’s positions and create artificial demand, pumping Bitcoin’s price above its current all-time high.



On the other hand, cryptocurrency traders constantly reevaluate their positions as the market changes. Therefore, if traders close their short positions, this reported liquidity pool could no longer exist in the following days.



Bitcoin whale activity



As a validation of a possible short squeeze, Ali Martinez reported an increased Bitcoin whale activity with a bullish bias. According to Martinez, these whales bought the dip to $67,000 for 20,000 BTC purchased, worth $1.34 billion.







The positive sentiment could propel Bitcoin short-sellers future liquidation as the spot market could face a supply shock. Nevertheless, investors should remain cautious and avoid overexposure to cryptocurrencies, considering their inherent risks and volatility.

With Ethereum ETFs Approved, Why Is ETH Not Going Up? - Benzinga

Ethereum ETH/USD enthusiasts were left scratching their heads this week after the long-awaited approval of a spot Ethereum ETF failed to ignite the anticipated price surge. What Happened: While many expected a repeat of Bitcoin‘s BTC/USD rise following similar ETF approval in January, ETH prices have remained relatively flat.The SEC’s approval of the 19b-4 forms is a crucial step in the regulatory process but does not fully clear the path for ETF trading. The S-1 registration statements, which provide detailed information about the ETFs to the SEC, must still be approved for trading to commence. This approval is often seen as a formality, but the current political climate has added uncertainty.However, new information suggests the approval process might not be as straightforward as initially believed.Gabriel Shapiro, co-founder of MetaLeX Labs, explains that only the 19b-4 forms were approved, not the S-1 registration statements.This limited approval was made by the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets under “delegated authority,” allowing any commissioner to challenge the decision within ten days. Shapiro suggests this procedural move indicates an attempt to obscure the political nature of the vote.Shapiro hints at a broader political strategy, suggesting the SEC’s actions are part of a “horse trade” to secure environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rules before a potential challenge by Donald Trump if he wins the 2024 election. This complex backdrop contributes to the uncertainty surrounding the approval of the S-1 forms, which Shapiro believes are unlikely to be approved soon. He describes the situation as “political progress” for crypto, similar to the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) Act.Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: All You Need To Know About The FIT21 ‘Crypto Bill’Market ReactionsEric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, offers a counterpoint, expressing confidence that the S-1 forms will eventually be approved and downplaying the likelihood of significant challenges. He attributes the lack of a price spike to the fact that the ETF approval was already anticipated by the market following earlier news. “S-1s will be approved, don't be silly… It prob didn't moon IMO bc approval was baked in already based on Monday's bombshell news,” Balchunas tweeted.Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital questions the SEC’s strategy, arguing that using crypto regulations as leverage for ESG rules undermines the commission’s credibility and political strategy, especially if they fail to achieve their ESG objectives. “This is tough to square…they don’t get ESG rules and also lose all credibility that they actually intend to govern reasonably in a Biden second term,” Johnsson stated.Staking and Market DynamicsPranav Kanade, Investment Partner at VanEck‘s Digital Assets Alpha Fund, highlighted another crucial factor: the nature of ETH staking in the approved ETFs. “The ETH ETFs approved on May 23rd do not currently include staking, and all of the ETH held in these ETFs will remain unstaked. However, even if this were to change (via new staked ETH ETFs), the risk of staking concentration would be largely mitigated by three factors,” Kanade explained. He pointed out that regulatory and compliance requirements would likely prevent U.S. ETF issuers from staking with dominant players like Lido. Additionally, emerging staking protocols are already reducing Lido’s market share, and Lido itself is diversifying its node operators, minimizing concentration risks.Looking ForwardThese developments highlight the intricate interplay between regulatory actions and political considerations affecting Ethereum’s market dynamics. Investors remain cautious as they await further clarity on the full approval process.For a deeper dive into the implications of these regulatory shifts and the future of digital assets, industry leaders and investors can join Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. This event will provide valuable insights into the evolving regulatory landscape and investment strategies within the digital asset space.Read Next: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $108M Inflows While Ethereum ETF Potential Remains UncertainImage: Shutterstock

Workday Stock Plunges as Guidance Dampens Investor Sentiment - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY), a leader in enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources, recently announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The company reported total revenues of $1.990 billion, a substantial increase of 18.1% compared to the same period last year. Subscription revenues, which comprise a significant portion of the total, rose by 18.8% to $1.815 billion.



Workday Announced Robust Financial Results for Q1 FY 2025



Workday’s operating income for the quarter was $64 million, or 3.2% of revenues, a notable improvement from the operating loss of $20 million, or negative 1.2% of revenues, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP operating income also saw a significant increase, reaching $515 million, or 25.9% of revenues, compared to $396 million, or 23.5% of revenues, in the same period last year. The company’s diluted net income per share was $0.40, a significant improvement from $0.00 in the previous year, while non-GAAP diluted net income per share rose to $1.74 from $1.33.



The company’s financial performance was in line with its expectations across key metrics, despite elevated sales scrutiny and lower customer headcount growth. Workday successfully increased its non-GAAP operating margin through efficiencies across the organization. The company also repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of Class A common stock for $134 million and reported cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $7.18 billion as of April 30, 2024.





However, Subscription Revenue Guidance Impacts Stock Price



Despite the strong financial results, Workday shares fell more than 11% today following the announced softer-than-expected current-quarter and full-year subscription revenue guidance. The company projected current quarter subscription revenue of $1.895 billion, falling short of estimates of $1.903 billion. For the full fiscal year 2025, Workday reduced its subscription revenue guidance to between $7.7 billion and $7.725 billion, down from the prior range of $7.725 billion to $7.775 billion. However, the company did increase its annual adjusted operating margin by half a percentage point to 25%.



Workday’s net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $1.99 billion, slightly ahead of the $1.97 billion consensus, while adjusted profit reached $1.74 per share, surpassing expectations of $1.58 per share. The company’s market cap stood at $69.21 billion as of May 23, 2024, with a 52-week range of $s147.57 – $230.15. The stock’s volume was 5,370,000, with a PE ratio (TTM) of 50.08 and an EPS (TTM) of $5.61.



Following the cautious outlook on subscription revenue guidance, Workday shares dropped by 11.2% to $231.60 at the time of writing. Despite the recent correction of more than 20%, the stock found support around the 200-day moving average, indicating potential resilience in the face of the current investor sentiment.

Coinbase Slugs It Out With U.S. SEC in Effort to Get Key Crypto Question Answered

The request would have to be accepted by the courts, including Judge Katherine Polk Failla, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, who rejected Coinbase's request to dismiss the SEC's original case, which accused the exchange of operating illegally. Resolving this central legal question could help steer a number of other SEC enforcement clashes with the industry.

Hong Kong bans WorldCoin, but for how long?


Sam Altman’s WorldCoin and its controversial iris-scanning orbs are reportedly set to be kicked out of Hong Kong after being found to violate the city’s privacy laws by a data watchdog. But is the impending regulatory action as bad as it seems?
While the ban from Hong Kong is being celebrated by privacy advocates and Sam Altman distrusters, it may not be a permanent problem for WorldCoin. The reasons for being booted from Hong Kong by the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) include:

Relevant privacy notice and biometric data consent forms not being available in Chinese
Insufficient transparency of the personal data policy and practices
The fact that before the collection of personal data, participants weren’t clearly informed of how the data would be used

These issues all seem like they can be solved relatively simply: By translating instructions and terms of service forms into Mandarin and Cantonese, making policy practices more transparent, and informing any participants exactly how their data will be used.
However, the fact that these solutions are so obvious may point to the real problem for WorldCoin.

Read more: Worldcoin fails to shift ban from Spanish court
Never fixed
The fact that WorldCoin wasn’t already providing terms of service and instructions in Mandarin or Cantonese at its locations in Hong Kong suggests a more sinister reason for getting kicked out of Hong Kong, namely that WorldCoin has — possibly — been purposely providing the least amount of information to users and regulators as possible to take advantage of the biometric data that the public is unaware of.
There are plenty of ways that WorldCoin could work with the Hong Kong PCPD to mitigate risks and provide more transparency so it could offer their iris scanning orbs in Hong Kong again, but will it? It remains to be seen.

Ether (ETH) ETF Listing Approval Sees Billions Poured Into Restaking Protocol Ether.Fi

"I think there is question whether staking, particularly liquid staking, turns ETH into a security," Silagadze said. "I think how it is going to start is you will have ETH ETFs that are either contracted out or run their own infrastructure, those nodes will be compliant and censored and all of that stuff, but it'll have a nice baked-in yield. Restaking is much more complex, so I think it'll get there; it'll just be a matter of time."

TSMC is Up 56% YTD, But the Taiwan-based Firm is Still Undervalued - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) continues to occupy a peculiar status in the investing world. On the face of it, the Taiwanese company has the most advanced chip-making foundries in the world. Its cutting-edge N3 node (3 nm) deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) process is poised to chart new efficiency and performance standards.



By 2030, TSMC’s 1 nm process is the major milestone on the roadmap, which will pack over a trillion transistors with 3D-stacked chipsets. Although Samsung and Intel are close behind, Chinese chip makers are not there yet. 



Pushed by government subsidies, Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Huawei are heading to manufacture 5 nm chips in Shanghai, lagging one generation behind. The US export controls are attempting to keep it that way. At the same time, the USG’s subsidies via the CHIPS Act are pushing Intel to take Samsung’s place behind TSMC. 



Concurrently, the US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is openly antagonistic towards China, having noted in March that “we cannot allow China to have access for their military advancement to our most sophisticated technology,”



Later in the 60 Minutes interview, Raimondo admitted that TSMC is the critical cog in the technological suppression of China. 







This dynamic puts TSMC investors in an awkward position. After all, Taiwan is right next to China, opening the gates wide to uncertainty. China can perform its suppression with blockades or military drills, as they have been occurring most recently since Thursday.



And that uncertainty places TSM stock firmly in the undervaluation range. But by how much?



TSMC Price and Earnings



Year-to-date, TSM shares gained 56% in value. Although impressive and widely outperforming the broad S&P 500 (SPX) benchmark, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares gained more than double that at a 116% boost in the same period. At the present price of $158.25 per share, TSM stock is near Thursday’s all-time high of $160.64.



This was when the price began to fall just as Chinese military drills around Taiwan commenced. TSM stock is nearly double its 52-week low point of $84.02 per share. In April, TSMC delivered its earnings for Q1 2024.



Although tracking a quarterly decline of 3.8%, the company reported 12.9% YoY revenue growth to $18.87 billion. The new 3 nm wafer process accounted for 9% of total revenue. The 5 nm process, the cutting edge for China, accounted for 37% of revenue, with the last-gen 7 nm making 19% of the revenue. TSMC reported $7.17 billion net income, an 8.8% YoY improvement. For the second quarter scheduled to be released on July 18th, the company expects further growth at $19.6 – $20.4 billion revenue range.





TSMC Fundamentals Examined



Like Nvidia, TSMC has beat earnings per share estimates for the last four consecutive quarters, showcasing strong fundamentals. However, while Nvidia had an upside surprise of 12.84% in the last quarter, TSMC only had 6.98%. Greater divergence is present in other quarters as well.



Case in point, when Nvidia ended the July 2023 quarter with a 38.89% upside surprise, TSMC ended it with 6.54% for the same period. This placed Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) nearly three times above TSMC, at 87.67 vs. 30.33 P/E respectively, as the measure of how much investors are willing to pay for the company’s stock to every $1 of its annual earnings.



But given that Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are all reliant on TSMC for its mass-scale manufacturing and cutting-edge node processes, this clearly points to investor displacement of focus. In other words, Taiwan’s location remains a suppressive TSM price driver.



However, as TSMC continues to expand beyond the island into Germany, Japan, and the US, the strength of the suppression is likely to weaken.  Under the CHIPS Act alone, TSMC received $11.6 billion in loans and grants to build new foundries in Arizona. 



Is China Just Posturing?



It bears noticing that the two economies are deeply intertwined despite tense US-China relations. Although Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for a “wall of opposition” to China’s exports, China held $797.7 billion in US Treasuries, or ~10% of the US national debt, in January.



This puts China in a financially subservient position amid threats from US officials. After all, China relies on Treasuries to maintain low export prices. A trade surplus with the US would allow more USD to flow into China, which would appreciate the Chinese yuan and make Chinese exports more expensive.



China has to rely on US Treasuries to hold USD inflows without appreciating the yuan. Otherwise, China’s export-oriented economy would lose global standing due to more pricey exports. Nonetheless, this dynamic doesn’t prevent China from posturing, which has a negative effect on investors.







What Is TSM Stock Price Forecasting?



Based on forecasting data aggregated by Nasdaq, TSM still remains in the “strong buy” zone. Against the present price of $158.25 per share, the average TSM price target is $164.11. The high estimate is $188 while the low forecast is $150 per share.



Similarly, WSJ’s average price target is $162.64 per share. The high target is $182, while the low estimate is $130 per share. 



Do you think China is likely to take over its neighboring island with military force or gradually with politics?

Samson Mow Reveals Last Chance to Sell ETH, Coinbase Adds Perpetual Futures for Shiba Inu, Solana Predicted to Be Next Crypto ETF: Crypto News Digest by U.Today


Take a look at what happened in the world of crypto by reading U.Today’s top three news stories."$1 million Bitcoin" advocate Samson Mow reveals last chance to sell ETHUpon the approaching deadline for the SEC's decision on spot Ethereum ETF approval, Samson Mow, CEO at Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin maximalist, took to X to pour cold water on Ethereum-based ETFs. In Mow's opinion, the potential approval of Ethereum funds by the regulatory agency is not bullish, as they will  "massively underperform" Bitcoin-based ETFs. To prove himself right, Mow advised comparing demand for both BTC and ETH on other markets, while also taking into account the fact that Ethereum will not give staking rewards. "This is the last chance to sell ETH above 0.05 BTC," wrote the CEO at the conclusion of his X post. Meanwhile, earlier this week, VC investor Anthony Pompliano called the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC “the last dam to be broken” before the U.S. approves the entire crypto industry.Perpetual futures for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other meme coins added by CoinbaseAccording to the official X announcement from May 23, Coinbase International Exchange will add support for Shiba Inu perpetual futures on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced. Apart from SHIB, two more meme coins, BONK and FLOKI, will also get their perpetual futures listed, to the great delight of the assets' communities. As stated in the announcement, the opening of 1000BONK-PERP, 1000FLOKI-PERP and 1000SHIB-PERP markets is expected to begin on or after 9:30 a.m. UTC May 30, 2024. Other perpetual futures offered by the exchange include such assets as Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Pepe (PEPE) and so on. As a reminder, Coinbase's offshore derivatives exchange opened last May. In September, Coinbase got regulatory approval to offer its futures to users outside the U.S.Brian Kelly predicts Solana could be next crypto ETFDuring his recent appearance on CNBC, Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, shared his opinion regarding the approval of Ethereum ETFs. Even though Kelly does not know when exactly the Ethereum ETF is going to be greenlit by the SEC, he is certain that it will happen at some point in time. When asked about what crypto could be the next to get its ETF, Kelly replied, "You've got to think about Solana as probably the next one. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are probably the big three for this cycle." However, the Solana ETF approval process could be complicated by SOL token's legal status in the U.S; as a reminder, last year, the SEC named SOL a security in its lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. The Solana Foundation strongly rejected this claim, stating that the blockchain is decentralized. Additionally, Solana does not have its futures-based ETF in the U.S.

DOGE, SHIB Price Spike After Elon Musk Tweet's About Mascot Dog Kabosu's Passing

DOGE surged as much as 5% to a session high of 17.3 cents within minutes after the post, while SHIB jumped nearly 3% during the same period. However, the advances proved to be short-lived as both cryptos pared gains. Still, DOGE was up 6% and SHIB gained 1% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the mostly flat broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index.

Solana, XRP ETFs Next After Ethereum, Bitcoin Approvals: Standard Chartered - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsMore crypto ETFs are coming. That’s according to British multinational bank Standard Chartered, whose digital assets researcher said in a Friday note that Solana and XRP will soon get their own exchange-traded funds. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs. The unexpected and historic move means that traditional investors can now buy shares which track the price of the second-biggest digital asset. The move follows approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January.Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of crypto research and emerging market foreign currencies, said that it is now only a matter of time before other major digital coins receive the ETF wrapper status. “For other coins (eg. SOL, XRP) markets will look ahead to their eventual ETF status as well, albeit this is likely a 2025 story not a 2024 one,” he wrote. “Other ETH-like coins (a number of which the SEC claimed were securities in the 2023 XRP case) are also not securities,” Kendrick continued. “In several cases the core technology is so similar to ETH it would be difficult for the SEC to claim they were securities given the ETH position.”Industry observers and analysts were pessimistic about the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs this week, because the SEC had barely engaged with from asset managers hoping to drop the funds. Then, the fund managers seeking to launch the products started frantically filing amended paperwork to move the process along, amid speculation of a politically fueled change in philosophy. By Thursday afternoon, the SEC had given them the green light.The approval of the Ethereum ETFs is surprising because the regulator had cracked down—and harshly, according to some lawmakers—on the crypto industry. One high-profile lawsuit against the Wall Street watchdog even alleged that the SEC wanted to designate Ethereum as a security, and not a commodity. In 2023, Ripple, a fintech company whose founders launched XRP, scored a partial court win against the SEC when a judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors did not qualify as securities, which the SEC had alleged. Though the judge did rule that $728 million worth of contracts for institutional sales did constitute unregistered securities sales, the industry interpreted the news as positive. Under SEC chair Gary Gensler, the regulator has claimed a number of coins and tokens are securities, and are therefore breaking the law by offering sales to investors. Kendrick added in his note that by the end of the year, Ethereum should reach $8,000 per coin. The bank’s researcher previously said that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 per coin by the end of 2024. He added today that price was still realistic with the continued success of the ETFs.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Shiba Inu Partner Unveils New Frontier In Token Trading


								D3 Global, a well-known DNS domain provider and Shiba Inu’s partner, has officially launched the beta version of its D3 Marketplace. This platform introduces a novel way of trading SHIB Name Tokens.
The D3 Marketplace now allows users to buy, sell, or make offers on Name Tokens, focusing initially on Shiba Inu-themed top-level domain (TLD) names. Current supported TLDs include .shib and .core, with early glimpses suggesting a streamlined transaction process directly integrated into the Web3 ecosystem.
“D3 Marketplace Beta is Live! D3gens, the D3 Marketplace has officially launched in beta, and you can now buy, sell and make offers on Name Tokens,” announced D3 via a post on X, highlighting the immediate availability of the platform for users eager to partake in this new trading experience.
What The Shiba Inu Army Can Expect
A detailed examination of the marketplace shows it features a user-friendly search box, allowing potential buyers to check the availability of specific TLD names. Once a name is selected, it can be acquired for approximately $10 for an annual subscription, with payment options including both cryptocurrencies and traditional credit cards.

A standout feature of the marketplace is its support for payments using Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens—SHIB and BONE. This capability is enabled through Shibarium, a layer that facilitates transactions without the need for bridging these tokens to the Ethereum network, thereby simplifying the payment process.
This initiative began back in December 2023 when Shiba Inu pioneered the integration of a TLD within the global cryptocurrency market. Following this trailblazing step, other major crypto projects like Gate.io, Casper Network, Core Network, and Viction joined hands with D3 to establish their respective TLDs.
“The Shib Name can be used as a username on web3 cross-platforms, multi-chain wallet address, and infrastructure identifier, among others,” the company elaborated on the utility of the Shib Name Tokens. These tokens are designed to function as universal identifiers across the decentralized web, simplifying user interactions across various blockchain applications.

Furthermore, the Shib Name Tokens have already demonstrated strong market interest. On the first day of sales in March, thousands of names were purchased, including highly sought-after ones like ‘my*shib,’ which fetched $2,000. D3 has set the standard registration price at $10 per year, with premium features available at higher tiers.
D3 anticipates that the beta phase of the marketplace will continue for several months. This period will allow the team to identify and rectify any technical issues before proceeding to the mainnet launch, though an official launch date remains undisclosed at this time.
At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00002423.

Are Ethereum ETFs A 'Sell The News Event?' Chart Analyst Highlights ETH's Key Resistance - Benzinga

Technical chart analyst Ali Martinez examined whether the Ethereum ETH/USD ETF approval was a "sell the news" event and explores potential price paths based on recent market activities and technical indicators.What Happened: Martinez notes significant transfers of ETH to cryptocurrency exchanges after the Ethereum ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, he raises concerns about possible profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing or market speculation. Notably, Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilke transferred 10,000 ETH (worth $37.38 million) to cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.Supporting this observation, Martinez points out that over the past two weeks, more than 242,000 ETH has been moved to exchange wallets, indicating a potential for increased trading activity and price volatility.This coincides with high expectations within the industry following the ETF approval. "Although industry leaders see the Ethereum ETF approval as an approval of the entire industry… traders must be cautious," he advises, quoting industry leaders such as Anthony Pompliano.Also Read: Spot Ethereum ETF Makes BlackRock ‘Very Eager To Push’ This Trending Coin’s Narrative, Trader ClaimsWhy It Matters: The influx of Ethereum to exchanges suggests a heightened likelihood of a sell-off or increased profit-taking activity. Martinez employs the TD Sequential indicator, which reveals a sell signal on Ethereum's daily chart."The current green nine candlestick on the daily chart suggests that a spike in selling pressure could see ETH retrace," he points out, implying potential short-term downside risk.In his tweet thread, he also highlights the key area of support.He adds that Ethereum’s most important resistance barrier is between $3,940 and $4,054 where more than 1.16 million addresses had previously purchased around 574,660 ETH. He suggests, "If ETH overcomes this hurdle and prints a daily candlestick close above $4,170, the bearish outlook will be invalidated. This could result in a new upward countdown phase toward $5,000."What’s Next: The influence of Ethereum as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga’s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: An Ethereum ETF Could Return ‘Animal Spirits’ To Crypto Reminiscent Of The 10x DOGE, SHIB Runs In 2021, Predicts TraderImage: Shutterstock

Coinbase v. SEC: Latest Developments Unveiled

In its ongoing lawsuit with the SEC, Coinbase has filed a reply in support of its motion to certify an interlocutory appeal with the 2nd Circuit Court. Paul Grewal, Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer, highlighted this new development on X (formerly Twitter). According to Grewal, the company's position remains steadfast: advocating for regulatory clarity for the crypto industry and the 52 million Americans who own digital assets, while challenging the SEC’s perceived overreach beyond its congressional mandate. The crux of Coinbase’s appeal centers on whether the SEC can regulate digital asset transactions as "investment contracts" without any contractual elements involved. This issue is not unique to Coinbase; the SEC itself acknowledged the question's "industry-wide significance" and the substantial differences in opinion, when requesting similar relief in the Ripple case.From the outset, Coinbase has attempted to engage the SEC in a constructive dialogue to establish a balanced regulatory framework for crypto innovation within the U.S. However, these efforts have been met with resistance, inconsistent positions and litigation, Grewal noted in a thread of tweets. In its recent filing, Coinbase emphasizes the urgency of addressing this critical legal question through an interlocutory appeal, highlighting its importance for the future of the crypto industry. Earlier this week, the House recognized the necessity for clear regulatory rules, reinforcing Coinbase's call for clarity as well.Regardless of the timeline, Grewal stated that Coinbase was determined to pursue this matter to its conclusion, aiming to secure regulatory clarity and push back against "overzealous regulators." The company asserts that such efforts are essential for the benefit of the 52 million Americans involved in crypto.As the legal battle continues, the outcome of this current phase in the lawsuit could have profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry.

Blockchain Brawl: Algorand Claims Only They 'Deliver' For Everyday Use


								Algorand, the layer-1 blockchain network, has launched a bold and unapologetic advertising campaign taking direct aim at industry heavyweights like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.
The ad, titled “When Blockchains Meet the Real World, Only One Delivers,” paints a scathing picture of the shortcomings of these established players, portraying them as sluggish, expensive, and unreliable for everyday transactions.

Through a satirical supermarket checkout scenario, the ad dramatically showcases the frustrations consumers might face when trying to use these blockchains. From the 27-minute wait for Bitcoin transaction confirmation to the eye-watering $112 “peak hour” fees on Ethereum, and the string of failed transactions on Solana, the message is clear: Algorand is the superior choice for real-world usability.


Algorand’s Brash Tactics Raise Eyebrows
While the ad has undoubtedly garnered significant attention, with over 740,000 views, the response has been far from universally positive. Some have applauded Algorand’s audacious marketing strategy, but others have raised concerns about its tactics and the accuracy of its claims.
One particularly puzzling aspect is the timing of the ad campaign, which comes just months after Algorand shut down its AlgoExplorer, a crucial blockchain search tool, citing a lack of funding.
This inconsistency has led some to question the company’s spending priorities and whether the significant investment in the ad was the best use of resources.
Total crypto market cap currently at $2.4 trillion. Chart: TradingView
Furthermore, cryptocurrency experts have voiced doubts about the ad’s portrayal of Algorand as the undisputed champion of speed and affordability. Analysts like MartyParty have highlighted the need for a closer examination of the claims made in the ad, raising concerns about their validity.
Scaramucci’s Shifting Loyalties Add To The Controversy
Adding fuel to the fire of criticism is the involvement of Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent Algorand backer, in the ad campaign. Just a day before the ad dropped, Scaramucci expressed his anticipation for a Solana ETF, a move that left some questioning his commitment to Algorand and the overall sincerity of the ad.


This apparent shift in loyalty has sparked broader concerns about the credibility of the ad’s message and the motivations behind it. As a respected figure in the crypto community, Scaramucci’s actions have the potential to significantly impact public perception and trust in Algorand’s marketing efforts.
A High-Risk, High-Reward Strategy For Algorand
Algorand’s bold advertising gambit has undoubtedly generated a significant buzz within the crypto community. Whether it will translate into tangible benefits, such as increased adoption and a price boost for the ALGO token, remains to be seen.


The mixed reaction to the campaign highlights the ongoing debate around the role of marketing in the cryptocurrency space. While some see humor and aggression as effective tools to stand out in a crowded market, others believe such tactics can hinder broader industry growth and undermine trust.

As the dust settles, Algorand’s future success will depend on its ability to back up its claims with real-world performance and continued innovation. The crypto community will be watching closely to see if this high-risk, high-reward strategy pays off or simply becomes a case of clever marketing gone awry.

After pushing hard at the beginning of the week, it does seem that PEPE is currently running out of momentum, with its indicators pointing to an ongoing correction.Its relative strength index (purple) has fallen from 70 earlier this morning to nearly 40 as of writing, and it could continue to decline over the next day or so.Source: TradingViewPerhaps more worryingly, the coin’s 30-day average (orange) has begun dropping downwards after spending several days rising aggressively beyond the 200-day (blue), which it may now be on course to fall below.It’s certainly possible that, after reaching several new record highs over the past few days, PEPE could suffer a sustained correction lasting a week or so.Having said that, its volumes remain close to record highs at around $2.4 billion, with some whales still accumulating the token in the past 24 hours.It’s therefore entirely possible that, with demand and interest still pretty high, the PEPE price will recover soon and potentially break its record high yet again.What’s particularly bullish for the meme token and the market as a whole is that yesterday saw the SEC approve eight Ethereum ETFs.Such ETFs are likely to launch next month, at which point they’ll bring new demand and volume to Ethereum and, by extension, the wider market.This will help to increase bullishness across the board, including for PEPE, which is not only an Ethereum-based token, but has remained a vehicle of choice for whales for well over a year now.As such, we could see the Pepe price rise to $0.0000150 in the next few weeks, before reaching $0.000020 by Q4.Diversification into New Altcoins for Big Returns
There’s a risk that, because it has already hit new highs several times this week, PEPE may correct and then not do much over the next few weeks.Fortunately, there’s a range of new meme coins entering the market right now, with several holding their presales and generating considerable momentum.One of these is WienerAI (WAI), a new Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has raised more than $2.7 million in its hugely popular sale.WienerAI may have a cutesy sausage dog as its meme, yet it has been attracting attention because it will launch an eponymous AI-based trading bot.As such a both, WienerAI will answer queries from traders, recommending high-potential coins before they rally big and therefore helping investors to stay ahead of the market.Helping in this respect will be its atomic swap feature, which means that traders who receive recommendations for a particular coin from WienerAI can use the app to quickly buy it.Another strong feature is its MEV protection, which helps users to complete trades ahead of front-running bots.Taken together, this gives WAI lots of utility as a native token, with demand for the coin likely to increase in parallel with the growth of WienerAI as an app.It will have a max supply 69 billion tokens, potentially making it deflationary over time.Holders will also be able to stake token, earning themselves a passive income while they wait for WAI to make gains.VIDEOInterested investors can join the coin’s sale by going to the official WienerAI website, where 1 WAI currently costs $0.00071.The sale will end in the next few weeks, at which point WAI may surge when it lists on exchanges.Buy WAI Today

Crypto Markets Drop Following Ethereum ETF Approvals - The Defiant

Traders ‘sell the news’ after the SEC approves eight exchange-traded funds backed by spot Ether.Crypto markets traded lower after the SEC approved eight exchange-traded funds backed by spot Ether on Thursday.The much-anticipated approval, initially expected to boost the market further, turned into a "sell-the-news" event, leading to an overall market drop.ETH dropped by 4% following the approval after rallying 20% over the past week. The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, also continued its downward trend, dropping 6%, while Solana was down 5%.ETH PriceBenjamin Cowen, CEO of ITC Crypto, finds it comical that people are upset about ETH's lack of movement. “ETH is up more this week than the S&P 500 typically gives you in a year."According to crypto analyst Zach Rynes, the lack of upside momentum means that "everyone who wanted to buy the approval already did."The exchanges involved — NYSE Arca, Nasdaq, and Cboe BZX — applied for rule changes to list and trade Ether ETFs. They received approval to trade multiple Ethereum-based ETFs, including Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust, the VanEck Ethereum Trust, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Franklin Templeton's Franklin Ethereum ETF.Data from CoinGlass shows that 104,585 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours for a total of $380 million. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance in the ETH-USDC pair, valued at $12.41 million. Over $105 million in long positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours.Long liquidations occur when traders betting on price increases are forced to close their positions due to falling prices, leading to automatic sell-offs.Meme coins are mixed today, with Dogecoin and PEPE rallying 3%, while Shiba Inu, FLOKI, and Dogwifhat dropped between 1% and 3%.DOGE PriceThe DOGE price action comes as Kabosu, the dog that inspired the Dogecoin meme in 2013, has passed away. Her owner, Atsuko Sato, a 62-year-old kindergarten teacher from Sakura in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, confirmed the news in a blog post on Friday.U.S. stock markets posted gains ahead of the Memorial Day long weekend. The Dow added 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose by 0.6% and 1%, respectively.

An Investor Made $42 Million with Only 3 Altcoins! Here are his actions! - Bitcoin Sistemi

While investors who have earned millions of dollars with their investments in the cryptocurrency market have been frequently talked about lately, a new one has been added to these.
According to data from Lookonchain, one investor earned $42 million with just PEPE and two altcoins.


Accordingly, this investor increased his portfolio from 23 million dollars to 65 million dollars in one year and made a profit of 42 million dollars. More importantly, the smart investor used only three cryptocurrencies namely PEPE, ONDO and BEAM to grow his portfolio.
This investor spent 2,434 ETH ($5 million) to purchase 3.97T PEPE between November 2023 and February 2024. This investor, who sells every time the PEPE price rises, still has a significant amount of PEPE.





The investor also purchased 7.55 million ONDO ($1.9 million) from January 28 to February 6 at an average price of $0.26. He then sold 2.56 million ONDO (valued at $2 million) on March 14, April 1, and April 2 at an average price of $0.79, leaving him with 4.99 million ONDO (valued at $5.73 million). Profit was $5.8 million and return on investment was 288%.
Again, this investor purchased 139.47 million BEAM (valued at $2.59 million) on January 4 and January 5 at an average price of $0.019. It then sold 139.47 million BEAMs ($4.44 million worth) from February 16 to February 27 at an average price of $0.032. Its profit is $1.85 million and its return on investment is 72%.



“What a clever trader!
In just 1 year, his portfolio grew from $23 million to $65 million and he earned $42 million!
He earned $60 million (+1203%) on PEPE!
Earned $5.8 million (+288%) on ONDO!
It earned $1.85 million (+72%) on BEAM!”

Sell-off alert: Ripple-related account moves over 50 million XRP to exchanges


    A Ripple-related account has recently transferred over 50 million XRP to cryptocurrency exchanges, indicating a significant sell-off. 



On May 1, Ripple released 1 billion XRP from its initial distribution, with the tokens locked in monthly escrows until 2027. The company sent 200 million XRP to its treasury account and locked the remaining 800 million in new escrows.



After receiving the 150 million XRP this month, Ripple’s destination account rP4X2…sKxv3 distributed some tokens to different unlabeled accounts.







A Ripple-related address, identified as r4wf..Rzn, has dumped 56.01 million XRP on exchanges in the last 24 hours, intensifying bearish sentiments.

The transactions included nearly 30 million XRP to Bitso and 26 million XRP to Bitstamp. This added selling pressure has contributed to the current price decline of XRP. 



On-chain data, highlighted by Whale Alert, suggests concerns about the performance of XRP, which is the 7th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.



The first transaction, which occurred on May 23, moved a staggering 30 million XRP tokens to the Bitstamp crypto exchange, valued at $15.4 million at the time. 



Shortly after, the second transaction transferred exactly 25 million XRP tokens to the Mexico-based exchange Bitso, worth $11.4 million at the time. The specific exchanges involved add to speculations about the reasons behind the action.



The Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp has received significant amounts of XRP over recent months. Bitso Exchange has also seen large inflows of XRP following its partnership with Ripple.



This distribution pattern suggests that these accounts are likely to continue transferring Ripple’s XRP to several centralized exchanges for sell-off. 



Such actions could increase supply pressure on the spot market, potentially impacting XRP’s price.



XRP price analysis



Ripple’s sell-offs can significantly impact the token’s price by introducing more tokens into circulation, causing supply inflation. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has seen both gains and losses, but as of press time, it was trading at $0.5358, up 0.14% over the past day.

Despite this, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51, indicating a neutral market stance where either bulls or bears could potentially take control.



Ripple’s monthly token distribution and subsequent sales are closely watched by the cryptocurrency community, as these actions can significantly influence XRP’s market dynamics

SEC Approval Of Ethereum ETFs Is Evidence Of A 'Profound Shift' In Crypto Adoption: Report - Benzinga

The SEC’s approval of eight spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETFs on Thursday marks a significant regulatory shift, reflecting the heightened politicization of digital assets ahead of a tightly contested presidential race, according to a report.What Happened: The report, by H.C. Wainwright & Co., this policy turnaround signifies an unprecedented embrace of blockchain technology, contrasting sharply with last year’s stringent regulatory environment.This approval, part of a broader legislative push, aligns with the passage of H.R. 4763, the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) Act. Introduced by Representatives Patrick McHenry and Glenn Thompson, the FIT Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Garnering bipartisan support, the bill aims to protect consumers, streamline registration for intermediaries, and spur technological advancements through innovation hubs within the CFTC and SEC.Kevin Dede, CFA at H.C. Wainwright, notes, “The SEC’s approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs, perhaps unthinkable just two weeks ago, is further evidence of the profound shift in appreciating blockchain and digital asset efficiency, easing adoption in the U.S. financial system.”Also Read: With Ethereum ETFs Approved, Why Is ETH Not Going Up?Despite fierce opposition from notable figures like Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Administration has signaled a willingness to collaborate with Congress on crypto regulation. This collaboration marks a potential end to the anti-crypto stance that has previously stymied legislative efforts. The dissolution of this resistance paves the way for a more favorable regulatory environment for blockchain businesses.What’s Next: These developments underscore the critical role of digital assets as a political lever in the U.S. As the market navigates these regulatory shifts, industry leaders and investors can gain deeper insights at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on November 19.This event will explore the evolving regulatory landscape, investment strategies, and the future of digital assets, providing a comprehensive overview of this dynamic sector.Read Next: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $108M Inflows While Ethereum ETF Potential Remains UncertainImage: Shutterstock

This Altcoin Soared 57 Percent Today! Here's Why! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Business Insider, a multinational financial and business news website based in New York City, listed “14 Music-Tech Companies to Watch” in a recent report.
Among these 14 companies was Audius (AUDIO), a decentralized music streaming protocol.


While this news caused a big jump in the AUDIO price, the AUDIO price increased by 57% in the last 24 hours.






Commenting on Business Insider's news, Audius co-founder Forrest Browning said:

“ Think of us as a more modern form of SoundCloud with a lot of paid fan engagement layered on top.
Currently, Audius runs on a decentralized blockchain powered by Solana and Ethereum.
Additionally, Audius currently has between 5 and 6 million monthly active users. The platform's most popular genres are electronic and hip-hop.
Currently, artists do not have a venue or outlet to foster deeper relationships and deeper collaborations. Audius wants to fill this gap by giving superfans a new way to engage with their favorite artists.”

Ethereum Will Turn ‘Really Freaking Bullish’ if This Happens, Predicts Crypto Analyst - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader believes Ethereum (ETH) could go on a massive bull run if one scenario plays out in the near term.
The analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto tells his 394,900 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum could go parabolic if it holds a key support level on the hourly chart while, at the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) dips to a lower $60,000 range.










“ETH still holding this flipped resistance [in the $3,300 range] which is acting as support so doesn’t look that bad at the moment. Again with my primary scenario being a breakdown on BTC to $62,000-$63,000 now I think we probably end up falling back below ultimately but for now it looks decent… 
If by the time we get to $62,000-$63,000 on BTC and ETH is still holding this region [above $3,360], that would probably be really freaking bullish.”
Source: Credible Crypto/X
Ethereum is trading for $3,721 at time of writing, down more than 2% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $68,253 at time of writing, flat on the day.
Next up, the analyst warns Solana (SOL) may break down against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC) if the crypto king dips to as low as $62,000 and then continues upward. He says Solana could face a big corrective move as he believes market participants would rotate their capital to ride the next burst to the upside for Bitcoin.
“The scenario below is how I’m viewing things with respect to BTC and SOL at the moment. This all gets triggered/comes into play on a BTC breakdown into $62,000-$63,000. Note, it is only possible to be bearish SOL and bullish BTC simultaneously because of confluence with the SOL/BTC chart looking like a distribution top… When looking at SOL in context of this [SOL/BTC] chart, it makes sense.”
Source: Credible Crypto/X
SOL/BTC is trading for 0.00245 BTC ($167) at time of writing, down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours.

Understanding the ETH ETF Approvals | Bankless


Just last week, you would have been hard-pressed to find anyone bullish on the probability of spot ETH ETF approval, but on Monday, rumors began circulating that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had begun meaningfully communicating with proposed ETF issuers.Previously, a communication deficit between these groups had been taken as proof of imminent denial, but this new development caused Bloomberg’s ETF analysts to increase their odds of spot ETH ETF approval threefold to 75% and sent traders scrambling to long ETH!While it was projected that the SEC would release a decision on the issue around the close of US stock markets at around 4 PM EST, Ether dumped 8% when this deadline arrived devoid of news, pushing ETH HODLers underwater on the daily for over an hour before the pump finally arrived… At 5:02 PM EST, it finally arrived: news wires reported that all proposed spot ETH ETFs had received approval, resulting in an immediate (but relatively modest) 4% rally in the price of Ether!Despite hopes that spot ETH ETF approval would be a massively bullish catalyst, it appears that traders anticipating denial had already repositioned earlier in the week as markets began coming to consensus on approval, dampening the volatility surrounding the actual approval event.Furthermore, the approval notice only concerned 19b-4 rule change filings from exchanges, only one of the two required documents for to the commencement of trading, and concerningly, the 19b-4 approvals were made on “delegated authority” (i.e. staff approved) by the SEC’s Trading and Markets Division, potentially due to Commissioner Crenshaw’s absence on maternity leave.Delegated decisions can be challenged by a commissioner within 10 days, leaving some room for concern that this decision could eventually be walked back.Thankfully, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas dismissed all concerns about the seemingly flimsy nature of approval, claiming that it is inevitable the S-1s will be approved and noting that many 19b-4s are approved via delegated decisions.Without the SEC’s approval of S-1 registration filings from issuers, given that there is still a non-remote possibility for the SEC to revoke 19b-4 approvals, and considering the timeline for spot ETH ETFs to begin trading remains unclear, it may be somewhat of stretch to claim these instruments have been outright approved.Nevertheless, it is overwhelmingly obvious that the regulatory progress is occurring, and moving in the right direction.Through the approval of spot ETH ETFs, the SEC yet again confirms the non-security status of Ether, just as it did with the approval of commodity futures-based ETH ETFs last October!Ethereum originated from an initial coin offering in 2014 that if conducted today in a similar fashion would be categorized an illegal security offering; the ability for ETH to achieve non-security status in spite of a security sale demonstrates that it is possible for a crypto network to sufficiently decentralize overtime and escape the purview of the SEC, giving all crypto a pathway to spot ETFs and listings on traditional exchanges.Although many crypto market participants have already begun speculating on which asset is next in line for ETF approval, it is unlikely that any new listings will occur in the near future, as it appears the yearslong existence of regulated commodity futures on a digital asset is the prerequisite for spot ETF approval.Key to the SEC’s approval of the 19b-4s was the fact that there are many years worth of data to support a high degree of correlation between the spot and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures markets prices for ETH.This strong mathematically proven correlation enables the presence of comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between spot ETH ETF listing exchanges and the CME to satisfy the SEC’s requirements that crypto ETF have mechanisms to detect fraudulent and manipulative trades.No crypto assets besides BTC or ETH currently trades on regulated futures exchanges, and although Coinbase had previously filed for DOGE, LTC, and BCH futures in March, these contracts are not currently trading, despite Coinbase’s intended April 1 launch date.The exact qualities a digital asset must possess for CME futures listings are unknown, but the Commodity Exchange Act provides clarity that it must meet the definition of a “commodity.” Although Bitcoin and Ether are the only two digital assets that have been designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as commodities at this time, ETH’s ability to progress from something with security-like properties into a commodity through decentralization opens the possibility for for any token to go through a similar transition!via CFTCCrypto has been little more than a fleeting afterthought for many policymakers throughout the past decade, but Congress produced multiple major legislative bills centered around the industry in recent weeks, one of which aims to provide clarity on how the labels of “commodity” and “security” should be applied to digital assets, and thus whether they fall under the respective jurisdictions of the CFTC or SEC.The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century ACT (FIT21), is on its way to the Senate after receiving bipartisan support in the House this week and no threat of veto from President Biden, potentially clearing its way for implementation into law.It gives the CFTC wide sweeping regulatory purview over “decentralized digital assets,” or tokens which no one single group controls greater than a 20% economic or voting stake that exist on blockchains where no single person has unilateral control over the network (i.e.; any distributed computing network).While FIT21 provides clarity as to the types of digital assets we can expect to receive spot ETFs in the future, it concerningly “provides the CFTC with exclusive regulatory authority over cash or spot markets for digital commodities,” an unprecedented level of control for a regulator who typically only has authority over exchanges utilizing leverage in the absence of fraud and manipulation…

SOL Down 3% As FTX Bankruptcy Estate Concludes Solana Token Sales - Benzinga

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $10 billion market cap in the first half of 2024


    As the first half of 2024 draws to a close, the crypto space appears poised on the brink of a massive bull cycle. 



This ongoing bullish sentiment is particularly beneficial for several cryptocurrencies approaching significant market cap milestones, including the notable $10 billion mark.



Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies likely to surpass this threshold. These predictions hinge not only on the continuation of the bull run but also on the potential benefits of high supply inflation, which could lead to an increased market cap even if price movements remain minimal.







NEAR Protocol (NEAR)



NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is poised for significant growth, driven by its role as a leading blockchain for mainstream applications, processing millions of transactions daily. 



With a current price of $7.81 and a market cap of $8.42 billion, NEAR’s focus on democratizing AI ownership and enhancing scalability, including sharding, strengthens its market position. 



Recent months have seen NEAR’s trading activity soar, with increased demand in the open interest market signaling potential price rises.

Despite market downturns, NEAR has shown resilience, up 13% over the last month and 113% year-to-date, aligning with broader AI token trends. 



Technical indicators are bullish, with NEAR trading well above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently fluctuating between $6.71 and $8.68. 



The next resistance level is at $9.59, and breaking this could target $11.56.



NEAR’s developer-friendly, scalable environment for decentralized applications, combined with its focus on AI and big data, makes it a strong candidate for growth.



Polygon (MATIC)



Polygon (MATIC) is making waves with its user-friendly Ethereum (ETH) scaling solutions. However, the short-term outlook for Polygon’s price appears bleak, with most indicators suggesting consolidation. 



Currently priced at $0.7174 with a market cap of $7.10 billion, Polygon has seen a modest 3% increase over the past week.

Trading near a resistance level of $0.72 and maintaining support at $0.60, breaking this resistance could push Polygon towards $0.84. 



Its sought-after Layer 2 scaling solution and rising institutional interest are key growth drivers. Despite a market downturn after a strong first quarter, Polygon is poised for recovery, aiming to reclaim the $1 mark soon.



To reach a $10 billion market cap, Polygon must sustain its growth, driven by technological advancements and strategic partnerships. Its robust foundation and market appeal position it well for this target.



The first half of 2024 is set to be a crucial period for NEAR Protocol and Polygon as they edge closer to the $10 billion market cap milestone.



It’s worth noting that despite being supported by several fundamentals, the possibility of the highlighted cryptocurrencies reaching the $10 billion mark will largely depend on whether the market maintains a bullish momentum.

Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin May Sell This Altcoin! - Bitcoin Sistemi


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin today unlocked and received 845,205 STRK worth $1.07 million from Ethereum L2 network Starknet's Locked Token Grant contract.
Vitalik Buterin, one of StarkNet's first individual investors, withdrew the STRK tokens reserved and locked for him into his wallet.


According to Arkhan Intelligence data, Vitalik Buterin currently has 845,205 STRK tokens in his wallet.
While Buterin has not yet made any transactions with STRK tokens worth approximately $1 million, it is not yet known what he will do.





However, while Buterin unlocking STRK tokens and withdrawing them to his wallet increases the possibility of a sale, analysts do not expect the $1 million sale to have a serious impact on the price, given STRK's daily volume and market value.
Apart from Ethereum (ETH) and STRK, Buterin's wallet contains various altcoins such as WETH, KNC, SDOG, DEGEN.



STRK, which rose to $7 after being listed on Binance in February, but then dropped to $1, continues to be traded at $1.21 at the time of writing.

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) Will Explode 16,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Fuks Biden presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Fuks Biden has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe Fuks Biden could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Pepe Fuks Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Fuks Biden on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Fuks Biden by entering its contract address – 4D3CzRs6n4hPrHJsqon5oDVKRe8nhaiBL1mQGowzhPvg – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEFBID.

We read the 230-page investigation into FTX so you don’t have to


The examiner appointed in the FTX bankruptcy has released its report, highlighting a variety of bad behavior from the firm and its executives leading up to its collapse. The report contains allegations about how FTX paid off whistleblowers, dealt with ‘capital issues’ at its bank, and when various executives knew about the insolvency of FTX group entities.
Who knew?
The report contains allegations about which executives and firms were aware of the ‘hole’ in FTX Group’s books before the collapse. It alleges that Ryan Salame ‘assisted with the creation of the backdated payment agent agreement; made or directed other FTX Group employees to make misrepresentations to banks about the purpose of FTX Group bank accounts; misappropriated FTX Group assets to buy real estate, restaurants, and food service companies, and to make other purchases and investments, including a private jet; and withdrew millions of dollars from his FTX.com account shortly before FTX.com halted customer withdrawals.’
The debtors also identified millions of dollars of FTX Group-funded political contributions made by Salame.
Furthermore, seaman Samuel Trabucco received significant benefits shortly before bankruptcy, as ‘the FTX Group spent over $15 million for real estate, a yacht, and a marina slip for Trabucco during the preference period and found that Trabucco made substantial withdrawals from the FTX.com exchange in September 2022.’
In other communications, he was concerned about Alameda’s balance sheet, as he warned of an ‘exodus’ if employees were to understand Alameda’s net asset value without FTT.
Other executives were also investigated for this report, including ‘a former FTX Group employee who managed token investments for Alameda‘ and ‘certain sales related to those investments that were not properly documented. S&C also found that this employee made substantial withdrawals from his exchange account close to the Petition Date.’
Additionally, there was ‘a former FTX Group employee who was the subject of media reports regarding his transfer of $600,000 of FTT to a charity that he co-founded. Due to the need to prioritize other litigation and potential challenges with any claims against these individuals, the Debtors have not yet elected to proceed with actions against them.’
Additionally, the report details an already filed avoidance lawsuit against employees who made other withdrawals in the days before the collapse.
The report further concludes that FTX US wasn’t solvent at the petition date, despite Bankman-Fried’s frequent insistence. Allegedly, FTX.US’s ‘Bank Balance’ spreadsheet totaled $138.5 million and the ‘Wallet Balances’ spreadsheet — the customer balances — totaled $184.7 million.
Additionally, ‘Caroline Papadopoulos, FTX.US’s controller, pointed out that the calculation was off for another reason: it “includ[ed] [WRS] cash [which] should be considered independent of FTX US.” She characterized the ostensible reconciliation as “nonsense.“’
Interestingly, the report concludes that ‘the Examiner has seen no evidence to suggest that Sullivan &Cromwell (S&C) knew about the fraud at the FTX Group pre-petition or that S&C ignored red flags that would have required the firm to investigate statements made by the Debtors.’
The report reached this conclusion despite the fact that ‘because of the use of Signal auto-deletion features, it is likely — and 38 indeed appears to be the case — that the production of these messages is not and potentially could never be complete.’
Furthermore, despite CoinDesk reporting suggesting that Alameda Research was valuing assets at more than their entire market capitalization, five days after that report dropped, an S&C lawyer emailed Voyager to reassure it that the FTX group was ‘rock solid’ and that the current issues were ‘Binance silliness.’
The lawyer apparently claimed they hadn’t learned about the issues until the day after sending this email.

Lawyers and whistleblowers
The report describes the deep and interconnected relationship that FTX Group had with Fenwick & West (F&W), described as ‘Law Firm-1’ in the report. Allegedly, Joseph Bankman, the father of financial criminal Sam Bankman-Fried, recommended hiring F&W to help the FTX Group, and further recommended that the firm recruit both Daniel Friedberg and Can Sun. 
The report alleges that F&W ‘served as the FTX Group’s primary US outside counsel and advised the company on issues of employment, tax, lending agreements, acquisitions, regulatory matters, government investigations, compliance and risk mitigation, equity incentives, partnership agreements, trademark enforcement, intercompany services agreements, purchase agreements, and financing. 
‘Between 2018 and 2022, Law Firm-1 received more than $22 million in legal fees from the FTX Group. In 2018, while Friedberg was a partner at Law Firm-1, Joseph Bankman encouraged Bankman-Fried to employ Friedberg in a central role at Alameda.
‘Friedberg and Can Sun left Law Firm-1 to join the FTX Group, in January 2020 and August 2021, respectively. Friedberg served as both the Chief Compliance Officer for FTX.US and General Counsel of Alameda, and Sun was the General Counsel for FTX Trading. However, the relationship between Law Firm- 1 and the FTX Group went beyond Friedberg and Sun.
‘Joseph Bankman maintained unusually close personal relationships with various other Law Firm-1 lawyers, which sometimes translated into subsidizing perks for certain Law Firm-1 attorneys, such as paying for travel and admittance to sporting events.
‘This deep relationship included F&W helping with:

The FTX Group’s issuance of ‘founder loans,’ which were used to move at least $2 billion in cash and assets among FTX Group entities, as well as directly into the personal accounts of FTX Group leadership;
Friedberg’s creation of a backdated payment agent agreement between FTX Trading and Alameda;
FTX Group leadership’s efforts to obfuscate from government regulators and investors the close relationship between FTX Trading and Alameda;
FTX Group leadership’s efforts to use unconventional settlements to silence credible whistleblowers; and
FTX Group’s efforts to downplay its involvement with, and control over, the Serum Foundation.’

The exact details of that relationship are a little hard to discern precisely, in part because F&W ‘frequently used ephemeral messaging platforms such as Signal to communicate with individuals at the FTX Group and, to date, has only produced 144 individual or group chats between Law Firm-1 and FTX Group employees.
‘Only 18 of those chats still contained messages; the remainder only showed that a group message had once existed, but did not contain any content.’
The report further suggests that F&W may have been aware of issues years before the eventual collapse, with the investigation finding ‘a December 2019 communication from Bankman-Fried to members of that firm in which Bankman-Fried acknowledged that Alameda holds lots of FTT, which has a high market value but that market value could not be realized without crashing the market.’
Furthermore, the report alleges that F&W ‘created the Serum Foundation with systems that would allow certain employees of the FTX Group to continue to exercise control over the Serum Foundation and the SRM token. Quinn Emanuel also found that individuals associated with the FTX Group used [F&W] to create an entity called the Incentive Ecosystem Foundation in order to provide incentives for the SRM ecosystem and bolster SRM’s market price, while concealing that entity’s connection to the FTX Group.’
This is consistent with the previous allegation where ‘the Debtors reported that Friedberg — the former General Counsel of Alameda — commissioned the whitepaper for Maps and drafted significant portions of it in October 2020.’
Friedberg has already been the target of a lawsuit by the estate that alleges that he helped pay off whistleblowers.
Additionally, ‘Sun, in coordination with Friedberg, worked to avoid CFTC scrutiny by concealing information about entities with an interest in FTX Trading.’
The report also alleges that the FTX Group had a pattern it tended to fall into with whistleblowers: ‘FTX Group counsel did not properly investigate the substance of these whistleblower complaints but rather settled them for considerable amounts, and that these resolutions were principally handled by Friedberg, with the assistance of Sun, Miller, and Joseph Bankman.’
Generally, the FTX group would allegedly resolve these complaints without investigating their substance, often using large financial settlements and a ‘consistent pattern’ of hiring counsel who did not end up providing substantial legal services to the FTX group. These allegedly included:

Paying Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe $20,762 for legal services related primarily to ‘Whistleblower-5’ separation from FTX.
Paying Holland & Knight $64,998 in fees related primarily to drafting a settlement agreement with a whistleblower.
Paying Silver Miller Law $760,000 in fees related to providing advice on regulatory matters and a whistleblower allegation.
Loaning Pavel Pogodin $1 million as part of a settlement related to dropping whistleblower complaints. Following this, he allegedly entered into two engagements with FTX, for a total of $3.3 million, and the investigation notes that it ‘found no evidence that Pogodin ever provided any legal services to the FTX Group.’
Paying ‘Law Firm-8’ $200,000 per month for five years after settling whistleblower-1’s complaint. The only work produced was apparently ‘a single, three-page memorandum prepared by a non-lawyer.’

Law firms were allegedly often instructed to skip due diligence on investments that the FTX group intended to make. Sometimes, like in the case of the law firm that aided in the acquisition of HiveEx in Australia, the firms were actually able to make ‘finder’s fees’ from helping FTX find the targets of these investments or otherwise help FTX.
In that case, ‘eventually, Law Firm-5’s role grew to include negotiating settlements to avoid negative publicity for the FTX Group. For example, in July 2021, Law Firm-5 arranged for the incorporation of a Cayman Islands company, 707,016 Ltd., to pay off the creditors of Alex Saunders, an Australian crypto-influencer. Saunders was alleged to have used borrowed funds to trade on FTX.com, but lost the funds that he traded.
‘To mitigate any reputational harm and avoid potential litigation, FTX Trading loaned Saunders $13.2 million through 707,016 Ltd. to enable Saunders to pay off his debts. Saunders has not repaid this loan. A partner at Law Firm-5, who was the FTX Group’s primary contact at the firm, personally received at least $727,402 in “finder’s fees” for certain acquisitions that he suggested.’

Another law firm was retained ‘in connection with responses to SEC and CFTC document requests related to the entities’ relationship with Tether/Bitfinex.’ Unfortunately, perhaps due to the use of Signal, some of the documents from that engagement that relate to market manipulation cannot be located. 
Some firms did raise issues with FTX leadership about conduct, with Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom supposedly repeatedly warning about ‘undisclosed political contributions by FTX.US.’
Banks
FTX struggled to maintain consistent and open access to banking, relying on a pattern of misrepresentations to maintain its access. These included failing to ‘properly designate all FBO accounts.’ Furthermore, they often commingled customer and corporate funds in the accounts. 
Salame allegedly intervened to help Deltec Bank and Trust with ‘capital issues’ by issuing ‘two $50 million loans involving Salame, Alameda, and two other companies, Deltec International Group (Deltec) and Norton Hall Ltd. (Norton Hall). The investigation concluded that the loans were intended to ameliorate Deltec’s capital issues while ensuring that Deltec would ‘owe’ the FTX Group as a result, and the related promissory notes were structured to conceal Alameda’s role in the loans.’
FTX and Alameda Research also cooperated with Deltec when it came to Moonstone Bank. ‘Although Moonstone Bank was a small regional bank with only a few million dollars in assets, debtor entity Alameda Research Ventures invested $11.5 million in Moonstone Bank’s holding company, FBH Corporation. The discussions around the staking program did not prove fruitful, but FTX Group entity FTX Trading nonetheless deposited $50 million in a Moonstone Bank account.’

Bad investments
Alameda Research and the rest of the FTX group were poor investors, skipping diligence and throwing money into projects with massive red flags.
These included Embed, a security clearing firm that it acquired for $300 million, and when the estate tried to sell, the highest bid was only $1 million from the founder of the firm. The report alleges that FTX ‘conducted minimal due diligence.’
In another case, the FTX Group spent $376 million to acquire DAAG, despite the fact that it was not an active business and the acquisition ‘did not include the rights to key pieces of intellectual property.’ The estate found that ‘a sale would not be possible because the company had no meaningful saleable assets.’
Some investments were important for other reasons, like when ‘FTX Group acquired nearly the entire economic stake in Genesis Block, but almost all of the shares of Genesis Block were transferred to an entity controlled by Genesis Block’s co-founder and CEO.’
Genesis Block was found to be connected to the ‘Korean Friend‘ account on FTX.

Modulo Capital was another investment fund with romantic ties to Bankman-Fried that received $500 million in investment.
Genesis Digital Assets, described as Venture Investment-1 in the report, received approximately $1 billion, but members associated with Genesis Digital Assets allegedly ‘were aware of potential inaccuracies in the company’s financial statements and valuation materials provided to potential investors.
‘There was also evidence that co-founders of Venture Investment-1 had been involved in criminal conduct in Kazakhstan. And while the FTX Group’s due diligence process identified many of these issues, the FTX Group nevertheless chose to invest.’
Broadly, the report reiterates that FTX was a criminal enterprise engaged in a variety of irresponsible and inappropriate behaviors, with a swarm of executives and lawyers working extraordinarily hard to keep the FTX ship afloat.

                        Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) FTX Group allegedly paid over $25 million in hush money to seven whistleblowers prior to the doomed crypto exchange collapse in November 2022, a bombshell independent examinator’s Thursday report found.FTX Whistleblowers Agreed To Settlement Deals Prior To Collapse
Robert Cleary, the independent examiner tasked with conducting the report, discovered the now-settled claims investigating employee severance packages, as FTX did not record employee complaints.According to Cleary’s report, the investigation “ultimately identified settlement agreements totaling more than $25 million with seven whistleblowers who alleged various improprieties at the FTX Group, with most of that money going to five of those whistleblowers who raised allegations of systemic improprieties.”The report further claims that FTX Group failed to investigate whistleblowers’ claims and instead settled them for “considerable amounts,” with the resolutions primarily handled by attorney Daniel Friedberg.One whistleblower (identified as Whistleblower-4) alleged the crypto exchange “misled regulators and investors and lacked adequate corporate structure” in a letter to Bankman-Fried, Friedberg, and FTX’s head of engineering Nishad Singh.“Shortly after, Friedberg told Whistleblower-4 that he should not have written the letter and, in particular, should not have suggested that the FTX Group may not satisfy investor expectations,” the report stated. “Friedberg further suggested that Whistleblower-4 apologize to Bankman-Fried.”Ultimately, the unnamed whistleblower allegedly agreed to a $16 million settlement in September 2022, just two months before the exchange’s collapse.Another whistleblower, who served as an attorney for FTX’s sister company, Alameda Research, was allegedly terminated after he “raised concerns about regulatory and governance issues at Alameda and Alameda’s handling of customer funds without a money transmitting license.”Despite having only worked at Alameda Research for a total of less than three months, the anonymous attorney was granted a $2 million settlement.A third whistleblower was allegedly granted a similar $1.8 million settlement after only working at FTX.US for two months after they raised concerns regarding “market manipulation and insider trading.”Ryan Salame To Be Sentenced Following SBF FTX Conviction
News of the report comes ahead of former FTX executive Ryan Salame’s sentencing on Monday on criminal charges tied to his role at the crypto exchange. Salame is the first FTX executive outside of Bankman-Fried to be sentenced for his crimes.Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence for orchestrating the multi-billion dollar fraud and has been ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture.The whistleblowers’ claims only serve to highlight Bankman-Fried’s desperate attempts to cover up his crimes, to no avail, in the leadup to FTX’s collapse.

Trader 'Betting On The Death' Of Dogecoin Meme Dog Kabosu Nets $230,000 Profit - Benzinga

Following the death of Kabosu, the dog behind the Dogecoin DOGE/USD meme, a Kabosu-themed token has netted a prescient trader of $200,000.What Happened: A trader’s tweet highlighted a wallet that had been accumulating billions in KABOSU throughout the year, "betting on the dog’s death." Upon the dog’s death, the price of the meme coin price spiked, prompting the trader to dump his entire holdings for a profit of $230,000.In January 2023, Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus shared a health update, writing “Kabosu is doing better and going on walks and eating again." It was disclosed that the Shiba Inu dog was afflicted by chronic lymphoma leukemia (cancer) and acute cholangiohepatitis (an inflammation that hits the liver and biliary tracts).One meme coin trader paid his respects to Kabosu, stating that without that dog there would be no Dogecoin, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, or any meme coins. The trader also mused which Kabosu-related token would perform the best, as several versions on different blockchains have sprung up.Also Read: Elon Musk Mourns Death Of Iconic Shiba Inu That Inspired His Favorite Crypto Dogecoin: Here’s How Crypto Community Is Reacting To Kabosu’s DemiseWhy It Matters: The Kabosu story mirrors that of a Winnie Pooh-related meme coin that quickly soared, albeit for no evident reason.

Four Giant Altcoin Whales Took Action: They Purchased Huge Amounts of 2 Different Altcoins! - Bitcoin Sistemi


While fresh wallets and whales turned to Ethereum-based altcoins, which attracted attention with their rise, during and after the Spot Ethereum ETF approval process, these large purchases by whales increased speculation that the altcoin season could begin.
When looking at whales' purchases, it was seen that they were concentrated in PEPE and Ethena (ENA).


According to data from Spot on Chain and Lookonchain, which track whales' purchases, whales have increased their PEPE and ENA purchases in recent days.
Accordingly, a whale bought 1.32T PEPE worth $18.2 million from Binance in just 2 days.





It was also observed that three whales received 54.31 million ENA worth $45.6 million from CEX in the last 7 days.
PEPE price has increased by 40% in the last 7 days; ENA, on the other hand, recorded a 21% increase.

Bitcoin Battles to Hold $69,000 as Analysts Eye Potential Retracement



                    

On May 22, Bitcoin aimed to turn the $69,000 mark into a support level, causing concern among analysts as prices pulled back from local highs.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed weakening Bitcoin price action, resulting in two tests of the previous all-time highs from 2021. 




At the time of writing, Bitcoin remained above $69,000, a crucial threshold for many.



“Support at $69k needs to hold to have a chance to validate an R/S flip at the prior ATH,” stated trading resource Material Indicators on X. 



This referred to a potential resistance/support flip at $69,000. 



However, Material Indicators also warned that one of its proprietary trading tools was signaling a “clear” downtrend on daily timeframes, adding, “For me, a move above $71.5k would invalidate.”



Other analysts shared similar concerns about the increasing risk of rejection, potentially thwarting Bitcoin bulls’ efforts to overcome resistance. 



John Bollinger, creator of the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator, expressed his apprehensions, noting, “I am not fond of the two-bar reversal at the upper Bollinger Band for $btcusd. Suggests a consol or a pullback. Not bearish here, just short-term concerned.”

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, some traders, including Credible Crypto, had already predicted a broader Bitcoin price retracement. 



“Credible Crypto has been one of the most vocal advocates for a return towards $60,000 or lower, with a recent chart on X indicating likely support below the starting point of an “impulsive move.”




The week’s decision on United States spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was also pivotal for Bitcoin targets, according to Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader. 



Updating X followers, Filbfilb suggested that an ETF rejection by regulators would only reset the market to its position before the recent impulse. 



He concluded, “If ETH ETF is rejected then simply reset to where we were last week.” Conversely, a positive ETF decision could propel Bitcoin into price discovery and potentially reach $80,000.



On May 21, ETH/BTC reached its highest levels since mid-March.

Prominent cryptocurrency trader smileycapital is raising the bar for Ether ETH/USD price predictions following the long-awaited approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.What Happened: While the market awaits a definitive breakout, smileycapital outlines a bullish short-term outlook with a target of $9,000, highlighting several key factors.The trader draws comparisons with Bitcoin's BTC/USD performance following its ETF approval.From October to March, Bitcoin surged from $30,000 to $74,000, roughly a 150% increase.Applying a similar trajectory to Ethereum, he notes, could imply a target of around $7,500 from the $3,000 level observed when the first news broke.Adjusting for market conditions and speculative behaviors, he suggests a potential peak of $9,500 for ETH.Differences In Market ConditionsHowever, smileycapital points out that Ethereum’s current market conditions differ significantly from those of Bitcoin during its ETF approval period. Bitcoin benefitted from a longer speculative phase, lasting three months before the actual approval, which allowed for substantial price growth. In contrast, Ethereum’s speculative period was much shorter, leading to a 30% rally and a subsequent cooling-off phase.Also Read: SEC Approval Of Ethereum ETFs Is Evidence Of A ‘Profound Shift’ In Crypto Adoption: Report“ETH does not have the aspect of pure speculation,” smileycapital notes, emphasizing the importance of speculation in driving price movements. He also mentions the seasonal slowdown in market participation during summer, which might affect Ethereum’s short-term price dynamics.Long-Term OutlookPost-approval, Bitcoin saw aggressive inflows for approximately 2.5 months, driven by rising global liquidity and retail FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), which propelled it to new all-time highs. Smileycapital suggests a similar pattern could occur for Ethereum, especially if institutional funds and participants chase ETH following Bitcoin’s ETF success. However, he cautions about tempering expectations given the current market phase and potential seasonal impacts.Despite the cautious short-term outlook, smileycapital remains optimistic about Ethereum’s long-term prospects, targeting $12,000 to $16,000 with a ratio of 0.12 against Bitcoin.He believes the approval of Ethereum ETFs cements the asset’s role as an institutional vehicle, paving the way for significant industry ramifications and a potential bull run in Q4 2024 and the first half of 2025.Looking ForwardEthereum's path to $9,000 in the short term is influenced by a mix of speculative behaviors, market conditions and institutional inflows.As the market navigates these dynamics, investors and industry leaders can gain further insights at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Read Next: With Ethereum ETFs Approved, Why Is ETH Not Going Up?Image: Shutterstock

Ripple (XRP) Price May Suffer From Investors Declining Conviction


Although Ripple (XRP) price may not have been among the best-performing cryptocurrencies this quarter, it is still in an uptrend.
This uptrend, however, may halt for a while as the shaking conviction among XRP holders could cause a price dip.
Are Ripple Investors Skeptical?

XRP price, like any other token in the crypto market, tends to be heavily impacted by the actions of its long-term holders (LTH). Their accumulation tends to drive the price up, whereas selling causes deep drawdowns.
In the case of the Ripple native token, these long-term investors have a pattern of moving their assets monthly, which has been priced at this point. However, recently, the age consumed metric, which multiplies the total volume moved with the time since it was last moved, has shown spikes in the last few days.
These spikes, being out of the pattern, suggest that XRP LTHs are moving their holdings around during uncertain market conditions. This could be their attempt to sell their holdings to secure profits or offset losses.

Regardless, the altcoin could face a bearish impact on this development.
Furthermore, XRP holders’ total participation has also come down considerably. The total number of investors conducting a transaction on the network started declining in December 2023. 
This decline has continued to date, which is a negative sign for the cryptocurrency.

The decline in active addresses shows that participation is down, which is a bearish development for the XRP price.
XRP Price Prediction: Fall Back to Key Support

XRP price trading at $0.53, managed to secure the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level as support. This level is also known as the bear market support floor and staying above it during bearish market conditions prevents excessive drawdowns.
This level marked at $0.51 is the likely target for the altcoin. The aforementioned factors, should they initiate a decline, could bring XRP price down to this price point. Losing it would also mean losing the support of the uptrend line sending the altcoin to $0.50 or lower.

However, if the broader market cues remain in favor of gradual uptrend, XRP price could prevent a drawdown and continue rising. As a result the bearish thesis would be invalidated and the altcoin could rise to $0.56.

Dogecoin Co-Creator, Elon Musk Join Tributes To Kabosu's Death, Ascension To Heaven To Be With Harambe: 'Will Live Forever In Our Hearts' - Benzinga

The iconic Kabosu Shiba Inu dog that inspired the Doge meme and subsequent launch of Dogecoin DOGE/USD has died at the age of 18.Tributes for the dog that inspired the community to "do only good everyday" poured in on Friday.What Happened: After recovering from being "very dangerously" ill back in 2022, the beloved Shiba Inu passed away, according to a social media account affiliated with the dog.Tributes are being posted for the dog who inspired several cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD. The dog became an internet sensation thanks to an iconic picture that evolved into one of the most recognized memes globally.Elon Musk is known for sharing his love for Dogecoin on social media from time to time. Early Friday morning he responded to a post about Kabosu's death.Later in the day, Musk shared a meme from Not the Bee that featured Kabosu and Harambe, a well-known gorilla from the Cincinnati Zoo who died in 2016."OG Doge has ascended to heaven to be with his friend Harambe," Musk tweeted.Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus shared several pictures and a video of Kabosu in a tribute."Kabosu will live on forever in our hearts," Marcus tweeted.Floki Inu FLOKI/USD, which is based on Musk's Shiba Inu, showed their support Friday."Kabosu's legacy lives on in Floki! She will be missed!" the account tweeted.The Floki account also said they will "march on" and "continue the legacy" created by Kabosu.The official Dogecoin account on X took time to share a tribute Friday."The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable. She was a being who knew only happiness and limitless love. Please keep her spirit and her family in your heart, and most importantly carry her with you as your story continues," the account tweeted.Cryptocurrency Solana SOL/USD also posted a tribute to Kabosu."RIP, Kabosu. So life, much success, such fluff," the account tweeted.Own the Doge, which is the community that owns the iconic Doge meme, paid tribute on X."Today, we come together with heavy hearts to bid farewell to an internet legend, an embodiment of joy, and a symbol of kindness – Doge, the beloved Shiba Inu known as Kabosu. The Doge who touched millions of hearts is now one amongst the stars, wagging her tail looking down at the legacy she has left," the account tweeted.The X account of WeRateDogs, which previously rated Kabosu, shared a touching tribute Friday and handed out a final rating."For her lasting legacy on internet culture, the legend Kabosu receives our highest honor, a 15/10," the account tweeted.Related Link: From Dogecoin Meme To Twitter Icon: 5 Little-Known Things About The 18-Year-Old Crypto Canine SensationWhy It's Important: The tweet by Musk of the meme of Harambe with Kabosu caused a brief spike in the price of Dogecoin.The connection between Kabosu and Harambe shouldn't be a huge surprise to any who have followed Musk for years as he's a fan of both internet legends.In 2019, Musk released a surprise rap song titled "RIP Harambe," which he joked was his finest work."RIP Harambe, sipping on some Bombay, we on our way to heaven, amen, amen," the song says in autotune.Likely not a surprise to the cryptocurrency community, someone created a Harambe and Kabosu inspired coin after Musk's tweet. The coin named KabosuwifHarambe has the ticker HEAVEN built on the Solana blockchain.Benzinga also shared that a trader who accumulated billions of the coin KABOUS throughout the year may have been "betting on the dog's death." When the coin spiked Monday, the trader sold the coin for a profit of $230,000.Kabosu was rescued by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato in November 2009. Sato took pictures of the dog in a random photoshoot and shared several online.The photos eventually made their way on Reddit and the rest is history. The meme"Never in a million years would I have imagined the impact that my photoshoot of Kabosu would have on the internet," Kabosu's owner previously wrote on Instagram.Read Next: 2021 Was The Year Of Dogecoin: A Month By Month Retrospective With Top StoriesPhoto: milan2102/Shutterstock

$3,400,000 Will Be Sent To Struggling Families As 'No Strings Attached' Income Program Launches on East Coast: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A nonprofit is preparing to hand out millions of dollars over the next two years in a new guaranteed basic income program.
New York City-based homeless shelter operator Win has launched a program that aims to assist homeless families with young children, handing out monthly cash payments for two years to help them get out of shelters faster, the Gothamist reports.










Win is the largest family shelter and supportive housing provider in New York City with 450 housing units in its portfolio. The pilot program will start in its central Brooklyn shelters.
Under the program, 100 families will be selected to receive $17,000 a year, distributed in monthly cash payments via debit cards. A family must have a child younger than two years old and be eligible for shelter to qualify.
There are no strings attached to the payments and the families can use the money in any way they see fit. Researchers from Vanderbilt University will document the program’s impact for five years.
Says Christine Quinn, CEO of Win,
“That’s really kind of like the secret sauce – you’re getting this money with no strings attached, but what is attached to it is a statement of belief in you, a statement that we know you’re the quarterback of your family, and you’re going to use this to help your family… That type of commitment, that type of sincerity is rarely bestowed upon homeless mothers.”
The program comes a year after New York was found to have the largest homeless population in the US. The New York Times reported that there were over 100,000 people in shelters in NYC, partially driven by the large influx of migrants.
Earlier this year, a controversial pilot program went live handing out pre-paid credit cards to 500 migrant families.
Each recipient is getting about $350 a month to spend on food and baby supplies, which is more money than low income residents are given through the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), reports Newsweek.
Dozens of other guaranteed income programs have launched across the US, designed to test the benefits of giving direct aid to people who are struggling to make ends meet.

Here's Why Ondo Finance's ONDO Token Soared to New ATH, Defying Market Sentiment


																Ondo Finance, a platform dedicated to tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) and backed by Pantera Capital, witnessed a surge in the value of its Ondo Finance (ONDO) token.
The coin soared nearly 20%, reaching an all-time high of $1.15 on May 24, 2024. This milestone was perhaps largely driven by Coinbase’s addition of ONDO to its perpetual market.
Performance and Future Outlook
DefiLlama data shows that the ONDO token’s increase over the past 24 hours has pushed its market capitalization beyond $1.6 billion. On May 21, Ondo Finance also achieved a peak total value locked (TVL) of $453 million, its highest level ever.
IntoTheBlock data also reveals a 52.3% rise in large transaction volumes for ONDO, with all holders currently in a profitable position. The concentration of large holders is significantly high at 92%, with around 63% of investors maintaining their tokens for periods between one and twelve months.
Since mid-March, ONDO’s price fluctuated between $0.97 and $0.69 but broke out on Friday. A 10% rally ended the consolidation, pushing ONDO to an initial record high of $1.05. Now in a price discovery phase, investors expect the bullish momentum to continue driving it upward. As of this writing, ONDO is currently oscillating around the ATH price of $1.15, and its TVL is $445 million.




Catalysts and Market Sentiment
The rally came amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Even though the green light has had a controversial impact on the rest of the market, ONDO is among the top performers on a daily scale.
Since its launch earlier this year, ONDO has seen strong demand and has rallied over 1,300% from its all-time low.
Another major catalyst behind the ONDO price rally could be related to Coinbase’s addition of the asset to its perpetual market. According to the announcement, trading has started for ONDO-PERP, PYTH-PERP, and ZETA-PERP on the perpetual markets.


The exchange’s platforms, Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced are now fully operational for trading and offer various order types, such as limit, market, stop, and stop-limit orders. Initially, the ONDO-PERP, PYTH-PERP, and ZETA-PERP markets will enter post-only mode on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced.
Following the announcement, several market traders have issued bullish calls for ONDO. One emphasized that ONDO represents a potent “ETH beta” set for attention soon.
Another predicts an upcoming surge in the “real-world-asset narrative,” highlighting ONDO’s noteworthy performance, ranking closely behind leading Layer 1 platforms and meme tokens this week. Additionally, a crypto trader suggested that investing in ONDO presents a good alternative for those unable to acquire securitized tokens, calling it the next best option.

Ethereum ETF Selloff Triggers $300 Million Crypto Long Flush


								Data shows that a lot of long liquidations have piled up on exchanges after the Ethereum ETF approval, which was a sell-the-news event.
Ethereum Price Has Been Down Since Spot ETFs Gained Approval
Yesterday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally gave the green light on all eight Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were awaiting approval.
Spot ETFs are basically investment vehicles that provide a way to gain indirect exposure to ETH’s price movements without actually owning any tokens.

ETFs are available through means that traditional investors would be familiar with, so those who don’t want to bother with cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets could decide to invest in the asset through them.
The market had been anticipating this event, just like the Bitcoin spot ETF approval back in January. In BTC’s case, the inflows through the ETFs eventually fueled a rally towards a new all-time high (ATH).
When the Bitcoin ETFs had just been approved, though, the investors initially showed a selling reaction, which resulted in the cryptocurrency registering a significant drawdown.
It would appear that the Ethereum spot ETF approval has also been met with some selling so far, as coins across the sector have been in the red over the past 24 hours. Ethereum itself is down more than 5% in the window.

Despite the decline, Ethereum investors would still be holding notable profits, as the coin at its current price of $3,700 is still up over 23% in the past week.
It would appear that the approval and the subsequent selloff may have caught the market off-guard, as the derivatives side has registered some large liquidations in the last 24 hours.
$384 Million In Cryptocurrency Contracts Found Liquidation In Past Day
According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency derivatives market has observed a mass flush during the past day. The below table shows what the numbers have looked like.

As is visible, over $384 million in cryptocurrency contracts have seen forceful closure during this period. More than $297 million of these liquidations involved the long holders alone.
This means these investors betting on a bullish outcome made up 77% of the flush. This naturally lines up, as the overall price volatility in the past day has been towards the downside.

It’s also not surprising that Ethereum, which has been the focus of attention recently, contributed the largest share to this liquidation squeeze, as the heatmap below reveals.

At more than $150 million liquidations, Ethereum has managed to significantly outdo Bitcoin, which has seen contracts worth $74 million flushed down.

JPMorgan Talks About The Approved Ethereum Spot ETFs And The Future Of Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin Sistemi

JPMorgan predicts that trading of the recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs will begin much earlier than November. The company views the approval of these ETFs and the overall cryptocurrency market as increasingly political issues, especially ahead of the 2024 US presidential election.
“We expect trading of the Spot ETH ETF to begin before November,” a team of JPMorgan analysts led by Kenneth Worthington said in a report published today.


On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved forms 19b-4 of eight spot Ethereum ETF applications. These include Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Fidelity and Franklin.
All approvals were granted in a single mass order. However, these ETFs' S-1 filings are still awaiting SEC approval before trading can begin. Many analysts predict that trading will begin in the coming weeks.





The SEC's approval of ETH ETFs comes after it reconvened with stakeholders earlier this week after months of deliberations.
The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs likely occurred because issuer companies removed staking-related language from their 19b-4 forms. Staking is a contentious issue between fund issuers and the SEC. It remains unclear whether an issuer staking ETH on behalf of an ETF investor creates an investment contract and therefore a security under the Howey test.



“Discussions around staking are likely to continue, as we understand that the focus right now is whether these issuers will be able to keep such staking rewards for themselves,” JPMorgan analysts said.
The approval of the ETH ETF coincided with the US House of Representatives passing the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, also known as the FIT 21 bill. Analysts said the following on the subject:






“But the bill has less chance of passing the Senate, and the Biden administration has said it does not support the bill, but has not yet threatened a veto.”

Bitcoin is worth $69,000 - unless you’re an FTX creditor


Unfortunately, it’s not looking good for FTX customers looking to raise the tragically low bitcoin price that the bankruptcy estate will use to calculate their repayments.
Yesterday, a US bankruptcy judge denied a victim’s request to use a higher price than $16,871. Specifically, the judge denied Australian Bitcoin miner NuGenesis Ou’s request to vacate a January 31 ruling that set the USD calculation date for crypto asset pricing to November 11, 2022.
On a separate and unrelated issue, NuGenesis also complained about FTX calculating the price of its proprietary token, NuCoin, at $0 as of November 11, 2022. More relevant to most customers who simply owned bitcoin or major altcoins, however, is that the bankruptcy judge denied NuGenesis’ request to move the USD calculation date away from November 11, 2022 for any crypto asset.
NuGenesis’ attorney argued that the company didn’t receive its legally required notice of the November 11, 2022 date. However, FTX attorneys argued — and prevailed in this argument — that the bitcoin miner was fully aware of FTX’s petition to use that date. The US Bankruptcy Court judge ruled that “there was no evidence supporting the excusable neglect,” as alleged by NuGenesis.
On January 31, Delaware’s US Bankruptcy Court ruled that FTX’s bankruptcy estate may repay customers based on bitcoin’s price on November 11, 2022: $16,871. With FTX’s bankruptcy estate still holding onto customers’ bitcoin that is now worth quadruple that figure ($68,100 as of press time), it is easy to see how FTX can claim to be repaying nearly all customers ‘in full.’

Full USD but 1/4th the bitcoin to FTX customers
Ironically, while boasting that it will repay customers ‘in full’ despite only giving them roughly one-quarter of their actual bitcoin back, FTX bankruptcy lawyers and other experts have earned over $320 million in fees over the last 15 months. 
According to this bankruptcy technicality, customers will only receive the USD equivalent value of their crypto holdings plus nominal USD interest as of the November 2022 bankruptcy petition date when one bitcoin was worth just $16,871.
The math for most other crypto assets is similarly disappointing. Ether has trebled since the bankruptcy, Dogecoin has doubled, XRP is up 50%, and Solana is up 10X. Customers holding any crypto asset will only receive repayment based on its USD value on November 11, 2022.
Although the judge admitted that other victims might have the right to challenge the $16,871 bitcoin price, this particular miner has lost its request to vacate that ruling. With several months already elapsed since the bankruptcy court set that price and no meaningful challengers able to raise it, it’s looking increasingly likely that FTX’s victims will only be receiving roughly one-quarter of their bitcoin back as of today’s much higher bitcoin price.
Somewhat embarrassingly, that is ‘full’ repayment, according to this bankruptcy proceeding.

Analysts Predict ETH Price Will Shoot to at Least $6,000 Following ETF Approval - The Defiant

Breaching the previous all-time high of $4,800 is only a matter of time, analysts say.The path has cleared for Ethereum to break its previous all-time high and climb to at least $6,000 after the U.S. securities regulator approved the spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund, analysts say.Ethereum’s native token Ether already roared upward in price in the prelude to the approval. The token is up 27% in the past 14 days, now trading for $3,716, although it dropped 3% along with the rest of the market in what seems like a “sell the news” event.Michael Van de Poppe, CEO of MN Trading, said ETH is set to climb another 60% to at least $6,000 in the upcoming months.“If Ethereum runs to 0.08 BTC in the upcoming period and Bitcoin stabilizes at the current price levels or makes a slightly higher all-time high, price predictions for Ethereum could be between $5,500-6,500 per Eth,” Van de Poppe said.Institutional Investors' Inflows And after months of sluggish token appreciation–and tension regarding whether the ETF approval would be granted–Thursday’s move from the SEC is a welcome sign for Ethereum holders.Investors speculate spot ETH ETFs will drive billions of dollars of inflows from institutional investors who would rather hold an ETF, which uses traditional financial infrastructure, than hold cryptocurrency directly. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $40 billion in assets since their approval in January, according to data by The Block.QPC & Standard CharteredSingapore-based crypto investment firm QPC Capital has also touted the potential for a 60% price rally. In a Thursday Telegram broadcast, the firm said that if the Ethereum ETF were to follow Bitcoin ETF flows after it’s January approval, Ether could see a $6,000 price tag.Standard Chartered’s target is higher, predicting ETH could reach $8,000 by the end of this year and $14,000 by 2025, according to a research note published before the ETF approval, last week.“It’s unclear how much Ethereum is going to accelerate. However, a new all-time high is on the horizon after the listing has been taking place,” added Van de Poppe.Long PositionsHis views echoed those of Co-Chief Investment Officer of Transform Holdings, a digital asset firm, Wes Levitt.Levitt also told The Defiant he is also expecting a price tag likely in the $6,000 range.“The start of ETH ETFs trading (not just the rumors of it) should be enough of a catalyst to push ETH to a new all-time high,” Levitt said. “If inflows are similar to those of the BTC ETFs, which have seen enormous success among investors, then price is expected to soar.Both Van de Poppe and Levitt claimed that investors should position themselves long Ethereum for the foreseeable future. Von Poppe, in fact, unveiled that his portfolio is favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin, especially considering the former has been slower to appreciate.

Democrats Urged, But Not Forced, to Oppose Pro-Crypto Bills FIT21 and CBDC Act



                    

Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives are not mandated to vote against two upcoming pro-crypto bills, though they are strongly advised to do so.



A May 20 email from Democratic Party leaders to House members, shared by Politico, indicates the party has not insisted on a “no” vote for the Republican-led Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, known as H.R. 4763 and H.R. 5403, respectively.




Both bills are seen as favorable to the crypto industry if passed. FIT21 would clarify the classification process for cryptocurrencies as either commodities or securities, primarily placing regulatory control with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).



The U.S. crypto industry and lobbyists back this bill, with 60 companies advocating for its passage in a May 16 letter.



The CBDC act aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency.




However, the email noted that Representatives Maxine Waters and David Scott “strongly oppose” FIT21, and Waters also opposes the CBDC act. 



Politico later obtained a letter from the pair urging a vote against FIT21.



“House Democratic leaders said today they will NOT whip against House Republicans’ crypto bill, I’m told,” Politico reporter Eleanor Mueller wrote on X, referring to FIT21.



In the email, Democratic leaders expressed concerns about parts of the bill, particularly its provision for trading digital commodities in the secondary market if they were initially offered as investment contract securities under the SEC’s Howey test.

“This language undermines decades of legal precedent and case law, thereby creating uncertainty in our traditional securities market,” the email stated.



Leaders argued the bill “weakens investor protections and opens the door to fraud and market manipulation” by providing a “safe harbor” for entities to register intent, effectively shielding them from the SEC until crypto rules are finalized by both the SEC and CFTC.



Meanwhile, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC, even in pilot programs.



Democratic leaders contend that stopping CBDCs could undermine the “primacy of the U.S. dollar,” as other countries with CBDCs seek to evade sanctions.



“According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the bill’s overly broad definition of CBDC raises concerns the bill could undermine the Fed’s ability to conduct monetary policy,” the email added. “Particularly concerning as it attempts to navigate a soft landing in regard to inflation.”



Floor debate and passage of FIT21 are expected on Wednesday, May 22, according to Politico’s Mueller.

Digesting the ETH ETF decision: What it means and what comes next - Blockworks


Spot ether ETFs are not launching today — and they might not hit the market any time soon. 
But Thursday marked a win for crypto fund issuers, particularly considering how many expected the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule against such products just a week ago.
In case your internet has been down for the last 16 or so hours, the SEC approved rule changes submitted by the stock exchanges on which ether ETFs would list.  
Fund groups now with a path to approval include VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, Ark Invest, Franklin Templeton and Invesco. 
Some industry watchers also noted the apparent clarity the decision offers in terms of ether’s status as a commodity. 
The agency greenlighting the so-called 19b-4 documents is a big step toward these funds launching, but not the only one. Next up, the SEC also needs to sign off on registration statements, known as S-1s, submitted by the fund issuers. 
Some have attributed the potential delay between these two actions to the fact that the SEC’s 19b-4 approval appeared to reflect a rather sudden, politically motivated change of stance. 
Read more: Politics, amendments, staking: Making sense of the ether ETF developments 
Whereas the agency’s Division of Trading and Markets ruled on the 19b-4, its Division of Corporation Finance handles the S-1 review.
Ramped-up engagement between the SEC and fund issuers this week indicates a possible SEC about-face that could signal the Corporation Finance unit is in catch-up mode. 
Such conversations in the days leading up to the SEC’s decision deadline resulted in 19b-4 amendments on Tuesday and Wednesday clarifying that the US spot ether ETFs would not stake their holdings. 
Put simply, ether ETFs are not cleared to launch, despite what might be out there in the ether (pun intended — we try to keep it light on Friday).
But it appears just a matter of time before such products are able to trade.
The next steps and when these could launch
The S-1 approval process is set to involve comments issued by the SEC and responses from fund issuers. While the SEC has a 240-day window to consider 19b-4 proposals, there is no specific deadline associated with the S-1 review. 
A source familiar with the matter told Blockworks “it’s really hard to put odds on timing” of how it will play out, noting that the SEC’s corporation finance unit has not yet made its view clear on the ether ETF proposals. 
The SEC did not immediately return a request for comment.
Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in a Thursday X post he expects the process could take anywhere from two weeks to several months. 
“Obviously this situation is nothing like anything that’s happened historically [in my opinion],” Seyffart added.Fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas indicated he believes it could take four to six weeks before we see an SEC comment letter related to the ether ETF S-1s. 
The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance had worked with prospective spot bitcoin ETF fund issuers on their S-1s for roughly three months before clearing those in January, Seyffart explained in a Friday X Space.  
Katherine Dowling, general counsel at Bitwise Asset Management, noted in the same X Space that the SEC — when reviewing S-1s — is tasked with ensuring the proper disclosures are in place for the investing public. 
There was consistent back-and-forth between the SEC and fund issuers on the spot bitcoin ETF S-1s, which resulted in a number of amendments prior to those funds being approved. Dowling said she expects the same with the ether products.
“Even though some of that groundwork will have been accomplished already through the spot bitcoin process, there are still differences,” the Bitwise executive added. “There are a number of additional risk disclosures, polishing, et cetera that will, and should, go on.”  
While VanEck filed an amended S-1 late Thursday, it appears no other issuers have submitted one since the 19b-4 approval. 
A person familiar with the filings told Blockworks they expect amended S-1s from the other fund groups to hit late next week. The SEC’s comments on those will be telling as to how long the process could take from there, the person added.
Another question has been the order in which these funds could launch, or if the full slate of proposed spot ether ETFs would ultimately come to market at once (as the SEC allowed with spot bitcoin ETFs).
VanEck first filed for a spot ether ETF in 2021 and re-upped that bid in September around the same time as Ark Invest and 21Shares. Other fund groups later followed suit.

“The commission believes that it is appropriate to approve all of the proposals at the same time in order to foster competition by potentially providing investors with several spot ether-based ETPs from which to choose,” the SEC’s Thursday 19b-4 approval order states.
Order proves ether is a commodity?  
Some segment observers predicted that the SEC’s unclear stance on whether ETH is a security or commodity could prove a barrier to ether ETF approval.
In a 2018 speech, William Hinman — then-director of the SEC’s division of corporation finance — said “current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.”
SEC Chair Gary Gensler did not give a clear answer when asked if ETH was a security or a commodity during a House Financial Services Committee meeting in April 2023.
Read more: With ether ETF decision imminent, a timeline of how we got here
Variant Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted earlier this week that SEC approval of spot ether ETFs would likely mean the agency does not view unstaked ETH a security, calling such a scenario “a major policy move.”
While the Thursday 19b-4 order does not explicitly detail the SEC’s stance on ether’s status as a commodity or security, the products are registered as commodity-based trust shares.
“Today’s approval signals that the SEC views that ETH is a commodity and not a security — contrary to the position it continued to take prior to the events of this week,” a Consensys spokesperson said in a statement.  
Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, filed a lawsuit against the US securities regulator last month, claiming the agency seeks to regulate ETH as a security.
Despite welcoming the ether ETF 19b-4 approval, the Consensys representative pointed to the SEC’s continued “troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets.” 
“We will continue to fight for definitive regulatory clarity in our case and we are pleased to see the tremendous bipartisan Congressional effort seeking to provide clear and sensible regulation,” the spokesperson added. 
Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal also pointed to what he interpreted as regulatory clarity within the 19b-4 order.
“ETH is effectively deemed a commodity as we’ve always known it to be,” Grewal said in an X post. 
The SEC last year sued the crypto exchange — set to be a custodian for several of the planned spot ether ETFs — for allegedly engaging in unregistered securities offerings.
Coinbase noted the Thursday ether ETF 19b-4 approval in its latest request on Friday to file an interlocutory appeal.

“These approvals enshrine the SEC’s position in 2018 — ETH is not a security,” said a16z crypto general counsel Miles Jennings. “That means the SEC has formally recognized that decentralization moves tokens outside of the US securities law regime.”

'Guild of Guardians' Review: The Perfect Ethereum Game to Play While Taking a Poo - Decrypt

Games have to find you at the right time. Well, this Ethereum game found me on the toilet.My favorite gaming experiences have come when a game is enjoyable and perfectly fits into my life. Think Bloodborne finding me cooped up inside during the pandemic, or co-op gem It Takes Two when I wanted to bond with my partner.Guild of Guardians meets you in those natural breaks in your day—as you're taking a suspiciously long toilet break at work, waiting for the bus, or cooking dinner. This mobile fantasy game has enough complexity to keep you interested, yet thankfully packs a quick enough gameplay loop to easily pick up and put down.Screenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.Fight through dungeonsGuild of Guardians is a mobile trading card game on iOS and Android that draws from the rogue-lite and auto-battler genres for an addictive and convenient gameplay experience.You'll battle your way through dungeons, completing each one up to three times for maximum experience points and loot so that you can continue upgrading your squad. Every dungeon has multiple rooms full of enemies that you need to battle in order to get the final reward. Each room likewise has a range of enemies, loot boxes, and the odd neutral ground to heal or level up your gear.You start off being able to field three guardians, gradually adding more as you level up. These range from tanks to mages and support guardians, and it's critical to make sure your squad has a balanced combination of attributes. Once you’ve picked your party of guardians, you’ll carefully select your formation, ensuring to put the tanks at the front—and then click fight.Taking inspiration from auto-battlers like Riot’s Teamfight Tactics (TFT), your guardians will fight automatically for you. In Guild of Guardians, however, you choose when each one casts their ultimate ability. This strikes a great balance between being passive enough to play in the natural lulls of your day while still being engaging—and requiring at least a little attention.Screenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.As you pass through the rooms of each dungeon, you’re asked to select a rune which will give you a slight buff going forward. Sometimes you have the misfortune of picking up a “curse of fate,” which will buff your enemy and make them more powerful. This gives enough variety to each run of a dungeon, as I adjust my strategy based on my squad and the runes I’ve picked up.This whole loop doesn’t take more than a few minutes at a time, with lots of downtime to put the phone down, continue on with real life, and then return. This is why it’s perfect for those natural pauses in your day.My only complaint when it comes to the core gameplay is that “domain synergies”—and how they interact with each other—feel hidden. Even once you search it out, it doesn’t feel wholly clear or unique. It appears that having a number of characters from the same “domain” slightly buffs your team, but the buff is fairly similar for each domain… so it feels slightly redundant.In other auto-battlers, this is often the most interesting part of the game—so I’d love to see Guild of Guardians develop out some complexity here, such as synergies that grant healing, the ability to stun, or something else unique.Pimp out your partyAfter completing a few dungeons, you’ve probably collected enough resources to start really crafting a team that works for you. Guild of Guardians has a pretty extensive character leveling and gear system that takes just as much as, if not more attention than the dungeon clearing. Each guardian has its own level going up to 30, which influences their health, attack, defense, as well as what skills they have available to unlock.On top of this, you’re able to equip each character with gear such as armor, a wizard hat, or an ax to boost certain statistics. This all feels pretty intuitive, and when it’s not, the game thankfully holds your hand through it.Screenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.Until this point, I had not interacted with any crypto or NFT elements. I’d played the game every day for almost a week, progressing through the game just fine without any Web3 components. Once you sign into your Immutable Passport wallet, however, using a simple Gmail sign-in option, new benefits come your way.Most notably, you’re able to “ascend” your guardians, which gives them a 30% boost across the board. By doing this, you’re turning the guardian into an NFT on the Ethereum scaling network Immutable zkEVM, allowing you to sell them on the secondary marketplace.You can currently purchase the resources required to ascend a guardian for $6.99 for 40 Ascension Seals, but you can also earn them by topping leaderboards. How many seals are required varies depending on how popular the guardian is—but from what I saw, 31 Ascension Seals would do the job for most purple-rarity guardians. Before doing this, Guild of Guardians game director Chris Clay encouraged me during a Zoom call to level my guardians up as much as possible. Ascending your guardians should be the last step in powering up your guardian, and a way for you to lock in the value you’ve put into the game.As someone who has put countless hours (as well as a painful amount of money) into games that give nothing back, I like the idea of being able to sell my assets when I decide I don’t want to play anymore—the Web3 element of this game enables that.Guild of Guardians has a brilliantly addictive gameplay loop. You’ll dive into dungeons attempting to get all the loot at the end. Failed to make it there? Then use any loot you can find to level up your squad, craft gear, or unlock new guardians to take you to that next level.Now when I’m sitting on the throne, I’m not doom-scrolling on Twitter. I’m leveling up my guardians, fighting skeletons in the dungeons, and grinding to one day ascend my whole party in Guild of Guardians.Edited by Andrew HaywardGG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

The Unintended Consequences of FIT21’s Crypto Market Structure Bill

The bill's proposed bifurcated market for restricted and unrestricted digital assets ignores fungibility as a fundamental characteristic of crypto tokens. By creating categories of restricted and unrestricted assets, the bill disrupts this principle, leading to confusion and market fragmentation. This could impair liquidity, complicate transactions and risk management mechanisms such as derivatives, reduce the overall utility of the crypto tokens and ultimately stifle innovation in a nascent industry.

Binance Announces Upcoming Support for New DeFi Altcoin on the Megadrop Token Launch Platform - The Daily Hodl


								Crypto exchange Binance just unveiled the second digital asset that will be supported on its new token launch platform.
In April, the crypto titan launched Binance Megadrop, a platform with airdrops and Web3 quests that gives users early access to assets that are not yet listed on its exchange.










The first crypto project on the token launch platform is the native Bitcoin (BTC) restaking chain BounceBit.
In a new statement, Binance says Megadrop will now feature the asset of open-source liquidity protocol Lista (LISTA).
Lista says it enables users to earn yields on collateralized crypto assets such as BNB and stablecoins and borrow the project’s Lista USD (lisUSD), a new type of asset known as “destablecoin” that uses decentralized and liquid-staked crypto assets as collateral only.
Lista’s destablecoin is not designed to achieve absolute price stability with fiat currencies, but it’s also not supposed to be a fully volatile asset.
“The intent behind Lista DAO is to propose a solution to the capital efficiency problem of overcollateralized stablecoins experience by allowing users to leverage their funds with a collateral debt position (CDP).”
Lista says it is native to the BNB Chain ecosystem but it has plans to expand to multiple chains.

London Stock Exchange Faces Staffing Crisis Amid Plans For Crypto ETPs Debut


								As the London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) prepares to list its inaugural crypto-linked products, it faces a significant hurdle: the loss of half its four-person team responsible for “overseeing’ exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Key departures include Michael Stanley, head of exchange-traded products, and Hetal Patel, head of business development, who have played pivotal roles in the ETF team.

Crypto ETPs Gaining Ground In The UK
The timing is particularly sensitive as the LSE gears up to introduce its first exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to cryptocurrencies, marking a significant milestone in integrating crypto assets into mainstream financial markets.
As Bloomberg reported, these exits could complicate the LSE’s ongoing projects. The departures have reportedly made it challenging for the exchange to provide clear feedback on technical issues to crypto ETP issuers.
The introduction of crypto ETPs on the LSE follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) recent approval of the first set of such products in the United Kingdom. Notably, WisdomTree Inc. has received authorization to list two physically backed crypto ETPs that will track Bitcoin and Ethereum.
These ETPs, set to begin trading on May 28, represent a significant development for the UK’s financial markets, which have traditionally been cautious about crypto-related investment products.
Unlike the broader accessibility in markets like the United States and Hong Kong, these UK-listed crypto ETPs will be restricted to only “professional investors.”
This cautious approach reflects ongoing regulatory efforts that appear to balance the potential benefits of innovative investment products with the need to protect less experienced investors from potential volatility and losses.
Comparative Insights From The US And Hong Kong Markets
The global landscape for crypto ETFs shows varied investor behavior. Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States have demonstrated strong performance, with a notable trend of positive net inflows. In contrast, Hong Kong’s similar products of ETFs have seen quite the opposite performance.
Particularly, data from SoSoValue shows that US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a nine-day streak of net inflows, accumulating $107.91 million as of yesterday. This marks the longest stretch of positive inflows since a ten-day streak observed in mid-March.
Conversely, the situation in Hong Kong presents a stark contrast. The region’s spot Bitcoin ETFs have faced challenges, with the three approved funds experiencing a net outflow of 25.63 BTC on the same Thursday, according to data from SosoValue.

This outflow was entirely from a fund managed by China Asset Management. Meanwhile, the spot Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong saw no new flows after recording an inflow of 62.8 ETH on the previous Wednesday.
The combined net assets of the three spot Bitcoin ETFs were $254.74 million, and the spot ETH ETFs had net assets of $50.83 million.
These divergent trends between the US and Hong Kong highlight differing investor sentiments and market dynamics in these regions, reflecting localized responses to global cryptocurrency movements.

Trader Says Top-10 Altcoin Primed To Surge 500% ‘Eventually,’ Updates Outlook on Ethereum and Pepe - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that one top-10 altcoin will eventually see a 500% rise while updating his outlook on smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) and memecoin Pepe (PEPE).
In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,200 followers on the social media platform X that meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) will eventually hit $1.










“Jeets might be selling you today but we will send DOGE to $1 eventually, Kabosu. Thank you for your services.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Dogecoin is trading for $0.168 at time of writing, a 6.9% gain during the last 24 hours.
Moving on to the top altcoin, Sherpa says he’s still bullish toward the second-leading digital asset by market cap. The trader’s chart indicates that ETH will clear the $3,980 level within a few weeks.
 “ETH: key level tapped but still expecting this level to break within a few weeks as long as everything gets cleared. Still bullish.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Ethereum is trading for $3,728 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease during the last day.
The trader concludes his analysis by saying that he believes PEPE is a good long play as far as meme assets go and should rise relatively more than DOGE.
“If you’re looking for a big cap meme to long, I think PEPE is a good one. good liquidity, strong volume, this one definitely catches up to the others a bit in my opinion. not saying it’ll flip DOGE or anything but should go up more relatively. long in the green boxes.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
PEPE is trading for $0.000014 at time of writing, a 5% decrease during the 24 hours. On February 19th, it was valued at $0.0000011.
Earlier this week, Sherpa noted that based on buyer demand and trading volume, PEPE has the potential to outperform large-cap meme assets.

U.S. Credit Unions Adopt Tokenization of Real World Assets


                        
                            U.S. Credit Unions Adopt Tokenization of Real World Assets

                        Traditional banks may still dominate the financial industry in terms of assets held, but credit unions are becoming an increasingly popular option for Americans who qualify. Recent data shows that there are roughly 4,600 credit unions in the United States. A September 2023 report from The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) further notes that nearly 139 million Americans were members of federally insured credit unions, up 20% from five years prior.In addition, the credit union market size measured by revenue totaled $126.2 billion last year.Credit Unions Are Ripe For Tokenization of Real World Assets
John Wingate, Chief Executive of financial platform BankSocial, told Cryptonews that a credit union is a member owned bank. “Unlike for profit banks that are owned by shareholders, credit unions are owned by the members, one member, one share, one vote,” said Wingate. “Given this, the credit union ethos and the decentralized fiance (DeFi) ethos are perfectly aligned.”While this may be true, credit unions face a number of challenges that may hamper future growth.Source: mx.comKyle Hauptman, Vice Chairman of the NCUA – an independent U.S. government agency that regulates federal credit unions – told Cryptonews that credit unions buy and sell pieces of loans. “This is a clunky process called ‘loan participations,” said Hauptman. A compliance blog from the National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions explained that loan participation occurs whenever the ownership interests in a loan are divided up and sold. “Under section 701.22, federally insured credit unions (FICUs) can buy participation interests in loans under certain conditions,” the blog states. Hauptman pointed out that the current loan participation process can be complex. For example, he explained that if a credit union makes a loan and another credit union buys a 20% stake in it, it gets 20% of every loan payment. Hauptman noted that the credit union that buys participation in the loan doesn’t know if the payment has actually been made, however. Additionally, that credit union is unsure if the selling credit union will pay the required 20%. “This makes it difficult for the buying credit union to plan, and it creates unnecessary uncertainty,” said Hauptman.Tokenization Use Cases
Considering the challenge, Hauptman believes that tokenizing loans that aren’t big enough to be securitized in a bond offering may be helpful. “A smart contract would automatically pay the buying credit union their 20%,” said Hauptman. “That credit union will never have to ask ‘did they make a payment?’ or ‘when do I get my piece?.’”Ravi de Silva, Managing Partner at compliance risk management firm de Risk Partners, told Cryptonews that tokenization could also help manage compliance risk by providing greater transparency, security, and efficiency.For example, de Silva believes that tokenization would be helpful for credit unions and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) use cases.“Transaction monitoring is a key control requirement in AML, which involves analyzing customer transactional data to identify potential suspicious or fraudulent activities,” de Silva said. “Tokenization can enable efficient analysis of transactional data.”For instance, de Silva remarked that tokens can be used as a unique identifier to track transactional patterns and detect anomalies. He added that credit unions can analyze token data to detect large cash transactions, structuring or unusual transaction patterns. “AML regulations also require financial institutions, including credit unions, to perform thorough customer due diligence and maintain accurate records of their customers’ identities,” de Silva mentioned. Therefore, he believes tokenization can further help securely store and reference customer identification data. Credit Unions Adopt Tokenization
Given the benefits that tokenization can bring to credit unions, it shouldn’t be surprising that some have started implementing these solutions. According to Wingate, BankSocial is working with several credit unions for use cases such as tokenizing identity.“Credit unions are using our ‘verified product’ for interoperable use between systems and fintechs, deposits for interoperability between bank accounts, other banks, and for DeFi use cases,” he said. Wingate explained that BankSocial’s verified product tokenizes transactional data through hashing. “This is done in a quantum resistant way, on-chain, to provide immutability to records and outcomes for regulators and third party audits,” he said. “We have future cases in the pipeline for merchant payments, treasury management, and lending/borrowing.”Wingate added that Great Lakes Credit Union recently implemented BankSocial’s Real Time Payment Solution. The solution uses Hedera Hashgraph’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) to tokenize payments and deposits for peer-to-peer transactions made on the Hedera network. He added that BankSocial uses the immutable ledger on Hedera as transaction resilience for traditional financial rails.Marshall Hayner, Metallicus’s Chief Operating Officer, told Cryptonews that Metallicus is also working with credit unions on blockchain solutions. “Metallicus has built the Metal blockchain, which is a layer-zero blockchain to enable banks, credit unions, financial institutions, and fintechs to create interoperable ledgers that can communicate seamlessly,” said Hayner.A recent Forbes article noted that Metallicus is working with three credit unions, Vibrant, Meritrust Credit Union, and Fairwinds, to enable blockchain-based solutions.Credit Unions Embrace Tokenization, But Concerns Remain
While it’s notable that some credit unions have begun exploring tokenization use cases, regulatory concerns are a constant challenge.According to Hauptman, the big question that credit unions face is whether or not tokens are securities. “Credit unions worry if that participation may be deemed a security,” he said. “We at NCUA have cleared the way for tokenization use, but we can’t really assuage other concerns about the tokens themselves.”Hauptman added that KYC processes, along with which platforms custody tokens, is a concern for credit unions.“And then within the platform the concern is ‘who are the node operators?’” Hauptman pointed out. “There’s already been political questions about a node being in North Korea or Iran. No one needs an OFAC investigation for breaking sanctions.”On a positive note, Hauptman shared that credit unions are moving forward with blockchain projects that enable identification.“This is where any token is clearly not something ever ‘bought or sold,’” he said. “But tokenization for real world assets remains an issue.”Yet, all things considered, Hauptman believes that U.S. credit unions are still better off implementing tokenization use cases than U.S. banks. He believes this is because NCUA has delivered guidance that provides positive clarity around regulations for credit unions. For example, Hauptman noted that in July 2021, NCUA published a “Request for Information and Comment on Digital Assets and Related Technologies” report. Later that year, NCUA released a report called “Guidance on Relationships with Third Parties that Provide Services Related to Digital Assets.” Additionally, in May 2022, NCUA released another document called “Guidance on Federally Insured Credit Union Use of Distributed Ledger Technologies.”Credit Unions Should Work With Compliance Teams 
In addition to clear guidance, de Silva believes that the regulatory challenges of implementing tokens can be solved by demonstrating how tokenization is implemented, monitored, and audited. “Credit unions need to continuously monitor their tokenization processes and conduct regular risk assessments to identify and address any vulnerabilities or emerging threats,” he said. “This includes staying updated on the evolving regulatory landscape and making necessary adjustments to ensure compliance.”Given this, de Silva pointed out that credit unions should work closely with compliance teams to adopt industry best practices for tokenization. “It is essential to establish a robust framework that aligns tokenization practices with applicable regulations, while prioritizing the security and privacy of customer data,” he said.

4 Solid Crypto Stocks to Bet on Ahead of Next Bitcoin Rally - Benzinga

The cryptocurrency rally came to a sudden halt in April after a robust 2023 and first quarter. The first quarter saw Bitcoin BTC/USD, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, hitting an all-time high of $73,750.However, Bitcoin has since retreated sharply, with its price hovering around $68,000 on May 23. In fact, Bitcoin has fallen 15% since hitting an all-time high on Mar 14.One of the major reasons behind the decline is the recently concluded halving event, which takes place once in four years. The halving event cuts the block reward by half, aiming to limit Bitcoin's total supply to 21 million coins. As a result, the reduced rate of new Bitcoin issuance typically leads to increased demand for the cryptocurrency, which in turn tends to drive up its price.Also, Wall Street suffered in April after a first-quarter rally, as concerns grew over rising inflation. This led to the optimism surrounding rate cuts fading fast as investors feared that the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for a longer period.High interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks, and cryptocurrencies.However, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential. Year to date, Bitcoin has gained 54% after increasing 207% in 2023. The halving event has also concluded.Also, the cryptocurrency has jumped more than 50% since the launch of the first Bitcoin ETFs in early January.The minutes of the Federal Reserve's Apr-30-May 1 meeting of the FOMC revealed that several officials are in favor of hiking interest rates if the need arises, as inflation is still above its 2% target.However, recent economic data showed that inflation declined in April after increasing in the first quarter. The consumer price index increased 0.3% month over month in April, which was lower than economists' expectations of a rise of 0.4%. Year over year, CPI rose 3.4%.Also, UJS GDP grew only 1.6% in the first quarter after expanding 3.4% in the final quarter of 2023. Besides, retail sales remained flat in April after increasing 0.3% in March, while manufacturing and services activity also slowed last month.These signs of a slowing economy have raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could soon start interest rate cuts, which would help the cryptocurrency market.Our ChoicesWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024.

Bitcoin Surges Past $70,000 Amid Massive Short Liquidations and ETF Speculations



                    

Bitcoin surged past $70,000 on May 21 following intense buying activity that spiked its price upwards.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed that BTC/USD was striving to maintain its newly reclaimed position near critical psychological levels.




Bitcoin’s price spike toward $72,000 was unexpected, driven by significant buy liquidity. 



This rapid increase dealt a heavy blow to short sellers, with $85 million in BTC shorts being liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass.



Statistician Willy Woo highlighted that bullish investors were confronting overhead resistance that had persisted for over a month. 




“1 month of Bitcoin short position build up just got liquidated,” he shared with followers on X. “One more layer to go in order to short squeeze past all-time highs.”



A bold forecast even suggested that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 following a breakout on weekly timeframes.

Popular trader Skew speculated that the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might have influenced the recent price movements, anticipating “important days to come” ahead of the decision on the U.S. spot.




Meanwhile, Ether (ETH/USD) traded near $3,700, marking an 18% rise in 24 hours and a 25% increase over the week.



Trader Credible Crypto maintained a cautious outlook despite the new demand, advising followers to be conservative. 



He emphasized that Bitcoin’s price was facing “major resistance” and was likely to struggle to break through it for now. 



“No change to the plan- we are at major resistance atm with perp premium positive after a month and a half and funding the highest its been since- I clearly said these are not the conditions in which a move to the highs is conducive to the next major leg up imo,” he explained in an X discussion.



CoinGlass indicated that the thickest bid liquidity below the spot price was at $70,630 at the time of writing.

Binance Exec Hospitalized in Nigeria as $35 Million Money Laundering Case Is Delayed - Decrypt

After fainting in a courtroom earlier this week, Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan has been hospitalized in Abuja, Nigeria, where his money laundering case was adjourned, per Reuters.The largest crypto exchange’s head of financial crime compliance was denied bail earlier this month after being incarcerated in the region in late February. Spending over a month in Nigeria’s Kuje Prison, the executive reportedly appeared gaunt at trial earlier this week.Gambaryan’s lawyer said in a letter to trial judge Emeka Nwite that he is “very ill and requires comprehensive medical attention." The letter went on to say that he “broke down” and had since been given “intravenous treatment for malaria,” according to the report from Reuters.In April, Gambryan pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges after he was charged alongside British-Kenyan regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla.Anjarwalla escaped custody in March and was able to fly to Kenya, but there are signs he could face extradition.Binance CEO Richard Teng demanded the release of the two employees in a blog post earlier this month and refuted the charges from the Nigerian government. In two separate lawsuits, the Nigerian government alleges that Binance has been evading taxes and allowed its exchange to be used for money laundering.Teng also said that Gambaryan, an "innocent, mid-level employee," is being held in "a dangerous prison in order to control Binance." For his part, Gambaryan has sued the Nigerian government for violating his fundamental human rights.The two Binance executives were invited to travel to Nigeria to meet with government officials to discuss the allegations there before any lawsuits were filed. But once there, they were detained in an official’s guest house for more than a month without charges. Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Marathon Digital partners with Kenya to harness underutilized renewable energy - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Marathon Digital has partnered with Kenya to harness underused energy across the country for Bitcoin mining.
The deal will see over $80 million invested in projects aimed at boosting renewable energy utilization and optimization. 

Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital has signed a major deal with the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum of Kenya.
Sealed today, May 24, 2024, the agreement provides for partnership that will see the BTC miner harness the country’s underutilized energy for Bitcoin mining.
Marathon to tap into Kenya’s underutilized renewable energy
Marathon struck the deal during Kenya’s President William Ruto’s State Visit to the US.
According to the company, the agreement will see more than $80 million invested in “green data centers to boost renewable energy utilization and optimization in the Republic of Kenya.”
“This agreement with the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum is a pivotal moment for our business as it provides us with a clear framework to pursue opportunities across the Republic of Kenya,” Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO, said in a press release.
The company will work with the Kenyan government and other stakeholders to support initiatives aimed at optimizing energy usage across the country as well as development of key technological infrastructure, Thiel added.
Today’s agreement follows an earlier consultation between Marathon and Kenya, with this deal set to boost the country’s renewable energy sector.
MOEP and Marathon are set to “exchange policy, scientific, and technical information, as well as project investment expertise, to better understand how to optimize renewable energy projects that produce surplus energy due to intermittency and seasonal variations,” the company said in the press release.
Recent data showed that Kenya’s renewable energy sources accounted for over 80% of the country’s electricity generation. Of these renewable or clean energy sources, geothermal is the largest.
But although its estimated potential is 10,000MW, it is largely unexploited. Installed capacity was about 860MW in 2022.

Bearish Unlock | Bankless


Ethereum’s spot ETFs took a major step towards trading yesterday after listing exchanges received “delegated approval” for their 19b-4 applications. Why is the ETH price now sliding?ETF experts had initially projected that we could expect to receive a spot ETH ETF decision around 4 PM EST, but when the moment this deadline arrived devoid of any updates, the price of Ether collapsed by 8%.Price managed to steadily climb higher from these lows in the hour that followed before popping nearly 4% higher after the first announcement of spot ETH ETF approval hit the news wires at 5:02 PM EST!Many Ether bulls were disappointed with the gains exhibited post-approval, believing that market participants were so underweight their chosen asset approval would result in a ferocious pump, but the probability that many would be fading ETH in either the approval or denial scenarios had been high coming into the event.In the denial scenario – which appears to have been fortuitously avoided – the SEC would likely have been forced to unveil a justification for why Ether is a crypto asset security and could not be wrapped in a commodity spot ETF, putting practically every token save BTC under the jurisdiction of the SEC wreaking havoc on broader alt markets.Alternatively, playing out the approval scenario leads to the conversion of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF, which will enable redemptions for over $10B in assets that have been held hostage at a discount for nearly three years and inevitably leading to Ether sell pressure.Both BTC and ETH only experienced a couple percentage points of upside from SEC approval, and although it is unclear when spot ETH ETFs will begin trading or the ETHE redemptions will be enabled, market participants appear to be positioning for sell pressure from the unlocks.While the ETH/BTC ratio went on a monstrous run this week, spiking to 0.057 on spot ETF approval, it has fallen 3% on the day as market participants gravitate back towards BTC, indicating that peak Ether strength has likely been achieved until ETHE redemptions are digested.ETFs can be a bullish catalyst for crypto assets, but only if they attract net new buyers. Unfortunately for Ethereum, demand is far from guaranteed, while an overwhelming supply glut looms large.Some analysts have extrapolated the 60% gains made by BTC since the approval of its spot ETFs to suggest that Ether could similarly rise to $6k and beyond, however, it's important to note that if this historical trend is to hold, ETH will be subject to a 20% drawdown in the coming weeks, retracing the entirety of this most recent move up as sell pressure from ETHE redemptions weigh on price.via TradingView

New Development on the Fate of Terra (LUNA) and its Founder Do Kwon - Bitcoin Sistemi


Once again, the Viši Sud (Supreme Court) will decide to whom Montenegro will extradite Terra (LUNA) founder Do Kwon. This decision came after the Court of Appeal overturned the decision of his colleagues in Viši Sud, upholding his and his defenders' appeal. The case was sent back to the first instance court for retrial and decision.
The first instance decision of the Viši Sud in Podgorica found that the legal prerequisites for the extradition of South Korean citizen Kwon Do Hyeong were met. This was for criminal prosecution for multiple criminal offenses at the request of South Korea and the United States.



However, the Court of Appeal council ruled that the decision significantly violated the criminal procedure provisions.
The right to a reasoned decision, which includes clearly explaining the court's views on the legal and factual issues on which the decision is based and presenting the basic justifications, was emphasized. This right is based on the principle contained in Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which is related to the protection of the individual from arbitrary punishments, that is, the protection of the principle of the rule of law.

Bitcoin Open Interest down by $1B - What traders should know - AMBCrypto



Money flowed out of BTC contracts, suggesting that the price might fall to $65,000.
Social dominance dropped to 7.07%, indicating that attention was moving to other cryptocurrencies.

The total Bitcoin [BTC] Open Interest has lost almost $1 billion in value between the 23rd and 24th of May. AMBCrypto found out after examining the metric using Santiment’s on-chain data.
On the 23rd, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) was $11.75 billion. But at press time, the figure had decreased to $10.77 billion. OI is the value of outstanding positions in a contract.
In crypto trading, there are two sides to a trade— a buyer and a seller. When OI increases, it means that there is new money coming into the market in favor of the buyers.
Decreasing attention may nuke BTC again
A trend like this suggests a bullish trend. But if the metric indicates gets too high, the OI could serve as a bearish sign. On the other hand, a decline in Open Interest suggests an increase in positions closed which favors sellers.
Therefore, the trend above indicates that most traders are not initiating new positions. For Bitcoin’s price, this was a bearish sign, and it had started to reflect on the price.
Source: Santiment
At press time, BTC changed hands at $67,123. This was a 3.52% decrease in the last 24 hours. Apart from the decline in OI, Bitcoin’s decline could be linked to recently approved Ethereum spot ETFs.
From AMBCrypto’s investigation, it seemed that traders were rotating capital into ETH and other altcoins. Should this remain the case for some time, BTC could drop further, and a move to $65,000 could be possible in the short term.
Recently, we reported that Bitcoin’s price could drop before a return to $70,000. As such, it indicates that the prediction could be playing out already.
Watch out! A bounce may be coming
Another metric assessed was social dominance. As of this writing, Bitcoin’s social dominance dropped to 7.07%. Some days ago, the metric was over 28%.
The decline in this metric implies that discussions related to the cryptocurrency had fallen, suggesting that attention from the market was moving elsewhere.
Should social dominance continue to drop, the prediction of $65,000 could come to pass. However, a further decline could indicate a bottom for BTC.
Furthermore, Bitcoin’s Funding Rate was 0.01%. Funding Rate is the cost of holding an open contract in the market. If the funding rate is positive, it means that the contract price is trading at a premium compared to the spot value.
Source: Santiment

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

When the positive rate is negative, it means the contract price is at a discount to the index price. With the funding moving lower and the price decreasing, Bitcoin could remain bearish in the short term.
However, it might not take a long while before the price rebounds.

Ethereum Foundation Officials Speak Out After Revelations That Employees Received Payments From This Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi

The Ethereum Foundation is pursuing the development of a formal policy to address potential conflicts of interest. The move comes after the foundation revealed that two of its researchers had received “significant” incentives in EigenLayer tokens.
Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi shared in her statement today that the organization's trusted neutrality is crucial to its role in the ecosystem. He addressed the ongoing discussion about potential conflicts of interest and expressed concerns shared with the community.


Miyaguchi said in his statement:

“It is clear that relying on culture and individual decisions is not enough, and we have been working on an official policy to address this issue for some time. “We will expedite this work and share an update soon.”

In response, Lefteris Karapetsas, a former Ethereum software engineer and founder of crypto portfolio tracking tool Rotki, suggested that the Ethereum Foundation should adequately pay his colleagues. This way, they would not need to look for additional compensation packages elsewhere, according to Karapetsas.






On May 19, Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, announced that he had recently received a “significant” Eigen token incentive after becoming an advisor to the Eigen Foundation.
Drake promised to “reinvest” all proceeds as investments or donations into “valuable” projects in the ETH ecosystem. He also stated that he had undertaken the advisory role only on the condition that his role was limited to investigating restaking risks.


Two days later, Dankrad Feist, another researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, also revealed that he had recently become an advisor to EigenLayer under the same circumstances as Drake.

$6 Billion Fraud and Bitcoin Money Laundering: Woman Gets Jail Sentence


A 42-year-old British-Chinese woman who pleaded guilty to converting Bitcoin into various assets, including real estate and jewelry, has been sentenced to six years and eight months behind bars, Reuters reports.  Jian Wen was initially facing up to 14 years behind bars on various charges. She was found guilty on one money laundering-related charge in March. When her house was searched back in 2018, the Metropolitan Police and a money-laundering investigator discovered a safety deposit box with 61,000 Bitcoins. cardYadi Zhang, Wen's housemate, disappeared after the search. It turned out that she was the mastermind behind a massive money laundering scheme after defrauding 130,000 Chinese investors and fleeing to the UK. Wen, a former takeaway worker, was hired by Zhang in order to use her as her "front person." The latter claimed that she was in charge of the jewelry business. Detectives discovered that Zhang, whose real name is Zhimin Qian, had crazy fantasies about becoming the queen of a small European country. She was prepared to spend at least a whopping $5 million on her crown, according to the personal diaries of the criminal mastermind. cardWen, who used to be a takeaway worker, insisted that she was not aware of the massive fraud scheme. According to Wen, Zhang told her that she was "independently wealthy." She insisted that she simply wanted a better future for her son, who started attending a private school. Zhang reportedly managed to flee with roughly $250 million. The "supervillain," who remains at large, has been slapped with an Interpol red notice.

Ethereum Foundation Preps New Policy on Conflicts of Interest | Bankless


The Ethereum Foundation is prioritizing a new formal policy to address potential conflicts of interest in light of recent debates around prominent Ethereum researchers undertaking advisory positions.What's the scoop?Aya Miyaguchi, the EF executive director, announced plans to speed up the creation of an official policy to handle conflicts of interest. The move follows rising community discussions around recent disclosures from researchers Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist about receiving significant EigenLayer token allocations for advisory roles with the restaking protocol."It is clear that relying on culture and individual judgment has not been sufficient, and we have been working on a formal policy to address this problem for a while now," Miyaguchi said. "We will be accelerating this work, and will share an update soon."Bankless take:It's vital to address and identify potential conflicts of interest to keep our best blockchain innovations uncaptured. That said, while advisorships do pose neutrality issues, both Drake and Feist have maintained they will be critical and focused on EigenLayer's risks, and these are two people whose track records show you can take them at their word. Regardless, Miyaguchi’s quick acknowledgment and prioritization of the issue signals that the Foundation is taking the matter seriously and is dedicated to upholding ethical standards and community trust. Keep an eye out for future EF updates here.

The Untold Story Behind Beeple's Historic NFT Sale: 'Token Supremacy' Excerpt

In 2007, Beeple started a project that would eventually make him famous. The "Everydays" series began as a daily drawing habit of crude little doodles that seemed to betray his more corporate, Bill Gates appearance. The drawings were the crass products of a mind feeding on internet bile (racist caricatures, nude women, penis jokes, political satire) and tutored by magical realism (family portraits, animal studies, Jesus smoking cigarettes, Hillary Clinton wearing gold teeth). A year later, Beeple switched to Cinema4D, an animation software that allowed him to manipulate three-dimensional space. For the kid who spent hours at Toys “R” Us playing a demo of Super Mario 64 on the new Nintendo console, it was a dream come true to create realistic worlds on a computer. But it wasn’t until around 2011 that he started fully utilizing the program to experiment with bright colors and blurry shapes with names like Synthetic Bubblegum Tittufux. Around the same time, Beeple started releasing music videos made with Cinema4D as free source material for creative professionals; the artist understood how popular his creations had become only when, on a family vacation to Hong Kong, he saw one of his works projected outside a Hard Rock Cafe.

Upgraded and Uncensored: Mistral Overhauls Its AI Model - Decrypt

Top open-source AI developer Mistral quietly launched a major upgrade to its large language model (LLM), which is uncensored by default and delivers several notable enhancements. Without so much as a tweet or blog post, the French AI research lab has published the Mistral 7B v0.3 model on the HuggingFace platform. As with its predecessor, it could quickly become the basis of innovative AI tools from other developers.Canadian AI developer Cohere also released an update to its Aya, touting its multilingual skills, joining Mistral and tech giant Meta in the open source arena.While Mistral runs on local hardware and will provide uncensored responses, it does include warnings when asked for potentially dangerous or illegal information. If asked how to break into a car, it responds, "To break into a car, you would need to use a variety of tools and techniques, some of which are illegal," and along with instructions, adds, "This information should not be used for any illegal activities."The latest Mistral release includes both base and instruction-tuned checkpoints. The base model, pre-trained on a large text corpus, serves as a solid foundation for fine-tuning by other developers, while the instruction-tuned ready-to-use model is designed for conversational and task-specific uses.The token context size of Mistral 7B v0.3 was expanded to 32,768 tokens, allowing the model to handle a broader range of words and phrases in its context and improving its performance on diverse texts. A new version of Mistral's tokenizer offers more efficient text processing and understanding. For comparison, Meta's Lllama has a token context size of 8K, although its vocabulary is much larger at 128K.Image: Prompt Engineering/YouTubePerhaps the most significant new feature is function calling, which allows the Mistral models to interact with external functions and APIs. This makes them highly versatile for tasks that involve creating agents or interacting with third-party tools.The ability to integrate Mistral AI into various systems and services could make the model highly appealing to consumer-facing apps and tools. Fore example, it can make it super easy for developers to set up different agents that interact with each other, search the web or specialized databases for information, write reports, or brainstorm ideas—all without sending personal data to centralized firms like Google or OpenAI.While Mistral did not provide benchmarks, the enhancements suggest improved performance over the previous version—potentially four times more capable based on vocabulary and token context capacity. Coupled with the vastly broadened capabilities function calling brings, the upgrade is a compelling release for the second most popular open-source AI LLM model on the market.Cohere releases Aya 23, a family of multilingual modelsIn addition to Mistral's release, Cohere, a Canadian AI startup, unveiled Aya 23, a family of open-source LLMs also competing with the likes of OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral. Cohere is known for its focus on multilingual applications, and as the number in its name, Aya 23, telegraphs, it was trained to be proficient on 23 different languages.This slate of languages is intended to be able to serve nearly half of the world's population, a bid toward more inclusive AI.The model outperforms its predecessor, Aya 101, and other widely used models such as Mistral 7B v2 (not the newly released v3) and Google's Gemma in both discriminative and generative tasks. For example, Cohere claims Aya 23 demonstrates a 41% improvement over the previous Aya 101 models in multilingual MMLU tasks, a synthetic benchmark that measures how good a model's general knowledge is.Aya 23 is available in two sizes: 8 billion (8B) and 35 billion (35B) parameters. The smaller model (8B) is optimized for use on consumer-grade hardware, while the larger model (35B) offers top-tier performance across various tasks but requires more powerful hardware.Cohere says Aya 23 models are fine-tuned using a diverse multilingual instruction dataset—55.7 million examples from 161 different datasets—encompassing human-annotated, translated, and synthetic sources. This comprehensive fine-tuning process ensures high-quality performance across a wide array of tasks and languages.In generative tasks like translation and summarization, Cohere claims that its Aya 23 models outperform their predecessors and competitors, citing a variety of benchmarks and metrics like spBLEU translation tasks and RougeL summarization. Some new architectural changes—rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), grouped-query attention (GQA), and SwiGLU fine-tuning functions—brought improved efficiency and effectiveness.The multilingual basis of Aya 23 ensures the models are well-equipped for various real-world applications and makes them a well-honed tool for multilingual AI projects.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

On-chain derivatives need more capital efficiency to rival centralized exchanges: SynFutures CEO - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            On-chain derivatives trading volume registered an all-time high in March when it reached nearly $317 billion. Rachel Lin, co-founder and CEO of the decentralized exchange for perpetuals trading (perp DEX) SynFutures, highlighted to Crypto Briefing that there are still capital efficiency problems hindering perp DEXs’ growth despite recent developments.Lin explained that the current AMM models struggle to compete with centralized exchanges’ order books: despite offering better transparency, they struggle to address high slippage when liquidity is low, which is a big concern for investors.“Like the previous versions, SynFutures V3 introduces an upgrade that majorly impacts liquidity providers (LPs) and traders. The new version comes with a new AMM model called Oyster AMM (or oAMM), allowing LPs to provide concentrated liquidity for any derivative pair listed on the platform. In SynFutures’ V1 & V2, LPs can already provide single-token liquidity, but with the new AMM, LPs will also be able to provide single-token concentrated liquidity, ie. liquidity that is concentrated within specific price ranges.” This new feature could improve capital efficiency for liquidity providers and get them higher returns while decreasing slippage for traders, Lin added.Increasing regulatory scrutiny is crashing volumesAlthough on-chain derivatives trading volumes showed a solid performance in March, this momentum seems to be cooling down, as trading volumes in May just surpassed $175 billion. This movement could be tied to increased scrutiny from government organizations, highlighted Lin, mentioning the SEC’s recent movements against Coinbase and Uniswap. “In early March, we saw Bitcoin break above the heights that it made more than 2 years ago. Ethereum inflows sustained that upward trend and altcoins were seeing big gains as well. All of that momentum no doubt snowballed and carried over into the on-chain derivatives market, among other sectors,” shared Lin.Blast plays a key role in on-chain tradingEthereum layer-2 (L2) blockchain Blast has been a key ecosystem for on-chain derivatives trading in the past weeks, dominating the volume for most of April and now fighting toe-to-toe with Arbitrum for such dominance.Lin is optimistic about Blast’s landscape, underscoring SynFutures’ being one of the founding projects on “what could become one of the biggest L2s.” Nevertheless, the perp DEX’s CEO stated that they plan to deploy their platform on different chains, in an effort to keep their significant share of on-chain trading volume.“New DEXs are entering the space and deploying on new chains on a biweekly if not weekly basis, so volume numbers are in constant flux. One chain will be on top one day and the other may be on top the next. SynFutures is a multichain DEX, so while V3 launched on Blast, we’re exploring deployment on other L2s in the near future.”

Pepe 69 (PEPE69) Will Rally 11,000%, Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe 69 (PEPE69) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe 69 (PEPE69), a Solana memecoin that was launched today, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe 69 presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe 69 has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe 69 could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.




Currently, Pepe 69 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe 69 on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe 69 by entering its contract address – EvevUFVUUFR2NZVSkVzRTj1SQ6KRKdsZqdkpWinkh8m1 – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPE69.

Solana Dev Who Got Burned Up in Meme Coin Stunt Is Alive-And Wants Another Dare - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe Solana meme coin creator who suffered third-degree burns across a large portion of his body this week took to Twitter to confirm that he’s alive—and looking to return to the project in a week.Mikol, as he’s called, got the burns while performing livestreamed stunts to try and pump the price of his token.“We are alive, we have not given up on you,” the dev said from his ICU bed, visibly burnt after being pelted with fireworks. “I’ll probably be here for another three days, but right after that, you’re going to see me right back in Miami. You’re going to see me right back and better—more motivated and more hungry than ever.”Mikol confirmed in a voice note sent to Decrypt that he suffered second and third-degree burns across a large portion of his body, with his left hand and shoulders being the worst affected.Since being in the hospital, Mikol said that he has been pumped with oxycodone, morphine, codeine, and fentanyl to help deal with the pain. He must constantly stretch to prevent his skin from healing too tightly, and is beginning physical therapy soon. He told Decrypt that this is the least he’s been in pain since the incident.“This hospital bill is gonna rack the fuck up,” he said in a voice note. “They’re trying to keep me here for a week and a half.”In the early hours of Wednesday, Mikol doused himself in isopropyl alcohol and livestreamed fireworks being shot at him in an attempt to pump his TruthOrDare (DARE) token. This resulted in the meme coin creator being rushed to hospital with third-degree burns, after going up in flames without proper fire safety precautions.Mikol’s fiery stunt is the latest in a series of meme coin creators who are turning to livestreamed antics to draw in potential investors. Part “Jackass” shenanigans and part performance art, such streams have seen users perform sexually suggestive acts with a family member, for example, or pretend to have no hands before “rugging” the community by selling tokens.Some Telegram users speculated that the dev had died, but those close to him soon confirmed that he was in a stable condition recovering in a Miami trauma center. In the day that followed, there was mostly silence coming from his camp. Now two days later, Mikol has released a video to his community, and is communicating with his Telegram moderators.“This is what I’ve always wanted to do. You see me doing it passionately everyday,” Mikol said, his voice hoarse. “I can’t let my community down, my family down.”TruthOrDare had been running for six days prior to the incident. Mikol had been performing dares that his community put to him, including things like drinking bong water or setting his pants on fire.The token had been declining from a high reached a few days prior, so he planned to do something crazy to pump the price—and evidently, things went too far. From that previous high, the coin is now up 55%, but at the cost of a rising hospital bill.“I’ve been told you guys [the DARE community] have been putting in effortless work,” Mikol said. “I couldn’t be more happy with the people I’m doing this with.”Since this incident, core community members have banded together to support the DARE dev. People who have made profits or simply feel bad have donated money to Mikol’s wallet; at the time of writing, 12 SOL (about $2,000) has been transferred since the incident. On top of this, a passionate DARE investor known as DLuxx said he visited Mikol at the hospital to physically give him cash and send his best wishes.“I went last night to the hospital to bring him some cash, ‘cause Solana doesn’t help when you are in the hospital.” DLuxx told Decrypt, “It was late to visit and there was a lot of family there dealing with the situation, so we respected their privacy. Mikol asked me to come back, and my plan is to visit him later this afternoon.”Now, the community is attempting to push the TruthOrDare vision forward by streaming themselves. DLuxx was the first to livestream. During the Telegram livestream, he met a homeless man named Dillon, who did some skateboard tricks while DLuxx begged him to not hurt himself. Now the community claims they are working to send Dillon money and find him a place to stay.In a message forwarded to Decrypt, Mikol said he plans to live stream a series of dares in New York once he has recovered.Edited by Andrew HaywardDaily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Top CEOs and Analysts Announce Altcoins That Could Launch ETFs After Ethereum - Bitcoin Sistemi

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has greenlit 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs from leading companies like BlackRock and Fidelity. However, approval of other spot crypto ETFs may be a more challenging journey.
Former White House Communications Director and managing partner of alternative investment firm SkyBridge, Anthony Scaramucci, expressed optimism that a Solana ETF is next. Following the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, Scaramucci confidently said, “A SOL ETF is coming, get ready.”


Brian Kelly, a host on CNBC, speculated about the chances of an ETF for Solana, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. “Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are probably the big three for this cycle,” he said, suggesting Solana could be the next big thing.

Kelly's comments echoed those of Joe McCann, a Solana investor and founder, CEO and CIO of crypto fund Asymmetric. McCann believes that if another ETF is approved, it will be Solana. However, he also acknowledged potential problems for Solana and other cryptocurrencies, noting that the Coinbase case used language that could affect future approvals.





McCann highlighted Dogecoin as another potential competitor for an ETF, given its similarities to Bitcoin's launch and its status as “definitely not a security.” Litecoin has also attracted attention for similar reasons.
However, from a regulatory perspective, while Dogecoin and Litecoin may be more suitable options, the financial obligation required to launch a Litecoin ETF may be a deterrent for issuers.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs Rake In Nine Consecutive Days of Inflows Totaling Over $1,750,000,000 - The Daily Hodl


								New data reveals that spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have brought in nine straight days of inflows totaling over $1 billion dollars.
According to data from London-based investment firm Farside Investors, BTC ETFs have seen positive inflows every day since May 14th, totaling more than $1.75 billion.










May 15th and May 21st marked the days with the largest inflows, as they saw $303 million and $305.7 million, respectively.
The data also unveils that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the only BTC ETF that saw outflows during the nine-day period. On May 14th, it saw $50.9 million worth of outflows while on May 22nd and May 23rd, it saw $16.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively.
Furthermore, according to Farside, the single biggest instance of incoming funds was on May 21st, when the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a staggering $290 million worth of inflows.
Spot market BTC ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year after years of rejection when a judge ruled that the regulatory body must reconsider its stance to remain consistent with previous rulings.
BTC ETFs give consumers exposure to the top crypto asset by market cap without them having to directly purchase it.
Earlier this month, it was found that the largest US hedge funds combined to accumulate over $2.6 billion worth of BTC ETFs.
“Twelve of the largest 25 US hedge funds collectively have over $2.6 billion Bitcoin ETF exposure. Eleven of the largest 25 Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) also have exposure. All while Bitcoin is just a $1 trillion asset class.” 
Bitcoin is trading for $68,122 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Feeling Lucky? Google AI Search Advice Could Kill You - Decrypt

Google's newly released AI-powered search results are garnering lots of attention—for the wrong reasons. After the tech behemoth announced a host of new AI-powered tools last week as part of a new “Gemini Era,” its trademark web search results changed significantly, with natural language answers to questions displayed above websites.“In the past year, we've answered billions of queries as part of the search-generated experience,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the audience. “People are using it to search in entirely new ways and asking new types of questions longer and more complex queries, even searching with photos, and getting back the best the web has to offer.”The answers, however, can be incomplete, incorrect, or even dangerous—whether wading into eugenics or failing to identify a poisonous mushroom.Image: @tkingfisher on ThreadsMany of the "AI Overview" answers are pulled from social media and even satirical sites where wrong answers were the whole point. Google users have shared countless problematic responses they received from Google’s AI.When told, “I'm feeling depressed,” Google reportedly said one of the ways to deal with depression was  “jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.”Another asked, “If I run off a cliff, can I stay in the air so long as I don’t look down?” Citing a cartoon-inspired Reddit thread, Google's "AI Overview" confirmed the gravity-defying capability.The strong representation of Reddit threads among the examples follows a deal announced earlier this year that Google would use Reddit’s data to make it easier “to discover and access the communities and conversations people are looking for.” Earlier this month, ChatGPT developer OpenAI similarly announced that it would be licensing data from Reddit.In another instance of absurd answers, a Google user asked, “How many rocks should a child eat?” to which Google’s AI responded with “at least one small rock a day,” citing a “UC Berkeley geologist.”Many of the most absurd and remarked upon examples have since been removed or corrected by Google. Google did not immediately respond to a request to comment from Decrypt.An ongoing issue with generative AI models is A penchant to make up answers, or “hallucinate.” Hallucinations are reasonably characterized as lies because the AI is making up something that is not true. However, in cases like Reddit-sourced answers, the AI didn’t lie—it simply took the information provided by its sources at face value.Thanks to a Reddit comment that's more than a decade old, Google’s AI reportedly said adding glue to cheese is a good way to keep it from sliding off a pizza.OpenAI's flagship AI model, ChatGPT, has a long history of making up facts, including wrongfully accusing law professor Jonathan Turley of sexual assault last April, citing a trip he did not take.The AI’s overconfidence has apparently declared everything on the internet as real, laid blame for the debacle at the feet of a former Google exec, and adjudicated the company's own guilt in the area of anti-trust law.The feature has certainly sparked humor and bemusement as users pepper Google with pop-culture queries.But the recommended daily allowance for rock intake by children has been updated, instead noting that “curiosity, sensory processing difficulties, or an eating disorder” could be responsible for such a diet.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Ethereum spot ETF approval is here - Everything you need to know - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Spot Ethereum ETFs have finally received the greenlight after a period of uncertainty. Thursday’s approval not only marked a milestone for Ethereum but also a positive development in the US regulatory approach to crypto. This article will provide more insights into the recent approval, its potential motivation, and implications for the industry.An overview of spot Ethereum ETF approvalOn May 23, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the 19b-4 forms associated with eight spot Ethereum ETFs. These include Blackrock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, Franklin Ethereum ETF, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.The latest approval follows the debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US in January. However, unlike Bitcoin ETFs, the Ethereum products still need S-1 form approval to fully operate, which is pending review now.As reported by Crypto Briefing, the securities watchdog recently started engaging with ETF issuers on S-1 forms. This development likewise confirmed some previous speculation that the SEC lacked interaction with the issuers during the review process.Considering previous cases, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimates that it may take the SEC up to five months to clear the spot Ethereum funds for trading. However, the analyst suggests that the timeline can be extended.Key factors influencing approvalAccording to the SEC’s approval document, the correlation between Ethereum futures and spot markets was one of the key factors influencing the decision.Notably, the SEC conducted its own analysis to verify the correlation results provided by Bitwise’s amendments and other commenters, including the Coinbase Letter and CF Benchmarks Letters. The SEC’s findings confirmed the high correlations reported, indicating a robust linkage between the CME Ethereum futures and spot Ethereum markets.Other considerations addressed in the approval document include investor protection, market integrity, volatility, and risk concerns.However, Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, claimed that the SEC might “explicitly avoid staking” in its document.There have been ongoing discussions surrounding the SEC’s stance on Ethereum’s staking feature. Analysts believe that the removal of the staking component, or the affirmation of no staking in Ethereum ETF filings is as important as other key factors influencing the decision.Major firms such as Fidelity and ARK 21Shares initially included staking provisions in their filings with the SEC. However, ahead of the SEC’s decision deadline, these firms amended their filings to eliminate any references to staking.While there have been no further comments from the ETF issuers, these removals were likely in response to the SEC’s stance that staking services could be viewed as unregistered securities offerings.Historically, the SEC has demonstrated a cautious approach to staking services.For instance, the SEC alleged that Kraken’s staking program, where users deposit crypto assets to stake and earn rewards, was an unregistered securities offering in violation of US securities laws. The lawsuit ended with Kraken’s $30 million settlement with the SEC. The firm subsequently discontinued its staking service for US retail customers.Another case is the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase in June 2023. The agency also alleged that Coinbase’s retail staking services were securities.Why does Ethereum ETF approval matter?The SEC’s green light for spot Ethereum ETFs hints at, but doesn’t definitively confirm, their stance on the underlying asset, Ethereum (ETH).Rumors have swirled that the SEC considers most cryptos, except Bitcoin, to be unregistered securities. This aligns with statements from SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the recent ETF approval offers a potential counterpoint.Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, and Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, interpret the recent approval as an implicit nod to ETH’s status as a commodity, given that the ETF shares are based on a commodity.“This week, this day, has been a rollercoaster unlike any other I’ve seen. ETH is effectively deemed a Commodity as we’ve always known it to be,” Grewal stated.“…it’s clear: “commodity-based trust shares,” Chervinsky noted.Why might delegated authority not matter?The approval of the spot Ethereum ETFs was issued via delegated authority, which eliminates the need for public commissioner votes. This arrangement raises concerns because it allows any commissioner the technical right to challenge and request a review of the decision.However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said a review request would likely not alter the outcome.According to him, the SEC commissioners would not permit the Trading and Markets division to issue such an approval unless a majority of them supported the decision. This consensus among the commissioners suggests a strong foundational agreement on the approval.In essence, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs under delegated authority indicates that the launch of these ETFs is imminent.The possibility of enforcement action against Ethereum-linked entitiesThe recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs came as a welcome surprise, especially given the SEC’s alleged legal threats against Ethereum-associated entities such as the Ethereum Foundation and Consensys.The agency had reportedly initiated a campaign to classify Ethereum (ETH) as a security—a move many believed would undermine the prospects for approving Ethereum-based ETFs.This backdrop, combined with a lack of engagement reported by insiders and a generally pessimistic outlook from ETF issuers and experts, made the favorable decision on May 23 particularly unexpected.Experts had speculated that the SEC was reluctant to approve ETFs tied to ETH because it wanted to classify the crypto as a security. However, the prevailing political climate in the US appears to have influenced the SEC to alter its stance and approve these ETFs.Nevertheless, this approval does not mean that the entities involved are completely off the hook. The SEC might still treat the sale of ETH tokens during Ethereum’s 2014 ICO as an “investment contract.”If this is the case, it likely reflects the Ripple-SEC legal lawsuit, in which the SEC alleged that the sale of XRP between 2013 and 2020 represented an “investment contract.”According to a court ruling last year, XRP sales on the secondary market did not constitute an “investment contract,” but the institutional sales were deemed unregistered offers and sales of investment contracts under the Howey test.Apart from these possibilities, in a less likely scenario, the SEC might not intend to sue the entities.The recent legal threats, including one targeting Uniswap, might be a strategy to intimidate or pressure crypto companies, rather than a genuine reflection of wrongdoing. This view was previously supported by Chervinsky.

An Upcoming Altcoin Allegedly Stole the Name of Another Popular Altcoin - Bitcoin Sistemi


The fact that the zkSync (ZK) altcoin, which will be listed on the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit in the coming period, will receive the ZK ticker owned by another altcoin, Polyhedra Network, was not welcomed by some segments of the community.
Polyhedra Network will no longer be able to be bought and sold on Bybit with the ZK ticker.


However, Polyhedra developers accused zkSync altcoin developers of stealing their tickers in their statement. However, there are many people who think that Polyhedra does not deserve the ZK ticker anyway.

Polyhedra Network was previously known as ZKbridge and had the ticker ZKB. However, it later changed its ticker to ZK after the altcoin was listed on OKX.





Polyhedra developers criticized the situation in their statement on social media platform X:

“It is incredible that even with the approval of the ETH ETF, there are still projects in 2024 that offer advantages to various parties and take away the ticker that others deserve.
Web3 should never have been a breeding ground for bullying.
We believe the community understands the true meaning of equity and justice.
Let's see who will support such abuses and who will be the defender of justice and righteousness.
“You did a great job as a robber and thief, not as a blockchain founder.”

FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg to Resign Amid Toxic Workplace Investigation



                    

Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), will step down following a scathing investigation revealing a toxic workplace culture at the agency.



On May 20, Gruenberg announced his intention to resign from his position as chair, a role he has held since August 2005. 




He stated in an email to staff, “In light of recent events, I am prepared to step down from my responsibilities once a successor is confirmed. 



Until that time, I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Chairman of the FDIC, including the transformation of the FDIC’s workplace culture.”



The FDIC, an independent U.S. government agency, provides insurance for depositors in American commercial and savings banks.




The announcement follows a third-party investigation published on May 7, which uncovered allegations of sexual harassment and other misconduct at the FDIC, as well as the management’s inadequate response to these issues.



On May 15, Gruenberg testified before Congress regarding the widespread allegations of sexual harassment and mistreatment of subordinates. 



Both Republicans and Democrats expressed their outrage and disbelief at the severity of the issues within the FDIC, as reported by Reuters. 



Lawmakers, including Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, have called for his resignation and urged President Biden to appoint a new FDIC chair.




The White House has confirmed its intention to nominate a successor for the position.

However, Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed confidence in Gruenberg’s ability to initiate change at the agency.



Gruenberg’s impending resignation has been well-received by the crypto community. Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, celebrated the news, calling it “the best day ever.”



Meanwhile, digital asset industry lawyer John Deaton criticized Warren, saying, “It is shameful how Elizabeth Warren circled the wagons to keep one of her disgraced puppets in place. I’m so looking forward to the debates.”



Gruenberg is believed to have played a key role in Operation Choke Point 2.0, a term coined by Nic Carter in 2023. 



This refers to a coordinated effort by the FDIC to discourage banks from holding crypto deposits or providing banking services to crypto firms.



In an October 2022 speech, Gruenberg compared crypto assets to risky financial innovations like subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.

Coinbase Presses for a New Appeal Against SEC | Bankless


Crypto exchange giant Coinbase just filed a motion for an interlocutory appeal in its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), challenging the agency's authority over certain crypto transactions.What's the scoop?Coinbase has asked for a higher court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, to decide if digital asset transactions without post-sale obligations to the original issuer qualify as investment contracts under SEC regulation. The move comes on the heels of a judge's rejection of Coinbase's initial attempt to dismiss the SEC's case against it. In that ruling, Judge Katherine Failla said buying a token on a platform involves buying into that token's digital ecosystem, not just the token itself.In its new motion, Coinbase pointed to a division between lawmakers and the SEC, particularly following the recent FIT21 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives.Ultimately, Coinbase is seeking to challenge whether digital asset transactions not involving formal contracts can be regulated as "investment contracts" by the SEC.Bankless takeThe passing of FIT21 in the House certainly provides ammunition to Coinbase’s motion, which could even extend to Consensys’s ongoing SEC lawsuit as well. Given that the motion's particular issue is clarifying whether the SEC will regulate digital asset transactions as investment contracts that don’t involve anything contractual, and how the implications of this are huge, it's also hard to imagine that U.S. lawmakers won't be watching this case closely going forward. In the meantime, only time will tell if Coinbase's new appeal will be heard.

Trump Embraces Crypto Donations: Could It Alter Digital Asset Playing Field? - Benzinga

Ex-President Donald Trump made headlines when he announced that his 2024 presidential campaign would accept cryptocurrency donations. This move marks a major shift in his stance on digital currencies (he previously called Bitcoin a scam). The twice-impeached and quadruple-indicted Republican is also the first major presidential candidate to embrace crypto for fundraising purposes (although independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been accepting Bitcoin donations for months).Trump’s pivot comes as his campaign looks to draw support from voters who have grown disgruntled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Biden administration for its strict stance on cryptocurrency companies.Trump’s camp also sees cryptocurrency as a means to raise money for his legal bills. This strategy counters the anti-crypto sentiment often associated with President Joe Biden and other Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.The White House did outline a regulatory framework for the crypto industry in 2022 that stressed “commonsense efficiency standards for cryptocurrency mining.”See Also: ‘The Real Loser Here Is Melania,’ Jimmy Kimmel Pokes Fun At Trump’s Financial WoesImplications for the Crypto MarketThe campaign's announcement highlighted that contributions could be made in various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Experts are divided on the impact of Trump's move. David Hoffman, co-owner at Bankless, suggests that the former president's interest in crypto might be superficial. In contrast, Ryan Selkis, CEO of Messari Crypto, viewed the development positively, noting Trump's recent influence on the crypto market and regulatory environment. Trump has benefited significantly from cryptocurrency. He has received millions in cryptocurrency from NFT projects that bear his photoshopped likeness; sold at least 1,075 ETH for $2.4 million in proceeds; and tapped Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey on a “day 1” cryptocurrency policy.Future of Digital Assets Event in NYCThe broader implications of Trump’s decision and the evolving role of digital assets will be explored at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event in New York City on November 19. This one-day gathering will feature industry leaders, investors, and policymakers discussing digital asset trends and future directions. The event promises to offer valuable discussions and networking opportunities, bringing together over 1,000 capital markets leaders for a day of meetings, executive roundtables, and panel discussions.The event will cover various topics, including the state of digital asset adoption, risk and security in the industry, and integrating digital assets into investment portfolios. Panels will explore the unintended consequences of regulations, the future of NFTs and metaverses, and the role of digital assets in the fourth industrial revolution. Attendees will also have the chance to engage in small group discussions with executives and thought leaders, gaining deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities in the digital assets space.Now Read: Historians Compare Trump’s Usage Of  Hitler-Phrase ‘Vermin’ To Autocratic RhetoricImage: Shutterstock

Post-Ethereum ETF Analysis: ETH Price Seeks Bottom As Bulls Eye $5,000 Target


																The recent approval of the Ethereum ETF applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday has sparked speculation on the next price movements for the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency as the trading launch date approaches. 
However, significant transfers of Ethereum (ETH) to cryptocurrency exchanges have raised concerns about profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, and potential market speculation. 
Sell-Off Amidst Ethereum ETF Greenlight?
According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these developments coincide with Ethereum founder Jeffrey Wilke transferring 10,000 ETH, valued at approximately $37.38 million, to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. 
Furthermore, the surge in Ethereum balances on cryptocurrency exchanges indicates a notable increase in tokens available for sale.

This trend, coupled with Wilke’s transfer, suggests the possibility of a sell-off or an increase in profit-taking among market participants.
While industry experts like Anthony Pompliano view the Ethereum ETF approval as a positive sign for the entire industry, traders are advised to exercise caution. For Martinez, the growing number of ETH deposits to exchange wallets implies a potential market reaction characterized by profit-taking or selling pressure. 
Additionally, the analyst notes that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal on Ethereum’s daily chart, indicating the potential for a retracement or a new downward countdown phase before the upward trend resumes.
Ethereum’s Price Outlook In Focus
Diving into the price analysis, considering the IOMAP (Input-Output Model and Profitability) data, Martinez highlights that Ethereum has a strong demand zone between $3,820 and $3,700, where over 1.81 million addresses bought approximately 1.66 million ETH.

This range could provide support amid increasing selling pressure. However, if this zone fails to hold, the next key area of support lies between $3,580 and $3,462, where 3.13 million addresses acquired over 1.50 million ETH.

	Related Reading


On the upside, Ethereum’s most significant resistance barrier is between $3,940 and $4,054, with over 1.16 million addresses purchasing around 574,660 ETH. 
Martinez suggests that a daily candlestick close above $4,170 would invalidate the bearish outlook and potentially trigger a new upward countdown phase, with a target towards $5,000.

As of this writing, ETH’s price is $3,719, reflecting a 2.5% retracement over the past 24 hours. However, according to the analyst’s assessment, Ethereum remains within a crucial demand zone. 
As the market approaches the launch and commencement of trading for all eight spot Ethereum ETF applications by the world’s largest asset managers, the exact impact on price action is yet to be fully realized.

BitMEX Co-Founder: Weak Yen Could Push Bitcoin Price to $1 Million | Cryptoglobe


                                
Arthur Hayes, co-founder of popular cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform BitMEX, has recently revealed a theory on the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, and how a weakening yen could see Bitcoin’s price top the $1 million mark.



In his latest newsletter titled “The Easy Button” Hayes, currently the Chief Investment Officer of Maelstrom, argued that efforts to address the weakening of the Japanese yen could help push the price of the flagship cryptocurrency upward. He said:



Bitcoin is the best-performing asset in the face of global fiat debasement, and they know it. When something is done about the weak yen, I will mathematically guestimate how flows into the Bitcoin complex will ratchet the price to $1 million and possibly beyond.



Hayes’ theory is based on the monetary policies of Japan, China, and the US and how the dollar-yen exchange rate is crucial for the global economy, with the Federal Reserve, using Treasury orders, being able to swap dollars for yen with Japan’s central bank to manipulate the exchange rate and avoid raising interest rates, which would hurt the Bank of Japan.



The founder of BitMEX added that this allows the Bank of Japan to support its yen without having to sell U.S. Treasurys, which in turn helps the U.S. Treasury by preventing it from becoming a forced seller and maintaining low yields.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Per his words, economic competition between China and Japan, particularly when it comes to exports, often boils down to the price, and a weaker yen could see China devalue its yuan to maintain competitiveness. This would, in turn, hurt American manufacturers and potentially lead to further outsourcing.



Hayes also speculated that China could even use its abundant gold reserves – which have been growing significantly – to back the yuan and destabilize financial institutions in the West.



To counter all of this, Hayes suggested a scenario in which the Federal Reserve intervenes by printing U.S. dollars and exchanging them for yen, to provide the Bank of Japan with resources to stabilize the currency market while allowing China to continue its monetary expansion.



Such a strategy, he said, could lead to the devaluation of the US dollar and that, coupled with Bitcoin’s rise, could threaten the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. If the theory holds, then institutional investors will move to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a hedge against the decline of traditional fiat currencies.

                        Cryptocurrency markets are ending the week with solid momentum in wake of the SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs and, in wake of Bitcoin (BTC)’s recovery back to the $69,000 level, traders are hunting for the best crypto to buy now for quick gains.That cryptocurrency could be Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum is up over 20% this week, but last trading in the $3,700s, remains stuck below its March highs.It also still remains well below its 2021 highs near $4,900. That’s despite the arrival of the most bullish Ethereum narrative in years.When spot Ethereum ETFs go live, that will open the door to a flood of new demand from institutional investors.ETF approval is also clears up any uncertainty regarding whether Ether is a security or not.And the market will also interpret ETF approvals as a stamp of approval on the asset from US regulators.As new ETH buyers flood in, this will inject further liquidity into its ecosystem.That should solidify Ethereum’s dominant position as the go-to blockchain for web3 project/developers.It’s very likely that Ethereum hits new record highs soon, assuming demand for spot Ethereum ETFs is good.All said, Ethereum is a candidate for best crypto to buy now.As Bitcoin progresses above $100,000 in the coming quarters, Ethereum could be a good bet to 2x from here.But some investors will be hunting for higher upside than this. For investors looking to book 5-10x upside, they will need to invest in cryptos higher up the risk curve.These will be smaller, lesser-known coins with smaller market caps. Here are some strong-performing altcoins on Friday that might pop.Best Crypto to Buy NowCore (CORE)After bouncing strongly from the $1.50 support zone, Core (CORE) is back at $1.97 and testing its 50DMA.CORE was last up 22% in 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap, making it the best performing in the top 100.“Core is a relatively new web3 blockchain that aims to be inclusive, decentralized, secure and more efficient,” Bybit says.If it can return to its April highs, that could mean a quick 2x gains in the next few weeks.Core (CORE) could see quick 2x gains, positioning it as potentially the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewjoel frThat could make it the best crypto to buy now.Ondo Finance (ONDO)Ondo Finance (ONDO) is powering to new record highs as bets on Ethereum ecosystem growth come pouring in.ONDO was last around $1.1460, up 7% on the day.The tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is a major theme in crypto. And Ondo Finance certainly ranks as one of the best RWA coins to invest in.One of the platform’s biggest success stories is its Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG) token.The token yields 4.96% and has nearly $200 million in trade value locked, per the project’s website.Ondo Finance’s overall TVL recently hit a record high above $450 million, as per DeFi Llama.That’s up more than double versus the start of the year.It shouldn’t come as a big surprise that ONDO is up nearly 600% year to date, as per CoinMarketCap.But as inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem accelerate, ONDO’s upside could accelerate. ONDO could easily be the best crypto to buy now.Uniswap (UNI)Leading Decentralized Exchange (DEX) protocol Uniswap (UNI) is testing key resistance just above $10.Last up 11% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap, Uniswap is another beneficiary of Ethereum ETFs.Rather than that being down to Ethereum ecosystem growth bets, that’s probably more to do with the SEC softening stance.The sudden SEC approval of spot Ethereum ETFs was a big surprise to the market.The SEC had previously been campaigning to label ETH a security, as per reports.Ethereum ETF approvals clears up all doubts – ETH isn’t a security. That’s a bit policy reversal from the SEC.Uniswap bulls might be hoping for a policy reversal for them too. The SEC hit Uniswap’s creator, Uniswap Labs, with a Wells Notice earlier this year.If Uniswap can bust through $10 resistance, the door is open to a quick retest of yearly highs at $17.As Uniswap gears up to break above $10 resistance, it could be the best crypto to buy now. Source: TradingViewThe prospect of quick 70% gains means UNI could easily be the best crypto to buy now.

Spot ETH ETFs could see 25% of the demand of BTC counterpart - Bloomberg analysts

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that spot Ethereum ETFs could see 20% to 25% of the demand experienced by spot Bitcoin ETFs.Seyffart expressed his stance in an interview hosted by Bitwise, adding that his fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, believes the new funds will see 15% to 20% of the demand.Seyffart compared both estimates to the fact that ETH has approximately 30% of Bitcoin’s $1.4 trillion market cap, calling his estimate a “discount” in that regard.He attributed the difference to certain limitations of each product. ETH ETF issuers will not engage in staking, meaning that, unlike ETH holders, ETF investors cannot earn yield. Furthermore, Ethereum has greater on-chain utility than Bitcoin, and ETF investors will not be able to access it.Seyffart declared:” … The gap between Ether as an ETF and Ether itself … is a little wider than the gap between Bitcoin and Bitcoin as an ETF wrapper.”Seyffart said that Ethereum futures ETFs, which have just 12% of the assets compared to futures ETFs in the US, do not provide a “good sample” for an estimate. ETH futures ETFs in foreign markets have 20% to 30% of assets proportionate to Bitcoin futures ETFs.Ultimately, Seyffart predicted spot ETH ETFs would have “big launches” but not as big as spot Bitcoin ETF launches. “There’s going to be demand,” he concluded.Bitwise CIO expects significant demandBitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicted “significant demand” for spot Ethereum ETFs.Hougan said that demand will likely come from two sources. First, he suggested that many investors treat diversification as a “fundamental starting point.”He predicted that “many investors” but “not a majority” would initially pursue a diversification strategy. Hougan also suggested that engagement could increase over time, with a majority of professional investors wanting diversified exposure within five years.Hougan said:“[Investors] don’t want to own one stock. They don’t want to own one bond. Why would they own just one crypto asset?”Secondly, Hougan said that Ethereum’s role as a “high growth tech investment” will appeal to investors, citing “killer apps” such as stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, DeFi, gaming, and social apps.ETH ETFs gained initial approvalThe US SEC approved several 19b-4 rule changes on May 23, which will allow exchanges to list and trade several pending spot ETH ETFs.One proposal that gained approval was NYSE Arca’s filing on behalf of Bitwise’s proposed fund.The SEC must still handle each firm’s S-1 registration statements.A launch date is unclear. Seyffart believes launches will occur in weeks or longer. JP Morgan believes the products will launch before November.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

                        Communities across the web are pausing to reflect on the life of Kabosu, the dog behind the Doge meme and Dogecoin mascot, who passed away at 17 on May 25.Kabosu’s owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the news in a post on her official blog, expressing her deep gratitude for the love and support shown to her over the years.The passing came following an announcement that Kabosu was in a “dangerous position” healthwise in 2022. However, Sata expressed the passing to be peaceful, without suffering.“Soft light streamed in through the window, amidst the beautiful morning where birds sing, she gently passed away, as if falling asleep, while being stroked by me,” she said.Sato also announced a farewell gathering in honor of “Kabo-chan,” scheduled for May 26 at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City.The news has reverberated across the internet, uniting pop culture, meme culture, and crypto culture to remember the loss. Kabosu has undoubtedly stamped her mark on internet history.Doge’s History: From Meme, to Crypto, to Legend
Kabosu first gained widespread attention in 2010 when Sato shared photos of her adopted dog on her blog. A particular image of Kabosu, capturing her skeptical and curious expression, swiftly went viral and birthed the “Doge” meme phenomenon.This single image, accompanied by phrases in broken English, became a cornerstone of early meme culture.By 2013, the popularity of the foundational meme surged after Dogecoin was created, using Kabosu’s image as its official logo.Despite initially being intended as a joke, Dogecoin became a popular cryptocurrency. It became responsible for several charitable initiatives, including clean water projects and funding for the Jamaican bobsled team.This also normalized meme coins in the crypto space, resulting in the rise of some of the most popular meme coins. Many of these coins adopted the Shiba Inu as their mascot, paying homage to the original meme that sparked the trend.The original Doge image was also minted as an NFT in 2023. It sold for 1,696 ETH, worth $4 million.Since being sold, the NFT has been divided into billions of smaller, tradable units for fractional ownership.Her influence extends to political campaigns.

Bitcoin Surges Above $70,000, Crushing Short Sellers with $85M in Liquidations



                    

Bitcoin surged above $70,000 on May 21 after intense buying pressure triggered a sharp price increase.



Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView indicated that BTC/USD was striving to maintain its newly regained ground at crucial psychological levels.




Bitcoin’s ascent towards the previous daily close was driven by significant buying liquidity, pushing the market close to $72,000.



This surge dealt a heavy blow to short sellers, with $85 million in BTC shorts liquidated in the 24 hours leading up to the report, according to data from CoinGlass.



Statistician Willy Woo commented on the situation, highlighting that bulls were confronting overhead resistance that had persisted for over a month.




“1 month of Bitcoin short position build up just got liquidated,” he told followers on X. “One more layer to go in order to short squeeze past all-time highs.”



A bold prediction even suggested that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 following a breakout on weekly timeframes.



Popular trader Skew speculated that the United States’ spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might have influenced the move, anticipating “important days to come” ahead of the decision on U.S. spot Ether ETFs.



On the same day, ETH/USD traded near $3,700, up 18% in 24 hours and 25% over the week.Despite the surge in demand, popular trader and commentator Credible Crypto maintained a cautious outlook.




He emphasized that BTC price action was at “major resistance” and was unlikely to overcome it in the near term.



“No change to the plan – we are at major resistance atm with perp premium positive after a month and a half and funding the highest it’s been since – I clearly said these are not the conditions in which a move to the highs is conducive to the next major leg up imo,” he wrote in part of an X discussion.



CoinGlass indicated that $70,630 was the area with the thickest bid liquidity below the spot price at the time of writing.

Binance Completes Another Massive LUNC Burn, Here’s How Much Was Burned | Bitcoinist.com


								Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume has executed another large-scale Terra Classic (LUNC) burn, continuing its supporting role for the Terra Classic ecosystem. Despite the substantial supply reduction, the price of LUNC and its daily trading volume have been falling significantly. 
Binance Burns LUNC Tokens
On May 23, Binance initiated another LUNC burn separate from its 21st batch of LUNC burns on May 1. According to LUNC burn tracker, Terra Finder, the crypto exchange transferred about 29,828 LUNC tokens to a dead wallet, with a transaction fee of 11.33 LUNC. 

Typically, on the first of every month, Binance executes a large-scale LUNC burn worth thousands of dollars. On May 1, the crypto exchange burnt approximately 1.4 billion LUNC tokens, valued at around $140,000, recording a total burn of more than 57 billion at the time. 
Data from Binance’s LUNC tracker, ‘LUNC metrics’ have revealed that Binance’s total LUNC burn has increased to 59.07 billion LUNC tokens, representing approximately 51.9% of the total LUNC burned by the Terra Classic community. Additionally, the crypto exchange had begun its monthly burning cycle following Terra Luna’s crash in 2022, terminating over 59 billion LUNC tokens in 2,965 transactions. 
The highest LUNC burn executed by Binance was recorded on March 2, 2023. The crypto exchange has burned a whopping 8.84 billion LUNC tokens, significantly reducing Terra Classic’s token supply. 
Collectively, the total LUNC tokens burnt by the Terra Community has reached over 113.7 billion, with Binance being the leading contributor to the burns. The crypto exchange has been a fervent supporter of the Terra Classic community, consistently aiding the community to diminish the token’s staggering supply of approximately 6.79 trillion LUNC. 
Terra Classic (LUNC) Price On A Downtrend
Despite Binance and the community’s effort to reduce LUNC’s supply, the cryptocurrency’s price has remained low, recording a 2.15% decline in the last 24 hours. Usually, when a token’s supply is diminished, it induces scarcity, fueling price increases as demand for the token grows. 
However, with LUNC’s substantial token supply coupled with a 62.49% decline in its daily trading volume, the cryptocurrency has failed to witness any significant price increases. 

At the time of writing, the price of the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.00011, according to CoinMarketCap. Additionally, its stablecoin, TerraClassic USD (USTC) is also trading at a price of $0.022, reflecting a 3.32% decrease over the past 24 hours. USTC’s daily trading volume has also recorded steep losses, falling by 56.26%.  
These unexpected declines in the Terra Classic ecosystem follow Binance’s recent LUNC token burn, displaying an opposite bearish effect from a burning process meant to decrease LUNC’s total supply and potentially trigger a price rebound.

Bitcoin Whales Are Back to Buying Up BTC, Analysis Shows - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe appetite Bitcoin whales have for more coins has returned for the first time since the price of Bitcoin reached its all-time high in March, according to blockchain data.“They are now returning with a strong buying force again, indicating that the current prices are suitable for purchasing and accumulating despite the widespread fear,” market intelligence firm CryptoQuant tweeted on Friday.Analysts cited a rise in the 30-day percentage change in whale address holdings, alongside a rising total BTC balance held by whales. In on-chain terms, a ‘whale’ is the owner of any Bitcoin address holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC, excluding those controlled by mining firms and crypto exchanges.“In general, whales buy Bitcoin at a faster pace during bull markets and decrease their buying when the market switches to a bear market,” CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno told Decrypt.Throughout March, whales had increased their BTC holdings by over 9.8%. They continued stacking in April, but their rate of accumulation slowed to just 4.2% by May 1, at which time Bitcoin’s price had cratered over 20% from its highs to under $57,000.As of May 22, the metric had returned to 5.5%, meaning whale accumulation was back on the rise after the market bottomed. In early May, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted that whales had scooped up 47,000 BTC during the drastic market dip.Bitcoin’s price has lifted to $68,760 as of this writing, up about 3% for the week.According to Moreno, the amount of money invested in Bitcoin by whales has more than doubled from $57 billion to $122 billion since the start of the year. This is measured by observing whale owners’ “realized cap”—the total value of all whale coins based on the time that each coin was bought, rather than their current market value.Lead Glassnode analyst James Check said on Wednesday that the Bitcoin network’s total realized cap has now reached an all-time high of $578 billion, “meaning the fundamentals of Bitcoin have literally never been stronger.”“In my view, we're quite far from the true euphoria phase of this bull market,” Check added. “You could argue we're on the boundary between enthusiasm and excitement, but not yet euphoric.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Solana (SOL) Plummets 10%, Here's Why, Ethereum ETF Effect: Will It Kick In? Cardano (ADA) Brand New Support Level

Solana lost around 10% of its value in an unexpected manner. The asset that looked well-positioned for the rally after the preliminary approval of the Ethereum ETF is currently looking weaker than the rest of the market, and it's not clear if it's going to recover properly.Examining the chart, Solana experienced a sharp decline, dropping from around $176 to $164. This significant drop has brought SOL down to test its support level at $160, which has previously acted as a strong support area. If this level fails to hold, the next major support lies at $150, corresponding with the 200-day moving average (orange line).SOL/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the resistance side, Solana faces immediate resistance at $176, a level it struggled to maintain before the recent drop. Above this, the next key resistance is around $190, where the 50-day moving average (blue line) currently resides. Breaking through these levels would be necessary for any substantial recovery.Several factors could be contributing to Solana's decline. First, market sentiment following the Ethereum ETF approval has been mixed, with some assets benefiting while others like Solana suffer. Additionally, technical factors such as failing to maintain key resistance levels might have triggered stop-loss orders, accelerating the sell-off.For traders and investors, the $160 support level is critical. If Solana can maintain this level, it may consolidate and attempt another upward move. However, if it breaks below $160, the next significant level to watch would be $150. This could indicate further downside potential, and investors might need to brace for more volatility.Ethereum stays composedThe expected kick in price that many attributed to Ethereum's ETF effect turned out to be a fiasco. There are quite a number of factors that could be responsible for bringing out such poor price performance, although, for the time being, the more important question remains: could there be price growth ahead, rather than talks about the failed rally?Ethereum, until this point in time, had not been able to really breach key resistance levels, even after ETF approval. Critical reasons behind this are the kind of approval — it was not the full-blown S-1 type — and, hence, the doors for further regulatory issues are still open. Besides, the Division of Trading and Markets gave this consent under delegated authority, which is subject to challenge over the next 10 days. All this amounts to some additional uncertainty that adds to the overall position of the markets. But it is not all bad over the long term. The plain fact that any acceptance of an Ethereum ETF, even partial, sets a precedent in this space and sets off further potential and larger instances of crypto adoption. Cardano's weird positionCardano is not the most noted asset in the market, does not bring much volatility and, therefore, did not form very noticeable moves in previous weeks. However, we can see some potential here because ADA is approaching a major support, which can afterwards serve as a base for a reverse.At this point, the chart is showing Cardano establishing a new level of support around $0.45. This level has been tested several times and has held up under the pressure of the downside, perhaps pointing to some real interest in that price. The volume spike on this new movement definitely strengthens the case for this to be an important level for the price. If ADA can hold onto this level, it might serve as a nice base upon which to initiate an upward move.On a daily chart, ADA has its immediate resistance located at $0.50. This is a price level at which the ticker has seen rejections in the onward price action for the last couple of days. One critical thing to note is that once breached, the current fanatical rally could see a target at $0.55, exactly where the 200-day moving average lies.

Bank Employee Steals $2,100,000 From Customers, Spawns Web of Unauthorized Transactions and Illicit Accounts: DOJ Indictment - The Daily Hodl


								The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is accusing a bank employee of creating a web of unauthorized transactions and illegal accounts, stealing more than $2.1 million from customers.
In a 17-count indictment, the DOJ says it’s charging Yue Cao of Winfield, Illinois, with alleged bank fraud, aggravated identity theft and engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property in connection with a scheme to steal funds from identity theft victims’ accounts.










Between May 2022 and April 2023, Cao is accused of defrauding an unnamed Ohio-based bank where he worked and its customers by transferring their funds to accounts that were under his control, including accounts he had established in the customers’ names, all without their knowledge or authorization.
Cao allegedly diverted the stolen money from the customer accounts for his own personal use, according to the DOJ.
The agency says Cao was a “quantitative modeling analyst,” and was able to use his position to find customers who hadn’t yet enrolled in online banking services – mostly the elderly – and sign them up using their names with fake email addresses without their knowledge.
Once the customers were unwittingly enrolled in online banking, Cao allegedly used those accounts to make at least $2.1 million in unauthorized online transfers from the victims’ real accounts to the accounts he had opened in the victims’ names and to his own financial accounts.
The case was investigated by the FBI’s Cleveland Division, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Edward Brydle.

Hedge Funds Are Net Short On Bitcoin Futures Even As BTC Bulls Take Over Options Markets


								There is nothing for Bitcoin holders and traders to write much about prices in recent days. Although there was excitement after May 20, the coin has been printing discouraging lower lows, cooling off from the impressive $71,900 zone to less than $68,000 at press time. As BTC drops 7% from this week’s high, hedge funds appear to be exiting.
Hedge Funds Are Shorting Bitcoin Futures On CME: Are They Really Bearish?
According to Kaiko, a blockchain analytics platform, the latest data from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showing Commitment of Traders (COTs), reveals that hedge funds are net short across leading BTC futures products on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

This development could suggest that the “big boys” think the uptrend is over now that bulls failed to follow through this week, confirming gains of May 20.

Looking at price action, the uptrend remains, though bears risk peeling off all gains early this week. Technically, buyers have a chance only if there is a shift in tune among bulls, pushing prices ideally above $68,000 and later $70,000. From the daily chart, buyers must breach $72,000 if they have any chance of conquering bears and breaching all-time highs printed at around $74,000.
Hedge funds shorting BTC futures on CME | Source: Kaiko
While the United States CFTC COT report points to a net short position for hedge funds in Bitcoin futures on CME, Kaiko also thinks it might not be a straightforward bet on prices to tank. Instead, the blockchain analytics platform believes institutional investors engage in “basis trade.” This strategy exploits arbitrage trades, capitalizing on price differences on spot and future platforms. 

Being “net short” on CME means hedge funds are likely “long” on their basis trade. This means they are simultaneously shorting BTC futures contracts and doubling down on the spot BTC. The goal here is not only for profits but also to create a buffer, a hedge against volatile prices. 
BTC Bulls Dominate The Options Market
Still, confidence remains high based on the options data shared by Kaiko. As the month comes to a close, Kaiko notes that most Bitcoin options volume is heavily concentrated on contracts expiring on May 31 and June 28. Most of these options contracts are “calls,” that is, traders expected prices to rise before expiry.

Kaiko notes that the highest volume strike price for BTC contracts expiring on May 31 is $80,000, with a notional value of nearly $910 million. Extrapolating from this, most traders expected BTC to surge above $80,000 by the end of the month.

Blockchain Gaming Altcoin Axie Infinity Flashing Signs of Potential 194% Surge, Says Crypto Trader - Here’s Why - The Daily Hodl


								The blockchain gaming altcoin Axie Infinity (AXS) is flashing signs that it could be ready to take off on a massive surge upwards, according to a popular crypto trader.
The analyst Ali Martinez tells his 62,600 followers on the social media platform X that it looks like AXS is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on its weekly chart.










Martinez says the pattern “anticipates AXS to rise toward the neckline at $13 before a potential breakout to $22.”
Source: Ali Martinez/X
An inverse head and shoulders pattern is a technical formation with bullish implications. The right shoulder suggests that bulls are willing to accumulate the asset without waiting for the price to drop to its previous low.
With AXS trading at $7.49 at time of writing, a surge to $13 would represent an increase of more than 73%, and hitting $22 would be a boost of nearly 194%.
Martinez is less bullish on Ethereum in the short term: The trader says the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator presented a sell signal on ETH’s daily chart on Thursday, suggesting the asset could suffer a 5% correction.
Source: Ali Martinez/X
Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles.
ETH is trading at $3,828 at time of writing.

                        As major cryptos remained stuck within recent ranges as traders digest Ethereum ETF approvals and hotter-than-expected US economic data released this week, traders are turning to the on-chain markets as they hunt for the top crypto gainers today.Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading just below $69,000, up 4% this week.Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, is changing hands in the $3,700s, up over 21% this week.Both cryptos are currently trading 4-5% below earlier weekly highs.Ethereum ETF approvals are an important bullish catalyst, but macro headwinds appear to have scuppered the market’s momentum.As blue-chip cryptos struggle, traders are turning to alternative assets as they hunt volatility.And the on-chain markets are the perfect place to make quick gains or losses.Here are some top crypto gainers today on Ethereum decentralized exchanges (DEX), as per DEXScreener.Top Crypto Gainers TodayEGOD (EGOD)A new meme coin paying respects to the death of Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog that inspired the creation of Dogecoin, called EGOD (EGOD) has sprung up on Friday and is performing well.The token was last up 15,900% since its launch, as per DEXScreener.Its market cap was last around $1.1 million, with $200,000 in liquidity.Degen Smerf (SMERF)A new shitcoin called Degen Smerf (SMERF) is up 7,800% since its launch, as per DEXScreener.Its market cap was last around $300,000, with $70,000 in locked liquidity.While the token only has one issue in its smart contract, as per a Go+ Security audit, that doesn’t mean its not a scam.Traders need to remember that nearly all newly launched coins are either scams or pump-and-dumps.

Gala Games CEO Blames Internal Controls for $23 Million GALA Token Hack



                    

Gala Games’ CEO attributes a recent security breach, which led to a hacker stealing and selling $23 million worth of its GALA token, to “messed up” internal controls.



On May 20 at 7:32 pm UTC, blockchain analysts noticed that 5 billion GALA tokens, valued at $200 million at the time, were minted. The responsible wallet sold these tokens in batches.




The breach caused GALA’s price to plummet by 20%, hitting a 24-hour low of $0.038. However, the price has since rebounded slightly to $0.041, according to CoinGecko.



“We had an incident that resulted in the unauthorized SALE of 600 million […] GALA tokens and the effective BURN of 4.4 billion tokens,” stated Gala Games co-founder and CEO Eric Schiermeyer in a May 20 post on X (formerly Twitter).



“We messed up our internal controls,” he continued. 




“This shouldn’t have happened, and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again.”



Schiermeyer revealed that Gala identified the compromise and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract. 



He reassured users that the Ethereum contract “is secure” and “was never compromised.”

Gala believes it has identified the person responsible and is collaborating with the FBI, the U.S. Justice Department, and international authorities, Schiermeyer noted.



In another post, Gala Games stated that the “security incident involving the GALA token has been contained and the impacted wallet has been frozen.”



Neither Gala Games nor Schiermeyer disclosed the identity of the individual responsible for the breach or the method used to gain access to the GALA contract.



Gala Games did not respond to a request for comment on the incident.



In a related development from August, Schiermeyer and fellow co-founder Wright Thurston filed lawsuits against each other. 



Thurston accused Schiermeyer of causing Gala to “sell off and waste millions of dollars in company assets,” while Schiermeyer claimed Thurston stole $130 million worth of GALA tokens.

Shiba Inu See Spike In Net Flows Following Listing On Solana-Focused Exchange, Is This Positive? | Bitcoinist.com


								Shiba Inu (SHIB) is again gaining bullish momentum, suggesting that a significant rally might be on the horizon for the meme coin. This is thanks to recent developments that have painted a positive outlook for the crypto token. 
Shiba Inu Sees Spike In Netflows
Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Shiba Inu has seen a notable increase in net flows, which have risen to as high as 379.61 billion SHIB tokens in the last 24 hours. This indicates that a lot of whale activity is currently going on in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. 

An increase in whale activity suggests that this category of investors is accumulating the meme coin ahead of a potential price surge. Moreover, these investors are also known to trigger a rally in Shiba Inu’s price with their significant purchases. Meanwhile, the rise in SHIB’s net flows could also mean a massive demand for the meme coin among retail investors. 
Crypto trading platforms like Robinhood, which also doubles as Shiba Inu whales, are known to move huge sums of the meme coin into their platforms to meet customers’ demands. Interestingly, this recent surge in net flows follows the recent listing of the meme coin by the Solana-focused crypto exchange Backpack. 
Given Solana traders’ general interest in meme coins, it will be no surprise if Backpack has witnessed a huge demand for the Shiba Inu token on its platform, which has led it to accumulate a significant amount of SHIB tokens. 
Meanwhile, some other on-chain metrics paint a bullish picture for Shiba Inu. Data from IntoTheBlock shows a 0.32% increase in Net Network Growth, meaning more users are adopting the meme coin. The Concentration metric, which tracks whales’ positions, has also turned bullish, meaning that these investors are adding to their positions. 
Could The Market See A SHIB ETF Soon?
Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, recently discussed the possibility of a SHIB ETF while congratulating the Ethereum team on the approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. He questioned if this event could pave the way for a fund that holds the meme coin. Crypto expert Anthony Pompliano seems to believe so, as he claimed before the approval order came in that approval would mean “they are approving the entire industry.”

Interestingly, earlier this year, the Shiba Inu community had petitioned asset manager Grayscale to launch a Shiba Inu ETF. With the Spot Ethereum ETFs in the bag, the community could again pick up such enthusiasm and push Grayscale or any other asset manager to apply to launch this Shiba Inu ETF. 
This process isn’t expected to be straightforward, though. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had previously suggested that any crypto token that will have its ETF needs to be first listed for futures trading on a regulated platform like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Ethereum Classic surges 17%: A shadow rally amid ETH ETF buzz? - AMBCrypto



Ethereum Classic’s price increased by more than 3% in the last 24 hours.
ETC was awaiting its fourth halving, which is scheduled for the 31st of May.

All eyes remained on the king of altcoins as the US SEC approved exchange applications to list spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs. But Ethereum Classic [ETC] silently stole the show as it registered a promising price increase in the last few days. 
Does this mean a fresh rally for ETC? 
Ethereum Classic’s response to ETF approval
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved ETH ETFs listing on 23rd May. Since then, this has been a top topic of discussion, but ETH’s price witnessed a correction soon after.
However, Ethereum Classic reacted in a different manner. According to CoinMarketCap, ETC was up by over 17% in the last seven days. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the token’s value surged by more than 3%. 
At the time of writing, ETC was trading at $32.07 with a market capitalization of over $44.7 billion. 
Thanks to the price increase, its social volume also shot up, reflecting its popularity. Additionally, its weighted sentiment remained in the positive zone. This meant that bullish sentiment continued to be dominant in the market.

Ethereum Classic awaits halving 
All this happened while Ethereum Classic was awaiting its fourth halving, which is scheduled to happen on the 31st of May. The last ETC having happened on the 11th of May 2020. 
The event can stir up bullish sentiment and allow the token to maintain its upward trajectory over the coming days.

To see whether metrics also supported a continued bull rally, AMBCrypto analyzed Santiment’s data. We found that ETC’s trading volume surged substantially along with its price.
 This can be considered an optimistic development, as a rise in volume acts as the foundation for a bull rally. 
On top of that, its open interest also remained relatively high. This suggests that the possibility of the current price trend continuing is high.

Apart from these metrics, Ethereum Classic’s Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a sharp uptick, hinting at a further price rise. 
However, not everything looked perfect as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved southwards. Additionally, ETC’s price also touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands, which could cause trouble.

Read Ethereum Classic’s [ETC] Price Prediction 2024-25

If ETC actually turns bearish, then investors might witness the token’s price falling to $29. At that level, ETC will have an opportunity to rebound. 
A further drop in price could push the token down to $27. However, if the bull rally continues, then it is likely for ETC to first touch $34–$35 in the coming days.

Mysterious Whale Withdraws $8 Million in $PEPE Tokens Amid Memecoin Surge | Cryptoglobe


                                
A mysterious cryptocurrency whale has made a splash on the memecoin market after moving nearly $8 million worth of $PEPE from Binance, effectively withdrawing 592 billion tokens after the recent price rise.



According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, the whale likely bought the tokens as the price of PEPE surged. PEPE, it’s worth noting,  recently moved to new highs, having recently briefly surpassed the $0.000014 mark before correcting slightly. Its gains came amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally that added over $200 billion to the space’s total market capitalization.



The catalyst for the broader market surge appears to be news related to the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has abruptly requested that the exchanges that want to list and trade these funds update key filings related to these products, fueling speculation that the regulator is considering approving these products.







The surge saw an early investor in the meme-inspired cryptocurrency who put in just over $460 when it was first launched cash out, realizing a gain of nearly 740,000% after their $460 appreciated to around $3.4 million.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Looking into the wallet of the trader, data shows that the trader often invests in newly launched memecoins hoping one will take off. The investor was early on several popular memecoins, but also seemingly on several memecoins that faded away soon after being launched, according to Etherscan data.



PEPE’s upward trend has attracted the attention of some cryptocurrency analyst, with popular trader Altcoin Sherpa noting that those looking for a “big cap meme to long” should consider PEPE as it has “good liquidity, strong volume.”







DonAlt, another popular analyst, warned of a potential bubble in the memecoin market, with valuations susceptible to dramatic corrections. Citing historical data, DonAlt predicted that popular memecoins, including PEPE, could experience crashes exceeding 80%.

Dogecoin ($DOGE) Price Soars 10% as Whales Dive Back In: Meme Coin Mania Returns? | Cryptoglobe


                                
The meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin ($DOGE) has recently seen its price surge by more than 10% over the last week amid growing activity from large cryptocurrency investors, colloquially known as whales, that shows growing interest in the cryptocurrency.



According to data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, DOGE whale transactions – those exceeding $100,000 worth of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency – nearly doubled in a single 24-hour period after speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds grew.







The data also reveals a rise in the volume of DOGE moved by these whales, climbing from 9.74 billion to 17.97 billion over the same period.



Adding to the intrigue, a long-dormant Dogecoin whale holding 893,303 DOGE (around $145,101) moved their funds after a decade of inactivity at about the same time, marking the whale’s first transaction since May 2014, involving the transfer of 23,338 DOGE, worth roughly $4,000, to Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange.











            
            

            
            

            
            

        

While the whale retains the majority of its holdings (869,964 DOGE, valued at over $140,000), this movement has sparked concerns about potential price fluctuations.



Historically, the re-emergence of early cryptocurrency investors has often coincided with significant price swings. The recent transfer to Binance could be interpreted as a potential precursor to selling activity, further fueling speculation about DOGE’s future trajectory.



As Cryptoglobe reported, DOGE has formed a chart pattern that suggests the price of the cryptocurrency may surge over 23,000%, akin to a rise it experienced last year when the same pattern was formed on its chart.



The chart pattern was first spotted by popular cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, who noted on social media that on Dogecoin’s weekly chart a descending triangle has formed. The last time Dogecoin encountered this pattern, it catapulted with an almost unfathomable rally of 23,200%. This revelation has stoked speculation about whether Dogecoin could reproduce a similarly meteoric rise.

Bitcoin Money Launderer Sentenced To 6 Years Behind Bars In $6B Scam | Bitcoinist.com


								A recent report by the Financial Times reveals that a British-Chinese woman, Jian Wen, has been sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for her involvement in laundering Bitcoin (BTC) allegedly derived from a £5 billion fraud in China. 
Wen, aged 42, was convicted in March of one count of money laundering on behalf of her former boss, Yadi Zhang, a Chinese woman. The sentencing took place at London’s Southwark Crown Court on Friday.
London Mansion Raid Uncovers £3 Billion Bitcoin Stash
According to the report, in 2018, London’s Metropolitan Police conducted a raid on Wen and Zhang’s Hampstead mansion. During the raid, they seized devices containing a staggering 61,000 Bitcoin, currently valued at over £3 billion. Notably, this seizure marked one of the largest cryptocurrency hauls ever made by a law enforcement agency worldwide. 

Authorities had originally investigated Wen concerning an attempted purchase of a London mansion using Bitcoin. Prosecutors in the UK alleged that Wen’s former boss, Zhang, ran a £5 billion fraud scheme in China, resulting in stolen funds.
While Zhang’s lawyer has maintained her innocence, Wen was convicted of laundering a portion of the proceeds between 2017 and 2022 after two trials and acquittals on 10 other counts. It is important to note that Wen was not implicated in the original alleged fraud. 
However, Judge Sally-Ann Hales, KC, emphasized that Wen had full knowledge of dealing with the proceeds of crime and described the offense as “sophisticated with significant planning” involved. 
Wen, who allegedly assisted in converting Bitcoin into cash, jewelry, luxury items, and property, pleaded not guilty and consistently denied being aware that her employer’s funds were stolen.
Letter Urges UK-China Negotiations
Mark Harries KC, Wen’s lawyer, described her as a “fragile and desperate woman” who was deceived and manipulated. However, the judge disagreed with this characterization, stating that she did not consider Wen a victim. 
Wen admitted to controlling a Bitcoin wallet but claimed ignorance regarding the cryptocurrency’s source. The court heard that Wen had not seen her 16-year-old son for 26 months and has been in custody since March 2022.
Between 2017 and 2020, Wen enlisted the assistance of several intermediaries to convert the cryptocurrency into various assets. 
One such intermediary was Michael James Burke, a Dubai-based estate agent, who reportedly aided Wen in selling Bitcoin through his companies in the Seychelles and Switzerland and facilitated property purchases in Dubai. 

The Metropolitan Police is pursuing a civil recovery process to seize the total amount of confiscated funds and is collaborating with Chinese authorities on the matter.
“The Chinese side has already engaged in international law enforcement cooperation with the UK concerning this case,” stated the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in response to the Financial Times. 
The ministry added that law enforcement agencies from both countries are actively working together to pursue fugitives and recover assets. Victims of the alleged £5 billion scam in China have also submitted a letter to the foreign ministry in Beijing, urging negotiations with the UK government to reclaim the Bitcoin purchased with their money.

As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency on the market, BTC, is trading at $68,150 after falling to consolidate above the key $70,000 milestone.

Dogecoin Weighted Funding Rate Falls 50% In 24 Hours, What This Means For Price | Bitcoinist.com


								Dogecoin, like the rest of the crypto market, has seen a slow down over the last day that has greatly impacted its price. However, this slowdown isn’t completely limited to the price as the open interest-weighted funding rate of the meme con has seen a significant decline over the last day.
Dogecoin OI-Weighted Funding Rate Crashes 50%
Over the last few days, as the Dogecoin price rose, so did the OI-weighted funding rate. This is normal, given that the funding rate follows market sentiment. In times when crypto traders are very bullish, the funding rate rises as long traders have to pay short traders to keep their positions open. Then, when sentiment is skewed toward bearishness, funding rates tend to drop, and short traders pay long traders to keep their positions open.

This is important as the funding rates help exchanges to keep contract prices and their underlying asset prices balanced no matter the market conditions. These fees are charged at intervals by the exchanges, but the duration between each charge varies from exchange to exchange.
Having explained that, it tells us that the drop in the Dogecoin OI-weighted funding rate is a show of bearishness among investors. When the Dogecoin price hit $0.17 on Thursday, the OI-weighted funding rate touched 0.0243%. However, as the price has dropped back down toward $0.16, the OI-weighted funding rate has now dropped to 0.0105%, according to data from Coinglass.
Source: Coinglass
This drop is a more than 50% decline from its Thursday figures and shows how fast sentiment can turn on a cryptocurrency such as Dogecoin. However, if the Dogecoin price does begin to recover once again, then the OI-weighted open interest will rise.
Open Interest Falls Alongside DOGE
Amid the decline in the Dogecoin price, the open interest has also taken a hit as well. Its recovery to almost $1 billion on Wednesday, May 22, has been rocked by a 10% crash that has sent it back down toward $900 million once more.
The majority of this decline came in the last 24 hours, where Coinglass data shows that the Dogecoin open interest saw massive losses across all major exchanges. The largest drop in open interest came from the Kraken crypto exchange, dropping 35.94%.

This was followed by dYdX with an 18.57% drop, and Coinbase with an 11.36%. Other exchanges saw varying declines between 1.25% and 7.4%, and in total, the open interest has dropped 5.31% in the last day. The total open interest is now sitting at $907.8 million.
Dogecoin’s price is currently trending at $0.1587, with a 4.59% decline in the last 24 hours. Honorable mention of Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog behind the infamous Dogecoin logo, who recently passed away.

                        The Southwark Crown Court in London, UK, sentenced a woman to jail for money laundering bitcoin tied to a billion-dollar investment fraud.Jian Wen was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison on Friday after being found guilty of money laundering in connection with a £5 billion ($6.4 billion) fraud scheme.Woman Jailed for Laundering $6.4 Billion Bitcoin Fraud Proceeds in London Court TrialAccording to Bloomberg reports, Jian Wen, a former fast-food worker, has been sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for laundering significant amounts of Bitcoin associated with a US$5.6 billion investment fraud in China. The case saw Wen convicted of money laundering linked to approximately 150 Bitcoin for a Chinese woman between 2017 and 2022. Law enforcement authorities seized over 61,000 Bitcoin valued at over US$4 billion.During Friday’s sentencing, Judge Sally-Ann Hales remarked that the offense was sophisticated and involved substantial planning, stating, “I am in no doubt that you knew what you were dealing with.”Despite holding British and Chinese citizenship, Wen consistently denied all allegations against her and is currently appealing her conviction. She portrayed herself as a victim who merely followed instructions from a woman, insisting she was unaware of the funds’ fraudulent origins. Her lawyers further portrayed Wen Jian as another victim of the mastermind behind the fraud, labeling the individual as an “expert criminal supervillain” who exploited Wen Jian’s trustworthiness before discarding her.However, the prosecution argued that Wen was motivated by greed and financial gain, asserting she played a decisive role in managing the crypto wallet linked to the laundering scheme. Prosecutors described Wen Jian as a “front person” utilized by the fraud mastermind to convert stolen funds into bitcoin, move them out of China, and convert them back into cash. Wen Jian maintained her innocence, claiming she was simply trying to provide a better life for her son, denying three counts of money laundering, and claiming she did not know Bitcoin’s criminal origins. Despite her claims, jurors found her guilty of one count in March, while two other counts resulted in a hung jury.In March, a jury found Wen guilty of one count of money laundering after a trial that spanned nearly two months, during which thousands of pieces of evidence, including WhatsApp messages between Wen and the alleged mastermind, were presented.Wen Jian Sentenced to Six Years and Eight Months for Money Laundering in High-Profile Fraud Case
Wen, 42, experienced a dramatic transformation in her lifestyle, transitioning from living in the basement of an east London Chinese takeaway to residing in a six-bedroom mansion in a leafy suburb and indulging in luxury shopping sprees at Harrods after she began working for the now-arrested female fugitive. Judge Hales noted, “I am in no doubt that you came to enjoy the better things in life.”In a separate statement, Wen’s lawyer refuted the allegations of fraud against her, asserting that she acquired substantial holdings of Bitcoin through lawful means.Judge Sally-Ann Hales emphasized that while there was no evidence of Wen Jian’s involvement in the underlying fraud but she was aware she was dealing with criminal proceeds. She sentenced Wen Jian to six years and eight months in prison for a single count of money laundering.Recently, the EU passed a new anti-money laundering regulation (AMLR) aimed at regulating crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). This regulation empowers Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) to detect and combat money laundering and terrorist financing.The legislation package, announced on Wednesday, will impact crypto exchanges and brokers operating under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). These laws introduce “enhanced due diligence measures,” requiring obligated entities such as crypto-asset managers to report suspicious activities to FIUs.Also, a new supervisory body, AMLA, will oversee implementation. This broad AML/CFT framework applies to all financial institutions, including CASPs, and is not specific to crypto.

Lido (LDO) Takes The Lead With 13% Surge Post Ethereum ETF Approval - Key Levels To Watch


																Lido (LDO), the liquid staking protocol for the Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) blockchains, has seen a significant price spike in the last 24 hours following the long-awaited approval of spot Ethereum ETF applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday.
The protocol’s native token, LDO, has successfully regained the $2.30 level and is looking to break out of its one-month downtrend structure that has been in place since the market correction in April. 
LSD Sector Set To Soar With Ethereum ETF Approval?
As reported by our sister website, Bitcoinist, the SEC’s approval of the Ethereum ETFs was detailed in an official filing, highlighting that the proposals meet the provisions of the Exchange Act and relevant regulations governing national securities exchanges. 
The Commission has determined that proposals from notable entities such as BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark Invest/21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton fulfill the requirements to prevent fraud and manipulation, protect investors, and safeguard the public interest.

	Related Reading


Crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, commenting on the Ethereum ETF approval on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out that the new index funds approval has led to two sectors emerging as clear winners. 
One of these sectors is Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) coins, with Lido at the forefront. Lido provides staking support for the Ethereum blockchain without the need to lock tokens or maintain infrastructure, allowing participants to engage in on-chain activities such as lending and farming.
Key Levels To Watch For Lido
During the early hours of Friday, LDO reached a peak of $2.49 but has since retraced to its current trading price of $2.35. Large investors are interested in the token, as Spot On Chain data reveals that six fresh wallets/whales withdrew 4.3 million LDO ($9.59 million) from crypto exchange Binance over the past 24 hours. 
This indicates a growing interest in holding the token, as sentiment suggests a potential increase in price parallel to Ethereum once the newly approved index funds for the second-largest cryptocurrency enter the market in the coming months.
Moreover, CoinGecko data shows that Lido has experienced a trading volume of $350 million within the last 24 hours, marking a 78.60% increase compared to Thursday’s. However, the token remains 68% below its all-time high (ATH) of $7.30, achieved during the 2021 bull market.

Looking ahead, bullish investors should closely observe the next resistance level on the LDO/USD daily chart, situated at $2.55. Breaking this level is crucial for breaking the downtrend structure that has persisted over the past month, potentially leading to retests at $2.70 and $2.90.
Conversely, the $2.21 zone serves as a significant support level, as it acted as a strong barrier for Lido in the past week and a half before the breakout.

FTX Co-Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Transferred To New Detention Center, Details | Bitcoinist.com


								According to a Bloomberg report, Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of the FTX crypto exchange, has been transferred to a temporary detention center in Oklahoma, contrary to a federal judge’s request to keep him in New York to assist in his appeal. 
The move comes as Bankman-Fried navigates the aftermath of his conviction for orchestrating a significant fraud at FTX.
Sam Bankman-Fried Transferred To Oklahoma 
According to the report, Sam Bankman-Fried is currently housed at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, as stated on the Bureau of Prisons website. He spent much of last year preparing for his trial while incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. 
Judge Lewis Kaplan, who sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison, recommended on Wednesday that he remain in Brooklyn “until his appeal has been fully briefed to facilitate access to appellate counsel.”

Curiously, Sam Bankman-Fried, who had publicly announced his intention to appeal the conviction, officially objected to the decision at the end of April. 
In a post-conviction interview, he voiced concerns about the fairness of his trial and specifically targeted Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing FTX’s new owners. 
The disgraced FTX co-founder accused the firm of colluding with the prosecution and impeding his access to crucial FTX documents shared with the prosecution. 
Sam Bankman-Fried asserted that this interference had a “detrimental impact” on the trial, including media coverage and the defense’s ability to present favorable evidence.
Closer To Family While Serving Sentence? 
With the appeal now officially filed, Bankman-Fried seeks a different outcome, hoping for a reduction in his sentence. He emphasized the importance of introducing vital evidence and presenting key witnesses, which he claims his defense was denied the opportunity to do during the trial. 
Mark Botnick, a spokesman for Bankman-Fried, expressed gratitude for the court’s consideration and hoped that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) would abide by the court’s recommendation to grant Bankman-Fried access to his appellate counsel.

According to the report, Sam Bankman-Fried may eventually be transferred to a prison closer to his family in California to serve the remainder of his sentence. The Oklahoma facility, classified as a transfer center by the Bureau of Prisons, is designed to hold inmates for a limited period of four to six weeks.

Ethereum Goes to Wall Street | Bankless


1️⃣ ETH ETF Approved in a Break-Neck PivotThursday marked another historic event with the SEC approving eight spot Ethereum ETFs from institutions like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and VanEck. While these approvals signal a regulatory shift, especially after the complete 180 the agency seemed to pull, trading can't commence until the S-1 registration statements are approved, which may take weeks. While the ETFs are expected to attract billions in capital, further boosting institutional interest in crypto, it seems like the next few weeks to months may be the quiet before the storm. 2️⃣ House Passes CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act and FIT21Also on Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, blocking the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency without Congressional approval. The bill, supported by 213 Republicans and 3 Democrats, aims to align any U.S. CBDC with American privacy values and free market competitiveness — essential given the potential for these tools to significantly compromise individual rights to freedom. Meanwhile, the House also passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), empowering the CFTC alongside the SEC to regulate the digital assets market. Both bills now move to the Senate, marking significant steps in shaping America's crypto regulatory landscape.3️⃣ Jupiter’s GUM Alliance Aims to Bring Everything OnchainSolana DEX aggregator Jupiter announced its Grand Unified Markets (GUM) initiative to create a “single atomic market” on Solana. Featuring partnerships with the Solana Foundation and market makers like Wintermute and DWF Labs, the GUM Alliance intends to create liquid markets for not only crypto but also real estate, forex, stocks, and bonds on Solana. In other words, tokenize everything. 4️⃣ Farcaster Raises $150M to Grow its User BaseDecentralized social network Farcaster announced a $150M fundraising round led by Paradigm, with participation from a16z, Haun Ventures, Union Square, and more. The funds will be used to grow its user base and add developer tools. Since October, Farcaster has seen a 50x increase in network activity, boasting almost 35K unique daily users. While it struggles with some spam and bot activity, as all social media does, Farcaster's growth indicates strong demand for its network and, in turn, onchain social media.5️⃣ Genesis Winning Approval to Pay Creditors, Beating DCGLast cycle’s debauchery seems to officially have come to a close with a U.S. bankruptcy court approving Genesis's Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, allowing the return of about $3B in cash and assets to creditors. A victim of 3AC and FTX, Genesis won its case over parent company DCG, who will now eat a loss due to the judge’s ruling. Gemini, a major creditor of Genesis, will start reimbursing customers 97% of their losses from its defunct Gemini Earn program by the end of the month.via Gemini

The Big SEC Surprise | Bankless


Approval Relief. Ethereum’s spot ETF was shockingly approved and the crypto market landscape will never be the same! What happened this week in markets?With the SEC’s first final decision for an active spot ETH ETF application scheduled to occur on Thursday, market participants came into the week expecting significant volatility… Although consensus overwhelmingly held that spot ETH ETFs would be denied come this deadline, rumors that the SEC was unexpectedly communicating with issuers began circulating on Monday.The prior absence of any meaningful communication had pushed market participants to prepare for denial, but the sudden reversal caused Bloomberg’s ETF analysts to increase their odds of approval threefold to 75%!Renewed confidence in renewal sent traders scrambling to long ETH, causing the ETH/BTC ratio to surge back above the key level at 0.05 and resulting in outsized Ether strength throughout the week (or at least until ETF approval).Many crypto market participants had long clung to beliefs that BTC was a special type of digital asset and would be the only one to receive regulatory clarity as a non-security, however, indications that the ETH ETF could be approved blew a hole in this narrative and confirmed that BTC will need to compete among other digital assets for TradFi’s attention.The loss in BTC’s narrative strength can be clearly observed in the charts; Bitcoin Dominance had its worst week since the arrival of spot BTC ETFs enabled redemptions for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and led to sell pressure that drove token price under.Unfortunately, the approval of the ETH ETF marked peak strength for alts. The ETH/BTC wicked as low as 7% off its Thursday approval highs and Bitcoin was one of the market’s lone gainers on Friday as traders rotated out of assets that outperformed leading up to Ether’s ETF approval.While this week’s headlines proclaimed “ETH ETFs Approved,” there remains a minute possibility the SEC could walk back its green light, as the approvals came per “delegated authority” by SEC staff, which a commissioner can challenge within 10 days. Nevertheless, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has dismissed these concerns outright. Alternatively, traders may be wary of the potential sell pressure that can be expected from the $10B AUM Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE); its conversion into a spot ETF enables redemptions and allows the instrument to trade at par for the first time in three years.The core doctrine of laser-eyed BTC maximalists may have experienced a crushing fundamental defeat now that it appears that any digital asset – no matter how it originated – can become a non-security, but leaders of this cult are holding steadfast in their beliefs that there is still no second best.

XRP Poised for Breakout? Analyst Sees Major Move After US Crypto Bill | Cryptoglobe


                                
XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, could soon see a breakout from its current level around $0.53 after the US House of Representatives passed landmark cryptocurrency legislation and ahead of the end of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



That’s according to popular pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Dark Defender, who pointed to the landmark cryptocurrency regulation bill the US House of Representatives passed this week,  Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21).



The proposed legislation is poised to create a framework for the regulation of the cryptocurrency market in the US, including implementing consumer protections, designating the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the primary regulator for digital assets, and outlining explicit responsibilities for both the CFTC and the SEC. Furthermore, it aims to provide a more distinct classification of a cryptocurrency as either a security or a commodity.



The bill has garnered strong support from the cryptocurrency industry with the Crypto Council for Innovation, a consortium of entities and companies in the sector, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Digital Currency Group, along with 50 other organizations, writing a letter to the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson (R-La.), and the Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), advocating for the bill’s approval.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The analyst used technical analysis tools  like Fibonacci Time Zones and Elliott Wave Theory, to project a significant price increase for XRP before July, suggesting the recent bill, and the entrance of institutional investors in the space through spot exchange-traded funds could further bolster XRP.







The analyst also suggested that Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which started after the regulator sued the fintech firm and two of its executives alleging they “raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering,” could soon end.



Notably, the analyst has earlier this month suggested XRP’s price could soon explode to as much as $18 after identifying a bull flag pattern on the XRP/USD chart.



The bull flag, characterized by a sharp price increase followed by a period of consolidation, appears across multiple timeframes, including monthly, three-month, and six-month charts, the analyst noted. The consolidation period, marked by converging red and blue trendlines, forms a triangle – a technical indicator often interpreted as a precursor to a breakout.

VanEck's Spot Ether ETF Listed on DTCC, Awaiting SEC Approval Amid Speculation and Political Influence



                    

Amid growing anticipation regarding the approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, global investment manager VanEck’s ETF has been listed by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker symbol “ETHV” as of May 23.



The DTCC, an American financial market infrastructure provider, offers essential clearing, settlement, and transaction reporting services to financial market participants. 




Being listed on the DTCC is a significant step towards receiving final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Currently, VanEck’s ETF is marked as inactive on the DTCC website, meaning it cannot be processed until it secures the necessary regulatory approvals. 



Notably, VanEck is not the first to list an Ether ETF with the DTCC; Franklin Templeton’s spot ETH ETF was listed on the platform a month earlier.



The DTCC clarified that their ETF list includes both active ETFs ready for processing and inactive ones awaiting approval.

In a related development, there are reports that SEC officials have contacted Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the New York Stock Exchange to update and revise existing spot Ether ETF applications.



The apparent shift in the SEC’s stance over the past week is believed to be influenced by the White House.




Crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky observed on X that policy is influenced by politics, noting, “For months, crypto has been winning the political battle.” 



He also speculated that former President Donald Trump’s endorsement of cryptocurrency might have prompted the Biden administration to adjust its policy.




The SEC faces a crucial deadline on May 23 for its decision on VanEck’s spot Ether ETF application.



After months of speculation about a likely denial of spot ETH ETFs, the SEC recently took significant action. 



The Commission requested financial managers to amend and resubmit their 19b-4 filings for proposed spot Ether ETFs. 



Some analysts interpret this move as a positive sign, increasing the likelihood of approval from 25% to 75%.

China's Digital Asset Ban Remains Ignored With Recent Increase in Money Laundering Cases - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Despite China’s digital asset ban, recent police raids reveal significant illicit transactions involving digital assets.



Cryptocurrency demand persists in China, fueled by factors such as the desire for alternative investments and evasion of capital controls.



Traders employ sophisticated methods, including peer-to-peer platforms and overseas company setups.




According to Bloomberg, recent police raids in China targeting illicit foreign exchange transactions have exposed the ongoing use of cryptocurrencies despite China’s digital asset ban.





Persistence of Cryptocurrency Demand Despite China’s Digital Asset Ban



These actions highlight the persistent demand for cryptocurrencies in the country, driven by various factors including the desire for alternative investments and the circumvention of capital controls.



In May alone, several significant cases involving cryptocurrencies were flagged by municipal authorities and state media. These included an underground bank involved in illegal transfers amounting to 13.8 billion yuan ($1.9 billion), a gang implicated in about 2 billion yuan of unauthorized conversions, and illegal money changers with transactions exceeding 1 billion yuan. The busts spanned across Beijing, the northeastern province of Jilin, and Chengdu city in the southwest.



China’s digital asset ban was initially deployed in September 2021 due to concerns over money laundering, currency outflows, and the environmental impact of energy-intensive Bitcoin mining. Despite this, Chinese citizens continue to engage in significant volumes of underground crypto trading.




Sophisticated Evasion Tactics Enable Continued Crypto Trading in China



According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, approximately $86 billion worth of cryptocurrency flowed into China in the 12 months through June 2023. While this represents a decline from pre-ban levels, it remains substantial on a global scale.



The persistence of cryptocurrency trading in China is facilitated by various methods to evade detection. Traders use software to mask their locations and peer-to-peer platforms such as WeChat and Telegram for transactions. Some individuals set up companies abroad through intermediaries to meet institutional know-your-customer (KYC) requirements on crypto exchanges, further complicating enforcement efforts.

Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Expected to Launch in Q1 2025 - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Ethereum will launch the Pectra upgrade by Q1 2025, incorporating EOF, PeerDAS, and EIP-7702 to enhance performance and efficiency.



Pectra introduces new opcodes, improving staking efficiency and accelerating cryptographic operations.



The Ethereum Pectra upgrade will modify the deposit and withdrawal process and regulate capital requirements for validators.




Ethereum core developers are preparing to launch Pectra, the next major upgrade for the blockchain network, by the end of the first quarter of 2025.





Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Launch Targeted for Q1 2025



Ethereum Pectra upgrade aims to introduce several significant improvements and innovations, furthering the development and efficiency of Ethereum.



Pectra will encompass multiple Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including the EVM Object Format (EOF), PeerDAS, and EIP-7702. EOF, a set of about 11 EIPs, introduces an opt-in container for EVM code to enhance performance and efficiency. PeerDAS, or Peer-to-Peer Decentralized Autonomous System, will facilitate decentralized peer-to-peer interactions on the network.



EIP-7702, introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, is set to replace the older account abstraction EIP-3074, aiming to improve network functionality and performance. The upgrade may delay the implementation of Verkle Trees to a subsequent hard fork named Osaka.




Validator Adjustments and Enhanced Staking Efficiency with Pectra



Pectra’s name combines two simultaneous upgrades targeting different Ethereum layers: Prague, which updates the execution layer responsible for enforcing protocol rules, and Electra, which enhances the consensus layer to ensure block validation. This multifaceted approach underscores Ethereum’s commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.



Additionally, Ethereum Pectra upgrade will introduce new opcodes, improve staking efficiency, and accelerate cryptographic operations. It will also include EIPs related to the deposit and withdrawal process and adjust the capital requirements for validators, potentially reducing their number and increasing operational efficiency.

BitGo Lawsuit Against Galaxy Digital Allowed by Court to Continue - Coincu



	

Key Points:




The Delaware Supreme Court has reversed an earlier ruling, allowing BitGo lawsuit against Galaxy Digital to continue.



The court found the merger agreement’s language ambiguous, requiring extrinsic evidence to resolve the dispute regarding audited financial statements.




According to CoinDesk, BitGo has been granted a new opportunity to pursue legal action against Galaxy Digital over their aborted $1.2 billion merger agreement.





Delaware Supreme Court Revives BitGo Lawsuit Against Galaxy Digital



The development follows the Delaware Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a previous ruling that dismissed BitGo’s $100 million lawsuit against Galaxy Digital.



The Supreme Court’s May 22 decision shows the ambiguity in the merger agreement’s language and the need for extrinsic evidence to resolve the dispute. This ruling reverses the June 2023 decision by the Delaware Court of Chancery, which had ruled in favor of Galaxy Digital by their “clean termination right” due to BitGo’s delay in providing audited financial statements for 2021.



R. Brian Timmons, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, the law firm representing BitGo, expressed satisfaction with the Supreme Court’s decision, stating, “We believe justice prevails on appeal, and we are delighted to move forward with this case in the Chancery Court.”




BitGo Alleges Intentional Breach as Galaxy Defends Termination Decision



Initially, BitGo lawsuit appeared in August 2022, accusing Galaxy Digital of an “intentional breach” of the acquisition agreement. BitGo sought $100 million in damages, citing that Galaxy backed out of the deal due to financial difficulties amid the crypto bear market rather than any fault of BitGo’s. Conversely, Galaxy maintains that its decision to terminate the merger was justified by BitGo’s failure to provide necessary audited financial statements on time.



The merger, announced by Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz in May 2021, was called off in August 2022. The dissent centers on the interpretation of financial statements required under the agreement.



Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster initially ruled in favor of Galaxy, citing non-compliant financial documents provided by BitGo. However, the Supreme Court’s recent ruling identified the definition of financial statements as ambiguous, necessitating further examination and thus reviving BitGo lawsuit.

‘I Feel Super Confident About That’: Jack Mallers Says Bitcoin To Explode by up to 1,357% - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								The CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) wallet and payments application Strike, Jack Mallers, is predicting that the flagship crypto asset could hit a seven-figure price.
Mallers says in a new interview with Anthony Pompliano that Bitcoin could soar between 260% and 1,357% in the coming months.










“I think we’re still so early in the Bitcoin story. I’m publicly on record saying I think Bitcoin hits $250,000 to $1 million in this cycle. So now I’m speaking the next 10 to 18 months.”
Bitcoin is trading at $68,653 at time of writing.
Mallers predicts that the US government will be forced to turn on the money printers to pay the bills on its record-high $34.577 trillion debt. Mallers says that the ensuing currency debasement will provide the catalyst needed to send Bitcoin soaring to his astronomical price target.
“I think people would be willing to pay $250,000 for a Bitcoin based on the mess that I think… I mean, there’s a massive hole and there’s a loss that has to be realized. That loss is going to come through debasing the currency. Asset prices are going to go up and what is the best asset and the best-performing asset? What’s the best money in human history? And so I think that has to be accurately priced.”
The Strike CEO also says that he feels “super confident” about his big price target for BTC.
“People are too fixated on the cost of capital as far as rates. They need to be more fixated on the amount of capital which is they’re still printing dollars. It doesn’t matter that rates are at 5.5% – it’s still inflationary.
And so for those reasons… how am I supposed to predict the most fixed asset in the history of mankind against the biggest f***ed-up problem that central banks have ever had to try and solve? I mean, come on $250,000 to $1 million. I feel super confident about that.”

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) Will Explode 16,000%, As It Looks to Challenge Shiba Inu and Dogecoin



                    

Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID) could become a viral memecoin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Pepe Fuks Biden (PEPEFBID), a Solana memecoin that was launched this week, is aiming to challenge other memecoin giants, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Fuks Biden presents a similar opportunity.



Pepe Fuks Biden has a market cap below $15,000 at the moment, meaning that when it just reaches a modest market cap of $400,000-$800,000, early investors would generate returns of 2,000%-5,000% in a matter of days or hours.



The exciting memecoin is poised to rally 11,000% in the coming two days, and Pepe Fuks Biden could potentially reach a multi-million dollar market cap within a few weeks.



Currently, Pepe Fuks Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy Pepe Fuks Biden on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Fuks Biden by entering its contract address – 4D3CzRs6n4hPrHJsqon5oDVKRe8nhaiBL1mQGowzhPvg – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.




The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEFBID.

The importance of liquidity in the crypto market

On the crypto market, liquidity is a very important parameter. 
Indeed, among all the parameters, it is the one that individually can have the greatest impact on prices, in addition to individual events of systemic importance. 

The role of liquidity in financial markets
With the term “liquidità” we refer to those assets that can be traded on the market very easily and quickly. 
The most liquid instrument of all is money, also because it was created specifically to be easily exchangeable in an extremely rapid manner. 
There are also assets that are extremely difficult to sell, such as those that are locked until a certain date. 
The more an asset can be easily and quickly sold, the more it is considered liquid, therefore there are different degrees of liquidity. 
Money is the most liquid asset that exists, while for example physical gold is a bit less liquid. A property by its very nature is not very liquid, because it takes a while to sell it, while some assets can even be totally illiquid if they cannot be spent at all (such as seized funds).
On financial markets, in general, the assets that are traded are liquid, except for those that cannot be transferred because they are restricted. 
But even in financial markets, there are different degrees of liquidity. 
In particular, when we talk about financial markets with real liquidity, we mean money, and those assets that are nothing more than highly liquid different forms of money. 
In other terms, in financial markets, liquidity is simply constituted by the most liquid assets. Among these are cash, both in physical and digital form, and those very short-term investments considered equivalent to cash. 
Liquidity in the crypto market
Il mercato crypto è solamente una porzione del mercato finanziario generale. 
So what applies to traditional financial markets also applies to crypto markets, regarding liquidity. 
What changes, however, are precisely the assets that are considered liquid in the crypto market. 
Just like in traditional financial markets, in the crypto market an important part of the liquidity is made up of fiat money. 
Tuttavia, a differenza di quanto comunemente si pensa, sui mercati crypto il denaro fiat non è quello più facilmente e velocemente spostabile. 
For example, to withdraw or deposit fiat currency on exchanges, it takes from a few minutes to a few days, while with other assets the movement is easier and faster. 
Ecco così che sul mercato crypto la maggior parte della liquidità è composta da token che replicano le valute fiat, ovvero dalle cosiddette stablecoin. 
To tell the truth, there are also stablecoin not pegged to fiat currencies, such as tokenized gold, but nowadays the term stablecoin is often used as a synonym for tokenized fiat currencies. 
The majority of liquidity in the crypto markets is made up of tokenized fiat currencies, or stablecoin, with fiat money following in second place. In third place are algorithmic stablecoin, while any other forms of liquidity in the crypto markets are practically absent. 
How liquidity moves
On financial markets, the most important thing regarding liquidity is not the amount present, but the speed at which it is traded. 
For example, if a billion dollars were traded only once a day, it would have a lower impact than a million dollars traded more than ten times a day. 
The sudden movements of liquidity that shift from one asset to another are the true culprits of price volatility. 
In general, however, regarding long-term price trends, the overall liquidity variation matters a lot. For example, between 2020 and 2021, when the Fed injected more dollars into the financial markets in less than two years than there were in total in 2019, the result was a generic strong and sudden rise in all prices. 
In other terms, the increase in liquidity tends to generate inflation, because it actually triggers an increase in purchase demand. 
Therefore, in the medium-long term, the variations in overall liquidity matter a lot, while in the short term, how quickly it moves matters more. 
For example, cash money held idle in a bank account does not generate the slightest volatility in the financial markets, whereas if it is spent to purchase financial assets it can generate a price increase. 
The current crypto situation: market and liquidity
One data point that can help understand the current liquidity level of the crypto markets is the trading volumes in stablecoin. 
Among other things, it should be noted that practically every day the cryptocurrency that records the highest trading volumes is USDT, which is absolutely one of the most liquid. 
Tendenzialmente i volumi di scambio giornaliero di USDT sui mercati crypto (circa 100 miliardi di dollari) sono doppi rispetto a quello di Bitcoin e Ethereum (entrambi attorno ai 50 miliardi), e di circa 10 volte superiori a quelli della seconda maggiore stablecoin, USDT (10 miliardi). 
Sui mercati finanziari tradizionali il volume di scambio complessivo di USD è enormemente superiore, tanto che ad esempio il singolo titolo Nvidia sta facendo registrare volumi di scambi giornalieri non molto distanti da quelli di USDT sui mercati crypto, e quasi doppi rispetto a quelli di Bitcoin o di Ethereum. 
Taking instead as a reference the overall trading volumes in all cryptocurrencies, the crypto market in recent days is recording a daily trading volume exceeding 100 billion dollars, but at the beginning of May it was only 70. 
During the peak in mid-March, they had risen to 150, which is well below the all-time highs of 300 billion dollars traded, for example, on April 19, 2021. 
In other words, the liquidity circulating in the crypto markets actually varies from day to day, even if with not exaggerated variations, but it varies especially from period to period, with large jumps during the bullrun, and strong contractions during the bear-market. 
Note that these variations not only affect volatility but also prices, and it is precisely for this reason that when there is less liquidity, prices tend to be low, while when liquidity rises, it also tends to increase prices.

Airdrop season in arrivo a giugno: gli ultimi aggiornamenti crypto

In June, a myriad of crypto airdrops are expected: after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Ethereum spot ETFs, several projects have planned to launch their own governance token shortly, taking advantage of the current wave of optimism and enthusiasm.
First of all zkSync, Ethereum’s L2 zkrollup scaling solution, which according to some rumors would release its own token ZK in mid-June.
Are we officially in the airdrop season phase? All the details below.

The launch of the zkSync token $ZK could inaugurate the airdrop season in June
As mentioned, the most watched crypto project of the moment by airdrop hunters is the zk-rollup zkSync Era network, controlled by the blockchain development company Matter Labs.
As reported by the information site The Block, on Tuesday, May 21, as soon as the L2 developer saw the probabilities of the approval of the Ethereum spot ETF increase, they sped up the TGE process, trying to launch their governance token as soon as possible.
Even though the official confirmation from the zkSync team has not yet arrived, according to internal sources at The Block, it seems that the scheduled date for the airdrop is around June 13, or in any case before the Blast token airdrop scheduled for June 26.
the ticker chosen for the cryptocurrency of the project is ZK (while many expected ZKS), which has fueled quite a few controversies since the same ticker was chosen by the Polyhedra Network team, which, however, has never seen a listing on Binance.
The same ZK token, expected at most 30 days after the TGE, is already being traded in premarket on platforms like Aevo, after the reference price is around 0.60 dollars.
Considering that according to rumors, the zkSync coin will have a supply of 21 billion tokens, with a price per token of 0.60 dollars the FDV would reach 12.6 billion dollars.

It is not the first time that speculations have been fueled regarding the long-awaited airdrop of this Ethereum L2: last week, the same zkSync team hinted at a symbolic launch and airdrop by the end of June, saying that it will soon implement an update to accelerate the decentralization of its protocol.
“The imminent release of v24 is the final planned protocol upgrade necessary before handing over network governance to the community,” stated zkSync last week. “The remaining missing pieces should be in place by the end of June.”
Il lancio di ZK potrebbe inaugurare ufficialmente l’airdrop season di giugno.
With a TVL of 872 million dollars according to L2Beat and several hundred million dollars in VC funding obtained from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Dragonfly Capital, Blockchain Capital, Crypto.com Capital, Placeholder Capital, and 1kx, the zkSync airdrop could offer significant rewards to its early adopters.
Some might, however, be left out given the large participation of the farmers: in total there are over 3.4 million active addresses, 8.1 million transactions, 15 billion dollars in bridged value, and almost 3 million bridgers.
Source: https://dune.com/gm365/L2
In any case, according to some users on X, that of zkSync could be the largest airdrop of all time in terms of value given to the community, potentially even better than that of Arbitrum.
Noi del team di The Cryptonomist, have been talking about it since May 2023.
We remain waiting to receive more information directly from the project team. Probably as early as next week, the checker will arrive to check which addresses are eleggibili to claim the reward.

All the upcoming crypto airdrops: which projects can you still qualify for?
Besides zkSync, many other projects are about to launch their own crypto on the market by initiating an airdrop to their respective communities, taking advantage of the positive wave in the crypto market.
One of the most anticipated launches concerns the interoperability protocol LayerZero, which has already announced snapshot n°1 on May 1st, indicating that ZRO will soon be officially listed within the crypto markets.
Here too the large participation of airdrop hunters, of which a large portion is verosimilmente a large slice sybil, has forced the project to identify criteria that will discard a significant portion of the users of the omni chain technology.
Tuttavia, considerando i prezzi in pre-market, ci si aspetta una FDV del token ZRO almeno a 15-20 miliardi di dollari al lancio, tale da riuscire a fare arricchire diversi utenti che si sono posizionati già diversi mesi fa.

Il mercato delle criptovalute è noto per i suoi cicli di bull e bear. Durante un mercato bull, i prezzi tendono a salire rapidamente, mentre in un mercato bear, i prezzi scendono. Gli investitori devono essere preparati a navigare attraverso entrambi i tipi di mercati.
Anche il protocollo di restaking Swell is about to launch the airdrop of its namesake token SWELL, with the TGE that would be imminent according to the project’s team.
While other competitors like Etherfi and Renzo have already played their cards, with the tokens ETHFI and REZ already present on the crypto exchanges, Swell has waited for the most opportune moment to introduce its asset on the crypto exchanges.
With a recent tweet, the protocol announced that it has increased the allocation planned for the airdrop from 7% to 8%, aiming to increase public engagement during a moment of euphoria for the entire EVM sector.
The SWELL coin has been tradable in pre-market for about a month, and an FDV of approximately 1.34 billion dollars is hypothesized at launch. The “pearls” points should be valued at around 0.5 dollars.

Worth noting is also what was revealed this week by Taiko, a based-rollup sequenced by Ethereum, which announced the arrival of its own token TKO with the launch of the airdrop checker. 
Eligible users have until May 29 to check their eligibility and 30 days to execute the claim once it is open to the public.
Click on this link to check the eligibility of your addresses.
TKO is already trading in pre-market at a price of about 2 dollars, bringing the FDV valuation around 2 billion dollars.
In this case, some users reported a positive allocation for the airdrop of Taiko, with rewards worth at least 1500 dollars while others reported poor allocations compared to the time and fees spent to grow the project.

Il mercato delle criptovalute è noto per i suoi cicli di bull e bear. Durante un mercato bull, i prezzi tendono a salire rapidamente, mentre in un mercato bear, i prezzi scendono.
There are then a wide range of secondary projects that could take advantage of the positive momentum of the airdrop season by launching their own cryptographic coins.
Among these, the most likely for an airdrop in June are: DeBridge, Debank, BItget Wallet, Syncswap, Blast, Orbiter, and others.
Instead, the next big projects on which it is still possible to take actions to qualify for the airdrop are Linea and Scroll, both l2 of Ethereum that could launch a token by the end of the year.

The power of Quantum Computing


One of the exponential technologies that is not yet getting its fair share of love from the general public and media is Quantum computing. In the past few years, I had the privilege of spending time discussing it with people from CERN and the Fermi Lab, but my conversation with Scott Crowder, Vice President IBM Quantum Adoption and Business Development, had the right mix of theory and real-life examples, which will make anyone understand the potential of this field of research and its business applications. AI will keep its hype for a good while, as we see from its pervasive presence in every corner of the internet. Quantum can be the next big thing. This is our dialogue. 
Who are you and what do you do for a living?
My name is Scott Crowder, and I run IBM’s Quantum efforts to boost its adoption, together with our partners and industry clients. Our goal is to build a useful Quantum computing infrastructure and to help the world make a Quantum-safe transition, in the next ten years or so. I am an engineer by training and had worked on semi-conductors in the past, before taking on the role of CTO for IBM Systems. With Quantum, it’s the first time where we have a ‘use first’ attitude, where we try things with partners, we teach and learn with our clients, before we scale-up projects. It’s interesting and it’s fun.  
What are the three ‘killer’ use cases for Quantum, for what we know now?
Firstly, simulating nature, like materials’ science – new materials, or chemistry, for example better battery chemistry, to mention something that is very ‘hot’ right now. We do physics simulations or try to understand how complex proteins would behave. These are operations that entail higher computing power than what we could do with today’s computers. 
Secondly, we try to find patterns out of complex data. For example, a classification of a piece of data as fraud or not. If there is some structure in the data before us, Quantum computing is much better than classical computers to give meaning to it and even pick up things like false positives. This is extremely useful, if we want to make sense of the world.  
Lastly, I would say, portfolio optimization, finding efficiencies, and distribution optimization. There are direct and huge applications here, for multiple industries. Think of the mobility or logistics markets, for example. This third use case is slightly farther out from us, in terms of time to market, when compared to the first two. 
Where are we really, when it comes to Quantum adoption in the real world?
To simplify it: Quantum is better at doing what it does best, namely simulations. For sure, to do it at scale, larger systems are needed. So, we are looking at 2030 and beyond. What we are doing now is, let’s say, algorithmic explorations. We work with a mix of partners: heavy industry conglomerates, banking, pharma, transportation, and startups. And, obviously, universities and research institutions. 
Big Tech is also into Quantum, even though the talk of the town is AI. Intel, Microsoft, Google, AWS: all have investments and programs in Quantum, with different approaches to it.
What is the future business model of Quantum? How are you going to sell it?
It’s hard to say right now. We must make some assumptions. It’s probably going to continue to be, in the medium term, a cloud service, where partners have access to the Quantum capabilities we have built, via API calls, and they can interact with our experts, who help with the prototyping and the training. Basically, it’s going to be the same as a standard cloud business model. There will be ad hoc projects for sure, where the stakes are high, and we can unlock tremendous economic value. In a way, the approach is more like how we weave CPUs and GPUs into a compute fabric, and not via a single application per se, like a Chat GPT for Quantum. 
What would you say is the number one risk associated with Quantum?
Cybersecurity is for sure the number one risk. Future, more powerful Quantum computers will crack at some point the current asymmetric cryptography, which protects public and private information, for example (mobile data, payments, medical records, etc…). The math for that already exists. There are Quantum-safe cryptography solutions, but a full ecosystem of security providers and coding will need to change, to account for the Quantum shift, and to make sure we have a Quantum safe era.
Where can we find you and learn more about Quantum?
A simple search for anything related to IBM Quantum will do. I am also active on social media, like LinkedIn. IBM writes a lot of articles on Quantum. We need to talk about it publicly, and have people understand this is real, and it has great potential to bring tremendous value to society and business, across all industries. You may think this is science fiction, as it’s going to hit us in our next decade, but it is a new way of approaching complex problems. It could help other applications and use cases, as well, like AI, and this is why it’s the right moment to talk Quantum.

NFT fest + TECH fest + WUF: 3 festivals in a single weekend on art and new technologies in Lugano in the Canton Ticino (Switzerland)


This year Lugano triples the offer of festivals linked to new technologies. After the experiences of past years, the time had come to provide some vertical content for the different communities and the different interests linked to the world of digital avant-garde.
On 14 and 15 June 2024 in Lugano there will be:
NFT fest: dedicated to Web3 communities, and to fans of NFTs in all its multifaceted forms;
TECH fest: focused on the world of start-ups, investors and the latest technological innovations;
WUF: acronym for “We Understand the Future”, a vertical format on new art forms linked to the latest technologies.
All of which forms the Lugano Digital Weekend, which will spread across the entire city and the Canton Ticino.
Thanks to the collaboration between FFS and Lugano Living Lab (the city’s digital laboratory), entry tickets to events will also be valid as transport tickets on public transport within the entire Arcobaleno fare community for the duration of their validity. Tickets can be booked at www.nft-fest.com. Participants will thus have the opportunity to easily reach Lugano from all over Ticino using the public transport network for FREE.
The epicenter of the various festivals will be the town hall and its Piazza della Riforma (main city square). Inside the courtyard of the municipal building there will be keynotes and podcasts from industry representatives and major influencers. And like last year, it will also be an opportunity to discuss and “clash” on the various sensitive and important, and sometimes divisive, topics that concern technological innovation.
Above all, there will be space for innovations and the city will anticipate some strategic activities undertaken to facilitate the re-location of technological start-ups in the area.
Dozens of side-events in those days, in a city that stands out for its vibrant activity in the month of June. At the gates of summer, on the lake, with a Mediterranean climate, schools just finished and lots of people around the city.
Michele Foletti, mayor of Lugano declares:

“The courage demonstrated several times by the city of Lugano inspires new initiatives on technological innovation and artistic avant-garde in the digital world. We are proud to involve more and more people in our territory, which today is talked about in the world”.

Roberto Gorini, organizer of NFT fest and TECH fest reiterates that:

“Lugano demonstrates once again that it firmly believes in new technologies, and in the ecosystem that this industry brings. In fact, we remember that Lugano was the first city in the world to equip itself with its own cryptocurrency for payments, its own wallet, its own confederated and institutional blockchain, several incubators for startups and various training courses dedicated to companies, individuals and to the world of business”.

LayerZero Sybil Bounty Reopened On May 28 With Deposit Requirement For Report - Coincu



	

Key Points:




LayerZero Labs introduces deposit requirements for LayerZero Sybil Bounty submissions.



The process will prioritize GitHub reports and bound addresses.



LayerZero aims to fight Sybil activity with over 3,000 bounty reports received following the latest airdrop phase.




LayerZero Labs, the entity behind LayerZero, a blockchain interoperability protocol, has announced plans to reopen submissions for the LayerZero Sybil Bounty, introducing a deposit requirement. The mechanism aims to ensure the integrity of submissions and deter fraud activity.





LayerZero Labs Implements Deposit Requirement for LayerZero Sybil Bounty Submissions



Effective immediately, all LayerZero Sybil Bounty hunters must deposit 0.5 ETH from their reward address to a specified account to be considered eligible for submitting reports. The deposit will be refunded after the Token Generation Event (TGE) if the report is considered honest and successful. However, failure to adhere to submission guidelines, including any form of fraud or plagiarism, will result in forfeiture of the deposit.



The deposit process opens on May 25th at 2:00 UTC, with submission reopening on May 28th at 00:00 UTC for a 48-hour window on Commonwealth. Submissions close on May 30th at 00:00 UTC. 



LayerZero’s Battle Against Sybil Activity



Priority will be given to LayerZero Sybil Bounty reports submitted on GitHub and bound addresses, with new reports evaluated on a “first-come, first-serve basis.” Successful reporters stand to receive a 10% bonus at TGE.




LayerZero Labs is taking proactive steps to combat Sybil activity, a practice where users manipulate multiple wallets to exploit airdrop rewards unfairly. Following the latest phase of LayerZero’s airdrop, which targets Sybils who failed to self-report, CEO Bryan Pellegrino revealed the receipt of over 3,000 bounty reports and 30,000 appeals. Additionally, some users resorted to reporting accusers’ accounts on GitHub to eliminate competition.

Marathon Digital Exploring Opportunities With Kenya Minis...


                                Marathon Digital Tie-Up with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum                                Marathon Digital is a Bitcoin mining company that has recently entered into a partnership with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum (MOEP). This collaboration is expected to profoundly transform the Kenyan renewable energy industry with Marathon Digital’s assistance for the development of energy solutions and strategies.What's the News?Marathon Digital has struck a deal with the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum of Kenya to enhance the nation’s renewable power endeavors. The cooperation will be based on sharing technical expertise, policies, investments, and building of the necessary energy assets. This is considered the major strategic move for Marathon Digital as it opens up a clear roadmap of how the company can expand and invest in opportunities in Kenya. Fred Thiel, the Marathon Digital CEO mentioned that this partnership indicates the innovative approach taken in Kenya to improve the utilization of energy and the enhancement of technological systems.Kenya’s Renewable Energy PracticesCurrently, Kenya is among the leading countries in the utilization of renewable energy sources, as more than 80% of electricity is produced using renewables, as noted by the ITA. The renewable energy sources in the country include wind, solar, hydropower, and geothermal, and out of all these the largest source is geothermal. Kenya has been identified as one of the cheapest producers of geothermal power in the world, and it is endowed with excellent solar resources.Why Kenya Banned WorldcoinAlthough Kenya is among the African countries with progressive policies on renewable energy, the government has not yet been very receptive to digital currencies and blockchain solutions. In September 2023, the Kenyan authorities decided to ban the activities of Worldcoin for one year. Worldcoin is a cryptocurrency project that aims to create a digital asset company that desires to ensure fairness without any fraud. This ban on Worldcoin by Kenya’s Ministry stemmed from the opinions of different governmental bodies and authorities due to privacy, transparency, and security issues connected with the collection of biometric data by Worldcoin. The government insisted that Worldcoin had to seek authorization from the Capital Markets Authority of Kenya and conduct a DPIA and a state-led data security workshop before it could resume operations in the country.ConclusionWhat CoinGabbar has piled up with this finding is that the Marathon Digital has signed a deal with Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, marking a new chapter in the relationship between renewable energy and digital technology. Although Kenya is one of the leading countries in the generation of renewable energy, this new partnership demonstrates Kenya’s interest in innovative methods in energy management as well as in technology. Nevertheless, the critical attitude towards digital assets, such as the temporary ban on Worldcoin proves that the government prioritizes the citizens’ privacy and security. This ensures that Kenya encourages new technologies but citizens’ data and privacy are protected.Also Read: Elon Musk Revealing Dangers Of Politically Correct AI

Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Equal March Record as BTC Price Heads for $69K


																Spot Bitcoin ETFs had some hard times at the end of April and especially on May 1, but the trend has changed now with 10 consecutive days of positive flows.
This comes as BTC’s price went on a rollercoaster propelled by the news surrounding the Ethereum ETFs, but the asset now heads toward $69,000.
The cryptocurrency industry saw a massive milestone in January when the US Securities and Exchange Commission finally greenlighted nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs after a decade of rejecting or delaying every application.
The effects were immediate as these products started attracting billions of dollars in the first few months. Then came April, though, when the trend changed, and there were numerous days in the red.
May 1 was the most painful in terms of outflows, as the total amount withdrawn on that date was north of $560 million.
The tides turned once again in the following weeks, especially after the favorable data from the US CPI numbers for April. In fact, May 10 was the last date when the largest ETFs saw negative numbers.
The financial products have been on an impressive streak since then, equalling the 10 consecutive day record from March of inflows. May 15 and 21 saw inflows of more than $300 million, while May 24’s numbers exceeded $250 million.
BlackRock’s IBIT leads the pack once again in terms of inflows and has attracted over $16,350 billion. Grayscale is still the leader with $20 billion, according to SoSovalue, but the outflows there suggest that BlackRock will surpass it in the near future.
Overall, the total inflows in all ETFs are close to $13.7 billion. Meanwhile, Ethereum fans also saw some positive developments this week as the US SEC greenlighted eight spot ETH ETFs. However, it’s still uncertain when they will launch.
BTC responded with lots of volatility to the Ethereum news, skyrocketing from $67,000 to $72,000 before dumping to under $66,000 this week. The past 24 hours have been more positive, perhaps driven by the impressive inflows, and BTC now stands close to $69,000.

Bitcoin Purchased By ETFs Surpass 12,000 Mark This Week With Optimism - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Spot market Bitcoin ETFs attracted over $1.68 billion in inflows over ten days, with $252 million on May 24 alone.



Currently, the total amount of Bitcoin purchased by ETFs constitutes 4.36% of the total Bitcoin supply.



The SEC’s approval of ETFs coincides with a surge in speculation and the establishment of new venture capital and hedge funds.




New HODL15Capital data has revealed a significant surge in spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), reporting ten consecutive days of inflows totaling over $1.68 billion.

Bitcoin Purchased By ETFs Hit Impressive Milestone This Week



On May 24 alone, the total net inflow reached $252 million, marking a consistent upward trend over the past week. Notable contributors to this influx include BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, with an inflow of $182 million, and Fidelity’s FBTC ETF, with $43.7083 million. Combined, Bitcoin purchased by ETFs on May 24, reaching 3,654, and over 12,000 throughout the week.



These ETFs offer investors exposure to Bitcoin, allowing them to tap into the crypto asset’s market potential without directly purchasing it. Currently, Bitcoin purchased by ETFs constitutes 4.36% of the total Bitcoin supply, valued at $59.07 billion, as shown by SoSo Value.




SEC Approves Ethereum ETFs Amid Growing Investor Interest



Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a widening acceptance of cryptocurrency investment vehicles. Following the success of Bitcoin ETFs, the market has witnessed a surge in speculation, with new funds emerging at an accelerated pace.



The cryptocurrency investment landscape witnessed a significant surge in activity, with 25 new venture capital and hedge funds established, according to Crypto Fund Research. This marks the highest number of fund launches since the second quarter of 2021, highlighting a growing interest in digital assets among investors.



Comparatively, the number of newly established funds has doubled from those closed during the same period, indicating a bullish sentiment prevailing in the market. Moreover, the figure represents nearly three times the number of funds introduced in the first quarter of 2023.

Santiment Announced: This Altcoin Diverged Positively from Others - "For Every Transaction at a Loss, There Are 11 Transactions in Profit" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment, in its latest analysis, found that one altcoin differs quite positively compared to others.
According to the analysis company's report, Chainlink (LINK) showed a much higher performance than the rise of other cryptocurrencies and exceeded the $ 17.50 level for the first time in 6 weeks.


According to analysts, onchain data showed that for every 1 LINK transaction made at a loss, 11 LINK transactions made at a profit were detected. Santiment reported that this rate is the highest rate since December 8, 2022.
LINK, the world's 14th largest cryptocurrency, has been well-received by the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the SEC. The price of the altcoin increased by nearly 8% in the last week. At the time of writing this article, the price of the altcoin is trading at $17.36.






However, LINK price is still far from its all-time high price level. During the big bull of 2021, the LINK price briefly climbed to $52.88. This shows that the current price is 67% lower than the all-time high price level.
In terms of market value, LINK is approximately 50% lower than the ATH level in 2021.

Cat-Themed v. Dog-Themed Meme Coins: ChatGPT Analyzes Which Will Perform Better in 2024


																TL;DR

Dog-themed meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) dominate due to strong communities and endorsements, while cat-themed ones like Popcat (POPCAT) are gaining interest but remain less popular.
Pepe (PEPE) has recently surged and could also become a top meme coin this year with continued community support and strategic developments, though investors should be cautious due to market volatility.


What Are the Expectations?
The meme coin realm has made great strides in the past several months, with its total market capitalization surpassing the $60 billion mark. Dog-themed sector leaders such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and many others have charted substantial price increases, capturing the attention of industry participants.
However, recently emerged cat-themed meme coins, including Popcat (POPCAT), Cat in a Dogs World (MEW), and Mog Coin (MOG), have also made the headlines thanks to their rising value and increased investor interest. As such, we decided to ask ChatGPT which niche will perform better in the remaining months of 2024.
The AI-powered chatbot stated that such a prediction is “highly speculative” due to the asset class’s infamous volatility. It also claimed that meme coins thrive on community enthusiasm and social media trends, suggesting that the popularity of cat-themed versus dog-themed coins can shift rapidly based on viral trends and influencer endorsements.
Other essential factors that can tip the scales are technological developments, regulatory environment, strategic partnerships, and marketing efforts.




ChatGPT noted that dog-themed meme coins, such as DOGE and SHIB, currently have the edge due to their well-established communities, substantial market caps, and support from popular figures. A recent study estimated that Shiba Inu has the strongest community base in the cohort, followed by Dogecoin. 
For its part, DOGE is the favorite cryptocurrency of Tesla’s CEO – Elon Musk. The billionaire often praises its merits, while the EV giant officially integrated it as a payment option on its website recently.
Cat-themed memes are less popular, but according to ChatGPT, they can benefit from specific marketing moves:
“A viral trend or major endorsement could propel a cat-themed coin to prominence, especially if it taps into a currently underserved niche. Strong marketing campaigns and community engagement could help a cat-themed coin gain ground on its dog-themed counterparts.”
Currently, the gap in terms of market capitalization between the top cat-themed meme coin POPCAT and the leading dog-themed DOGE is over $22 billion. However, the ever-evolving meme coin sector is capable of offering surprises, so it will be interesting to follow what will happen in the following months.
Meanwhile, if you are about to enter the ecosystem as an investor, please check our dedicated video to protect yourself from some common mistakes:
VIDEO
How About Another Scenario?
One meme coin that has been crypto’s rock star in the past few days due to reaching a new all-time high price is the frog-themed Pepe (PEPE). As such, we conducted a separate ChatGPT query asking about its chances of emerging as the sector’s leader before the end of 2024.
The chatbot noted PEPE’s recent strong market momentum, claiming that “sustained community support and engagement” are crucial for reaching the top. 
Additionally, ChatGPT estimated that the asset’s price and market capitalization could take off if the team behind the project implements technological advancements or developments that add utility and thus attract more investors. 
“If PEPE continues to capture the interest of the crypto community, it could indeed rise to the top of the meme coin rankings. However, given the speculative nature of meme coins, investors should approach with caution and stay informed about market developments,” the chatbot concluded.

Whales, defined as owners of Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC (excluding mining firms and crypto exchanges), tend to buy Bitcoin more aggressively during bull markets and reduce their buying activity during bear markets.Throughout March, whales had increased their BTC holdings by over 9.8%. Although their accumulation rate slowed in April to 4.2% by May 1, coinciding with Bitcoin’s price decline of over 20% to under $57,000, the metric has now rebounded to 5.5% as of May 22.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju previously noted that whales had acquired 47,000 BTC during the sharp market dip in early May, further indicating their confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects.The amount of money invested by whales in Bitcoin has significantly grown from $57 billion to $122 billion since the beginning of the year, as observed through the “realized cap” metric, which considers the total value of all whale-held coins based on their purchase time rather than the current market value.Bitcoin’s price has recently risen to $68,760, marking a 3% increase over the week and reflecting the renewed optimism in the market.Lead Glassnode analyst James Check emphasized that the Bitcoin network’s total realized cap has reached a record high of $578 billion, underscoring the robust fundamentals of the cryptocurrency.However, Check believes that the market is still far from entering the true euphoria phase of the bull market, suggesting that the current sentiment falls somewhere between enthusiasm and excitement.Institutional Investors Increase Crypto Exposure
Nearly 40% of institutional investors had some exposure to crypto assets in 2023, a notable rise from the 31% recorded in 2021.According to a recent survey, a third of respondents reported having at least 10% of their portfolio allocated to crypto assets, compared to only a fifth of respondents two years ago.As reported, Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x Research, previously predicted that a breakthrough above $67,500 could potentially lead to new all-time highs. Currently, BTC is trading at $68,700, less than $5,000 away from reaching a new all-time high in U.S. dollars.Aside from 10x Research, some other analysts have also turned bullish on Bitcoin following weeks-long consolidation.Leading trading firm QCP Capital has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s price momentum, forecasting a potential return to the highs of $74,000.

Warren Buffett Disciple Pabrai Retains His Mentor's Stance On Bitcoin Despite Rally: 'Going To End Badly' - Benzinga

This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.Amid the volatile waves of the cryptocurrency market, Mohnish Pabrai, an investment fund manager often likened to Warren Buffett, has cast a shadow of doubt over the future of Bitcoin.What Happened: Pabrai, in a recent appearance on the My First Million podcast, shared his critical perspective on Bitcoin, hinting at a bleak future for the digital currency. He admitted that Bitcoin BTC/USD is beyond his expertise and bluntly stated, “If you put a gun to my head, I would say it’s going to end badly.” His skepticism is rooted in the absence of intrinsic value in Bitcoin, which he believes is essential for investment.Drawing a parallel between Bitcoin and the US dollar, “The Dhando Investor” author pointed out that despite the dollar’s lack of intrinsic value, it is underpinned by “the full faith and credit of the US government,” bolstered by the trust of the American people. This kind of support, he argues, is starkly missing for Bitcoin.If you’d like to stay ahead of the curve on the Indian market, sign up for our Ring The Bell newsletter by clicking here.Pabrai also cautioned that most individuals should steer clear of investing in Bitcoin, as many are unable to justify its value or foresee its future trajectory. His views mirror the approach of many value investors who question the cryptocurrency’s foundational support and its prospects for longevity.Why It Matters: Pabrai’s apprehension towards Bitcoin resonates with the sentiments of other prominent figures in the investment world. Charlie Munger and Buffett, two of the most respected investors globally, have also expressed their disdain for Bitcoin, albeit for different reasons. Buffett once famously referred to Bitcoin as “probably rat poison squared,” underscoring his skepticism about its value.Moreover, the call for a crackdown on Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry by the JPMorgan CEO has added to the negative sentiment, although this stance was met with ridicule on social media. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies are hitting new highs with Bitcoin trading above ₹56.2 lakh and Ethereum at ₹3.16 lakh.The latest surge is coming after the U.S. markets regulator, the SEC, approved eight Ethereum spot ETFs after giving similar approval for Bitcoin offerings months prior.Image Via ShutterstockRead Next: Sundar Pichai Echoes '3 Idiots' In Chat With Varun Mayya: 'Real Success Comes From...'

Investors Pile Into Bitcoin: Spot ETFs On A Tear For 8 Straight Days


								The floodgates have opened for Bitcoin in the US, with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experiencing a record-breaking eight days of consecutive net inflows. This surge in investor appetite, totaling more than $150 million on a single day, signifies a new era for cryptocurrency accessibility and traditional market acceptance.

Ethereum Enters The Arena
The positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin ETFs extends to its Ethereum counterpart. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently requested amendments and refilings of applications for spot Ether ETFs.
This move, often seen as a precursor to approval, has sent ripples of excitement through the cryptocurrency community. Cboe BZX submitted revised forms for five spot Ether ETFs, while Nasdaq filed the amended form for BlackRock’s offering.
The potential approval of spot Ether ETFs could further fuel the digital asset market. Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, boasts a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Investor interest in gaining exposure to this rapidly evolving space is undeniable.

Bitcoin: Regulation Paves The Way, BlackRock Leads The Charge
This bullish run coincides with the recent passing of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the U.S. House of Representatives. The act aims to establish a long-awaited legal framework for the digital asset industry, empowering the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with greater oversight of crypto assets as “digital commodities.”
While the FIT21 Act marks a significant step towards crypto regulation, it’s not without its critics. Concerns surround the lack of robust consumer protection measures in the current version of the bill. However, the act’s passage signifies a willingness from lawmakers to embrace the future of finance, and further refinements are expected to address consumer safety concerns.


BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner in this gold rush, attracting a staggering $92 million in inflows. This move by the world’s largest asset manager validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class and is likely influencing other institutional investors to follow suit. Fidelity Digital Assets’ Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF is another major player, raking in $75 million, further solidifying the trend.

While Grayscale’s industry-leading Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) witnessed a minor setback with net outflows, the overall sentiment remains overwhelmingly optimistic. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively garnered a staggering $13.33 billion since their launch in January, reflecting a massive vote of confidence from investors.
Additionally, the cumulative trading volume surpasses $267 billion, highlighting a highly liquid market eager to absorb new investments.
A New Era For Digital Assets
The confluence of surging investor interest, regulatory progress, and the potential arrival of spot Ether ETFs paints a bright picture for the future of digital assets in the US.

As traditional finance embraces Bitcoin and potentially Ethereum, a new era of accessibility and legitimacy dawns for the cryptocurrency market. However, regulatory hurdles remain, and ensuring investor protection will be crucial for sustained growth. With careful navigation, the US has the potential to become a global leader in the burgeoning world of digital finance.

Senate Hopeful John Deaton Rebukes Elizabeth Warren's Crypto Policies


							

John Deaton proclaims his fight against the crypto critic Senator Elizabeth Warren.



Deaton calls it a fight against the government overreach, reflecting on his war against the SEC.



The XRP lawyer addresses himself as a pro-freedom rather than a pro-crypto candidate.




John Deaton, an XRP attorney and U.S. Senate candidate, has intensified his battle against crypto-critic Senator Elizabeth Warren. Positioning himself as a “pro-freedom candidate,” the XRP lawyer proclaimed his fight against what he terms “government overreach.”







Deaton is well-known among crypto enthusiasts as an XRP attorney who joined the community to challenge the SEC’s regulatory actions. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which seeks to classify XRP as a security, remains unresolved and has been a focal point of Deaton’s advocacy.



As an opponent of Warren, who recently reiterated her anti-crypto stance and formed the “anti-crypto army,” Deaton does not consider himself a pro-crypto candidate but rather a pro-freedom candidate. Criticizing Warren’s strong opposition to cryptocurrencies, Deaton asserted it is “anti-American.”



In his recent post on X, he drew parallels between his prolonged conflict with the SEC and his opposition to Warren. He highlighted his disagreement with both the SEC and Senator Warren over their anti-crypto measures and regulatory overreach. He stated, “It’s the most important AND most difficult fight against government overreach.”



Ahead of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, President Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump have clarified their stances on crypto. Trump announced his support for crypto and has even begun accepting crypto donations, while Biden has sworn to combat cryptocurrencies, forming an anti-crypto coalition.









Referring to the political divide between Republicans and Democrats on crypto, Deaton emphasized Warren’s significant role in exacerbating this divide. He remarked, “It’s fueled by my opponent, Elizabeth Warren, who just fuels the division.”



Recently, when Warren demanded stricter crypto regulations, including oversight of crypto and stablecoin users, Deaton criticized her, accusing her of “misleading the American people.” Deaton advocated a balanced approach to crypto regulation that fosters innovation while addressing risks.

Uniswap price jumps 20% as UNI hints at massive breakout - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Uniswap price reached highs of $10.99 on May 25, rising more than 20% in 24 hours.
UNI gained amid whale activity, Ethereum ecosystem developments and Uniswap Labs’ response to SEC’s Wells Notice.
The technical picture also hints at a breakout that could push UNI price to $15.40 and towards $2.

Uniswap price jumped more than 20% in 24 hours to trade at $10.99, its highest level since early April.
A bullish outlook suggests increased buying pressure could push UNI towards highs of $15.40 reached in March.
Uniswap price and the ETH ecosystem
UNI is the native token of the leading DEX platform, likely one of the top beta plays around the spot Ethereum ETF approval.
On Friday, Uniswap price defied marketwide consolidation, with the price of Ethereum (ETH) hovering above $3,700. As most altcoins looked to bounce off key support levels, UNI price rose more than 20% to touch a multi-week peak of $10.95.
This comes as whales increasingly withdraw UNI from exchanges. According to on-chain details shared by Lookonchain on X, one such whale withdrew $1.96 million in UNI from Binance as price rose.
Uniswap’s upside momentum has also strengthened amid the unveiling of ERC-7683. This new token standard is a collaboration between Uniswap Labs and Across Protocol and aims at streamlining cross-chain trading via a “unified framework for cross-chain intents systems.”
UNI surges after Uniswap response to SEC
Breaching the critical $10 mark also came amid a rising bullish sentiment around Uniswap’s regulatory outlook.
Earlier this week, Uniswap Labs’ reiterated its readiness to fight the SEC’s potential lawsuit following a recent Wells Notice.
According to Uniswap, the SEC is “wrong” in its assertions that the DEX platform is an unregistered securities exchange and broker-dealer. The allegation that UNI is a security is also wrong, with SEC’s theories around it “weak” Uniswap wrote in a response to the regulator.
Uniswap price chart
Uniswap’s surge in the past 24 hours sees UNI breakout of a consolidation phase that had prices capped below the $8 level.
Increased whale activity and the current projections for the ETH ecosystem favour UNI bulls.

The technical picture also supports an upside continuation. In this case, the RSI and MACD indicators on the daily chart suggest bulls are in control.
If this outlook holds, UNI price could eye the key resistance levels at $12.96 and $15.40. An important short term target lies at $2

This Week in Coins: Ethereum ETFs Get the Green Light, Dogecoin Jumps on Elon Musk Tweet - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsIt’s been a wild week for crypto, with what many see as a complete 180-degree turn from the Securities and Exchange Commission when the regulator on Thursday approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC said yes to the likes of Grayscale, VanEck, Fidelity, and BlackRock after industry observers said for months that the products would not get approved.Despite the funds now making their way to the market, the price of the coin didn't move much on the news. It still had a great week since rumors of incoming approvals dropped on Monday: ETH is now trading for $3,747, a more than 20% seven-day jump.The ETFs won't be available until applicants sort their S-1 forms out with the SEC. But the approval is a big win for the space. Soon, traditional investors will be able to buy shares that track the price of the second-biggest digital asset—and if the eventual launch of the products is anything like the Bitcoin ETF one, capital will flood the space.Bitcoin rode off the back of the ETH approval rumors on Monday and passed the $70,000 mark for the first time in more than a month.The price of the biggest digital asset has since dipped and is now at $68,757 per coin, per data from CoinGecko, a 2.8% increase over the week.Other coins and tokens have risen over the past week, with Chainlink, Avalanche, and Bitcoin Cash making gains of 4.8%, 3.1%, and 3% respectively.But Dogecoin is the best-performer out of the top assets, having jumped by 7% in one week.It's now priced at $0.1656 after Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted a picture on Twitter expressing his condolences for Kabosu, the Shiba Inu behind the Doge meme, who died Friday.Dogecoin, the original meme coin, was created as a joke by developers wanting to poke fun at the seriousness of Bitcoin. But it gained near-mainstream traction in 2021 when Elon Musk—currently the third richest person on the planet—started pumping the coin on Twitter, the platform he now owns.Its market cap has since grown and it's the ninth biggest cryptocurrency as a result.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.

Farewell, Doge: Kabosu, the Shiba Inu Behind the Iconic Meme, Dies at 18


																Kabosu, the Shiba Inu who became a global internet sensation as the face of the “Doge” meme, passed away on May 24 at the age of 18, her owner, Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato, confirmed on Instagram.
The beloved dog, known for her iconic expression and the humorous captions that accompanied her photos, captured the hearts of millions worldwide and became a symbol of the whimsical and endearing nature of internet culture. “Kabosu is at rest now,” Sato wrote in a heartfelt blog post.
Confirming the news, Dogecoin’s official X handle tweeted,
“Today Kabosu, our community’s shared friend and inspiration, peacefully passed in the arms of her person. The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable. She was a being who knew only happiness and limitless love.
Please keep her spirit and her family in your heart, and most importantly carry her with you as your story continues – we are all fortunate for hers to have touched and shaped ours.”
In 2008, Sato adopted Kabosu, naming her after the citrus fruit “kabosu” because she thought the dog had a round face resembling the fruit.
The viral meme of Kabosu led to the creation of Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2013, which began as a joke currency and is currently the world’s largest meme coin by market cap.




DOGE’s success opened the floodgates for the creation of numerous other dog-themed tokens, including Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI), which have since gained tremendous traction in the cryptocurrency industry.
In late December 2022, Kabosu was reported to be seriously ill with leukemia, though Sato later mentioned that her health had improved soon after the diagnosis.

Uniswap Shoots Past $10 On 17% Price Explosion - Here's The Trigger


																In a week marked by consolidation across the cryptocurrency market, the native token of Uniswap, UNI, has defied the trend, surging over 15%, and surpassing the $10 mark. This bullish run comes amid positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem and Uniswap’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

	Related Reading


Riding The Ethereum Wave
Beyond the legal battle, the current momentum within the Ethereum ecosystem is also propelling UNI’s price upwards. On-chain data reveals significant whale withdrawals from crypto exchanges following news of a potential spot Ethereum ETF.

This flight to safety, coupled with the overall bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, is creating a ripple effect that benefits UNI, a key player within the Ethereum DeFi landscape.
From a technical standpoint, UNI’s breakout from a monthly consolidation phase paints a promising picture. Both technical indicators and on-chain data suggest a potential 25% price increase for UNI.
Source: Lookonchain
The token’s recent surge indicates a potential bull run, with analysts eyeing a price target of $12.80 if the current momentum continues.
Adding fuel to the fire is Santiment’s Age Consumed index, which measures the movement of dormant tokens. Spikes in this index often precede price rallies, and the latest uptick by the latter part of April seems to have foreshadowed UNI’s current uptrend.
This on-chain metric reinforces the bullish outlook for UNI, suggesting that investors are awakening to its potential.
Short Sellers Get Burned As Bulls Take Charge
The recent price rally has also been accompanied by a significant rise in trading activity. Data from Coinalyze reveals over $1 million in Uniswap liquidations in the last day.
The majority of these liquidations (over $750,000) were short positions, indicating that traders betting against UNI are feeling the heat. This surge in open interest, with more traders going long on UNI, further strengthens the bullish control over the token’s price.
UNI is currently trading at $10,8. Chart: TradingView
Uniswap Takes A Stand Against The SEC
This display of defiance has instilled confidence among investors, who view it as a positive sign for Uniswap’s future. The popular decentralized exchange (DEX) recently received a Wells notice from the regulatory body, alleging that UNI is a security. However, Uniswap has vowed to challenge this claim, asserting that the SEC’s case is weak.

The SEC case against Uniswap remains unresolved, and a negative outcome could dampen investor sentiment. A broader market correction could still impact UNI’s price.

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) to Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Struggle



                    

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because WIZPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Wizard Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Wizard Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



Wizard Pepe launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Wizard Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Wizard Pepe by entering its contract address – AJM9tnhfGz9xezv1rTjspoTug3YVpcmrp3gJ9FMDEEYj – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WIZPEPE.

What is a Bitcoin Futures ETF? How Does it Work? List of 16 Top Bitcoin Futures ETF

Bitcoin Futures ETF allows investors to invest their money in leveraged Bitcoin instruments such as Futures and Options. Leverage provides them with a way to reap greater returns than the average investors. 
However, there are ample risks involved too. Risks such as capital risk, and regulatory risk pose a great challenge. Yet, with diligence, these ETFs prove a great investment.
This article explores Bitcoin Futures ETF and tries to explain their working, benefits and disadvantages. At the end, there is a list of 16 top Bitcoin Futures ETFs with a brief explanation on how they make money for their investors.
What are Bitcoin Futures?
Bitcoin Futures refers to the derivative contracts which trade with a certain amount of leverage. These contracts do not trade actual bitcoin but place a kind of bet on the future price of Bitcoin (hence the name). The bets are usually directional (bullish or bearish) and provide multifold return to the investor who has accurately predicted the price movement.
Usually a derivative contract is between two parties, one among whom assumes that the price will go higher and the other assumes the price would go lower. These parties remain anonymous to each other and meet via a crypto derivative exchange such as Binance, Coinbase or Derebit.
Futures trading has been beneficial for both institutional as well as retain traders. Institutions can take market positions (bearish or bullish) against a certain event (say elections) and protect their holdings from volatility. Whereas for retail users, it is a quick way to make a lot of money, although with a huge risk.
How Bitcoin Futures and Future ETFs Work?
Let us understand how future trading works with an example.
Suppose Bitcoin is at $60,000 and you run a Bitcoin ETF with 100k Bitcoins. Now imagine, if there is any negative news, for example, if the US Fed raises interest rates by 1%, it would definitely result in a market crash. But you won’t be able to sell all your 100k Bitcoins before the crash takes place, simply because of the fund size.
For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that Bitcoin would rise or fall just $1,000 in any case.
If you would have sold your Bitcoins at $60k, there is no surety that it would have fetched you the same price i.e.$60k, because selling such a large holding takes time. Plus, if you try to sell such a huge number of Bitcoins, it could have resulted in a market crash. Also, you would have been banned from trading in any crypto exchange.
Now here comes a person, who says that if Bitcoin falls from $60k to $59k, I will give you $1000 cash and if the reverse happens, say a rally from $60k to $61k, you will have to pay me $1000.
Now, think, why would someone enter into such an agreement with you. The reason is with Bitcoin futures, the person would have to pay a very small price($10 with a leverage of 100) as investment(margin) and gain $1000 if they are right. This contract is called a leveraged futures contract.
NOTE: Leverage is a form of trader where a person invests a small amount (margin), say $10 and is allowed to trade at a much bigger nominal value, say $100. The trader is liquidated (stopped) if their losses go above $10. This is how leverage works in its simplest form.
For more details on how leverage works, see the relevant section below.
If the institution/Bitcoin ETF fails (i.e., the market goes higher), they just lose $1000 and but their entire fund is still protected and also as price goes up by $1000, they make more gains. If they are right (market goes down) they still get $1000 from the individual trader.
On the trader’s side, they gain $1000 if the market goes up but lose $10 if the market goes down.
Why Are Bitcoin Future ETFs Popular?
Bitcoin ETFs provide a safe yet rewarding way for retailers to earn from Bitcoin derivatives.
Futures trading is greatly rewarding for individual retail traders, however, there is a catch. Retail traders often lack the sophisticated knowledge of trading strategies. For retail individual traders, this results in a loss most of the time they trade.
However, there is a better way for them to benefit. Traders and investors who want to benefit from Futures trading, but do not want to do it on their own, can take the benefit of Bitcoin Futures ETF.
Bitcoin Futures ETF are the shares of the companies that trade Bitcoin Futures with expert knowledge and years of experience. These traders have quantitative models, risk-reward ratio calculations and several times even insider knowledge that helps them secure a profit most of the times they trade. Even their losses are capped with the diligent usage of risk management strategies.



These ETFs charge a small amount of money to manage customer funds, often in the range of 0.1% to 2%.
There are several Bitcoin Futures all over the world and they have been present since October 2021.

Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and the first one to solve the double spending problem. Previously, all other cryptocurrencies could be just copied and pasted several times to create multiple yet identical copies. Bitcoin used a unique method called proof of work to make sure that a certain user could only spend their crypto once.
Futures
Futures and Options, together called derivatives, allows users to place intelligent bets on the future price of a certain asset, here Bitcoin. A future trade is composed of two traders who have different and opposing views on the price of Bitcoin at a future date, say 1 month ahead.
ETF
An Exchange Traded Fund or ETF is a share of a trust fund that trades solely in Bitcoin Futures. Whatever proceeds are obtained as a result, are shared between the subscribers of the ETF based on their percentage of ownership.
Margin
Margin is the minimum amount you have to put forward in order to trade a Future contract. For example, if you are trading a 10x Futures contract with a nominal value of $100, you would need a margin of $10.



Derivative
Futures and Options are collectively called as derivatives because they derive their value from a separate independent financial asset such as stocks, crypto or commodities. For this article, a financial asset refers to Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency.
Leverage
Leverage is the ratio of the nominal amount of your trade and the margin you put forward. In the above example of Margin, the leverage is 10x since it allows you to trade a contract that has a nominal value of 100 with a margin of $10.
Liquidation/Liquidated
Liquidation, in the scope of this article, is the act of terminating a futures contract because its losses have either exceeded the amount of margin put forward or simply because the exchange cannot settle this trade beyond a certain level. This acts as a safety mechanism and prevents a sell-off or shoot-off in a crypto’s price.
Advantages of Bitcoin Future ETFs
There are several advantages of investing in a Bitcoin Futures ETF.

Your funds are managed by seasoned experts.
The funds are easily invested and redeemed without any lock-in period.
Bitcoin futures ETFs allow investing with leverage which allows investors to reap multi-fold benefits.
ETFs are regulated by government bodies which ensure consumer protection.
The ETFs also benefit from Bitcoin fundamentals such as growing adoption and scarcity introduced due to Bitcoin halving.
Despite their high appeal, Futures Bitcoin ETFs barely hold just 12% of the market share among all Bitcoin ETFs. 

Market Share of Spot Bitcoin ETF vs Futures ETF
Disadvantages of Bitcoin Future ETFs

The risk factor is higher than spot Bitcoin ETFs due to the use of leverage trading in Bitcoin Futures.
The ETFs are not suited for all investor types, especially the risk averse investors.
A wrong time of entry would mean that you would lose a great portion of your invested money.
Crypto is still a sparsely regulated sector and there are serious regulatory risks with any investment.
Bitcoin’s price often reduced to one-fifth of its cycle high during the bear markets.

Cardano's price loss - Is it time to scoop more ADA? - AMBCrypto



Most ADA transactions ended in a loss, prompting speculation that the price might drop again
Price-DAA was below 0.50, indicating that it could be time to buy the token

Losing 5.42% of its value in the last 7 days is something that has allowed Cardano [ADA] to emerge as one of the market’s worst performers the top 20. Now, while the token might not be new to this tag, some market participants believe that it could be a good time to buy the token.
To lend further insight into this, AMBCrypto considered an in-depth on-chain analysis. At press time, ADA’s price was $0.45. Its latest bout of depreciation has affected its transactions in profit and loss on the Cardano network.
Cardano stops giving and keeps taking
According to Santiment, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions volume in profit to loss was 0.827 at press time. If this ratio is over 1, it means that there are more participants realizing gains than losses.
In this case, ADA’s trend would have been bullish. However, the reading above indicated that only 0.827 transactions ended in profits, when compared to every on-chain transaction that realized a loss.
Historically, this metric seems to correlate with the price. For instance, the ratio hit 0.722 in February. At the time, ADA’s price was $0.57. A few weeks later, the price jumped to $0.73 on the charts.
Source: Santiment
A similar scenario transpired on 13 April. At that time, the decline in the ratio triggered ADA’s bounce from $0.43 to $0.52. Considering its past performances, there is a chance Cardano might drop further.
If this is the case, the value of the cryptocurrency might drop to $0.42. However, there is a high chance that ADA might produce a 20% hike too, meaning a rise to $0.50 within a few days.
An entry level has appeared
Additionally, the price-DAA divergence is an indicator that can predict ADA’s valuation. DAA is an acronym for Daily Active Addresses, used to measure the overall level of network activity.
When combined with the price, the metric can identify potential exit and entry points. At press time, the price-DAA was -38.88%. From a trading perspective, a buy signal appears when the metric is less than 0.50.
On the other hand, a sell signal appears when the divergence is at 0.90 or above. Since the ratio was 0.388, it seemed to be a sign that it could be time to start Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) Cardano’s native token before the price pumps.
Source: Santiment
However, it is important to note that this metric alone cannot dictate where Cardano might be heading.
Assessing the same using the volume, on-chain data revealed that the metric hiked on the charts. This is an indication of more buying and selling. However, a look at the price action would suggest that there have been more sales than accumulation.

As long as this remains the case, ADA might face another decline as mentioned above. However, if the decline gets too intense, the token could rally back to its yearly peak.

China's Crypto Crackdown Failing? Billions in Illegal Transactions Exposed


							

Chinese authorities uncover billions in illicit crypto despite a nationwide ban.



Underground banks and illegal exchanges flourish as China’s crypto crackdown falters.



About $86 billion of crypto flowed into China in the 12 months through June 2023.




Recent developments in China suggest the continued use of cryptocurrencies despite an existing ban by the government. Multiple raids by the Chinese police uncovered the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit transactions totaling billions of dollars.



A Bloomberg report revealed that in May, the police in China discovered an underground bank linked to 13.8 billion yuan, or $1.9 billion worth, of illegal transfers. They uncovered a gang implicated in the unauthorized conversion of about 2 billion yuan, and multiple unlawful money exchanges involving transactions worth over 1 billion yuan.



The outcome of these discoveries suggests a significant presence of Chinese traders actively participating in the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, the police located the suspects around Beijing, the northeastern province of Jilin, and Chengdu City in the southwest, raising the possibility of a widespread practice across the entire country.



It is worth noting that it has been two years since the Chinese authorities imposed a ban on cryptocurrency transactions within the country’s borders. The government cited money laundering, currency outflows, and environmental harm from energy-intensive Bitcoin mining as the reasons behind its crypto ban.









However, there is a belief that Chinese citizens are still involved with digital assets. While many use it as an alternative investment amid falling property prices, others utilize crypto as a channel for circumventing overseas transfer limits.



In a statement, Chengyi Ong, APAC policy head at Chainalysis Inc., noted that a significant amount of crypto activity remains in China. According to Ong, this may be a result of the lack of strict enforcement of the ban. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the decentralized and peer-to-peer nature of crypto activities could be contributing factors.



As reported by Chainalysis, about $86 billion of crypto flowed into China in the 12 months through June 2023. The blockchain firm acknowledged the volume to be substantial, despite being significantly down from pre-ban levels.

This Ethereum Rival Could Skyrocket by Nearly 2x Over the Short to Medium-Term, Says Coin Bureau’s Guy Turner - The Daily Hodl


								The host of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel, Guy Turner, is expressing bullish sentiment on one Ethereum (ETH) competitor.
Turner tells the 2.47 million subscribers of the Coin Bureau channel that the layer-1 blockchain Fantom (FTM) possesses more upside potential based on technical analysis.










“The weekly chart appears to be painting a wonky head and shoulders pattern that looks eerily similar to the topping pattern FTM saw in late 2021. Notably, this pattern implies that there could be one more leg higher.”
Source: Coin Bureau/YouTube
According to Turner, Fantom could go up by approximately 98%, nearing double its current price.
“Zooming out on the weekly chart suggests that FTM could rally as high as $1.60 in the short to medium term where it will likely stall out due to resistance, also known as bag holders, from the previous bull market. After that, it’s anyone’s guess.”
Fantom is trading at $0.810 at time of writing.
On the reasons supporting his bullish thesis for Fantom, the Coin Bureau host says,
“FTM has some solid ‘pump-a-mentals,’ so to speak. It has a low price tag and a market cap that isn’t so large as to prohibit an epic pump. 
The fact that FTM’s supply has already vested to investors and the team suggests there will be minimal sell pressure from their side, particularly when you factor in the Fantom Foundation’s apparently enormous runway… 
The only thing that FTM is missing is a narrative that retail investors can understand. And more retail accessibility. Specifically, FTM is not currently listed on Coinbase though it’s possible this could change if regulations in the US change.”

US and Hong Kong Spot Crypto ETFs Diverge Post-SEC Approval


The recent development of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has significantly influenced the crypto investment environment.
Following the SEC’s preliminary approval for spot Ethereum ETFs, Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts continue to record positive inflows.
US Spot Crypto ETFs Surge Amid Renewed Optimism

SoSo Value data reveals that as of May 24, US spot Bitcoin ETFs had a total net inflow of $251.94 million. This marks ten consecutive days of inflows. On the same day, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) received inflows of $182 million and $44 million, respectively.
Meanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) received no flows on the same day. This is noteworthy considering the negative flow streak for US spot Bitcoin ETFs from late April until early May.

Indeed, the spot Ethereum ETFs have infused the crypto market with renewed optimism. BeInCrypto reported that Ethereum and some tokens in its ecosystem have shown impressive performance since Monday.
However, it is important to note that the spot Ethereum ETFs have yet to be officially launched, and SEC approval for the S-1 filings is awaiting. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, expects that the spot Ethereum ETFs will ” take a couple of weeks but could take longer” to trade in the market.

“Typically, this process takes months. Like up to 5 months in some examples, but Eric Balchunas and I think this will be at least somewhat accelerated. Bitcoin ETFs were at least 90 days. Will know more soon,” he explained.


Nonetheless, experts remain optimistic. Another ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, predicts that spot Ethereum ETFs could acquire “10% to 15% of the assets of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.”
Despite renewed interest in the US market, spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong saw a relatively muted performance. Data shows that from May 20 to May 23, Hong Kong’s spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded no flows for two consecutive days. Meanwhile, their Ethereum counterparts only recorded an inflow of 62.80 ETH on May 22.

However, a recent report mentioned that Hong Kong’s regulator is considering including staking for spot Ethereum ETFs. This is particularly interesting since potential issuers in the US have removed staking from their filings. By including staking rewards, Hong Kong’s spot Ethereum ETFs could provide a competitive edge, offering extra yield for investors.

Will Bitcoin Rise and Outshine Nvidia's AI Boom? Experts Weigh In


							

Nvidia stock soars, but doubtful of outpace Bitcoin for the next decade.



Crypto experts predict Bitcoin’s resurgence due to rising institutional interest.



Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals have set the stage for a Bitcoin bull run.




Cryptocurrency experts contend that despite NVIDIA stocks’ outperforming the Bitcoin the past decade, the feat is highly unlikely to repeat itself over the next decade. Swan CEO Cory Klippsten highlighted this in a recent X post, responding to data shared by Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.







Alden’s post illustrated that while Bitcoin’s market capitalization grew by 19,920% over the past decade, NVIDIA’s stock gained an impressive 24,840%, exceeding Bitcoin’s performance by roughly 5,000%.



TradingView’s data revealed that NVIDIA’s stock traded for less than $4 in 2014 and experienced gradual growth until 2020 before a breakout to the upside. This breakout coincided with a boom in the AI sector, leading to numerous innovations and the development of AI-related solutions.



Notably, after the 2020-’21 rally, NVIDIA’s stock price slumped in the 2022 bear market, only to rebound in Q4 of the same year. Since then, the chipmaker’s stock has surged by an impressive 905.58%. Its most notable performance occurred this month, following the release of sales and earnings figures that surpassed expectations.



Despite NVIDIA’s impressive run, analysts believe Bitcoin will surpass it in the coming years, with the flagship cryptocurrency entering a new phase that could witness an influx of institutional investors. The January approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC bolstered Bitcoin’s prospects for mainstream adoption and opened a new frontier for Bitcoin.









As anticipated, Bitcoin responded to this development by surging to a new all-time high. However, many users believe Bitcoin’s rally is only beginning and expect the fund’s influx to continue in the coming years. Analysts predict that Bitcoin’s price could reach $200,000 within the next two years, with the potential to climb even higher over the long term.



The contrasting trajectories of NVIDIA and Bitcoin highlight the intricate landscape of investment. While NVIDIA’s recent success is undeniable, Bitcoin’s potential to outpace it in the coming years, fueled by growing institutional interest and favorable regulatory shifts, underscores the allure of this evolving asset class. As both technologies continue to reshape their respective domains, investors are awaiting the next big-ticket for the next decade.

The History of Binance: A Multi Billion Dollar Crypto Empire

Despite all the legal and illegal blows that it got, no one can deny that Binance is still the largest crypto exchange in the world. Everyday millions of customers transfer billions of dollars of crypto despite all regulatory sanctions which makes us think there must be something unique about the exchange. 
In this article, we will take a look at the journey of the largest exchange that went from a nearly failed startup to the ruler of the crypto world. A company which has been through good, bad and everything in between, led by a humble and visionary leader.
So, let’s begin the journey.
Origins
Prior to founding Binance, Changpeng Zhao was an entrepreneur and a tech professional. He founded Fusion Systems in 2005 in Shanghai which built a high speed trading system for stock market brokers.
In 2013, he joined Blockchain.info as the third member of the crypto wallet’s team.
Zhao started Binance in 2017 after leaving OKCoin as its CTO. He founded the company in China. However, soon he had to move out of the country because of the Chinese ban on crypto.
Binance launched its ICO which helped it attract $15 million in coin sales. This gave birth to the BNB cryptocurrency. It was initially conceived as a cryptocurrency to pay trading fee on Binance. By mid-2024, BNB commanded over $87 billion.

Investing in ICOs, Must Read These Risk Management Strategies

The cryptocurrency now has an autoburn mechanism which helps greatly in price appreciation.
Expansion
By Jan 2018, Binance became the largest crypto exchange with over $1.3 billion in valuation.
Throughout the year, Binance opened three offices in Malta, Bermuda and Jersey.
In June 2018, Binance acquired Trust Wallet, which has been one of the most popular crypto wallets.
In May 2019, Binance revealed that it became a victim of a large-scale security breach and had lost over 7000 Bitcoins valued then at $6 million.

Don’t Miss: What Happens to Crypto if Binance Goes Bankrupt?

In September 2019, Binance launched BUSD in collaboration with Paxos, a well known developer of stablecoins. Within a few years, it rose to become the third largest stablecoin after USDT and USDC. At its peak, it commanded over $23.5 billion  in market cap (November 2022). However, it had to shut down the stablecoin as its issuer Paxos was ordered by New York authorities to shut minting in early 2023.
Mature Phase
In February 2020, Binance had a brief spat with the Malta Financial Services Authority(MFSA) over regulation. The authority issued a press release stating that despite being a Maltese company, Binance was not registered with MFSA and thereby was not under its regulatory oversight.
In October 2020, the Forbes Magazine did a story on Binance which claimed that Zhao and other Binance executives designed the corporate structure in a way that would profit from the country but would avoid compliance with US regulations.
By May 2021, there were unconfirmed reports that Binance was under legal scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service as well as by the US Department of Justice. However, it would take almost a year before US regulators finally charge Binance on paper.
In a Post-COVID World
Binance was perhaps the greatest benefactor of the COVID induced crypto bull run from 2020-2022. With lockdowns and travel restrictions all over the world, users had almost nothing to spend their money. A rising crypto trend in such times, prompted users to invest in crypto. Investments from all over the world made crypto rally faster than ever.
By the end of  2023, Binance had dominated at least 50% of the crypto market in terms of trading volumes.
Growth of Binance in 2022. Shown in Light Green
This alerted several regulators all over the world and around the same time, we saw the initial troubles of the exchange.
Controversial Stand on Russia Ukraine War
The troubles of Binance might have taken concrete shape in 2022 when after a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Binance decided not to ban Russian users from its platform. In doing so, it might have irked US authorities. However, later Binance softened their approach and donated $10 million in support of Ukraine.
In 2024, the exchange pleaded guilty to having allowed billions of dollars to flow without restriction through its exchange. It also was found guilty of having  helped users bypass the US sanctions against Russia.
The Regulatory Troubles Begin
Binance vs US SEC
On June 05, 2023, the US SEC registered a case against Binance and its 13 companies that includes Binance.com, Binance.us, BAM trading services, and the group’s co-founder Changpeng Zhao. The charges include operating unregistered exchanges, unregistered broker, dealer and clearing services, misrepresenting trader controls over Binance.us and finally the offering and sale of unregistered securities.

Binance vs US Department of Justice
The case registered against Binance by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the company and its CEO of committing a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. As per the act, it was charged with transferring money without registration. The exchange was also charged with violating US Sanctions against Russia.
Binance agreed to pay the biggest fine ever paid in corporate history. The company settled the case by the US Department of Justice after paying the latter, a sum of $4.3 billion.

Further, Changpeng Zhao, co-founder of Binance had to agree to step down as the CEO and from the Board of the US arm. 
The prosecutors had also demanded a three year sentencing. However, Zhao only received a light four month sentence due to his cooperation, clean image and clear track record.
This was possible because of several reasons. Changpeng Zhao had been a very ethical entrepreneur in his past. When the US DOJ registered the case against Binance, he had Canadian citizenship and could have easily lived a life on the run. His wealth was enough for him to sustain any lifestyle. Still, he decided to cooperate with the US DOJ and even was present physically prior to sentencing.
Another factor that greatly helped in reducing the sentencing was the letters of support that poured in the court prior to his sentencing. Several well known corporate houses, industry professionals, friends and family had vouched for Zhao being a good and ethical person. Even Zhao himself penned a letter of apology to the court, asking for forgiveness.
All of these helped him not only to clarify his own image, but also secured him a less harsh prison sentence.
Binance vs Nigeria
The case of Binance was quite unique. It was summoned by the Nigerian SEC as well as multiple agencies under the government.
It was charged by the Nigerian government to work in the country without legal registrations, facilitate illicit transactions and also engage in tax evasion.
Between late February and early March 2024, the Nigerian authorities levied a $10 billion fine on Binance for involvement in money laundering. However, the notice was soon withdrawn and the government went into denial as claims of the government strong-arming Binance surfaced. The fine was later changed to $35 million by 30th March 2024.
Further, on multiple occasions, the Nigerian house of representatives had summoned Binance executives including its CEO Richard Teng. However, the CEO did not comply with any summons yet.
Binance vs French Authorities
Binance received regulatory clearance way back in 2022. The license allowed the company to provide digital asset services in France. However, by mid-2023, the Paris prosecutor’s office had charged the exchange with money laundering in the country.
Then Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had clarified that despite unannounced inspections, the exchange fully cooperated with the French authorities.

Later the case seems to have receded into oblivion with no further updates after June 2023.
Binance and Netherlands
In 2022, Dutch authorities put a fine on Binance for operating in the country without a proper license.
However, by June 2023, due to failure to secure the correct licenses, it had to exit the country. All its users were transferred to its rival Coinmerce.
Despite everything, the exchange had said during its exit that in the future, it would reintroduce its services in the country after obtaining proper licenses and documents.
Binance in India
Binance’s troubles were unique in India. Due to the presence of strong AML laws, and the focus on increasing compliance, the exchange was initially seen as a non-complying entity. However, that soon changed with Binance’s decision to comply.
Perhaps it was the only incident where both parties, the regulator and the company, mutually understood and agreed to each other’s needs without any collateral damage.
In India, there exists a powerful but less known regulator called the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). It was established to detect money laundering, financial crimes and also provide intelligence inputs to the government of India.
The FIU asked crypto exchanges operating in India, both native and international, to register with the regulator, share transactions data with it and also comply with Indian money laundering laws. However, due to a lack of response, the regulator decided to put a shadow ban on Binance.com on 27th December 2023. The URL of Binance.com was blocked for Indian users and its mobile apps were taken down from Apple and Google stores.
Binance quickly responded that it was ready to comply with Indian laws. Soon the negotiations began and by May 10, 2024, Binance finalized its initial registrations with India along with KuCoin. Within a few days, both the companies got approval and a nod to resume their operations in India. Binance also reportedly agreed to pay a $2 million fine.

Binance in the UAE
UAE is perhaps the few countries where Binance actually had ease to do business. The vision of the UAE government to make the country a crypto hub has greatly helped Binance and several other crypto businesses.  The country has been hosting several successful crypto events lately.
In June 2023, Binance received a VASP license which acted as a MVP license in Dubai and allowed Binance to establish operations. Later, on 18th April 2024, Binance received full operational license in Dubai.
The Illegality of the Legal Troubles
It’s well known that the troubles of all crypto-native companies would have been far less if countries had crypto regulations in place. Till date only a few countries have crossed the policy stage.
When the US charged Binance, it did not even have a draft policy for crypto, let alone having a concrete set of regulations. The SEC had repeatedly tried to impose its authority to regulate crypto even when it had lost a case against Ripple. That case also made it clear that any retail sales of XRP never amounted to their classification as securities.
Similarly, the prosecution of Binance under the Nigerian laws never took any concrete stand because crypto as a whole was for tax evasion, money laundering and several other crimes. Such services were provided by several other companies including those native to the country.
Countries at Various Stages of Crypto Legislation/Regulation, Source IMF
Data by WEF shows that even as late as Jan 2024, most countries are still unable to regulate crypto in its entirety. Only a few economies such as the EU, UAE, Switzerland and Japan seem to have comprehensive regulations.
Choosing a Way Forward
Battling with authorities had always proven fatal even if someone was right. The Ripple vs SEC case dragged on for years and despite a win by Ripple (in relation to the retail sales), it had to spend a huge sum, estimated at $1.3 billion, on just legal fees. Yet, the case is far from being a complete resolution.

It won’t be an overstatement to assume that Binance decided to skip all those legal headaches and went directly into resolution. Not only was it an apt decision with respect to cost, but also it helped Binance skip all the negative media attention. Further, compliance also strengthened its position in the eye of the regulators and lawmakers.

Bitcoin Whales Buy $1.34 Billion In BTC In One Day - Is Return To $70,000 Imminent? | Bitcoinist.com


								Following rumors of a potential Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, the Bitcoin price made a run at its current all-time high of $73,737. While the momentum was not sufficient to push the premier cryptocurrency to a new record price, BTC still managed to cross the $70,000 level for the first time in over a month.
Bitcoin’s price soon experienced a correction and currently sits below $70,000 despite the SEC’s eventual approval of the ETH ETF. However, the latest on-chain revelation suggests that the BTC price might resume its upward movement sooner rather than later.
Can Whale Activity Drive BTC’s Price Recovery?
In a recent post on the X platform, popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez shared that there has been significant buying activity amongst a certain class of large investors in recent days. This on-chain revelation is based on Santiment’s Balance of Whales, which tracks the total number of coins owned by whales holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC.

According to data from Santiment, this class of large Bitcoin holders have bought more than 20,000 BTC (equivalent to a massive $1.34 billion) in the past day. This recent acquisition brings the balance of this class of whales to a whopping total of 4.96 million BTC.

The timing of this purchase is interesting, considering its occurrence after the Bitcoin price dropped back to $67,000. Notably, Martinez said in his post that these whales are “buying the dip,” a term used to describe purchasing activity after an asset experiences a fall in price. 
What’s more, this recent purchase by the whales might be a signal that the large holders and big players might know something about the BTC future price trajectory. As such, investors might want to keep an eye out for further movements, as they can lead to speculations and potential market shifts.
Moreover, whales are often perceived as key players in the crypto market, as their buying and selling activities can impact the price of digital assets. Considering its magnitude, the recent purchase might be a bullish proponent for the price of the premier cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin Price At A Glance
As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands around $68,917, reflecting a mere 1% increase in the past day. On the weekly timeframe, though, the premier cryptocurrency holds a better position and is up by 3%.

                        Bitcoin Price PredictionAs Bitcoin tumbles following the SEC’s approval of ether ETFs, market analysts are closely monitoring the next key levels. Bitcoin’s price prediction indicates a potential bullish trend, with BTC/USD currently trading at $69,042.This update explores the pivotal support and resistance levels, providing insights into the future movements of Bitcoin amidst the shifting regulatory landscape.SEC Approves Rule Change for Ether ETFs
The SEC has approved a rule change to allow the creation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in ether, one of the largest cryptocurrencies. This decision follows the recent success of bitcoin ETFs, which have seen net inflows surpassing $12 billion. The approval comes just in time, aligning with the SEC’s deadline for the VanEck Ethereum ETF decision.Companies that sponsor bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRock, Bitwise, and Galaxy Digital, are also starting the process to launch ether ETFs. However, the SEC’s rule change does not guarantee immediate launches, as it only approves the applications from exchanges to list eight different ether funds. The actual launch dates remain uncertain.Key Points:
Ether prices rose 2% following the SEC’s decision, after a 20% surge earlier in the week.
The SEC’s order approves the listing of eight ether funds but does not set launch dates.
Initial ether ETFs are expected to be smaller than bitcoin ETFs, with the Grayscale Ethereum Trust holding about $11 billion in assets.
The approval suggests a potential easing of the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies, particularly following the agency’s loss in a lawsuit against Grayscale in 2023. This legal outcome paved the way for the approval of bitcoin ETFs and now ether ETFs. Despite this progress, the SEC’s regulatory approach to crypto remains under political scrutiny.Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, underpins the Ethereum network, which facilitates decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), and asset tokenization. However, the new ether ETFs in the U.S. may exclude staking, as the SEC views staking-as-a-service offerings as unregistered securities. This exclusion could reduce the attractiveness of ether ETFs compared to bitcoin ETFs.Richard Kerr from K&L Gates highlighted that the approval does not apply to other crypto projects on the Ethereum network. Steven Lubka from Swan Bitcoin pointed out that ether ETFs might experience lower demand due to structural differences, such as the lack of staking options.The approval of ether ETFs marks a notable development in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, signifying the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial products.










Bitcoin Price Prediction

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $69,042, showing a modest increase of 0.45% signalling a bullish Bitcoin price prediction. The pivot point, marked by the green line, is at $68,514, serving as a crucial level for trend direction. Immediate resistance levels are observed at $70,029, followed by $71,458 and $73,299.
On the downside, support levels are at $66,394, $64,947, and $63,490. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 48.93, indicating neutral momentum, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $67,860, providing significant support.

Bitcoin Price Prediction

The price is bolstered by an upward trendline near the $69,000 level. The formation of a series of doji candles above this level suggests potential buying trends above $68,500.
Both the RSI and EMA support the likelihood of a continued bullish trend. Traders should watch for a break above the immediate resistance at $70,029 to confirm further upward movement.


Exciting New AI Meme Coin Wiener AI – Can It Outperform?

The fun new sausage dog-themed meme coin, Wiener AI (WAI), is more than just a novelty. It offers advanced AI-powered trading tools, adding substantial utility beyond its playful exterior.
With investors already pouring $2,880,453 into WAI’s presale, this early demand signals strong interest in the new meme coin.
In the current market, AI is a hot theme, especially after Nvidia’s impressive earnings. This trend is expected to boost demand for WAI even further.
Not only does WAI come with AI utility, but it also provides a great opportunity for earning passive income. Twenty percent of the total supply is allocated to staking rewards, offering investors a remarkable 396% APY, according to the project’s official website.
At this rate, investors can potentially double their initial presale investment in just a few months.


Crypto experts are eagerly buying into this exciting AI crypto coin. Michael Wrubel, a widely followed crypto analyst with over 312,000 YouTube subscribers, ranks WAI as a top crypto for 2024.
Interested investors need to act fast as the WAI price will increase when the presale reaches $3 million. The current price is $0.00071, giving WAI a market cap of under $50 million. If WAI achieves market leadership, early investors could see significant gains, with the potential for 100x returns or more.

Starknet Token Activity Dives as 3AC Liquidator Makes Major Binance Transfer


							

Three Arrows Capital liquidator Teneo transfers $2.63 million in STRK to Binance, retaining a significant $157 million worth.



Teneo emerges as a major player in the Starknet (STRK) token ecosystem, holding the second-largest non-team/CEX wallet.



STRK Price Up, Trading Volume Down: What’s Next for Starknet?




Hedge Fund Three Arrows Capital’s liquidator, Teneo, has reportedly transferred 2.18 million STRK tokens, valued at approximately $2.63 million, to Binance over the past three days. According to an X post by the blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain, Teneo currently retains 130 million STRK, estimated to be worth $157 million.







Chinese crypto reporter Colin Wu offered further insights into Teneo’s strategic maneuver with STRK tokens. Notably, Teneo, holding a substantial portion of 3AC’s STRK tokens, has emerged as the second-largest non-team/CEX STRK-holding wallet.







As of the latest data, the Starknet token (STRK) is trading at $1.23, reflecting a slight decrease of 2.27% over the past 24 hours. However, the token has demonstrated positive momentum over the past week and month, surging by 6.10% and 3.88%, respectively.



The token currently holds the 68th position on CoinMarketCap, boasting a market capitalization of $1,408,958,143. A significant decline of nearly 50% in its 24-hour trading volume, currently at $157,940,550, suggests decreased activity within the ecosystem.



According to a previous report released in February 2024, an address identified as “Teneo: 3AC Liquidation” holds more than $602 million in crypto assets. The report revealed that the wallet was dominated by a vast collection of 75 million WLD tokens, valued at $567 million, constituting 94% of the total assets.









Other assets in the Teneo wallet included 8.437 million DYDX, valued at around $26.91 million, 160,000 AXS, worth more than $1.3 million, and 5.75 million USDC. The report also noted that 3AC creditors are among the largest holders of Worldcoin tokens (WLD).



Moving STRK tokens to Binance piques curiosity upon Teneo’s intentions. It could be a step to liquidate the tokens to pay off creditors or it could be a strategy, in part, to maximize the value of the remaining assets.

Suspicious Transaction Ahead of Elon Musk's Dogecoin Tweet! He Bought the Other Memecoin He Mentioned, How Did He Know? - Bitcoin Sistemi


There has been an interesting development in the cryptocurrency market, this time involving Elon Musk.
A cryptocurrency user created a new wallet about 1 day ago and withdrew 661 SOL worth 116 thousand dollars to this wallet via Binance. Immediately afterwards, he used all of these to buy 1.94 million memecoins called HARAMBE.


This wallet has currently made a profit of approximately 18 thousand dollars.

Although the amount of profit generated is low, it is noteworthy that this large purchase took place very shortly before Elon Musk tweeted about HARAMBE.





As it is known, Dogecoin's mascot dog Kabosu passed away at the age of 18. After this incident, Elon Musk published a message and said that Harambe, a famous gorilla who had previously passed away, and Kabosu went to heaven.
Following the development, the price of memecoin named HARAMBE increased by approximately 30%.

Bitcoin whales show ‘strong buying force’ signaling bullish bias


    Bitcoin (BTC) is currently experiencing renewed momentum, with notable buying activity from Bitcoin whales signaling a resurgence of bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. 



Despite a minor 3% retreat over the past week, these major investors have shown a strong buying force, reflecting their confidence in Bitcoin’s future prospects.



Whales, defined as entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC and excluding those owned by mining companies and exchanges, play a crucial role in the dynamics of cryptocurrencies.







Following a period of relative inactivity, these significant players have once again started to increase their Bitcoin stakes significantly. 



As of May 22, there has been a 5.5% increase in their holdings, marking a notable contrast to the more cautious 4.2% growth observed in April. 



This shift underscores a change in strategy among whales, influenced by their perception of favorable current prices for purchasing and accumulating Bitcoin, as highlighted by market intelligence firm CryptoQuant.



Market reactions and analysts insights



The behavior of whales often serves as a bellwether for broader market trends. Crypto analyst Axel Adler used on-chain data to shed light on the momentum building within the Bitcoin market. 



His analysis, shared on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out that the price gradient oscillator, which measures how quickly the market cap grows compared to the realized cap, is approaching a critical level.



Realized cap considers the total value of all whale-held coins based on their purchase time rather than the current market value.

Surpassing a value of 3.0 with this oscillator could indicate a sustainable bullish trend, steering clear of the downturns witnessed in the 2021 cycle.



CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju emphasized the significant rise in the 30-day percentage change in whale address holdings and the overall BTC balance held by whales.



According to him, during a sharp market dip in early May, whales acquired an additional 47,000 BTC, demonstrating their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value.

The exchange whale ratio, which tracks large Bitcoin holders’ activity, increased in April and May, suggesting heightened activity from these major investors. This is unusual, as typically, whale activity decreases during sustained bullish market periods.



Analyst Willy Woo observed that over the past two months, there was significant buying of Bitcoin even though its price didn’t show a clear upward trend.



Even though this caused some panic among individual investors, the demand for Bitcoin at its current market price remained strong.



Bitcoin price analysis



The market’s response to these developments has been overwhelmingly positive, with Bitcoin prices rebounding to $69,300—an increase of about 3% over the past week. The total realized cap of the Bitcoin network has reached a record high, reflecting robust market fundamentals.



However, despite this optimism, analysts like James Check from Glassnode caution that the market has not yet entered the euphoria phase typical of bull runs, suggesting there is still room for substantial growth.

The increased activity and aggressive buying patterns of Bitcoin whales are critical indicators of broader market trends.



Their continued accumulation of Bitcoin suggests a bullish outlook for the future of cryptocurrency, potentially paving the way for new market highs.

Bitcoin Is Currently out of the ‘Danger Zone,’ According to Crypto Analyst - But There’s a Catch - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) is no longer in the “danger zone,” when there is a likelihood of a dip below its range low.
Pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital tells his 472,200 followers on the social media platform X that while the “danger zone” has passed, Bitcoin could still dip about 13% from its current value.










Based on past cycles, Bitcoin enters the “danger zone” after a halving event, when miners’ rewards are halved, and declines significantly, according to the analyst. After the “danger zone,” Bitcoin historically enters a “post-halving reaccumulation” phase when it trades sideways within a range.
“Since the Bitcoin post-halving ‘danger zone’ ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71,500. However, ~$71,500 is where the range high resistance of the macro re-accumulation range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from. The consolidation continues and history suggests it will continue for several more weeks between $60,000 and $70,000.”
Source: Rekt Capital/X
The analyst also says that based on historical precedence, Bitcoin may not break out of the range high of $70,000 until September.
“Historically, Bitcoin has always rejected from the range high on the first attempt at a breakout after the halving. Moreover, history suggests this re-accumulation should last much longer. Bitcoin tends to break out from these re-accumulation ranges only up to 160 days after the halving. That would translate to a Bitcoin breakout from the re-accumulation range only in September 2024.”

Bitcoin is trading for $69,012 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

3 cryptocurrencies to avoid trading this week


    Finbold identified three cryptocurrencies that speculators should avoid trading due to the upcoming substantial token unlocks. These unlocks have the potential to flood the market, leading to increased selling pressure and significant price fluctuations.



Experienced cryptocurrency market participants closely monitor factors like token supply and demand to optimize their trading strategies and mitigate potential losses. By taking these dynamics into account, they can make well-informed decisions that maximize profitability while effectively managing associated risks.



In particular, data from TokenUnlocksApp shows $373.11 million in potential sell-offs for the next seven days from May 25. The top 3 highest unlocks will happen on May 31 and June 1, releasing $219.67 million worth of tokens.

Avoid trading Optimism (OP)



First, investors should avoid trading Optimism (OP), the popular second layer for Ethereum (ETH), amid a potential sell-off incoming. On May 31, the protocol will unlock 31.34 million OP tokens currently worth $80.23 million.



Optimism’s unlock represents a nearly 3% supply inflation that repeats every month with slight variations, as previously reported by Finbold. Core contributors to the protocol will receive 16.54 million OP worth $42.35 million, while private investors will get $37.89 million to realize their monthly profits over retail buyers.

dYdX Protocol (DYDX)



The decentralized exchange protocol DYDX is again featured among cryptocurrencies to avoid trading due to its unlocks. Finbold reported a similar warning for April 27 and, previously, for March 31, with 33.34 million tokens unlocked – worth $70.33 million and $117.33 million, respectively.



On February 29, we also reported the unlock of the same amount, worth $130 million. The gradual loss of purchasing power evidence the nefarious effects of supply inflation on cryptocurrencies and the “avoid trading” alert.



Now, the protocol will put the same amount of DYDX in circulation on June 1, currently worth $70 million. This represents a nearly 12% monthly inflation likely to affect DYDX investors. As of this writing, the token trades at $2.10.

Sui Network (SUI)



Another cryptocurrency to avoid trading due to recurrent monthly token unlocks is Sui Network (SUI). The competing layer-1 blockchain developed by former Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) engineers will inflate its supply by 2.8% this month.



On June 1, the protocol will unlock 65.08 million SUI for private investors, the development team, and the Mysten Labs treasury. Notably, private investors will receive 39.16 million SUI for over 60% of the total $70 million worth of unlocks.

However, crypto traders will try to speculate on the economic effects these unlocks may have on price, which could bring increased volatility and worsen the potential risk-reward ratio. The market is uncertain and influenced by multiple factors, requiring proper risk management and learning when to avoid trading specific cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin attack mode: BTC set for $150k after post-halving consolidation


    After weeks of appearing to consolidate, Bitcoin (BTC) aims to establish its price above the crucial resistance level of $70,000.



Indeed, if the crypto manages to sustain the current bullish momentum, the market anticipates that it will rally to a new record high, possibly above $100,000.



Consequently, crypto trading expert TradingShot noted in a TradingView post on May 23 that Bitcoin is forecasted to enter a new rally phase following a period of consolidation post-halving. This development aligns with historical patterns in previous Bitcoin cycles, signaling a potential surge towards $150,000. 







For instance, TradingShot noted the consistent occurrence of a two-month consolidation phase before and after the halving event, a pattern observed in past Bitcoin cycles. This consolidation phase typically precedes a significant rally in Bitcoin’s price.

Moreover, the expert also reviewed the impact of technical indicators such as the Mayer Multiple Band (MMB) and the Bollinger Bands Width (BBW). TradingShot suggested that trading above the MMB of 1 Standard Deviation (SD) indicates a bullish trend, particularly after the BBW bottoms out.  A surge has historically followed this pattern in Bitcoin’s price towards the MMB 3SD level. 



Bitcoin’s next price target 



The Vortex Indicator (VI) and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) in the two-month time frame also highlight the symmetry in Bitcoin’s cycles. TradingShot’s analysis indicated that VI tops coincide with CCI’s first higher low after a bottom, suggesting a predictable pattern in Bitcoin’s price movements.




“As a result, we can expect the price to top by the week of March 17 2025 the earliest. <…> The most important part perhaps is that after each consolidation after the BBW bottom. Bitcoin’s immediate target was the MMB 3SD, which is the orange trend-line. That is currently at $125k but by the time the rally reaches it, it could be closer to $150k,” the analyst said. 




It’s worth noting that Bitcoin has exhibited bullish sentiments in the short term, with the crypto hitting the $71,000 mark on May 21. The rally coincided with a significant surge in spot buying and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) purchasing.



As things stand, the market seems to be on edge regarding the implications of the current price movement. Some believe the recent bull run has peaked, while others suggest that a new bull run consistent with the Bitcoin post-halving price movement has begun. 



Bitcoin price analysis



By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $69,103 with daily gains of almost 2.5%. On the weekly chart, BTC is up 2.67%.



Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold



Elsewhere, Bitcoin’s technical analysis is dominated by bullish sentiments. According to data retrieved from TradingView, a summary of Bitcoin’s one-day gauges indicates a ‘buy’ at 15, while moving averages are at ‘strong buy’ at 14. Oscillators, on the other hand, are ‘neutral’ at 9.

Overall, most of the market anticipates that Bitcoin will sustain its current momentum, but a continuation of the rally significantly hinges on breaching the $70,000 resistance zone.

How Sportsbetting Giants Are Embracing Cryptocurrency: Let's Examine HugeWin



                    

Recently, the sports betting scene has shifted quite a bit. The surge in cryptocurrency isn’t just a fleeting thing—it’s reshaping the iGaming industry and now making its mark on sports betting. As more cryptocurrencies gain popularity, top sports betting platforms are catching on and embracing this innovative payment method.



The current gambling scene, in general, is starting to shift towards prioritizing player safety. With even such infrastructure like multi-factor authentication, advanced encryption systems, and more put in place to safeguard players’ assets. Cryptocurrency can accomplish just that. As the most widespread decentralized finance option, cryptocurrency is the most secure payment method out there.




Why Do Cryptocurrencies Land Themselves So Well To Betting?



Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology at large has been disruptive to a variety of industries across the free market. The next on its list is sports betting. The easy adoption of such technology can be summed up to a few main features of all crypto shares.




A Focus on Player DefensesSince cryptocurrencies are built on a decentralized, encoded mechanism like blockchain, they provide one of the safest and most secure methods of payment out there. Bettors especially like to prioritize privacy. Hence, crypto lends itself perfectly to the betting scene.



Lightning-quick TransactionsTraditional banking methods just do not cut it anymore. Especially in the field of betting, where a split-second decision can spell either glorious victory or tremendous defeat. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, enable instant transactions, making deposits and withdrawals swift and hassle-free.



Miniscule Transaction Fees & Universal AvailabilityAnother aspect in which traditional banking straight up loses to cryptocurrency. When it comes to transaction fees, cryptocurrencies have a major advantage over traditional methods—they’re significantly lower. Plus, unlike traditional payment methods, cryptocurrencies aren’t bound by territorial limits. This means that even in regions with strict gambling regulations, bettors can still participate in sports betting activities hassle-free.




Hugewin – a Major Player Embracing the Change

Hugewin provides betting options for anything like football and basketball (including major league games). For fans of popular games like Zeppelin, Aviator, and Spaceman, Hugewin has you covered as well.



Polishing Up The Experience



Cryptocurrency adoption isn’t merely an alternative payment option. In Hugewin’s case, it specifically enhances the overall user experience. Lightning speed transaction fees, lowest fees of any financial option, and unparalleled security – all of these features provided by cryptocurrencies make the sports betting experience on the website seamless and incredibly responsive.



While crypto adoption is a significant step in Hugewin’s safety, it’s not the only thing contributing to it. Hugewin boasts that it is legislated under the Curaçao eGaming license. Being a licensed sports betting service is a big achievement for any platform in the industry. On top of that, Hugewin’s unmatched 24/7 user support is helpful and instills a much-needed feeling of trustworthiness and safety, which is not often felt in the industry.



Reaching a New Demographic



While improving user experience, Hugewin’s adoption of cryptocurrency also plays a role in attracting a new type of bettor to their platform. Hugewin is perfectly poised to reel in a newly emerging type of demographic – tech-savvy individuals from the mainstream.




This new demographic will be excited to hear that Hugewin offers a generous 100% welcome bonus on their first deposit. And once they’re reeled in, Hugewin keeps them there by providing them with a perpetual 5% bonus cashback on all sports betting. Even when you lose on Hugewin, you get something extra.



Unveiling the Future: Cryptocurrency Changes Sports Betting

Ether.Fi price breaks above key resistance, is $10 next? - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Ether.Fi price rose 10% as altcoins looked to rebound, hitting highs of $5.35 amid latest upside momentum.
ETHFI could target $10 if bullish sentiment prevails.

Ether.Fi price rose 10% to reach highs of $5.35, a seven-week peak for the Ethereum liquid restaking platform’s native token ETHFI.
Importantly, Ether.Fi price at current levels sees it trade above a crucial support-turned resistance area.
With prices up 47% this past week, can bulls strengthen to push to $10? The last breakout above $5 saw ETHFI rally to its all-time high of $8.53 on March 27.
Ether.Fi introduces ether.fi Cash
On May 24, the Ether.Fi team announced the launch of ether.fi Cash, a mobile wallet and Visa credit card that allows users to save, spend or invest with their ether.fi assets.
Cash allows users to borrow or settle everyday transactions with USDC. Users can also pay off balances using their stake and liquid rewards.
“Cash is the third in our Trilogy of products — ether.fi Stake, ether.fi Liquid, and ether.fi Cash. Combined these integrated products help users save, invest and spend their crypto, making it so that users never have to offramp again,” the protocol noted in an announcement.
ETHFI price surges past $5
Data from CoinGecko shows that ETHFI price soared alongside major altcoins as Ethereum spiked earlier in the week. The ETH price reacted sharply to news of an impending spot ETF approval, reaching highs of $3,900.
The upside momentum also impacted ecosystem tokens, with ETHFI bouncing from lows of $3.23.

Although price faced an initial rejection at the horizontal resistance line, a retest of the area saw bulls break higher to hit $5.35 on May 23.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is at 66 to suggest the upper hand is with the buyers. Also, the MACD indicator is strengthening above the signal line to reflect an overall bullish outlook for ETHFI.
If bulls flip the key resistance zone into a robust support area, a surge to $6.14 could see them aim for the ATH.

Crypto Casino as a New Trend: Let's Examine on the Example of Hugewin



                    

Cryptocurrencies have been popular and in demand ever since the creation asset was created. However, community members recently experienced an unprecedented surge in demand for this technical innovation. The surge permeated various sectors, from finance to retail, but its impact is perhaps most pronounced in the iGaming industry.



A recent study by Grand View Research revealed that the worldwide online gambling market, which stood at $66.72 billion in 2020, is predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2021 through 2028. A key driver of this growth is the adoption of cryptocurrencies, which provide a fast, secure, and efficient means of transaction that appeals to modern gamers.




Additionally, findings from a CryptoGamblingNews survey indicated that over 60% of respondents prefer using cryptocurrencies for online gambling due to their quick transaction times and the anonymity they offer.



Why cryptocurrency is perfect for iGaming



The inherent features of cryptocurrency make it a suitable and successful pairing. Here’s why:




Comprehensive security measures. Since crypto utilizes blockchain technology, which is renowned worldwide for its secure but transparent way of storing data, the risks of fraud (which were quite common within the online casino industry of the past) are virtually zero.



Enhanced transaction speeds. Cryptocurrencies are transforming various industries due to their rapid transaction speeds surpassing traditional banking systems. This makes it an ideal fit for the iGaming industry, where fast, seamless transactions are crucial.



Global accessibility. Cryptocurrencies transcend geographical boundaries, making them accessible worldwide. Players from different countries can participate easily without the hassle of currency conversion or international banking restrictions.



Anonymity and privacy. Using cryptocurrencies allows players to maintain a higher level of anonymity since they don’t need to provide sensitive personal information. This privacy is especially appealing in the iGaming sector, where discretion is often valued.



Lower fees. Cryptocurrency transactions typically have lower fees than traditional banking methods. This cost-efficiency benefits players and gaming platforms, making it a more attractive option for financial transactions.



Enhanced credibility. The decentralized framework of cryptocurrencies, along with the permanent recordkeeping of blockchain transactions, fosters user trust. This allows players to confirm transactions and verify game fairness, which is essential for upholding integrity in the iGaming landscape, especially for a cryptogames casino and crypto slot games.




These features collectively make cryptocurrencies an ideal choice for the iGaming industry, providing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience for both players and operators.

Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) to Explode 14,000% Ahead of Bitrue Listing, as Shiba Inu, Bonk and Dogecoin Lag



                    

Early investors in memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) made astronomical returns, and Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT) presents a similar opportunity for a limited time.



Kim Jong Crypto (KIMCRYPT), a newly launched Solana memecoin, is poised to explode over 14,000% in a matter of days, as former Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pour funds into this new token.




KIMCRYPT will be listed on Bitrue, one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, within a few days – and this is a massively bullish development for the token, as millions of new investors will easily be able to buy Kim Jong Crypto.



Currently, Kim Jong Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.



To buy KIMCRYPT on these platforms, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kim Jong Crypto by entering its contract address – DY225ypZiG3aYkZnzaXJYDGtUz76uNuQiJLMzs6qGAZ5 – in the receiving field.




KIMCRYPT currently has a market cap of just under $13,000, with over $4,000 in locked liquidity, meaning it has huge upside potential.



Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.



If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Ether Poised to Surge Past $5,000 as Key Indicators Flash Bullish Signals



                    

Ether (ETH) could potentially retest the $5,000 price mark it narrowly missed in 2021 if three long-term indicators continue their current trends, according to one crypto trader.



“The dominance chart suggests we’re entering an ‘ETH Season’ where Ethereum is likely to outperform other cryptocurrencies,” said pseudonymous crypto trader Blockchain Mane in an interview with Cointelegraph.




This optimism follows the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) initial approval of eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on May 23.



Data from TradingView reveals that ETH’s market dominance surged by 19.56% over the past week after reports suggested the SEC was shifting its stance on ETF approvals.



Blockchain Mane highlighted another key long-term indicator: the Fibonacci retracement. 




This indicator predicts potential price levels where Ether might rebound, based on mathematical patterns from the Fibonacci sequence.



According to Mane, ETH is showing “resistance targets at $5,080.60 and $6,231.83.” 



These levels are significantly higher than its all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021, as reported by CoinMarketCap.



At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $3,802.

The third indicator noted by Blockchain Mane is the parabolic curve, which identifies potential trend changes by placing dots above or below Ether’s price movements.



Mane observed that ETH is following a “bullish trend” along the curve, with three distinct phases: base one, base two, and base three.



“The parabolic curve indicates continued upward movement, especially after the falling wedge breakout,” Mane said.



Meanwhile, other crypto traders are focusing on shorter-term price actions amid the spot Ether ETF approvals.



“ETH is up more this week than the S&P 500 typically gives you in a year,” crypto commentator Benjamin Cowen said in a May 23 X post.



Crypto trader Matthew Hyland emphasized the importance of Ether holding support around $3,800 for continued momentum.



The price of Ether has remained relatively stable following the ETF approvals, likely because the news was already priced in and ETF trading has not yet begun.

Ethereum's Pectra Upgrade: Stakes Raised for Validators, Smart Contracts Get Smarter


							

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is expected by Q1 2025 amid complex feature integration.



EVM Object Format and EIP-7702 by Vitalik Buterin are included in Pectra.



The Pectra upgrade will raise the staking cap for Ethereum validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.




Ethereum core developers are targeting the launch of the Pectra upgrade by the end of the first quarter of 2025. This upgrade encompasses the EVM Object Format (EOF), a suite of approximately 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which will introduce an optional container for EVM code.



Notably, Pectra, the next phase of the Ethereum network upgrade after Dencun, was initially expected to go live later this year. However, the shift from the previously projected late 2024 timeline is attributed to the inclusion of the EOF.



The Pectra upgrade is poised to raise the staking cap for Ethereum validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, as proposed in EIP 7251. This 64-fold increase would benefit major staking services like Coinbase and Lido by allowing them to consolidate their validators.



This change would streamline operations by reducing the need to create new validators for every additional 32 ETH staked, thus saving resources and effort in the staking and validation processes.



Another notable feature of the Pectra upgrade is PeerDAS, a data availability sampling solution that leverages the existing peer-to-peer components within the Ethereum ecosystem. This is expected to enhance the network’s scalability and efficiency.









Moreover, Ethereum developers have agreed to replace the account abstraction proposal EIP-3074 with the newly introduced EIP-7702, authored by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 is designed to allow externally owned accounts (EOAs) to operate as smart contract wallets within a transaction, potentially enhancing flexibility and security for users.



Following the Dencun update, Pectra merges the “Prague” and “Electra” upgrades for execution and consensus layers, respectively. While the final details of the upgrade are still being debated, there is a possibility of deferring certain features, such as the Verkle tree implementation, to a later hard fork, namely the Osaka hard fork.

With the broader digital currency ecosystem tilting toward tokenization, Ripple CTO David Schwartz has hinted at some of the important benefits of this technological advancement.Benefits of tokenizationThe concept of tokenization has been flying around, however, only a few understand or know what it really means. Taking to the Ripple Labs’ new X series of explaining a blockchain concept in 60 seconds, the Ripple CTO used real estate to explain the tokenization concept.He said, with a lot of paperwork involved in buying an asset, it becomes fairly difficult to prove ownership of such properties. He believes tokenization eliminates this challenge by solidifying the process of asset transfer and ownership. He said, with distributed ledger technologies, real estate sales recording, payment for properties and taking away all fraud factors becomes possible. He went on to point out how this ledger simplifies the process of borrowing against an asset. With tokenization, the person’s collateral can be registered on-chain and the lender can easily verify the ownership of the collateral. Depending on the key designs of the tokenization features, the lender may also gain insight that will show whether or not the person is borrowing from a number of lenders at the same time.Many financial giants are already trialing tokenization features, with BlackRock also joining the trend. Protocols like Chainlink are specifically helping to fuel this tokenization agenda with its CCIP solution among others.Ripple Labs positioningWhile Ripple Labs has not categorically stated the road map in its own tokenization agenda, the firm has immediate plans to launch a stablecoin later this summer. In its latest push, Ripple Labs has filed a trademark for its stablecoin, showing it hopes to use the ticker symbol "RLUSD."The stablecoin ecosystem is growing, and Ripple is optimistic to tap into the market in a dominant way.

Ethereum to Launch Next Network Upgrade in Q1 2025


Ethereum core developers are gearing up for the highly anticipated “Pectra” upgrade, set to launch by the end of the first quarter of 2025. 
This significant update will introduce the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), incorporating approximately 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). EOF aims to enhance the EVM code through an opt-in container system, marking a pivotal development in Ethereum’s evolution.

Ethereum’s Next Big Upgrade Coming Q1 2025
One of the standout features of the Pectra upgrade is PeerDAS, a data availability sampling solution. PeerDAS leverages existing peer-to-peer components within Ethereum to ensure efficient data distribution and availability. This innovation aims to bolster the network’s resilience and performance, addressing current scalability challenges.
Interestingly, developers will replace the account abstraction EIP-3074 with a more advanced proposal, EIP-7702, introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 allows Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to function as smart contract wallets during transactions. Subsequently streamlining the user experience and enhancing security.

“This EIP is designed to be very forward-compatible with endgame account abstraction, without over-enshrining any fine-grained details of ERC-4337 or RIP-7560,” the proposal stated.

Pectra’s architecture includes two critical components. First, the Prague upgrade on the Execution Layer, and second, the Electra upgrade on the Consensus Layer. These updates collectively aim to optimize transaction processing and network consensus mechanisms, ensuring a more robust and efficient blockchain.

Howey Test Ignored by SEC, Alleges Coinbase


Coinbase leveraged current political movements in the US Congress to bolster its interlocutory appeal against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In a May 24 court filing, Coinbase argued that the SEC tried to “side-step” the Howey test, which is a legal framework used to determine assets that qualify as securities. Over the years, the crypto industry and the SEC have battled over applying this standard to digital assets.
Coinbase Accuses SEC of Ignoring Howey Test

Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, explained the exchange’s position. According to him, the core question was whether the SEC can regulate cryptocurrency transactions as “investment contracts” when no contractual obligations exist. 
Grewal noted the SEC’s inconsistency and highlighted its similar appeal in the Ripple case. He stressed the importance of this unresolved legal issue for the crypto industry. The executive also contended that the SEC has an extensive history of being uncooperative with industry leaders.

“From the beginning, we came to the SEC with good-faith efforts to have a conversation about a workable and balanced regulatory framework for crypto innovation within the US. Instead, we – like much of the industry – have been met with slammed doors, changing positions, and litigation,” Grewal said.

Remarkably, Coinbase also pointed out recent legislative developments that could impact the SEC’s jurisdiction on the emerging industry. During the past week, the US House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which could shift more regulatory power to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 
This bill, staunchly opposed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, aims to oversee the crypto markets and enjoys strong support from industry stakeholders.

“Legislators’ disagreement with the SEC’s position meanwhile has deepened: just this week, the U.S. House of Representatives approved on a bipartisan basis comprehensive digital asset legislation that would deny the SEC the expansive jurisdiction it claims,” Coinbase wrote.

Grewal highlighted this development as a positive shift in the political landscape and a step toward better regulatory oversight. He also reiterated Coinbase’s commitment to obtaining clarity for the industry and resisting overreach by regulators.

“Earlier this week, the House recognized the need for clear rules, and we’re seeking clarity in the Courts as well. But regardless of the timeline, we’re committed to seeing this through â€“ no matter how long it takes to get clarity for the entire industry and push back against overzealous regulators. It’s what the 52 million Americans who own crypto deserve,” Grewal remarked.

ETH vs. ADA: Is Cardano or Ethereum a Better Investment in 2024?


																Markets got a big spike in Ethereum price this week on crypto exchanges. What’s behind it and what factors can investors take into consideration to determine whether Ether or its friend Cardano is the better buy?
Ethereum has a birthday coming up on July 30. It was launched in 2015 to create a “world computer” with the same Web3 blockchain properties as Bitcoin has for storing cash and making payments.
Cardano was launched on September 23, 2017 by initial coin offering (ICO) and founded by an Ethereum co-founder, Charles Hoskinson. Today it’s the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
Ethereum Market Cap (May 22): $451.8 billion
Cardano Market Cap (May 22): $17.2 billion
Certain differences between the two cryptocurrencies are an advantage for one or the other and a good reason to be bullish or bearish for ETH or ADA tokens.




But some of the two networks’ differences are tradeoffs that are more complex to evaluate as yielding an advantage for either crypto. Here are 7 key factors at play in the future Ethereum price against Cardano:
1. ETH vs. ADA – Technical Analysis (a tie)
Ethereum price is nearly all the way back to its ATH (all time high) after spiking this week on Ethereum spot ETF buzz. Cardano has a long way to go. That might actually be more bullish for ADA, with more upside left in its price.
The recent Ethereum ETF approval will shake up the entire meta for investing in Ether. If bulls take the price past $4,000, another 12.5% increase would pump ETH to $4,500— within striking range of the previous Ethereum ATH of $4,721 in Nov. 2021.
Forbes recently mentioned an Ethereum price prediction of $5,000 by the end of 2024. Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck predicts $11,800 by 2030. An even more bullish outlook forecasts $10,000 ETH by the end of the year.
Over the short term, Cardano technical indicators and moving averages over the weekly span recommended “Sell” on Thursday. Meanwhile, Ethereum technical indicators for the seven-day span recommended “Strong Buy,” according to data from Investing.com.
2. Ether Spot ETF – Regulatory Analysis (bullish ETH)
There’s no denying it. Charles Hoskinson would certainly agree: U.S. regulators seem to favor Bitcoin and Ethereum over Cardano and other DeFi networks.
The SEC said okay to Ethereum futures ETFs in October, revealing it didn’t seem to think of Ether as an unregistered security. However, the U.S. regulator has classified Cardano and other cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities in lawsuits against multiple blockchain companies, while ignoring Bitcoin and Ether.
As Fortune Magazine reported on May 1, “Furthermore, despite launching a number of lawsuits against crypto companies since April 2023, the agency has never named Ether to be a security in its complaints.”
The SEC lawsuit against Ripple has taken years (since Dec. 2020) and still has not yet been resolved. It is costly and leaves the future unsure for the currencies under the government’s crosshairs.
Markets abhor uncertainty.
It may not be fair, but it’s a bullish factor for ETH and bearish for ADA.
3. ADA vs. ETH – Fundamental Analysis (a wash)
Fundamental analysis is the preferred method of investors who are not total degenerates. Instead of chart technical analysis or meme currency voodoo economics, the fundamentalist looks at an investment prospect and asks what would “The Intelligent Investor” author Benjamin Graham do if he were here?
Graham says:
“The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists. In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”
If a business’s expected future revenues discounted to the present day exceed its current market value, then it may be a good investment. If they match or fall short of the business’s market cap, then it may be a poor investment.
ADA: $263.8 million TVL (3% annual reward rate + 121% annual growth rate) / Market Cap: $16.4 Billion
ETH $64.9 Billion TVL (5.5% annual reward rate + 145% annual growth rate) / Market Cap: $453 Billion
Going by the data above without any further context, it appears Cardano would be the winner, because its inflows make up a much smaller portion of its market cap than Ethereum (0.019 to 0.22), but only if we expect it to grow at the same rate as Ethereum in the future.
The lopsided institutional adoption between the two will make that difficult for Cardano unless it finds a use case, a feature/benefit, and a narrative that shakes up the retail Internet markets for cryptocurrency.
4. Cardano vs. Ethereum – Gas Fees (cat’s game)
There are lower and more predictable fees on Cardano, but higher fees on Ethereum are also a feature, not necessarily a bug. They make it more expensive to misuse the network for cybercrime that doesn’t pay, so it’s more secure. Big institutions like that.
That’s one reason why the industry leader, Bitcoin’s slow, expensive network, with a low transaction bandwidth holds its capital so well. In many ways these built-in costs qualify participants better than Know Your Customer policies and automatically and without discriminating on any basis other than ability and willingness to pay the network’s fees.
Still for newcomers, enterpreneurs, startups, and investors starting out with a smaller cash pile, smart contract blockchain networks with lower fees like Cardano have an advantage. Transaction fees on both networks are highly variable and spike during periods of high network use.
5. Ease Of Use – Cardano (another tie)
Some people in Web3 feel Ethereum has an ease-of-use problem. It’s become too overgrown with complicated, byzantine layers on top of layers, creating a steeper learning curve and potential security threats.
Blockchain advocate Daniel Cawrey wrote in a recent opinion article on Blockworks:
“Ethereum is becoming a multilayered lasagna-like system whereby complexity and fees are pushing people to the margins, causing interoperability and security concerns.”
While true, much like Ethereum’s higher transactions fees— the complexity of Ethereum may be a reason to be bullish for ETH. It could simply be proof of the network’s success. As Cawrey acknowledges in the piece, the network is beginning to achieve its “world computer” concept.
Any computer architecture expert would be hard-pressed to explain how a Turing-complete global computer that anyone can use on a peer-to-peer network would become anything but a flying spaghetti monster of complexity.
6. Ether vs. Cardano Whales (bullish ADA)
A massive 15,000 ETH whale deposit to Kraken on May 18 spotted by Whale Alert suggested a bear run on Ether by whales could be incoming, but after the SEC approved the spot Ethereum ETF a surge in whale-sized transactions has been net positive for the network, according to IntoTheBlock data.
Meanwhile, Cardano whales have been extremely bullish for ADA in May. They boosted holdings in Cardano tokens by 11% in a month. Whales tend to be smart money with some of the most advanced analytics and market outlooks to know what they’re doing, so that’s positively bullish for Cardano.
https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1790774801277042863
7. Ethereum vs. Cardano Memes (bullish ETH)
Meme coins are a definite advantage for Ethereum. While Cardano does have meme coins, none of them are notable and they have not topped the market cap charts like Ethereum’s SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI.
Cardano has succeeded in making a simpler, lower-fee Ethereum, but crypto markets tend to reward projects that leaven their technology with some meme karma. Maybe an Orange Pill Moon Boys NFT collection or something with a dog on it would do the trick.

'Severely undervalued,' says influencer on PEPE, but activity suggests otherwise


    In the vast and still experimental cryptocurrency market, influencers and enthusiasts often share insights into their favorite cryptocurrencies. Usually, they will hold these assets as personal investments—a normal behavior expected from someone enthusiastic about an asset.



However, influencers can use their influence to lure exit liquidity for tokens they hold but do not plan to keep in the long term. This is what recent on-chain and social activities suggest could have happened to a known meme coin trader.



Notably, Lookonchain spotted a possible divergence between words and on-chain activity from James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) on X on May 25.







Influencer James Wynn’s PEPE dilemma



As the on-chain analyst reported, Wynn recently deposited $7.54 million worth of 491 billion PEPE to a Binance account. Etherscan data shows the deposit occurred at 07:31 a.m. +UTC under the transaction ID ‘0xb46…3afd5c.’



0xb46b036c6ed411d86bdab8fc0990af9a681b5e1d2635efd8f539fd6c573afd5c. Source: Etherscan



Interestingly, the influencer then posted that “PEPE is still severely undervalued” one hour after the deposit. According to screenshots taken and shared by Lookonchain, James Wynn continued with two other bullish-biased posts related to PEPE.







These posts are currently inaccessible because the trader locked his account on X.

Depositing from a self-custody wallet to crypto exchanges usually means an intention to sell and is a commonly used indicator.



Previously, Wynn spent $8,524 to buy 2.83 trillion PEPE, which equals $44.4 million at current prices. The influencer has been partially selling this amount over time. Now, his most recent activity dumped nearly half of the remaining reserves held at jwynn.eth.



As of this writing, the account still holds 476.8 billion PEPE, worth approximately $7.48 million.



PEPE, meme coins, and the Greater Fool Theory



Meme coins, such as PEPE, often lack fundamental value and are driven by hype and social media buzz. Traders who buy these coins are essentially gambling in the hope that someone else will buy them at a higher price.



This mentality aligns with the “Greater Fool Theory,” which suggests that profits can be made by buying overvalued assets and selling them to a “greater fool.” 



Moreover, this theory highlights the inherent risk of such investments, as the market eventually runs out of willing buyers. When the hype dies down and demand dwindles, traders can be left holding worthless cryptocurrencies, leading to substantial financial losses.



In closing, this recent activity demonstrates the importance of not blindly following crypto influencers to make investment decisions.

Coinbase Strengthens Case For Interlocutory Appeal In Latest Petition


								The long-drawn legal battle between Coinbase and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to provide more twists and turns in what may be a pivotal case in crypto regulatory history. In a recent development, the American crypto exchange has now filed a response to the commission’s petition against an initial motion for an interlocutory appeal in this contentious legal case.


Coinbase Sends Fiery Response To SEC As Appeal Saga Thickens
On April 12, Coinbase approached the US court seeking clarification on whether an investment contract can be formed with no post-sale obligations. The crypto exchanges consider this issue as a “controlling question of law” critical to its ongoing case with the SEC. 
In response, the SEC argued that there was no need for the court to certify such an interlocutory appeal as the existing securities regulations, especially the Howey Test, have proven sufficient for decades. In particular, the Commission stated that no court had ever requested a post-sale contract following the use of the test in the past. 
However, in a fresh Memorandum of Law submitted on Friday, May 24, Coinbase addresses this statement saying that the interlocutory appeal revolves around a novel issue in that “no appellate court has addressed whether a digital asset transaction carrying no post-sale obligations can be an ‘investment contract’ under Howey”. 
In addition, the exchange accuses the SEC of avoiding the “controlling question of law” in its counter-motion by diverting attention to the controversy with the application of the Howey Test to cryptocurrency transactions rather than Coinbase’s petition which seeks guidance on Howey’s application to digital assets.


Coinbase Seeking For ‘Stylish’ Court Victory
Finally, in Coinbase’s latest petition, the exchange reiterated the potential importance of this interlocutory appeal on the outcome of its legal case with the SEC. The defendant’s lawyers stressed that with a favorable outcome, over 70% of the SEC complaints could be rendered invalid. 
A statement from the petition read: 
Most of the SEC’s 116 recently-served document requests and all of its 32 requests for admission, 10 third-party subpoenas, and 9 requests for inspection are about Coinbase’s platform and Prime services rather than the unrelated staking program. This portends a discovery process, motion practice, and a trial skewed heavily toward claims centering on the “ecosystems” of 12 distinct tokens—claims that are destined to consume substantial judicial and party resources but that, with interlocutory review, could be out of the case.

On June 6, 2023, the SEC charged Coinbase with accusations of operating as an unlicensed securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. Considering Coinbase’s status as the largest US exchange, the result of this is tipped by many to have massive effects on regulations in the country’s burgeoning crypto industry.

Bitcoin rises, Ether gets an ETF boost, and Donald Trump takes crypto

Illustration: Craig Hastings (Getty Images)The U.S. House of Representatives passed a crypto market structure bill on Wednesday evening that aims to regulate the industry at large.The bill, “The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act” (FIT21), would effectively classify cryptocurrency as a commodity, not a security, and therefore exempt from securities regulations. It would also determine oversight of cryptocurrencies, whether they should be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Read More

Will 'Coinbase effect' have a role to play in FLOKI's price targets? - AMBCrypto



FLOKI’s price appreciated by over 3.5% in the last 24 hours 
Market indicators hinted at a sustained price hike on the charts 

FLOKI bulls continue to dominate the market as the memecoin’s weekly and daily price charts remained green, at press time. Things can get even better for the altcoin, however, especially since a major exchange has now announced FLOKI’s listing – An update that can propel further growth in the coming days. 
Coinbase lists FLOKI
CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that FLOKI has been enjoying a comfortable weekly rally as its value surged by more than 8.8% in the last 7 days. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the memecoin’s price spiked by 3.5%. 
At the time of writing, the memecoin was trading at $0.0002264 with a market capitalization of over $2.16 billion. However, it was surprising to note that despite the bullish price action, FLOKI’s weighted sentiment dropped. Simply put, bearish sentiment retained its dominance in the altcoin’s market.
Additionally, its social volume declined over the last few days as well. 
Source: Santiment
However, this might change after Coinbase announced that it has listed FLOKI perpetual futures. The memecoin’s official X handle mentioned in a tweet that its fresh Coinbase listing will significantly enhance FLOKI’s market liquidity.
 Coinbase listings often have a bullish impact on the listed token’s price, which is commonly referred to as the “Coinbase effect.” If such an episode happens on this occasion, then FLOKI’s bull rally might get a further push and help spur the memecoin’s fainting momentum. 
FLOKI bulls to dominate more?
AMBCrypto then analyzed Santiment’s data to find out whether metrics supported the possibility of further growth. We found that FLOKI’s MVRV ratio remained relatively high, which can be inferred as a bullish signal. 
However, the memecoin’s trading volume dropped last week after spiking on 22 May. On top of that, the crypto’s network growth also declined, meaning that fewer new addresses were created to transfer the token. 
Source: Santiment
Nonetheless, market indicators continued to remain bullish. For example, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also went north, indicating that the chances of FLOKI continuing its rally were high.

If the bull rally continues, then the first target for FLOKI would be $0.00024 as liquidation would rise, which can result in a short-term price correction.
A successful breakout above this level would allow the memecoin to hit $0.00026–$0.00027. However, if the trend changes and the memecoin goes down, then FLOKI might drop to its support level near $0.000226.

Shibarium Is Close to Breaching Important Milestone

Shibarium, the Shiba Inu-backed Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, is showcasing a mixed growth outlook, however, with the tendency to hit a major milestone soon. Per data from its dedicated explorer Shibariumscan, the L2 protocol is eyeing hitting the 5,000,000 total block production milestone.Shibarium's erratic statisticsSince its inception, Shibarium has maintained a steady growth pace in all key metrics, except for its erratic daily transaction count. Despite powering one of the most vibrant Web3 ecosystems, its average daily transaction count has slumped from at least 1 million in Q4, 2023, to just 5,150 today.Despite this epic slump, block production remains steady. At the time of writing, a total of 4,900,607 blocks have been produced on Shibarium, leaving just 99,393 blocks to hit the 5 million milestone. At its current pace, chances are that it might hit this record before the end of this second quarter.Another crucial data insight on Shibarium is the total transactions and wallet address features. While total transactions come in at 417,549,926, the wallet address count is pegged at 1,803,996. This data shows that Shibarium is thriving within its own ecosystem of dApps.Boosting Shibarium with ShibaSwapSince its inception in August 2023, Shibarium has charted its growth course in a majorly organic manner. This is about to change as the protocol has welcomed ShibaSwap, its dominant decentralized exchange (DEX).As an exchange with many unique visitors, the expectation is that in the long run, ShibaSwap can help drive the transaction rebound as well as attract new users into the Shibarium ecosystem.With the Ethereum L2 ecosystem recording intense competition, Shibarium is looking at competing following its latest hard fork event on the mainnet. With faster speed, predictable gas cost and transaction throughput, hitting the anticipated milestone appears inevitable.

Ethereum’s Muted Response to ETF Approval: A Calm Before the Storm?


							

Ethereum price increases slightly after long-awaited SEC approval of spot ETFs.



Ethereum traders have lost $23.33 million to liquidation in the last 24 hours.



Analysts expect the spot ETFs to bring more demand to the Ethereum market.




The market value of Ethereum (ETH) registered only a modest uptick over the last 24 hours despite the SEC approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs.



At the last check, Ethereum traded at $3,742, representing a 2.76% increase from the previous day, although its weekly performance reflects a more substantial gain. In comparison, Bitcoin surged 4%, setting a daily high of $69,222, with a similar percentage growth over its weekly performance.



Notably, in the build-up to the ETF approvals, Ethereum experienced heightened optimism. The asset soared by 40% to reclaim the $3,943 price point on Thursday, having traded at as low as $2,815 on May 1.



Meanwhile, the positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum waned after ETF approvals. Data from market tracker Coinglass indicated that following the SEC’s approval of Ethereum spot ETF listings on May 23, ETH traders witnessed $80.3 million in long liquidations.



For context, a long position involves purchasing an asset with the expectation of selling it at a higher price in the future. As of the latest figures, traders betting against the Ethereum uptrend are now the ones mostly in losses. In particular, Ethereum shorts have lost $23.33 million in the last 24 hours, amid ETH’s 2.76% uptick.



Source | Coinglass



While Ethereum has yet to see substantial gains since the ETH approvals, industry experts remain confident that it will soon set new all-time highs.



Chris Donovan, COO of the NEAR Protocol, expressed optimism for the crypto industry in the wake of the Ethereum spot ETF approval. Donovan believes that the approval is a strong endorsement for the entire crypto sector and could lead to significant and improved demand entering the market.









The approval of Ethereum spot ETFs marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, signaling growing acceptance among institutional investors. Even as the market adjusts to the surprise SEC approval, the optimism expressed by industry figures like Chris Donovan suggests that this could be just the beginning of Ethereum’s next bull run.

Private stablecoins will be the bedrock of on-chain commerce - Blockworks


One of the most common misconceptions about blockchain technology is that it’s synonymous with privacy. Instead, the reality is that public blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are more of an open book than a lockbox of user information. They are transparent by default, and every single transaction that takes place on them is visible to anyone using a block explorer.
While this has numerous benefits — including fulfilling the dream of a more accountable financial system — it also has its drawbacks. When it comes to commerce and other use cases, some variations in how these blockchains are implemented might be appreciated by end users and enterprise projects alike. Private stablecoins, in particular, are key to this type of adoption.
Parity with TradFi is the least we can do
As crypto and digital assets become more widely adopted, the transparency that exists in public blockchains becomes more problematic. The perils of doxxing that now exist in terms of personally identifiable information will start to extend to personal financial information as well, leaving many vulnerable to bad actors.
Despite this, recent developments like Google’s decision to index ENS balances and transactions have made personal financial information on Web3 more public than ever before. And while these balances are generally held in pseudonymous accounts, their IRL identities are usually traceable by sufficiently interested parties, as some controversial Web3 projects have demonstrated.
What happens then, if we assume that the Web3 community’s ambition to bring more and more financial activity on-chain, becomes reality? 
On one hand, we’ve solved the primary problem of adoption thanks to stablecoins, albeit sans privacy. Today, we use robust stablecoins that let us work around crypto’s volatility for many kinds of on-chain commerce activities, including popular DeFi applications. 
Read more from our opinion section: Stablecoins bots are a feature, not a bug
On the other hand, on-chain commerce will never fully take off without the same level of privacy that exists in traditional finance because most users expect the same level of privacy and ease that they get with their banking app on their smartphone — and reasonably so. 
It’s not hard to see why the current open book nature of public blockchains is a cause for concern for many would-be users and enterprise adopters. 
Private stablecoins are the absolute bedrock of any Web3 analogue for commerce use cases. We can’t achieve parity with traditional finance without getting this right.
Taking on-chain commerce a step further than TradFi
We’re already starting to reap the benefits of all the great research and advances in zk technology that took place during the bear market. This is enabling new features that protect users’ financial information by allowing them to prove necessary information without revealing balances or transactions publicly. 
The ongoing integration of this technology with stablecoins will pave the way for on-chain commerce to thrive. Moreso, it will add security and privacy benefits that did not exist in traditional finance and Web2 environments.
The first example of where these features can have an impact goes back to personal security. Private stablecoins based on zk technology (and current work on cost reductions for proof verifications) eliminate the need for expensive custodians through built-in security and anonymization features.
Then, we can look at the implications for enterprise adopters. Private stablecoins can provide competitive security and protection against espionage by obscuring transaction trails for stablecoins and securing sensitive business operations.
Enhanced privacy features using zk technology can also mask financial details of employees to prevent reverse-engineering of payroll data when salaries are distributed using stablecoins. This kind of non-custodial security solution could reduce vulnerabilities even further by decentralizing payroll management with employees controlling their own transactions.
Finally, we can look at the need for private stablecoins from a compliance perspective. We can program regulatory compliance into stablecoins in such a way that they’re tailored to meet legal standards, maximizing privacy and security at the same time. 
In these cases, compliance can be proven to relevant authorities via zk proofs that don’t disclose any additional information publicly. This would create a healthier balance between transparency and privacy for stablecoin users in on-chain commerce.
A slow but steady path towards private on-chain commerce
The need for private stablecoins for on-chain commerce is part of a broad, important and ongoing conversation around the need for financial privacy in Web3. The decentralized and open source nature of Web3 means innovation is happening quickly, but the right implementation by Web3 projects can be somewhat slower. 
Many of the features that are being made possible by the integration of zk technology into stablecoins are a work in progress. It’s absolutely crucial that we move forward with private stablecoins as soon as possible. Otherwise, a truly on-chain economy will be a permanent pipedream.

Attention: Giant Bankruptcy Firm Starts Sales in This Altcoin - Holding 10 Percent of Total Supply - Bitcoin Sistemi


Teneo, the liquidator of the bankrupt cryptocurrency company Three Arrows Capital (3AC), has made some interesting transactions, according to onchain data.
According to the data, the organization moved 2.18 million Starknet (STRK) tokens, worth approximately $2.63 million, to Binance in the last three days. These appear to be STRK tokens that Teneo recovered from 3AC and sold to pay its buyers.


Notably, Teneo currently owns another 130 million STRK in Three Arrows Capital's bankruptcy assets. This corresponds to approximately 157 million dollars.
With $157 million in assets, Teneo is the second largest holder of STRK tokens, excluding developer and exchange wallets.






Starknet has a total market cap of $1.4 billion, meaning Teneo owns approximately 10% of the total STRK supply in assets.
However, almost 90% of STRK tokens are still uncirculated, bringing the token's fully diluted market value to approximately $12 billion.


After Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin claimed $1.07 million worth of STRK tokens yesterday, the STRK price dropped approximately 6%.

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) Will Skyrocket 18,000% as KuCoin Listing Announced



                    

Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE) could turn early investors into multi-millionaires if it becomes a mainstream coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).



Wizard Pepe (WIZPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is poised to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days.




This is because WIZPEPE has announced its first centralized exchange listing, which will be on KuCoin.



This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.



Currently, Wizard Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jupiter and Raydium, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.




Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Wizard Pepe could become the next viral memecoin.



Wizard Pepe launched with over $6,000 of locked liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.



To buy Wizard Pepe on Raydium or Jupiter ahead of the KuCoin listing, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Wizard Pepe by entering its contract address – AJM9tnhfGz9xezv1rTjspoTug3YVpcmrp3gJ9FMDEEYj – in the receiving field.



In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.




If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.



The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.



This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like WIZPEPE.

$2.7 Billion in Bitcoin and Ether Options Set to Expire, Revealing Market Sentiment



                    

Approximately $2.7 billion in Bitcoin and Ether options are set to expire on May 24, offering key insights into market sentiment.



According to Greeks.live on X, 21,000 Bitcoin options are expiring, with a put/call ratio of 0.88. 




This shows a near-even balance between buyers and sellers, with a slight lean towards call options. 



The maximum pain point, or the price at which most option buyers would incur losses, is $67,000, totaling a nominal value of $1.4 billion.



While the upcoming 21,000 contract expiry is significant, it is overshadowed by a larger event on May 31, when $4.3 billion worth of options are set to expire, according to Deribit. 



Deribit data shows that long positions dominate open interest (OI), with $830 million tied to the $70,000 strike price. 



Higher strike prices also show significant OI, notably $843 million at the $100,000 mark, indicating a bullish sentiment among traders. 



The $60,000 strike price stands out with $388 million in open interest, the most notable for put contracts.



This substantial OI suggests many contracts remain unsettled, showing that bulls are confident in much higher Bitcoin prices.

OI represents the unresolved value of contracts awaiting settlement.




The options expiry event also impacts Ether, with 350,000 contracts expiring, representing a notional value of $1.3 billion. 



The put/call ratio of 0.58 and a max pain point of $3,200 suggest a slightly bullish tone, with more call options expiring than put options.



Greeks.live reports that Ethereum recently led the crypto rally, driven by ETF progress, with a one-day 20% rise. 



The short-term options implied volatility (IV) reached 150%, much higher than Bitcoin’s current IV for the same period.



However, a divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum is evident. 



While Ethereum’s bullish sentiment remains strong, maintaining high IV levels for each major term is challenging from a market trading and structure perspective. 



This suggests that calendar spreads might be a better choice. In contrast, Bitcoin appears more balanced between long and short positions, with stronger forces selling calls.

Terra LUNA’s LUNC Set To Jump 13x, Analyst Reveals The Drivers


																Crypto analyst Javon Marks has laid out a bullish narrative for Terra Classic (LUNC). Based on his analysis, the crypto token could eventually see a 13x increase from its current price levels. The analyst alluded to LUNC’s historical pattern as what could drive such parabolic price surge.

	Related Reading


How LUNC’s Price Could Jump By 1,300% 
Marks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that LUNC has confirmed a “major bullish pattern,” signaling a continuation of its bullish run to the first price target at $0.00058046. He noted that this move of over 400% was likely to be attained with the crypto token holding above levels that it had earlier broken out from. 

The crypto analyst then raised the possibility of LUNC making a 1,300% move instead. He claimed that LUNC’s previous breakout and run pattern suggests that three targets could be broken above, meaning that the crypto token rising to the price target of $0.00139122 from here is “possible.”
Marks has remained bullish on LUNC for a while now and has suggested that LUNC’s parabolic rally is a question of when and not if. However, he has failed to provide any specific timeframe for when this move will likely occur. LUNC’s fundamentals are also expected to contribute to this upward trend and push its price to such heights. 
One way that is likely to happen is through the LUNC’s burns, which are carried out regularly. The Terra community has burnt over 113 billion LUNC tokens since the burning initiative came into place following Terra LUNA’s crash in 2022. This has helped reduce the crypto tokens’s circulating supply and could be significant as demand for the token picks up. 
It is worth noting that LUNC is well below its all-time high of $119. However, this suggests that the crypto token has enough room to move significantly to the upside.

Recent Developments In The Terra Classic Ecosystem
Genuine Labs, a Terra Classic developer group, recently announced that the latest version of SDK 47 was ready. The proposed upgrade is expected to be put up for governance voting. The upgrade will introduce significant changes to the Terra network, including a fix to the dyncomm decorator. 
Furthermore, the upgrade will handle peer-to-peer (p2p) storms on the network and add new features to the Terrad client, which connects developers to the Terra blockchain. It is uncertain when the proposal will go live, but it should be soon enough. 

	Related Reading


Meanwhile, the Terra community also recently passed a proposal to make Allnodes an official organization for the community. Allnodes will be the official source for information regarding the circulating supply of LUNC, USTC, and other native tokens. 
At the time of writing, LUNC is trading at around $0.0001151, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The Pectra update is expected to include the EVM Object Format (EOF), a collection of approximately 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that provide an optional container for EVM code. This key component is one of the main reasons for the projected 2025 timeline for the update.


Another key feature of the update is PeerDAS, a data availability sampling solution that leverages existing peer-to-peer (P2P) components in Ethereum.

In a notable development, the developers have agreed to replace the EIP-3074 account abstraction feature with EIP-7702, a newer offering from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 will increase the flexibility and functionality of the network by allowing Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) to function as smart contract wallets during a transaction.





The Pectra update includes the Prague update in the Execution Layer and the Electra update in the Consensus Layer. However, the final scope of the upgrade is still being debated and there are potential changes on the horizon. One of these changes may be to postpone the transition to the Verkle tree until the next Osaka hardfork.

XRP's unusual token activity - Assessing its potential market impact - AMBCrypto



Many long-term XRP holders changed addresses, but it may not be in a bid to sell.
Short-term participants made mild gains, however, the token remained undervalued

In less than two weeks, XRP’s Age Consumed metric has resurrected from major lows three times. The first time was on 16 May when the metric spiked to 214.86 billion.
On 20 May, it went overboard and hit 539.79 billion, and on 24 May, the metric rose again, indicating significant movement of tokens by long-term holders.
For those unfamiliar, Age Consumed tracks the amount of tokens changing addresses within a certain period. When the metric spikes, it means that a large number of previously idle tokens are on the move.
On the other hand, a low reading suggests that long-term holders have kept most of their assets in the same wallet. On the back of the recent market surge, participants might assume that holders are planning to sell their XRP.

XRP to trade between $0.50 and $0.55
However, making conclusions without proof from other metrics might sound too hasty. As such, AMBCrypto evaluated the exchange inflows and outflows on the XRP Ledger.
According to data obtained from Santiment, XRP’s exchange inflows were 211,00. Exchange inflows measure the number of tokens sent from external wallets to exchange addresses.
A surge in the inflows suggests that most tokens might be up for sale. Furthermore, the exchange outflows at press time were 208,000. This metric is the number of tokens sent out to non-custodial wallets. On most occasions, this action implies that the participants involved do not plan to sell soon.
The mild difference in the flows indicates that XRP’s price might not be significantly affected by the spike in the movement of idle coins.
Source: Santiment
Holders should prepare for fireworks
At the time of writing, XRP’s price was $0.53. This value represented a 2.67% hike in the last 7 days. Going by the indications on-chain, XRP might not register a notable uptick in the coming days.
However, if the market condition gets too bearish, the price might slide to the $0.50 underlying support. Conversely, in a highly bullish scenario, XRP might hit $0.55 on the charts.
All in all, the short-term forecast seemed to indicate that the token might remain in a tight trading range. In the meantime, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio showed that more XRP holders have become profitable of late.
At press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio was 2.696%. This means that the average token holder who accumulated in the last 30 days might get positive returns if they sold.
Source: Santiment
In addition, the metric measures if an asset is undervalued or overvalued. By the look of things, XRP seemed to be undervalued, compared to its performance in March.

Hence, the token’s price might climb toward $0.60 in the mid-term. However, the short-term outlook does not exactly look bullish as XRP might swing sideways as mentioned previously.

South Korea Busts Crypto Scam: 19 Arrested In 'Reading Room' Fraud


								South Korean law enforcement has struck a blow against social media-fueled crypto scam with the arrest of 19 individuals linked to a deceptive “crypto reading room.” The Daegu Police Agency’s raid, which unfolded on May 21st, exposed a manipulative scheme that preyed on more than 300 unsuspecting investors, swindling them out of a staggering $19 million.

Crypto Scam: Deceptive Chats, Illusory Profits
Authorities allege the international gang operated an “open chat room,” likely on platforms like Telegram or KakaoTalk, masquerading as a legitimate hub for cryptocurrency trading advice.
Police describe the room as a meticulously crafted stage. Gang members, posing as seasoned crypto experts, dispensed seemingly valuable tips and boasted about substantial returns.
Others, acting as ordinary investors, chimed in with enthusiastic endorsements, weaving a web of trust to lure victims into the trap.

Bogus Exchanges, Brutal Betrayal
The meticulously crafted facade unraveled when victims were steered towards downloading apps connected to bogus crypto exchanges. These fake platforms, say officers, housed unlisted coins, further fueling the illusion of exclusivity and potential profit.

As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com
To solidify trust, the crypto scam gang allowed victims to make small, initial gains, emboldening them to invest larger sums. The true horror unfolded when victims attempted to withdraw their funds. They were met with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle – fabricated “withdrawal fees.”
Refusal to pay these fees resulted in the gang severing all communication, leaving victims with nothing but empty promises and stolen savings.
Pig-Butchering Abroad: A Chilling Twist
The investigation revealed a particularly disturbing recruitment tactic employed by the ringleader. Dubbed “pig-butchering,” it involved promising unsuspecting individuals lucrative job opportunities in Myanmar.
Upon arrival, a sinister bait-and-switch unfolded. Passports and phones were confiscated, and victims were strong-armed into joining the fraudulent operation. This tactic highlights the international reach of these criminal networks and the lengths they go to exploit vulnerabilities.

Crypto Wild West: A Call for Regulation
This raid underscores the urgent need for stricter regulations in the cryptocurrency space. South Korea, a hotbed for crypto activity, has seen a surge in social media-driven scams.
Experts believe this case may be a catalyst for the government to implement stricter controls on both crypto platforms and social media groups offering investment advice.

ChatGPT-4o predicts XRP's price if the token's ETF is approved


    Following the approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Standard Chartered Bank has projected that several other cryptocurrencies could follow suit.



Among the cryptocurrencies is Ripple’s XRP, which is currently embroiled in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs suggests that the regulatory agency does not classify ETH as a security.



Therefore, this implies that other coins previously under scrutiny may also not be considered securities, paving the way for more spot crypto ETF approvals. 







Drawing from historical performance, the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF led to the cryptocurrency rallying to a new record high. Monitoring whether the same can be replicated for XRP will be a matter of interest.



To gather insights regarding the price impact of a possible ETF on XRP, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s latest and most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o.



Implication of XRP spot ETF



The tool identified several factors around an ETF that could impact the price of XRP. First, ChatGPT-4o drew parallels from the past, noting that the approval of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs significantly influenced the maiden cryptocurrency’s value. This surge has been attributed to heightened accessibility and institutional interest. Similarly, should an XRP ETF gain approval, a comparable uptrend could be anticipated.



The tool also noted that the regulatory move could positively impact XRP. It pointed out that if an XRP ETF receives the green light, heightened interest and investment from retail and institutional sectors could be witnessed, further bolstering XRP’s market position.



Additionally, the AI platform highlighted that the impact of the ETF approval could complement XRP’s existing fundamentals. It noted that XRP’s utility in cross-border payments and established partnerships with financial institutions underpin its intrinsic value.



XRP price prediction post-ETF approval



Regarding the token’s price, ChatGPT-4o suggested that XRP could experience a substantial price escalation if the ETF is approved. The tool offered a conservative estimate, stating that if ETF approval leads to moderate increases in investment and interest, XRP might see a price increase of 2x to 3x over the next year from the current valuation. This would place XRP in the range of $1.08 to $1.62.



In a more optimistic scenario, where market conditions are favorable and investor interest surges, XRP could see a 5x to 7x increase, leading to a price range of $2.70 to $3.78.



Elsewhere, in the event of a highly bullish market with significant institutional adoption and broader market rallies, the tool projected that XRP might experience a 10x increase, pushing the price to around $5.40 or higher.

It will be interesting to monitor how the SEC approaches a possible XRP ETF, considering the regulatory agency has been in a long-term legal battle with XRP’s parent company, Ripple. 



Overall, an approval would be considered bullish for the United States cryptocurrency landscape over the ability to attract institutional investor capital into the sector.



At the moment, there are expectations that the legal matter will be resolved soon. Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Garlinghouse, continues criticizing the SEC over its “regulation by enforcement” approach.



XRP price analysis



By press time, XRP was trading at $0.53, having rallied about 0.3% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, XRP is up almost 3%.

Meanwhile, XRP’s main hurdle is reclaiming the $1 mark, which is pivotal for competing with assets such as Bitcoin. In the short term, investors will be monitoring the price as it aims to breach the $0.60 resistance.

Telegram's Explosive Gaming Trend Spurs Cryptocurrency Adoption with Viral Hits like Notcoin



                    

Telegram‘s vast user base is becoming fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption, with viral games like Notcoin surging in popularity.



In less than two months, Notcoin attracted over 30 million users on Telegram and established The Open Network (TON)-based cryptocurrency wallets. 




This “idle game,” where users tap their screens to earn NOT tokens, has integrated 3% of Telegram users into the Web3 space. 



Listing NOT tokens on major cryptocurrency exchanges has also provided financial benefits for casual gamers.



Inal Kardan, gaming lead at TON Foundation, discussed with Cointelegraph the unique ability of blockchain gaming to draw new users into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 




“Gaining 35 million users in five months, Notcoin showed us how games can work on Telegram and how easy it can be to onboard users,” Kardan said at the Next Block Expo in Warsaw.



Kardan noted that several Telegram-based games are quickly attracting significant user numbers and revenues by leveraging marketing mechanics like sharing and mining within Telegram. 



He described Telegram as an accessible and “somewhat untapped distribution channel” that integrates Web2 technologies with web page extensions and blockchain functionality.



Kardan also mentioned a shift from the “play-to-earn” models of popular Web3 games like Axie Infinity. 




Games like Notcoin are adopting newer approaches, including traditional monetization tactics like advertising.



Yat Siu, co-founder of blockchain gaming venture capital firm Animoca Brands, explained that the success of Web3 games on Telegram and TON is due to viral growth mechanics previously used on platforms like Facebook or the Apple App Store. 



“Neither Apple nor Google have been as flexible on Web3 games on their platforms the way TON and Telegram have been. It’s a competitive builder/growth advantage that TON is getting here too,” Siu said.



Siu emphasized that idle clicker games have always been popular, but the user engagement approach of games like Notcoin is a key differentiator.

“The Notcoin approach has far better value for end-users and is more aligned with growth incentives versus the adversarial nature of Web2 advertising business models,” he added.



Siu cited Gamee, a Web3 gaming firm using hyper-casual games on TON and Telegram, as an example. 



Gamee’s average daily active user count has increased to around one million due to staking and idle game mechanics.



Michał Dąbrowski, CEO and founder of blockchain game infrastructure provider Elympics, believes Web3 games are set to attract new cryptocurrency users. 



Dąbrowski told Cointelegraph that blockchain infrastructure bridges the gap for game developers struggling with monetization mechanics, allowing them to use cryptocurrency wallets to incentivize and engage players.



Elympics sees immense potential in the TON ecosystem, which is closely linked to Telegram’s large user base. “Notcoin is a prime example. 



It tapped into the viral aspect of a social platform like Telegram. Sharing is an important part of the mechanics,” Dąbrowski said. 



He added that Web3 functionality is revitalizing the idle gaming genre, giving users ownership and value from their gameplay through monetized soft currencies.

Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Could Send ETH to a New Record High, Says Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan - The Daily Hodl


								The chief investment officer of crypto fund manager Bitwise is predicting new all-time highs for Ethereum (ETH) if spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are ultimately approved.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a rule change that sets the stage for the potential green lighting of spot market Ethereum ETFs.










In a new interview on the Bankless podcast, Matt Hougan predicts investor inflows into ETH ETFs would total billions of dollars and drive ETH beyond its all-time high of about $4,900, which it hit back in November 2021.
“I don’t think Ethereum ETFs will match Bitcoin ETFs. But I do think it will be measured in terms of many billions of dollars… 
Will it be enough to drive Ethereum to new all-time highs? I definitely think that’s possible as well. If Bitcoin ETFs did $12 billion in their first four months, I think Ethereum ETFs will do less than half of that but more than a quarter of that. And that’s going to be pretty significant. Remember, that’s against a market with no net new supply. So I think there is real demand.” 
Hougan believes that ETFs with exposure to multiple digital assets will also launch in the future and investor demand will exist for the different types.
“I think if you think about the ETF investor market if I had to put numbers on it a year from now, I think you’ll have 30% of the market that’s Bitcoin only, you’ll have like 50% of the market that’s a mix, you’ll have 20% of the market that’s ETH only… 
Many professional investors looking at the crypto market are looking for sort of tech alpha. They’re looking for that high-returning asset. Ethereum fits nicely into that dialogue. So I think you’ll see all three. And I think the market as a whole will benefit from there being multiple crypto asset ETFs if that’s what we get. It makes the market feel more robust, more real. There’s more to talk about. I think it’ll be a net positive. These are going to be significant.” 
Ethereum is trading for $3,736 at time of writing, down more than 1% in the last 24 hours.

Long squeeze alert: This cryptocurrency could crash 30% soon


    The meme coin mania is back in the cryptocurrency market, and cryptocurrencies like PEPE show signals of being overvalued. This could foreshadow a long squeeze, as suggested by increased open interest (OI), high funding rates, and accumulated liquidations downwards.



Previously, the meme coin boom marked a local top, followed by a market crash and significant long-position liquidations. Should a similar pattern play out, this asset class is at the peril of suffering another hit despite positive social activity from influencers.



As of this writing, PEPE has $736.69 million in open interest, ranking fifth on CoinGlass. This value represents 11% of the meme coin’s $6.39 billion market cap, trading at $0.0000151. Notably, PEPE’s OI is larger than the open interest on XRP, which has a $29.73 billion market cap.







Despite a drop of 37.82% in the $3.07 billion 24-hour volume, the market’s open interest is surging by 8.85% on the meme coin.

PEPE funding rates and potential long squeeze



In particular, the consolidated exchanges’ funding rates for PEPE indicate an open interest weighted to long positions. Currently, long-position traders pay an APR of 52.66% to PEPE short-sellers as a mechanism to remedy derivatives imbalances.



This high funding rate could accelerate a long squeeze to the meme coin or, at least, incentivize traders to close these bullish positions.

Moreover, the one-week liquidation heatmap shows a likely liquidation price target of $0.0000107 per token to leveraged PEPE traders. Therefore, the meme coin could be set for a long-squeeze crash if sentiment shifts from bullish to bearish.

A price drop to this target would result in 30% losses to traders buying PEPE at current levels.



Still, the meme coin could continue upward if enough capital flows into it in the following days. Cryptocurrency traders and speculators must understand the volatile nature of these digital assets and act cautiously moving forward.

Nvidia has 'near zero chance' of outperforming Bitcoin this decade, say experts


    In light of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) impressive performance over the past decade, financial and cryptocurrency experts now anticipate a significant shift, predicting that the tech giant has “near zero chance” of outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the upcoming decade. 



This forecast is part of a wider discussion on the evolving dynamics between traditional high-growth tech stocks like Nvidia and growing digital currencies such as Bitcoin.



Nvidia, a leader in the semiconductor industry, recently celebrated a remarkable milestone with its stock price soaring following the latest earnings report. 







This surge contributed to an overall return of 21,558% from May 2014 to May 2024, a growth significantly fueled by the company’s pioneering efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming technologies. 



An X post from The Kobeissi Letter on May 25 highlighted this extraordinary performance: 




“$NVDA has officially joined the exclusive club of 250,000%+ in all-time returns. $10,000 invested in Nvidia in 1999 is worth $25.3 million today.”




Despite these impressive gains, Bitcoin has emerged as a formidable competitor. It has returned 13,048% over the same period, with recent trends suggesting even greater potential.  



Notably, the 90-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index rose to 0.46 last week, marking the highest level since late August. 



This reflects Bitcoin’s increasing alignment with mainstream financial markets, a trend further evidenced by its comparison with high-growth tech stocks.

Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, and Lyn Alden, a noted investment strategist, have expressed skepticism about Nvidia’s capacity to replicate its past decade’s success. 



They highlight Bitcoin’s advantages, such as its integration into mainstream financial products, including the recently approved Bitcoin ETFs, and its potential to outpace traditional assets due to its decentralized nature and extensive network effects.







Recent performance and market trends



The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10 was a significant milestone that further legitimized Bitcoin as a mainstream investment option, boosting its returns to 31.7% since then. 



This slight edge over Nvidia’s 30.2% in the same period underscores growing investor confidence in Bitcoin, aligning it with the growth trajectories typically associated with high-growth tech stocks.



Daniel Sempere Pico and Sina from 21st.capital have commented on the potential for Bitcoin’s financial networks and widespread adoption to drive more sustainable long-term growth compared to Nvidia’s AI-driven advancements. 



They argue that while Nvidia’s innovations in AI are impactful, the broader applications of Bitcoin in global financial systems present a more compelling investment narrative, suggesting that the future of investment may tilt increasingly towards digital currencies over traditional tech giants.



Nvidia and BTC analysis: A comparative look at market performance



BTC and NVDA comparison. Source: TradingView



From January 1, 2024, to May 25, 2024, BTC-USD and NVIDIA demonstrated distinct trading patterns and growth trajectories, reflecting their unique market positions and investor sentiments.



Bitcoin exhibited significant volatility, with prices ranging from approximately $39,450 to $73,750, leading to a 63% YTD increase. 



This volatility, highlighted by frequent relative strength index (RSI) signals of overvaluation and undervaluation, underscores the speculative nature of Bitcoin, influenced by diverse investor behaviors and market dynamics.



In contrast, NVIDIA displayed strong growth, with its stock price increasing from $475 to $1,064, marking a YTD rise of about 115%. 



The stability in NVIDIA’s RSI suggests consistent market sentiment and fewer fluctuations attributed to its ongoing advancements in AI and the semiconductor sectors, which are vital for technological innovation and impact across various industries.



As Bitcoin increasingly competes with major tech stocks, its transformative role in the investment landscape is becoming more pronounced. 



With broader adoption and alignment with financial markets, digital currencies are poised to dominate future growth, potentially overshadowing even the most established tech giants

Ethereum ETFs Could Trigger ETH Supply Crisis


The newly approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could trigger a supply crunch for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
Ethereum’s supply on centralized exchanges has hit an eight-year low, with only 12.78 million ETH available. This amount constitutes roughly 11% of the total supply.
Ethereum Demand Shock Expected

Analysts have noted that investors are withdrawing their ETH from exchanges just as the asset is poised to experience a surge in institutional demand. Such a decline in exchange balances is usually a bullish sign. It indicates that investors expect price growth and have no plans to sell their holdings in the short term.
This week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved several Ethereum ETFs, which many believe could boost demand for the cryptocurrency. 
Mara Schmiedt, CEO of Alluvial, points to the significant institutional interest generated by spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January. These ETFs now hold 800,000 BTC, demonstrating a growing institutional appetite. Consequently, she predicts Ethereum could see similar demand, potentially leading to a significant demand shock.

“What happens if there is $20 billion taken out of the market? It could be a tipping point in terms of supply and demand. We haven’t really seen this kind of rapid demand shock in the market before,” Schmiedt said.

Notably, ETH is already experiencing a surge in institutional activity. Blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock reported that anticipation around Ethereum ETF approval pushed the on-chain trading volume to a two-year high of $15.98 billion, largely driven by crypto whales.

Of the $15.98 billion, $14.33 billion came from transactions exceeding $100,000, typically conducted by whales. This accounts for 90% of the total traded volume on that day.

IntoTheBlock explained that the approval of ETH ETFs marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency acceptance. It continued that this move would likely increase ETH whales’ activity, as seen in recent large-volume transactions.

“The shifting landscape, underscored by substantial on-chain trading volumes, suggests a growing institutional and investor confidence in Ethereum. This trend is poised to gain momentum, potentially leading to even greater market movements,” IntoTheBlock added.
