Should FET, AGIX, and OCEAN Investors Worry About ASI?


Mergers between two companies in the crypto industry are rare. Still, it is even rarer to see three companies come together as Fetch.ai (FET), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), and SingularityNET (AGIX) plan to.
Whether this will turn out to be a spectacular or a disastrous spectacle is yet to be determined.
The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) Closer to Coming to Life
Earlier this week, SingularityNET announced that it would merge with Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol to form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI). The merger will unify the three networks into one Artificial Intelligence (AI) network.

Currently, these three tokens are worth around $3.2 billion combined. Following the merger, ASI is targeting a market cap of $7.5 billion, which would place the token among the top 20 cryptocurrencies in the world.
The merger is expected to begin on June 11 and be completed by June 13, after which the three tokens cease to exist. Token holders until June 13 will have a chance of swapping their holdings for ASI.
However, with a market cap target of 2x the current valuation of these three assets, the question arises if this is a possibility or a simple fantasy.
FET, AGIX, OCEAN Price Prediction: Where They Are and Where They Could Land
Fetch.ai (FET)
Fetch.ai’s price has been consolidating for the past two months, with every breakout attempt failing so far. FET is changing hands at $2.11, moving within the range of $1.95 and $2.49.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the bearish zone under the neutral line of 50.0. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It currently signals a bearish outcome over the next week, likely keeping FET consolidated.

SingularityNET (AGIX)
AGIX price has been doing well on the macro time frame. The altcoin has observed a consistent uptrend for the past two months, bringing the trading price to $0.89. AGIX is currently sitting under the critical resistance of $1.00.
If this barrier is breached, the crypto asset would have a shot at rising further towards rallying beyond $1.07.

However, this could take a while, and the anticipated merger date, June 11, is less than a week away.
Ocean Protocol
OCEAN’s price action has not been too impressive, either. The altcoin has been consolidating between $0.84 and $1.02 for a solid eight weeks. OCEAN nearly breached the upper limit once but failed to sustain the rise, returning to the trading price of $0.89.

The chances of the altcoin dipping to test the support floor of $0.84 are much higher than a breakout.

Thus, given the current market conditions and despite the rise in AI, these three tokens are witnessing slow growth. The potential of these assets combining and skyrocketing from positions 60, 80, and 143 to become a top-20 asset seems a little difficult.

Senate Crypto Bill: Potential Impact on Digital Assets

This week, a bill placed on the Senate calendar introduces several provisions that could impact digital asset protocols and tokens. Although it does not explicitly ban digital asset protocols, its broad scope could allow it to become an attack vector for anti-crypto aspects of the US government.The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence passed the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (IAA) by a unanimous 17-0 vote in May, as Senator Warner’s office reported. The bill, S. 4443, authorizes funding, provides legal authorities, and enhances congressional oversight for the US Intelligence Community (IC).Specifically, Section 423 of the bill allows the Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions prohibiting transactions between any US person and a “foreign digital asset transaction facilitator” who has knowingly facilitated significant transactions with foreign terrorist organizations, specially designated global terrorist organizations, or other sanctioned entities. The definition of “foreign digital asset transaction facilitator” is broad, covering any foreign person or group that “controls, operates, or makes available a digital asset protocol or similar facility, or otherwise materially assists in the purchase, sale, exchange, custody, or other transaction involving an exchange or transfer of value using digital assets.”While this does not constitute an outright ban, even protocols such as Aave, Uniswap, or stablecoins like USDT could potentially be designated as sanctioned “foreign digital asset transaction facilitators” if they are determined to have knowingly facilitated prohibited transactions with sanctioned entities. This could restrict US persons from transacting with them. However, the bill does not ban these protocols or tokens outright solely for being potentially accessible to sanctioned entities. There would need to be a determination that they knowingly facilitated prohibited transactions.“FOREIGN DIGITAL ASSET TRANSACTION FACILITATOR.—The term “foreign digital asset transaction facilitator” means any foreign person or group of foreign persons that, as determined by the Secretary, controls, operates, or makes available a digital asset protocol or similar facility, or otherwise materially assists in the purchase, sale, exchange, custody, or other transaction involving an exchange or transfer of value using digital assets.”Tether has frequently complied with requests to freeze tokens for US-sanctioned entities. Regardless, US institutions have repeatedly targeted it for allegedly allowing such activity, with competitor Circle adding to the rhetoric in front of Congress earlier this year. Aave, Uniswap, and others banned wallets that interacted with TornadoCash to comply with US sanctions in 2022. Still, if the Treasury deems previous interactions as “materially assisting” sanctioned entities, this new legislation could target them, in the worst-case scenario, the crypto industry.Given the bill’s importance and historical context, it is likely that some form of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 will pass. However, the exact provisions, especially those related to digital assets and protocols, may be subject to changes during the legislative process. The bill’s progress and any amendments will need to be monitored to understand its final impact on open-source protocols and decentralized tokens.Per Senator Warner’s office, the bill has cleared a significant hurdle by being reported favorably by the Select Committee on Intelligence and placed on the Senate calendar for further consideration. This indicates strong support and a positive trajectory through the legislative process.Ultimately, the bill aims to enhance oversight and potential sanctions around digital assets but does not constitute an outright ban on major DeFi protocols or stablecoins at this point. Their operations could face restrictions if they are found to have facilitated prohibited transactions with sanctioned entities, necessitating careful compliance and fair treatment by regulatory authorities.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Kanter's Regulatory Response On AI Monopolies


                                U.S. Antitrust Chief to Scrutinize AI Sector for Monopoly Risks                                The United States antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter has declared the need to investigate the AI industry due to the alleged monopolization of the market. To avoid the domination of several companies, Kanter’s analysis will encompass several facets of AI such as computing capacity, data utilization, and hardware access.What’s the News?Jonathan Kanter, the U. S. antitrust enforcer has pointed out the fact that it is high time that regulators focused on the AI industry. During an interview, Kanter stressed the need to look into the competition and find monopoly choke points. These points include computing power for AI, data for training LLMs, cloud providers’ domination, engineering talent, and AI hardware.Kanter said that it is crucial to intervene early to address the problem of large technology companies monopolizing the AI market. He stated that the current status of AI competition is at its highest level and active steps are needed to sustain this level of competition. According to Kanter, if regulators intervene in real-time, they can be less intrusive to the companies as they can manage monopoly threats adequately.Impacts of AI MonopolyThe concentration of the AI industry is another factor that poses numerous questions. Another challenge is the limited availability of graphics processing units (GPUs) necessary for training LLMs. When people want to use these innovative products, they begin to focus on how chipmakers are distributing their chips. This is especially important to discuss as firms such as Nvidia record increased revenues and stock prices because of the high sales of their GPUs. The overall revenues in the first quarter of 2023 were recorded to be 262% higher than the same period of the previous year which took Nvidia’s valuation over $2.5 trillion.Furthermore, monopolies in AI can cause a more significant problem of power consolidation that kills the spirit of innovation and enhances social imparity. Recently Singularity NET’s Chief Operating Officer Janet Adams expressed her concerns about big tech companies taking over artificial general intelligence (AGI). Adams also points out that if the creation of AGI will be in the hands of several large companies the creation will be focused on making money and may not bring a positive impact on society and may lead to a dystopian future.Preventions to avoid the monopoly of AITo avoid monopolistic control in the AI sector the following steps can be taken. Kanter referred to the current government programs that have been put in place to help increase production like the Chips and Science Act of 2022. This legislation provides $39 billion of subsidies for chip manufacturing inside the United States, intending to strengthen the local supply chain and cut dependence on foreign manufacturers.Also, decentralizing the development of Artificial Intelligence through the use of blockchain technology could be a significant move. This would spread the advancements in AI among a larger number of players, and thus, the advantages of AI would be enjoyed by a larger number of people. Thus, regulators can encourage the creation of more open-source AI projects and support less experienced developers.ConclusionThus, constant monitoring of the AI sector and its activities is crucial as the sector grows rapidly. Jonathan Kanter’s approach of being aggressive in identifying potential monopolies in AI is good for ensuring that there is no monopolistic behavior in the market. Thus, the regulators should focus on eliminating the monopoly choke points and encouraging decentralization to guarantee that the AI advantages will be distributed and innovations will be encouraged. As per CoinGabbar, AI’s future is most likely to be shaped by these two poles to avoid monopolistic tendencies while encouraging technological development in the interest of humanity.Also Read: Bots On The Boats With AI, Is It Driving Humans?

How Bitcoin, Ethereum pushed crypto market cap to over $2 trillion - AMBCrypto



The crypto market capitalization has increased slightly in the last 24 hours.
BTC and ETH’s price increase contributed to the increase in the market cap.

The cryptocurrency market recently experienced a slight increase in market capitalization. This growth was largely driven by the prices of Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH], which dominate the market. 
Additionally, both assets have been experiencing significant accumulation volume recently.
Bitcoin, Ethereum contribute to market increase
According to data from CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency market’s market capitalization has increased by over 1% in the last 24 hours. 
Currently, the market cap stands at over $2.6 trillion. The analysis revealed that Bitcoin accounts for over 53% of the market cap, amounting to approximately $1.4 trillion, while Ethereum holds nearly 18%, valued at around $463 billion.
Source: CoinMarketCap
Further analysis revealed that the market capitalization increased by almost $1 trillion from the end of last month to now. 
At the end of May, the market cap was approximately $1.54 trillion. Currently, it stands at around $2.54 trillion, indicating an increase of nearly $1 trillion.
Bitcoin, Ethereum see increased accumulation
Recent analysis indicates an increase in the accumulation of Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past few days. This accumulation coincides with notable price movements, contributing to the rise in market capitalization.
According to data from CryptoQuant, the wallet reserves holding between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoins have been increasing.
These wallets now collectively hold over 3.6 million BTC, indicating substantial accumulation despite recent price fluctuations. 
Further analysis showed that this trend has been ongoing since March. Additionally, the wallets in the 1,000 BTC category now account for about 40% of the total Bitcoin supply.
Additionally, data indicates that Ethereum has been experiencing increased accumulation by large addresses. 
The chart reveals an upward trend in accumulation from wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH. These addresses now hold over 340,000 ETH, valued at more than $1.3 billion.
Ethereum sees more holders than Bitcoin
Bitcoin and Ethereum have both experienced increased accumulation, but Ethereum currently has more holders. 
According to data from Santiment, the number of Ethereum holders has surged in recent years, reaching nearly 123 million. In contrast, the number of Bitcoin holders stands at around 54.2 million.
Source: Santiment
This indicates that the number of Ethereum holders is more than double that of Bitcoin holders. A major reason for this could be the cost of entry into these assets. 
Currently, Bitcoin’s value has increased again, with predictions of further rises in the future. 
This increase may drive more traders toward alternative assets like Ethereum and others, subsequently impacting the prices of these assets.
How ETH, BTC have trended in the last 24 hours
AMBCrypto’s daily analysis of Ethereum revealed a positive price movement on 5th June, with a 1.48% increase, bringing its price to around $3,866. 
Despite recent struggles, Ethereum has managed to stay within this price range. As of this writing, it is still trading in the $3,800 range, with a decline of less than 1%.
Source: TradingView
Additionally, an analysis of Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that it remains in a strong bull trend. As of this writing, its RSI is above 65.
Analysis of the Bitcoin price trend showed positive bounces over the past few days. The chart indicated a five-day consecutive rise, taking its price from around $67,700 to over $71,000.

Read Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2024-25

By the end of trading on 5th June, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $71,121, marking an increase of almost 1%. As of this writing, it has slightly declined to the $70,000 region, with a decrease of less than 1%.
According to its RSI, BTC remained in a bull trend despite the recent price decline. The RSI was above 60 as of this writing.

Is Bitcoin (BTC) Attempting to Push to a New All-Time High Next?


Bitcoin (BTC) currently trades within an ascending channel. The rally in the past few days has pushed the leading coin’s price toward the upper line of this channel.
If the coin successfully crosses above this line, it will have breached a key resistance level of $72,690.
Bitcoin “Big Boys” Weigh In
Bitcoin’s recent rally above $70,000 is partly due to the uptick in the coin’s whale activity over the past few weeks. 

On-chain data reveals a significant increase in the number of large daily transactions over the past 30 days. BTC transactions valued between $100,000 and $1 million have surged 9% during this period. 
Even more notable, transactions valued above $10 million have skyrocketed by 165% in the last month.
Bitcoin Whale Activity. Source: IntoTheBlock
Upticks like these in BTC transactions suggest increased participation from institutional investors, such as hedge funds, investment firms, and corporations, during the period under review. 
This attention from this cohort of BTC investors played out on June 4 when the US-based spot BTC ETFs recorded its 15 consecutive days of inflows, Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a post on X.

“The ability to bounce back w/ renewed interest after a couple nasty selloffs is rare for hot sauce type strategies. Shows staying power.” Balchunas added.

However, general market sentiment around the leading crypto continues to be negative. On-chain data showed that despite BTC’s recent price performance, its weighted sentiment has been negative since May 23.

With a weighted sentiment of -0.3 when writing, there was more negative chatter than positive around BTC on social media.
BTC Price Prediction: Is Demand Losing Steam?
At press time, BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was in an uptrend. This indicator measures an asset price momentum. 

It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is used to identify overbought or oversold market conditions. At 64, the indicator’s value showed steady demand for BTC.
However, BTC’s declining Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) forms a bearish divergence that hints at a potential price dip. This indicator measures money flow into and out of an asset’s market.
When it declines when an asset’s price rises, a bearish divergence is formed. This divergence suggests that despite the rising price, buying pressure is decreasing, indicating a potential price decline.
Bitcoin Analysis. Source: TradingView

If this trend continues, and the CMF continues to record lower values, BTC may eventually retrace and slip back to $68,180.

However, if buying pressure regains momentum and spikes, it will push the coin’s price above resistance at $72,690.

Investment Company VanEck Targeted This Figure for Ethereum by 2030! Is it possible? Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Global investment firm VanEck has set a new price target for Ethereum (ETH), predicting that the Ethereum network's native token will reach $22,000 by 2030.
VanEck Predicts Ethereum (ETH) to Reach $22,000 by 2030
This ambitious estimate represents a significant increase from current trading levels of approximately $3,850.


VanEck attributed this potential increase to Ethereum's disruptive capabilities and significant cash flow generation for token holders.
The firm emphasized that Ethereum has revolutionized various sectors such as finance, banking, payments, marketing, advertising, social media, gaming, infrastructure and artificial intelligence.





The report emphasized that Ethereum's technology offers lower costs, greater efficiency and greater transparency, which could shift significant market share from traditional financial and technology institutions to blockchain-based solutions.
VanEck estimates that this shift could tap into a total existing market (TAM) of $15 trillion.



Furthermore, VanEck predicts that free cash flows from holding Ethereum will reach $66 billion by 2030, further increasing its valuation to its projected target of $22,000.
The firm, which has filed to list an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), also predicts that these ETFs could surpass Bitcoin ETFs in size.





The report expressed confidence that spot Ethereum ETFs are nearing approval to trade on US exchanges.
Such approval would enable financial advisors and institutional investors to hold ether with the security of qualified custodians and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs.

Robinhood Bets Big on Crypto with $200M Acquisition of Bitstamp


																Popular trading platform, Robinhood, has reached an agreement to acquire cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp. This purchase aims to bolster Robinhood’s presence in the crypto space across the world while simultaneously attracting institutional clients by offering new products.
The all-cash deal is valued at $200 million and is anticipated to be finalized in the first half of 2025.
According to the official press release, the deal’s completion is based on customary closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. The acquisition is estimated to be finalized in the first half of 2025, provided all requirements are met.
Barclays Capital Inc. acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Robinhood throughout this transaction, while Galaxy Digital Partners LLC served as the exclusive financial advisor to Bitstamp.
Commenting on the development, Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Crypto, said,
“The acquisition of Bitstamp is a major step in growing our crypto business. Bitstamp’s highly trusted and long standing global exchange has shown resilience through market cycles. By seamlessly coupling customer experience with safety across geographies, the Bitstamp team has established one of the strongest reputations across retail and institutional crypto investors.”
As a result of the acquisition, the teams from Bitstamp and Robinhood will integrate, combining their expertise and resources.
This move is anticipated to facilitate Robinhood’s goal of expanding its global reach beyond the United States and attracting institutional clients to its platform. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells Notice to Robinhood, alleging potential violations of securities laws last month.
Despite the regulatory scrutiny in the country, Robinhood’s crypto revenue soared to $618 million, reflecting a 40% year-over-year increase.
In an effort to expand its crypto offerings, the platform launched crypto trading services for clients within the European Union in December.

Bitcoin and Other Crypto Assets on the Cusp of ‘Significant Move,’ Says Jason Pizzino - Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl


								Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Jason Pizzino is offering his thoughts on the potential trajectory for the digital asset market going forward.
Pizzino tells his 328,000 YouTube subscribers that the Average True Range indicator is suggesting that “another significant move” is imminent for Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets.










The ATR is used to measure the volatility of an asset with higher values indicating higher volatility and lower values indicating lower volatility.
According to Pizzino, Bitcoin recently witnessed a relatively small range and this could portend a bullish move ahead.
“Basically, we’ve seen one of the smallest days since January. So Bitcoin did a $500 range day on the weekend on Saturday… typically when this happens, you see some sort of windup period… you can see in each of these occasions you will see a pretty significant move to the upside.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube
The widely followed analyst says that Bitcoin is “still looking relatively good” and is well-placed for the “next leg to start”. According to Pizzino, Bitcoin needs to first undergo a consolidation phase before it can rise above the all-time high of $73,800 reached on March 14th.
“Does not mean that we’re going to blow up in a matter of days or weeks. But I think we could still take a bit of time here. Bitcoin’s price has got to consolidate above $72,000.”
Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube
Bitcoin is trading at $70,984 at time of writing.
Turning to altcoins, Pizzino says that the combined market cap of this class of crypto assets is currently in a phase similar to other periods that preceded a breakout.
“I see this as a stealth move for the altcoins. And the stronger ones are going to get the gains when this breaks out. So the theory here is we’re in stealth – the stealth is identified here with small average true ranges of the bars.”

Cardano's Growing Adoption Could Fuel Next Bull Run, Analyst Says


							

Dan Gambardello thinks Cardano’s ADA is preparing for a parabolic bull run.



Cardano Foundation partnered with Argentina, and Dubai police started using the technology.



Historical data suggest ADA is set to rally significantly.




Renowned crypto analyst Dan Gambardello believes Cardano’s ADA is gearing up for a parabolic bull run following recent developments in the project’s ecosystem.



In an X post, Gambardello highlighted the Cardano Foundation’s collaboration with Argentina and Dubai police utilizing the technology as significant catalysts for the blockchain project.







In addition to these events, Gambardello noted that the US is exploring the deployment of Cardano in voting processes. He believes these developments will collectively contribute to Cardano’s growth, ushering ADA into the new era of Voltaire, a community-run chain, as charts suggest a potential parabolic bull market.



Meanwhile, Gambardello shared an ADA monthly chart to illustrate how the altcoin’s historical trend supports his projection. The chart reveals that ADA is mirroring its 2019 to 2022 movement when it experienced a parabolic rally.



In 2019, ADA traded sideways for an extended period before breaking above a significant moving average. The surge began after the token retested the moving average ahead of the bull cycle, causing ADA to soar over 5,000% in its most significant rally.









Notably, ADA has replicated this trend, as Gambardello’s post demonstrates. The altcoin traded sideways before breaking above the same moving average. The current price action shows ADA retesting the moving average, prompting the analyst to project a move similar to the 2021 parabolic surge.



Gambardello’s projection isn’t solely based on technical indicators. He also cites the aforementioned efforts by the Cardano Foundation to increase adoption and the project’s expansion into new territories. Such developments, coupled with the favorable technical arrangements, could catalyze a significant surge for ADA in the upcoming bull cycle. ADA was trading at $0.458 at press time, according to TradingView data.

For instance, Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts that the new Hong Kong crypto products, including Ethereum ETFs, could see about $1 billion in net inflows in their first year or two.Given the larger scale of the U.S. ETF market, the inflows for U.S.-based Ethereum ETFs could be substantially higher​.Also Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $887M Inflow On Wednesday, Second-Highest EverPotential Impact On BitcoinThere is a concern that the new capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs might cannibalize the inflows that would otherwise go into Bitcoin ETFs. However, the data suggests a more nuanced picture. Bitcoin ETFs have also seen strong inflows, with products like BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT leading the way with $720 million in net inflows recently.This indicates robust investor appetite for both cryptocurrencies​.Price ImplicationsThe impact on prices will depend on the balance between new capital inflows and the potential shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum investments. If the inflows are primarily new capital, we could see upward pressure on both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Conversely, if there is significant cannibalization, Bitcoin might experience slower price appreciation relative to Ethereum.The upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will be a key forum to discuss these developments.Industry leaders will offer their insights on the evolving dynamics of digital assets, providing valuable perspectives on how these ETF inflows might shape the market in the coming months.Read Next: Mike Novogratz Predicts Bitcoin To $100K By The End Of 2024Image: Shutterstock

G-III Apparel Group Beats Q1 Expectations with $0.12 EPS - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (NASDAQ: GIII) reported a robust performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended April 30, 2024. The company’s net sales were $609.7 million, a slight increase from $606.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net income significantly rose to $5.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $3.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the prior year’s quarter.



The company’s non-GAAP net income per diluted share remained steady at $0.12, as there were no non-GAAP adjustments during this period. Morris Goldfarb, G-III’s Chairman and CEO, attributed the strong start to fiscal 2025 to double-digit increases in DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld and a successful relaunch of Donna Karan. Goldfarb highlighted the company’s strategic investment in All We Wear Group (AWWG) to accelerate its European expansion.



Additionally, the amendment and extension of their ABL credit facility to $700 million, extending the maturity to 2029, further solidifies G-III’s financial position. With approximately $1 billion in cash and availability, the company is well-positioned to continue investing in its brands and infrastructure.



G-III Apparel Group Reports $0.12 EPS Against -$0.03 Expected



When comparing the current performance against expectations, G-III Apparel Group exceeded its earnings per share (EPS) projections. The expectations for the quarter were an EPS of -0.03, but the company delivered an EPS of $0.12 per diluted share. This notable performance was driven by strategic investments and a strong market response to their owned brands. Revenue expectations were set at $614.35 million. While the actual revenue of $609.7 million fell slightly short, the company’s overall financial health and strategic moves overshadowed this minor shortfall.



The increase in net income and EPS indicates effective cost management and successful brand investments. Despite the marginal miss on revenue expectations, the company’s ability to surpass EPS forecasts by a significant margin demonstrates strong operational efficiency. 





G-III Apparel Group Updates Full Year Outlook, Expects Net Sales of Approx. $3.2 Billion, EPS between $3.58 and $3.68



G-III Apparel Group has updated its fiscal 2025 outlook with cautious optimism. The company expects net sales of approximately $3.20 billion and net income between $170.0 million and $175.0 million, or between $3.58 and $3.68 per diluted share. This forecast compares to net sales of $3.10 billion and net income of $176.2 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, for fiscal 2024. The guidance reflects a balanced approach, considering incremental expenses associated with new product launches and marketing initiatives. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, G-III anticipates net sales of approximately $650.0 million, compared to $659.8 million in the same period last year. Net income is expected to range between $10.0 million and $15.0 million, or $0.22 and $0.32 per share, compared to $16.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the previous year’s second quarter. The guidance takes into account the ongoing investments in marketing and technology to support brand expansion and operational capabilities.

Ciena Beats Q2 Forecasts, Reports Significant Drop in EPS Y/Y - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



Ciena Corporation (NYSE: CIEN), a networking systems, services, and software company, announced its unaudited financial results for the fiscal second quarter ending April 27, 2024. The company reported revenue of $910.8 million, a decrease from $1.13 billion in the same quarter last year. The GAAP net loss for the quarter was $(16.8) million, or $(0.12) per diluted common share, compared to a net income of $57.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share, in the fiscal second quarter of 2023. Adjusted (non-GAAP) net income was $39.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted common share, down from $110.4 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share, in the previous year.



The company saw a decline in various segments, with the Networking Platforms segment experiencing a significant revenue drop from $914.9 million in Q2 FY 2023 to $676.3 million in Q2 FY 2024. Despite the challenging environment, Ciena’s Global Services segment grew, increasing revenue from $127.8 million to $134.7 million year-over-year. CEO Gary Smith emphasized the company’s focus on extending its leadership in optical networking to meet the growing demand for bandwidth.



Ciena’s Adjusted EPS Drops Significantly Y/Y But Outperforms Expectations at $0.27 per Share



When comparing Ciena’s current performance against market expectations, the company slightly exceeded revenue expectations but fell short on earnings per share (EPS). Analysts had projected revenue of $895.5 million and an EPS of $0.14. Ciena reported actual revenue of $910.8 million, surpassing the revenue forecast by approximately $15.3 million. However, the adjusted EPS of $0.27 was significantly higher than the expected $0.14, indicating better-than-expected cost management and operational efficiency.



Despite the revenue beat, the year-over-year revenue and profitability decline highlights Ciena’s ongoing challenges. The gross margin slightly decreased from 43.1% to 42.7% on a GAAP basis, and the operating margin turned negative at (0.4%) compared to 9.1% in the previous year. The adjusted operating margin also declined from 13.8% to 6.8%, reflecting the impact of lower sales and higher operating expenses.





Ciena Repurchased Approximately 1.1 Million Shares for $57 Million



Ciena provided guidance for the upcoming quarters, emphasizing a cautious yet optimistic outlook. The company expects continued robust growth in bandwidth demand, which it plans to leverage by focusing on its core strengths in optical networking. Management highlighted that service providers are still working through existing inventory, which has impacted short-term sales but is expected to normalize over time.



The company also noted several key metrics expected to influence future performance. Cash and investments totaled $1.42 billion, and cash flow from operations was $58.5 million for the quarter. These strong liquidity positions provide Ciena with the financial flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and navigate market uncertainties. Additionally, the company repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $57.0 million, reflecting confidence in its long-term prospects.

Crypto expert PlanB drops bombshell Bitcoin prediction for June 2024


    After Bitcoin (BTC) has retaken the important psychological level at $71,000, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset seems to be moving towards the exceptionally bullish price target set by a renowned cryptocurrency analyst, who believes it might reach sooner rather than later.



Specifically, Bitcoin could hit the target price of “at least the $100,000 level we should see any time soon,” according to the analysis by pseudonymous crypto trading expert PlanB, who has shared his insights on the maiden crypto asset in a video streamed on his YouTube channel on June 1.

PlanB’s Bitcoin price prediction



Indeed, according to the crypto expert’s 200-week moving average (MA) chart, Bitcoin is looking at a price of $100,000 shortly, which coincides with his earlier shared stock-to-flow (S2F) model, which also sees the largest asset in the crypto sector by market capitalization rushing towards this high price mark.







Bitcoin stock-to-flow (S2F) model. Source: PlanB Twitter



Earlier in mid-May, PlanB argued that Bitcoin miner revenue tended to recover in two to five months after the halving, and after that, the price of Bitcoin “goes vertical.” As it happens, June 19 will mark two months since the last Bitcoin halving, so the vertical price action could occur shortly after that date.



Bitcoin price analysis



Currently, Bitcoin is changing hands at the price of $71,030, which suggests a modest increase of 0.12% in the last 24 hours while making more significant progress of 4.60% across the previous seven days, adding up to the advance of 11.50% over the past month, as per the latest chart data on June 6.

All things considered, Bitcoin could, indeed, hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $100,000 in the following weeks, as the crypto analyst has opined. However, things in the crypto market can sometimes change entirely, so doing one’s own research when investing is critical.

Vitalik Buterin slams celebrity memecoins, calls for "better direction" - AMBCrypto



Celebrities like Iggy Azalea launched memecoins, showcasing widespread crypto adoption among public figures.
Vitalik Buterin critiques celebrity memecoins, but community support remains strong.

In the year 2024, the trend of memecoins has gained considerable traction, with celebrities like Iggy Azalea, the American rapper, joining the fray by launching their own tokens, such as MOTHER IGGY on Solana [SOL]. 
Caitlyn Jenner, rappers Soul Ja Boy and Rich The Kid have also recently released their crypto tokens.
Buterin voices dissatisfaction!
However, Ethereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed discontent with the surge of celebrity-endorsed memecoins and emphasized the necessity for more relevant projects in the crypto sphere. 
In his recent X post, Buterin noted, 
“I’m feeling quite unhappy about with ‘this cycle’s celebrity experimentation’ so far. ‘Financialization as a means toward an end’, I can respect if the end is worthy (healthcare, open source software, art, etc).’” 
He further added, 
“Ashton and Mila’s Stoner Cats was vastly more honorable than anything we’ve seen from this 2024 celebrity memecoin era – at least there was an actual show being funded. How do we push things in a better direction?” 
Here, Buterin discusses “Stoner Cats,” a webcomic by Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, lauded for its remarkable success in 2023. The SEC then charged the creators for an unregistered offering of NFTs. As per an SEC filling,  
“Stoner Cats sold its entire supply of NFTs in just 35 minutes, generating proceeds of over $8 million, most of which were then resold – not held as collectibles — in the secondary market within months.”
Buterin’s concerns regarding celebrities’ growing interest in memecoins raise a critical question: Is the future of cryptocurrency misdirected?
Buterin’s advice to scale celebrity-backed memecoins
In response, the Ethereum co-founder recommended various strategies to enhance celebrity-backed crypto ventures, focusing on public benefit, engaging content, and project sustainability. He suggested,

Memecoin craze despite crictsism
On the community front, reactions appear largely supportive of memecoins, as observed by researcher Gumshoe in their recent X post. 
“Iggy went from being called a scammer to having Vitalik and Ethereum OGs discussing the celebrity memecoin meta in a week. Pretty amazing if you ask me.” 
Despite Buterin’s expressed concerns about memecoins, which stemmed from a tweet by Chris Burniske, Mother Iggy experienced a notable 40% surge in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum saw a more modest increase of 1.16% at the time of writing.
All in all, ‘Aden | The Wolf of X’ put it best when he said, 
“#Memecoin season 2024 unstoppable.”

Shiba Inu's 2024 Roadmap: Team Member Outlines Key Developments So Far | Bitcoinist.com


								In a detailed update, Lucie, a well-known member of the Shiba Inu team and marketing head has outlined several key developments and achievements for the project in 2024. The successful introduction of Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s ground-breaking layer-2 blockchain solution intended to improve scalability and transaction efficiency, was one of Lucie’s many highlights of the noteworthy progress accomplished thus far.
These advancements highlight Shiba Inu’s continuous dedication to expansion and innovation, setting the project up for long-term success in the rapidly changing cryptocurrency market.
Major Developments For Shiba Inu In 2024
Shiba Inu team member, Lucie started with the Shibarium blockchain solution. Lucie noted that since the solution was introduced it has advanced significantly, improving the scalability and efficiency of the Shiba ecosystem.

Launched in August 2023, the blockchain marked a significant step for the project’s ecosystem, attracting millions of users during its first few weeks. Shibarium aims at tackling scalability, which was one of the main issues facing the Shiba Inu ecosystem. 
With a sharp reduction in transaction prices, Shibarium seeks to ease customers’ long-standing complaints about Ethereum’s high gas expenses. This presents a positive image, suggesting that Shibarium may establish Shiba Inu as a strong challenger for DeFi.
SHIBdentity is the next development pointed out by the marketing lead. The team introduced the initiative to usher in a new era of digital identity. It aims at giving users full control of their digital identity by employing valid credentials that can be verified and trustworthy authentification. 
Moreover, it provides real-time communication, spam reduction, and private peer-to-peer chat. In order to provide human-readable names and foster friendly messaging, SHIBdentity will need to communicate with Shib Name Service (SNS).
The next key development is the introduction of Shiba Inu’s SHEboshis Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) collections. For those interested in NFTs, these collections pave the way for the development of hybrid tokens that provide shared ownership and uniqueness.
SHEboshi collections consist of 20,000 unique arts, launched as a DN404/ERC-404 token on the Ethereum network. It is important to note that SHEboshis, which embodies creativity, art, and the spirit of the SHIB community, marks a bold step into the future.
Upcoming Layer 3 Blockchain
Lucie also underscored the project’s much-anticipated Privacy-Focused Layer 3 Blockchain Development. This layer 3 blockchain intends to improve user privacy by enabling computations on encrypted data without the need for decryption.

So far, the team has managed to raise $12 million in funding to develop the blockchain. As part of the investment round, the yet-to-be-released TREAT was sold to a group of venture capital firms that included Animoca Brands, Polygon Ventures, Big Brain Holdings, and Shima Capital, among others.
Lucie further emphasized that Shiba Inu’s attendance at the Token2049 conference in Dubai was another significant achievement for the project this year. Midway through April, Shiba Inu took part in the event as a gold sponsor.
Lastly, the marketing lead underlined the integration of ShibaSwap, the native decentralized exchange (DEX) of the Shiba Inu ecosystem on the Shibarium blockchain. A key component of this integration is to improve the capacity of users to directly impact the ecosystem of the solution by generating new liquidity pools for the tokens they desire.

Avalanche strengthens the security of its native wallet

The cryptographic ecosystem of Avalanche is looking to increase the security of its infrastructure by implementing external web3 solutions.
Today Core, the native wallet of Avalanche developed by Ava Labs, announced a strategic partnership with the provider Blockaid, which provides a suite of tools to simulate transactions before their actual execution and avoid cyber scams such as phishing and hack.
Security is a very important topic within the crypto sector, where from 2017 to today hacking activities have been carried out for a total damage of 8.2 billion dollars.
Let’s see everything in detail below.

Avalanche Core forms a partnership with Blockaid to prevent phishing and hacks within its ecosystem
Today Core, the famous Avalanche cryptocurrency wallet developed by the parent company Ava Labs, revealed an integration with the Israeli provider of web3 security solutions Blockaid, with the aim of making its infrastructures impenetrable and offering users a convenient tool that highlights the presence of danger factors.
In detail, Blockaid uses highly sophisticated technology that allows transactions to be simulated before being executed by the user, enabling the identification and prevention of potential fraudulent activities such as phishing attacks, address poisoning, and hacks.
One of the biggest current limitations of decentralized non-custodial wallets is that when performing any operation (signature, approve spending, execution, etc.), it is not intuitively clear what is being confirmed, unless the underlying code is examined.
It often happens that several individuals are scammed precisely because they end up on malicious sites that invite them to connect their wallet and approve seemingly legitimate transactions, but which then end up emptying all the funds contained within: see case Ledger Connect Kit.
Blockaid solves this problem thanks to its warning interface that allows examining each step in real-time by leveraging the extensive database of web3 threats possessed by the Israeli security company.
This service has been integrated in the past also by other similar web3 providers to Avalanche Core like Coinbase wallet and Metamask, helping various communities to keep up with the advancement and refinement of cyber scams.
The integration of Blockaid with one of the main infrastructures of Avalanche addresses the needs of the DeFi sector, which from 20217 to today has seen 8.2 billion dollars lost due to hacks and exploits. More recently, in April 2023, about 53 million dollars were stolen from various types of attacks.
The solution just integrated on Avalanche Core, in the past has helped other ecosystems to protect approximately 7.1 billion dollars, warning of potentially malicious operations for 500 million dollars.
Source: https://www.blockaid.io/
Regarding the excellent news, Akash Gupta, Head of Consumer Products at Ava Labs, the company that oversees the development of the Avalanche ecosystem, stated the following:
“This collaboration with Blockaid represents a significant step forward in providing users with security and control without compromising speed and ease of use. By integrating advanced security solutions into the Core suite, we ensure that users can explore the Avalanche ecosystem and beyond with complete peace of mind.”
Promoting high security and privacy standards within the decentralized finance industry is essential in order to move on to new onboarding challenges and truly aim for mass adoption. 
Avalanche is doing it the right way.
Other web3 tools focused on security and privacy
In addition to Blockaid, there are many other tools focused on the security and privacy of web3 transactions, which can be used by users of Avalanche and other ecosystems.
The most well-known is definitely Wallet Guard, an open-source extension for Chrome, iOS, and Brave that guides the end user through all cryptographic operations, providing pop-ups that explain what is being authorized when confirming a smart contract.
Wallet Guard, which also features a convenient security dashboard, has protected over 40 million dollars from scam activities, thanks to its timely alerts regarding potential frauds and hack.

Another very interesting service is that of Blowfish, available on Solana and on 14 EVM networks like Avalanche, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, which thanks to its interface warns users who are visiting fraudulent web3 sites.
Blowfish also warns if it perceives that the content of a tx being signed appears dangerous and explains what is being authorized when signing each smart contract and which funds will be used.

In order to safeguard one’s digital finances, the website Revoke.Cash is a must, which allows users to simply remove, through a unified dashboard, all previously signed token spending approvals, avoiding potential complications in case of a platform hack.
It often happens that when using a DEX and you have to approve the spending of a token, the authorization is not canceled at the end of the operation, leaving an attack vector for scammers and hackers.
Revoke works on over 80 decentralized networks, including Avalanche.

Among the other useful services in terms of web3 security, capable of preventing cyber attacks and saving our finances, we find Stelo, TrustCheck, Fire, Pocket Universe, AegisWeb3, and Web3 Antivirus.

Cardano’s (ADA) Future: Investors’ Decisions Are Crucial


Cardano’s (ADA) price is not reaping the benefits of the broader market cues as it remains sideways bound.
The reason is that no one other than the ADA whales opted to sell, creating a bearish atmosphere.
Cardano Whales Selling Sends Bearish Ripples

Cardano’s price has been influenced by its investors in the past, and this influence has only grown stronger now. The best example is the recent move from ADA whales, which the altcoin can still not recover from.
Addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA sold over 290 million ADA in a single day at the end of May. This $130 million worth of supply could likely have been to either secure gains or prevent further losses.
Regardless, since such large wallet holders’ selling and buying affect the direction of the price action, it wasn’t surprising that ADA consolidated following the selling.

However, this could change, and the investors who caused the dip also have the power to do so. At the time of writing, the addresses conducting transactions on the network have registered a surge.
Cardano’s growing participation is a positive sign for the asset, which translates to increased demand and higher liquidity. However, the mixed cues generated could lead to consolidation. Plus, rising participation combined with falling prices or slow growth creates a deviation between the two.

This deviation tends to flash a sell single, which causes further issues with the price action.
ADA Price Prediction: Breakout Will Be a While Away
Cardano’s price moved within a symmetrical triangle for two months. A symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern characterized by converging trendlines connecting a series of sequential peaks and troughs. 

This pattern typically indicates a period of consolidation before the price breaks out in the direction of the existing trend. While the outcome is likely bullish, this would warrant further sideways movement before something substantial. This would require ADA first to secure the $0.46 as a support floor.

Considering the aforementioned factors, bearish-neutral price action will likely continue its sideways movement.
However, if $0.46 is tested as a support floor, the bearish thesis could be invalidated. As a result, ADA could also rise to $0.50 and above, effectively eliminating all recent losses.

It’s time to end the SEC's war on crypto - Blockworks


The American government is badly damaged — we need public servants who care more about right or wrong, especially when it comes to the crypto industry.
I’m not denying that there are reasonable questions about how crypto firms should be regulated. Many policy questions still require legislation to resolve. But, our current system is broken.
The Securities and Exchange Commission traditionally does not expose itself and its credibility to an appellate beatdown. But this SEC is different. This SEC and Chair Gary Gensler have an extra-regulatory anti-crypto agenda. And they are using their power to obstruct and delay the industry — imposing their own preferences where they can. 
Gensler may not like bitcoin. But whether you decide to invest in bitcoin is up to you, not the SEC. 
What’s going on with Gensler at the SEC is clearly a culture of bad faith against crypto.  
Take January’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, which only came after years of good-faith applications from crypto industry participants. The SEC was helpless to explain or defend its decision to reject past spot bitcoin ETFs — not a leg to stand on, it was truly an embarrassment. The court then ruled that the SEC position was “arbitrary and capricious.” And ultimately, Chair Gensler was forced to vote to approve a bitcoin ETF he was hell-bent to obstruct.  
Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton provide a safe and easy way for US investors to buy bitcoin. They easily satisfy the SEC’s investor protection standards; they are in the best interest of the investors the SEC is sworn to protect. And three months after their launch, bitcoin ETFs hold $61 billion in assets.  
Or, take the recent SEC vs DEBT Box fiasco. Two SEC lawyers leading an anti-crypto action were forced to resign after a federal judge sanctioned the agency for “gross abuse of power.”
The SEC misled the court to get a temporary restraining order against crypto firm DEBT Box. This action was ex parte — without any notice to DEBT Box. They violated the court’s trust.
Forced to resign? After that debacle, the SEC should have turned off the lawyers’ key cards before they got back to the office. But maybe they were following marching orders. 
Where do we go from here?
This lack of communication between regulators and crypto participants has been going on for years, and needs to change. Many other issues in crypto could be navigated in good faith if regulators simply engaged with the industry. 
Back in 2021, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong found that the SEC was the only government branch unwilling to meet with the firm. Coinbase is a public company. And it is now in litigation with the SEC relating to questions that could have been discussed and resolved in good faith back in 2021. 
But good faith left the building when Gary Gensler walked in. 
For example, take now the public spectacle of Gensler in front of Congress in April 2023, when he evaded the fundamental question of whether crypto’s second largest asset, ETH, is a security. Documents in the Consensys lawsuit against the SEC describe how the agency was pursuing an investigation into the nature of ETH days before Gensler testified.
Frustrating.  
“Chair Gensler refused to answer questions regarding the SEC’s classification of ether,” Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) said on X. “New court filings show this was an intentional attempt to misrepresent the commission’s position.”  
Ethereum, established in 2015, has a market value of $457 billion. We should have a public statement from the SEC on this one. And to add to the federal regulatory charade, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission went to court this year claiming Ethereum is a commodity and not a security for the purpose of federal regulation. Do these guys talk to each other? 
If the SEC thinks Ethereum is a security, why not just say it? That’s an important question. If you are not steeped in crypto, you may struggle to answer it. But regulatory clarity unlocks the potential of the industry. And Gensler does not want that to happen. He has an agenda unrelated to his job as a regulator, and he is backed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, founder of the “anti-crypto army,” the world’s smallest and most unpopular political unit. 
Why should we care about crypto? 
Here’s why: Crypto is a disruptive transition of the kind this country normally leads and dominates. Capital and talent are gravitating to the industry. 
Crypto orchestrates the deployment of capital to overcome seemingly insurmountable barriers to entry. Look at how the US dollar stablecoin — the digital version of the US dollar with over $140 billion in circulation — is disrupting banking and payments. And incidentally, fostering the globalization of the dollar to the benefit of all Americans. 
We need a good faith regulator to get in the room with the adults in the crypto industry. We need to move past untethered regulatory obstruction. Goodbye Gary Gensler, hello honest reform.

Binance Restarted Cryptocurrency Partnership with Mastercard and Visa! Here are the Details... - Bitcoin Sistemi


According to Coindesk news, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has reactivated Mastercard payments for cryptocurrencies.
Binance also announced that its Binance-branded Visa card continues to accept crypto payments.


Accordingly, MasterCard will continue its cryptocurrency deposit and payment services at Binance.
A Binance spokesperson told Coindesk:






“After a thorough review of the stringent controls and processes Binance has put in place, Mastercard has made the decision to allow Binance-related purchases on its network.
We look forward to adding support for other products, such as withdrawals, at a later date.
Apart from Mastercard, the Binance-branded Visa card has also resumed functionality on the exchange, in addition to allowing payments using Mastercard.”

Mastercard and Visa ended their card partnership with Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, last August.
While it was stated that Binance's problems with regulators around the world were behind these moves by Mastercard and Visa, a Binance spokesperson told Bloomberg that Visa stopped issuing new cards co-branded with Binance in Europe as of July.

Roger Ver released on $160K bail as US seeks extradition


Roger Ver, a.k.a. ‘Bitcoin Jesus,’ was ordered to give up his passport and released on bail by Spanish authorities as the US seeks his extradition over tax fraud charges.  
That’s according to documents seen by Bloomberg that reveal his €150,000 ($163,000) bail, which began on May 17, was granted on the condition that he stay in Spain. 
Ver is also required to visit a Spanish court every two days. Prosecutors attempted to appeal his release but this was rejected. 
The bitcoin investor was arrested in late April after the US accused him of defrauding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) out of more than $48 million. Just days before his arrest, Ver published his new book Hijacking Bitcoin, which is his own version of Bitcoin’s 2015-2017 blocksize wars.

Ver, who owned companies MemoryDealers.com Inc. and Agilestar.com Inc., started buying up bitcoin for himself and his firms, publicizing the purchases and earning his famous nickname.
The IRS alleges, that he ‘concealed and provided false information to his various advisors regarding the number and value of bitcoins he owned and controlled both personally and through his companies.’
Bloomberg reports that Ver’s lawyer, Jaime Campaner, claimed he “is not a fugitive at all, since he has been in touch with the US authorities through his Californian lawyers.” 
“Therefore, he was aware of the investigation and, in my opinion, his arrest didn’t make sense,” he said.

Prison Sentence for the Student Who Issued Altcoins from the Chinese Court! Here's Why! - Bitcoin Sistemi

A 24-year-old university student in China, known for its bans on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, published a token on BNBChain.
This token was the subject of a lawsuit and the court sentenced the Chinese student for fraud.


According to local news agency Thepaper, Chinese university student Yang Qichao launched an altcoin called BFF on BNBChain.
Qichao, who added liquidity to the altcoin named BFF and then withdrew it, caused the price of the altcoin he issued to drop suddenly.





The court sentenced Qichao to 4 years and 6 months in prison on the grounds that he caused an investor to lose 50,000 USDT by withdrawing liquidity.
While the court imposed a fine of 30,000 yuan in addition to the prison sentence, Yang Qichao and his lawyers argued that he did not commit fraud.


Yang and his lawyers argued that the investors who bought the crypto called BFF were experienced and had been trading crypto money for a long time.
Lawyers also stated that investors clearly know the risks inherent in the BFF token and said:






“This investor is an experienced cryptocurrency investor and knows the risks.
Additionally, this investor still holds BFF tokens. At this point, the BFF tokens he held gained value due to the increased liquidity after the event. Therefore, there is no harm to the victim.
“There is no fraud involved.”

Hoskinson: Cardano Will Propel the Industry Towards Solving Real-World Issues | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 5 June 2024, Charles Hoskinson, the visionary behind Cardano, took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to address the ongoing disconnect between the perception and reality of Cardano within the cryptocurrency community. His detailed post not only highlighted the significant advancements and upcoming milestones for Cardano but also criticized the negative media narratives that often overshadow the project’s true potential. 



Charles Hoskinson is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency world, known for his significant contributions to blockchain technology. He co-founded Ethereum and later founded Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), which later got rebranded to Input Output Global (IOG), one of the three main companies supporting Cardano and its ecosystem.



Hoskinson studied mathematics and cryptography at Metropolitan State University of Denver and the University of Colorado Boulder, though he did not complete his Ph.D. He became involved in the blockchain industry early on, contributing to the development of BitShares and Ethereum. At Ethereum, Hoskinson played a crucial role in its early development and the creation of its initial coin offering (ICO)​​​​.



In 2015, Hoskinson co-founded IOHK with Jeremy Wood, aiming to build a blockchain platform grounded in rigorous scientific research and secure programming practices. This led to the creation of Cardano, launched in 2017. Cardano distinguishes itself from other blockchains by using the Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol, which enhances its security and scalability​.



Hoskinson’s post began with a poignant observation about the stark contrast between the cryptocurrency media’s portrayal of Cardano and the project’s actual fundamentals. Despite numerous advancements and a robust roadmap, media coverage often questions the viability of Cardano. This disconnect, according to Hoskinson, is not only misleading but also undermines the genuine progress made by the Cardano community.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

One of the central highlights of Hoskinson’s post was the announcement of the Chang hard fork, which he described as the most significant in Cardano’s history. Scheduled for the second quarter of 2024, this upgrade is set to usher in the Voltaire era, a phase focused on decentralized governance. The Chang hard fork will enable on-chain community consensus, allowing ADA holders to use their tokens to vote on proposals. This shift towards community-run governance is a pivotal step towards full decentralization, positioning Cardano as a leader in blockchain governance.



Hoskinson underscored the rapid growth of community-driven decentralized applications (DApps) and the strides made in scaling research and development. Technologies like Hydra, which aims to enhance Cardano’s scalability, were mentioned as key developments that are maturing and contributing to the network’s robustness. Hydra’s potential to significantly improve transaction throughput while maintaining decentralization is crucial for Cardano’s scalability.



Moreover, the introduction of partner chains (such as Midnight) and Atala PRISM were highlighted as significant advancements. These technologies are expected to bolster Cardano’s infrastructure, providing more efficient and secure solutions for various blockchain applications.



In addition to technological advancements, Hoskinson pointed to several major events that are poised to further strengthen the Cardano community. These include taking part in Rare EVO event, a blockchain conference that is being held August 15-17, 2024, in Las Vegas, and Token 2049, a leading crypto conference being held September 18-19, 2024 in Singapore. Such events not only foster community engagement but also provide a platform for showcasing Cardano’s progress and future plans.



A significant portion of Hoskinson’s post was dedicated to addressing the negative media coverage that often surrounds Cardano. He criticized the media for focusing on sensationalist headlines like “Will Cardano die?” instead of acknowledging the substantial progress made by the project. According to Hoskinson, this kind of coverage reflects a low-quality, low-effort approach that fails to recognize the real advancements within the Cardano ecosystem.

Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu said the following about the investment:

“McKinsey estimates that metadata could add $5 trillion to the global economy by 2030.
Today, games like Minecraft and Roblox are some of the most popular games in the world, but they do not provide digital property rights to their users. Sandbox represents the evolution of UGC gaming for the age of digital ownership.”

ETH Heading to Zero Against Bitcoin - Max Keiser Gives Key Reasons

Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser has again poured harsh criticism on the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization value, Ethereum, giving the community reasons why he believes that ETH is a loser compared to Bitcoin.He stated that ultimately Ethereum will crash to zero against BTC.Max Keiser's arguments against EthereumFormer financial commentator and Wall Street trader Max Keiser has published a tweet in which he once again slammed Ethereum. Keiser has done the same before, not only with ETH but also with XRP, ADA, SOL and other altcoins since he as a Bitcoin maxi considers any crypto except Bitcoin to be centralized and an unregistered security.This time, however, the rigorous Bitcoiner strengthened his BTC advocacy against ETH with several key reasons why he believes ETH is “heading to zero against Bitcoin.”Keiser stated that Ethereum is not a commodity (like Bitcoin is), and it does not run on the proof-of-work algorithm as Bitcoin does, and which ensures its decentralized aspects. Keiser also revealed that in El Salvador, where he currently lives and works as Bitcoin adviser to president Nayib Bukele, Ethereum, along with all other altcoins, is classified as an unregistered security. Bitcoin was classified by the SEC as a commodity due to its decentralized nature, as was Ethereum later. However, recently, debates are again increasing on this subject, and it is unclear whether ETH will keep its beneficial status as a commodity.Recently, the SEC regulator gave preliminary approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, but to achieve this, issuers had to remove the staking option from their filings. This is because, recently, the SEC filed legal charges against U.S. exchanges Coinbase and Kraken for their staking offerings to clients, and ETH was included on that list among other altcoins.Samson Mow ridicules VanEck's $22,000 ETH predictionAnother prominent Bitcoin maximalist, Samson Mow, has published a tweet in which he shared his take on the recent Ethereum prediction made by VanEck.@vaneck_us tweeted that they have increased their ETH price target to $22,000 by 2030. This decision was influenced by the news of the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, the progress that Ethereum developers have been making with scaling the blockchain and also based on VanEck’s reading of on-chain data.Samson Mow, finding that highly unlikely, reacted just with one word: “LMAO.”

“Send Crypto” Is Red Alert For Remote Workers, FBI Highli...


                                FBI Warns of Rising Work-From-Home Scams: Protect Your Crypto                                The FBI has recently warned the public about a new trend of employment fraud particularly for work-from-home positions to con people out of their cryptocurrency. Since the COVID-19 pandemic forced many individuals to start working from home, fraudsters have become more active and promised people big money for small tasks, such as rating restaurants or clicking buttons.What's the News?On June 4, the FBI noted that a new trend is the use of fake job offers for remote workers. These Crypto scams work in a way that the fraudster initiates the contact through a call or a message and offers simple and legal-looking tasks. This is because victims are made to think that they are earning some money through other interfaces, which are never accessible.The deception escalates when the scammers demand money in the form of cryptocurrency from the victims to ‘access’ more work from their employers. Such payments reach the scammers directly. The FBI's warning is clear: if a job post involves sending cryptocurrency as part of the job, then the job is most certainly a scam.Impacts of the ScamThe effect of these scams is not only measured in monetary terms but also terms of psychological well-being. This is because most people are attracted to remote work. After all, they believe that it will help them balance their work and personal life. This desire is manipulated by the scammers, and the victims end up dedicating their time and resources to what seems to be a genuine business venture.The global remote workforce statistics reveal that the percentage was 28% by the end of 2023 as stated by Statista. This growing trend means that there are more targets for these scammers to prey on, and that is a good thing. The FBI's recent data paints a grim picture where cryptocurrency investment losses significantly increased from $2.57 billion in the year 2022 to approximately $3.94 billion in the year 2023 with an increase of 53%. This surge is a clear indication that the public should be more cautious especially those who are seeking jobs.Prevention TipsTo avoid falling victim to these scams, the FBI recommends looking out for several red flags. Beware of job descriptions that frequently use the term "optimization" without clear context and positions that don't require references or a thorough recruitment process. Genuine employers typically follow standard hiring procedures, including interviews and background checks.Always verify job offers by researching the company and confirming job listings on official websites. Also, be Skeptical of upfront payments, Check Contact Information whether the company is legitimate or will provide verifiable contact details. The most important thing is to report Suspicious Activity if you encounter a potential scam, report it to authorities immediately.ConclusionAs the concept of remote work becomes increasingly popular, the imagination of fraudsters does not remain idle either. The FBI’s warning is a timely call for everyone to be alert all the time. In this way, job seekers can prevent their hard-earned money from falling prey to these scams and become a statistic for the rising cases of cryptocurrency fraud.Work-from-home scams are a part of a general increase in the cybercrime rate, based on the progress in technology and people’s behavior. The best form of protection against such elaborate scams is to remain informed and to be wary. With the new normal of working from home now a reality, it is crucial to safeguard one’s assets, especially in the emerging cryptocurrency market.Also Read: US Antitrust Chief’s Vision For Preventing AI Monopoly

Ethereum Whale Moves $33.55 Million in ETH to Coinbase: Details

An Ethereum (ETH) whale has transferred 8,710 ETH, valued at approximately $33.55 million, to Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges. The transaction was highlighted by Whale Alert, a service that tracks large crypto transactions. The transfer has sparked speculation that this whale might be preparing to sell a large portion of their holdings.Such moves are closely watched by the crypto community, as they can significantly impact market dynamics. Given the recent rally in Ethereum’s price, it is plausible that the whale intends to capitalize on the gains. Over the last 30 days, the ETH price has surged by 22.15%, and it is currently trading at $3,849, up 1.20% in the past 24 hours.Market context and implicationsEthereum’s recent price performance has been robust, driven by a confluence of factors, including market optimism and broader adoption trends. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds) has been a major catalyst. These ETFs are expected to begin trading in the coming weeks, and many analysts believe that their introduction will further fuel Ethereum’s price appreciation.The approval of these ETFs marks a significant milestone for the leading altcoin, providing traditional investors with a new avenue to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. This could potentially lead to increased demand and higher prices. Analysts are bullish on Ethereum’s outlook, predicting that the price could surge as these ETFs launch and attract more institutional and retail investment.Whale transactions, particularly those involving large amounts of cryptocurrency being moved to exchanges, are often seen as precursors to market volatility. Historically, large sell-offs have sometimes led to short-term dips in price, but the overall upward trajectory is driven by strong fundamentals, and increasing adoption tends to mitigate long-term concerns.As the crypto community closely monitors this whale’s next moves, the broader market focus remains on the upcoming trading of Ethereum ETFs. The anticipation is high, and many believe that Ethereum is on the cusp of another significant rally. For now, Ethereum stands strong, backed by positive market sentiment and strategic developments that promise to enhance its market position even further.

The CEO of Tether challenges the MiCA rules on stablecoins and crypto

Paolo Ardoino, CEO di Tether, has recently expressed criticism towards the MiCA regulations of the EU, arguing that the rules on risky bank deposits compromise the security of stablecoins and limit access to the crypto market. 
Let’s see all the details below. 

The new MiCA regulations hinder crypto and stablecoin: the opinion of the CEO of Tether
As anticipated, the CEO of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, has criticized the upcoming regulation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), particularly the rule that requires stablecoin issuers to hold reserves in bank deposits.
This criticism comes as the cryptocurrency industry prepares for the implementation of these regulations on June 30, with many platforms like Binance moving their operations to Europe. 
Ardoino expressed concern that the MiCA provision, which requires that 60% of stablecoin reserves be bank deposits, could complicate and make riskier the operations of stablecoins. 
He also noted that the European Central Bank only insures bank deposits up to 100,000 euros. An amount therefore negligible compared to the market capitalization of stablecoins like Tether’s USDt, which stands at about 110 billion dollars.
Furthermore, Ardoino raised concerns based on recent events, such as the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank, which demonstrated the vulnerability of large uninsured bank deposits. 
He indeed highlighted the risks for stablecoins like Tether’s USDT, primarily supported by US Treasury bills compared to bank deposits, extending the focus on this aspect.
According to Ardoino, in the event of a bank failure, bank deposits are protected by bankruptcy laws, which could be harmful to stablecoin issuers. 
However, Tether currently invests the majority of its reserves in short-term U.S. government bonds, which are cash equivalents and can be sold immediately. 
Questa strategia offre maggiore sicurezza in caso di fallimento di una banca, permettendo il recupero rapido dei titoli.
MiCA Regulation: the adaptation of the main crypto exchanges 
As the deadline approaches, major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Kraken are ready to review their products in Europe. 
For example, Binance announced that from June 30 it will limit the use of “unauthorized” stablecoins, in line with the implementation of MiCA regulations.
This move reflects the general trend in the crypto sector, with the exchanges preparing for the new rules by trying to minimize the impact on their European customers. 
The decision of Binance to limit certain functionalities rather than completely delist some coins shows the flexibility of the exchange in responding to the changing regulatory environment.
In an interview, the CEO of Tether emphasized that the bank deposit requirement stipulated by MiCA could affect European stablecoin users. 
Ardoino observed that this new regime could make stablecoins less available to European users, who are generally more sophisticated and liquid, thus threatening their stability and reliability. 
According to him, it is a step backward for Europe, as it could have a negative impact on the availability and security of stablecoins for European investors and users.

The Value Locked in the Decentralized Finance Protocol Reached 20 Billion Dollars! It Became the Second Largest DeFi! - Bitcoin Sistemi

EigenLayer, a leading restructuring protocol, reached a major milestone as its total value locked (TVL) exceeded $20.09 billion.
EigenLayer's Total Locked Value Exceeds $20 Billion, Becoming the Second Largest DeFi Protocol
This success positions EigenLayer as the second largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol behind Lido.


Since the beginning of the year, EigenLayer's TVL has experienced significant growth, rising from $1.4 billion to over $20 billion, or approximately 5.21 million Ethereum.
At the beginning of March, EigenLayer's TVL was valued at $10 billion, equivalent to 2.93 million Ethereum. The recent increase in TVL can be attributed to increased inflows and the increase in Ethereum price.





EigenLayer's mainnet launched in April, and the protocol allows users to deposit Ethereum and various liquid staking tokens to secure third-party networks.
Following its launch, the protocol saw a significant increase in deposits, driven by its token distribution plan.



However, this period also witnessed significant outflows due to low individual airdrop allocations and community dissatisfaction with the token's non-transferability.
In response, the Eigen Foundation expanded airdrop allocations for all users and clarified the timeline for token unlocking and transferability.





These adjustments helped ease concerns and were followed by a renewed increase in inflows.
The Eigen Foundation has reserved 15% of its 1.6 billion token supply for user distribution across multiple stakedrop seasons, with 5% allocated as of March 2024. The protocol is currently in its second stakedrop season.

Bitcoin investors unimpressed with Kerrisdale Capital report on Riot Platforms


Kerrisdale Capital’s Sahm Adrangi, who has been earning something of a reputation in the crypto industry, has short-sold Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT). RIOT was trading at $9.85 per share when Adrangi tweeted a couple minutes prior to NASDAQ’s 9:30am open. Within an hour, it had dropped 10% to $8.84. 
The move seemed to vindicate the privileged, Miami Beach-based fund manager, whose aggressive media appearances have given the crypto community little reason to support him. Indeed, until now, he’s perhaps best known for making a few million dollars flipping a mansion and getting arrested at 3am in the Hamptons on charges of driving while drunk and high on cocaine.
Adrangi’s initial capital came mostly from his family, with a New York Magazine profile revealing that he started in 2009 with “$300,000 of his and his parents’ money.”
On Wednesday, he equated his unremarkable stock trade to “a war against bitcoin miners” and called the workers who secure the world’s most important blockchain “an industry of snake oil salesmen that are incinerating both investor capital and the environment.”

Critics respond to Kerrisdale Capital report on Riot Platforms
Critics have labeled Adrangi a Karen and laughed at his fund’s underperformance. They highlighted his losing trades, such as his short-sale of Uranium Energy Corporation on March 23, 2023, which has doubled in price since he bet against the company.
In his report, Adrangi wrote that “Riot incinerates cash” and correctly noted that it has “increased its shares outstanding 6-fold” via dilutive share offerings. Because Riot has diluted its shares, its price has declined 43% year-to-date despite bitcoin itself rallying 60%. Adrangi predicts that Riot will continue to dilute shareholders indefinitely.

Bitcoin miners responded to some of the allegations in Kerrisdale Capital’s report. A miner who worked inside Riot’s Rockdale mine debunked Adrangi’s safety concerns around fluid flammability and arc flashes and called Adrangi’s complaints about the company’s receipt of Texan government subsidies via ERCOT ​​naïve. Overall, the miner predicted Kerrisdale would lose money on its short-sale.
After the first hour of trading down in response to the report, Riot shares steadily recovered. As of pre-market trading on Friday, the stock was back to $9.49 — barely changed from the initial report and well within the range of the past 30 days.

Kiyosaki's $350K Bitcoin price prediction: Too far-fetched? - AMBCrypto



BTC could hit $350K in two months per Kiyosaki. 
However, the level is way too bold to be achieved statistically in 2024. 

Industry titans and market analysts expect Bitcoin [BTC] to breach its current $60K – $71K price consolidation range before end-year. For Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz, the end-2024 target was $100K if the $73K ATH was cleared. 
Another crypto analyst, PlanB, saw $500K per BTC as a possible fete in the current market bull run. 
However, Rober Kiyosaki, an entrepreneur and author of ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad,’ has made a bold prediction – $350K per BTC in the next two months. 
‘BITCOIN will be $350,000 by August 25, 2024, is not a lie. It’s a prediction. It’s speculation, it’s an opinion, but it’s not a lie.’
Kiyosaki added that the prediction was possible because of ‘the incompetence of our leaders, President Biden, Treasury Secretary Yellin and Fed Chair Powell.’
Is $350K per BTC too optimistic?
However, another renowned crypto analyst, Willy Woo, deemed Kiyosaki’s projection too bold to be achieved within such a short timeframe. The move to $350K per BTC would mean 5X in two months. 
Maybe in 2025, Woo noted, 
‘Statistically possible in 2025 if monetary debasement resumes. Next to no chance in 2024 outside of a bullish black swan.’ 
Interestingly, the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model confirmed Woo’s argument and forecasted that $350K per BTC was only possible in March 2025. 
Source: Look Into Bitcoin
The S2F model, based on BTC’s supply schedule, has fairly predicted BTC’s future price prospects in the past. Given that mined BTC reduce with time, BTC supply also declines and the S2F ratio value increases with time. 
That’s why, according to the model, BTC’s value is expected to rise as supply reduces in the future. Based on the model, BTC could hit $80K – $85K in August 2024, as opposed to the $350K projected by Kiyosaki. 
Source: BTC/USDT, TradingView
In the meantime, BTC could ease back to the short-term demand, which was a previous supply of around $70K, before going higher to the $72K mark. 
The Coinglass liquidity data supported the scenario, showing key magnetic levels for price action at $70K and $72.3K, as shown by the orange levels.

Argentina Says Yes To Cardano: Wil ADA Hit $0.50 From Blockchain Allliance?


								This week marked a significant advancement in Argentina’s embrace of blockchain technology as the Cardano Foundation partnered with Entre Ríos, a central province.

Argentina’s Crypto Potential
This strategic alliance marks a turning point for both parties, with Cardano aiming to tango its way into the vibrant Argentine crypto scene and Entre Ríos seeking a skilled partner to lead the way in blockchain adoption.
The official signing ceremony between Governor Rogelio Frigerio and Cardano’s Rafael Fraga caused a stir in the South American nation. Although the details of the partnership are undisclosed, there is widespread speculation.
Industry insiders believe it could involve educational programs, fostering a developer ecosystem, or even exploring pilot projects for government services on the Cardano blockchain.


This move fits perfectly with Argentina’s recent crypto-friendly turn. President Javier Milei, a vocal advocate for digital assets, has championed initiatives like legalizing cryptocurrency use in contracts and collaborating with El Salvador to understand Bitcoin adoption.
The Cardano partnership aligns with this vision, potentially providing Argentina with the technical expertise to establish itself as a regional blockchain hub.
For Cardano, the allure of Argentina is undeniable. The nation boasts a tech-savvy population and a government actively embracing crypto. This fertile ground presents a golden opportunity for Cardano to expand its footprint in Latin America, a region experiencing explosive blockchain growth.
ADA is currently trading at $0.45. Chart: TradingView
ADA’s Tango And Risks
With its native token, ADA, currently trading lower than its competitors, a successful partnership could restore investor confidence and drive ADA to reach new peaks. As of now, ADA has risen by a mere 1.7% in the past week to $0.45, with anticipation of reaching the $0.5 milestone in the near future.
However, the tango isn’t without its potential missteps. Regulatory frameworks for crypto in Argentina are still being crafted, and how these will impact Cardano’s operations remains to be seen. Additionally, the success of the partnership hinges on its specific projects.
Despite these uncertainties, the Cardano-Entre Ríos collaboration signifies a promising development for both parties. Argentina takes a confident stride towards a blockchain-powered future, while Cardano secures a strategic foothold in a growing market.

As the partnership evolves, it will be fascinating to witness the innovative applications of blockchain technology that emerge from this South American alliance.

VanEck Revises Ethereum Prediction To Put Price At $22,000, Here's Why


																Asset manager VanEck recently revised its prediction for Ethereum (ETH), revealing what price it believes the second-largest crypto token could reach by 2030. The firm also did well to outline what could drive Ethereum’s price to this revised price. 
Ethereum To Reach $22,000 By 2030
In a recent blog post, VanEck predicted that Ethereum could reach $22,000 by 2030. Before now, the asset manager had predicted that the crypto token would hit $11,800 by 2030. However, VanEck suggested they had become more bullish on ETH in anticipation of the Spot Ethereum ETFs, which could begin trading soon. 

	Related Reading


They noted that these Spot Ethereum ETFs have caused them to revise their earlier prediction since these funds will allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold the crypto token. They believe this category of investors could bring new money into the Ethereum ecosystem, further driving up the crypto token’s price. 
VanEck projects that the Ethereum network will likely continue to enjoy rapid share market growth thanks to interest from traditional investors and Big Tech. They believe this, along with EETH’s dominance among smart contract platforms, could lead to a “create path to $66 billion in free cash flows” for the network. 
They base their projection of ETH’s valuation by 2030 on this, stating that these cash flows will accrue to Ethereum’s native token. A rise to $22,000 represents a return of around 487% from Ethereum’s current price and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.8%. Meanwhile, Ethereum reaching $22,000 will give it a market cap of around $2.2 trillion. 
Highlighting Ethereum’s Potential
VanEck sounded very bullish on the Ethereum ecosystem as it claimed that the network could disrupt existing financial businesses and the largest tech companies, including Google and Apple. Given that Ethereum has earned a reputation as the platform for decentralized applications (dApps), they factored in the market size of business sectors that blockchain technology will disrupt while determining ETH’s future valuation. 

	Related Reading


The asset manager also highlighted how ETH benefits massively from ETH’s potential since no action can be taken on the network without the native token. Additionally, they noted how 80% of the revenues earned on the network are used to buy back and burn Ethereum tokens in circulation. 
Meanwhile, VanEck believes that ETH is “a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world.” They referred to it as “Digita Oil” since it is consumed by those transacting on the Ethereum network. 
The asset manager also called it “Programmable Money” and “Yield Bearing Commodity” because of how automated the Ethereum network is and that validators earn yields on the crypto token when they stake their ETH. Lastly, it was referred to as the “Internet Reserve Currency” since it serves as the “base asset” for all activity and most digital assets with the ETH ecosystem worth over $1 trillion.

Words of Praise About Bitcoin (BTC) from the CEO of Hong Kong SEC! "He Proved Himself!" - Bitcoin Sistemi


Approving spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs after the USA, Hong Kong is on its way to becoming the cryptocurrency center of the region.
Julia Leung, CEO of Hong Kong SFC, which approves spot Bitcoin ETFs, talked about Bitcoin.


Speaking at the Hong Kong Greenwich Economic Forum, Hong Kong SFC CEO Julia Leung said Bitcoin clearly demonstrates its staying power as an alternative asset.

“Most central bankers and economists say virtual assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum do not have any intrinsic value.
However, I do not agree with this view.
While the intrinsic value debate will continue, 15 years later Bitcoin has emerged solid and strong from numerous boom and bust cycles, clearly demonstrating its enduring power as an alternative asset.
“More clearly, Bitcoin and its underlying technology, DLT, are here to stay.”

The CEO of the Hong Kong SFC warned investors that digital assets such as BTC are highly speculative in nature, saying that the SFC has ensured and will continue to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect investors.





SFC CEO Leung recently stated that SFC is also working to regulate stablecoins and said, “Preparations for a new regime that will regulate fiat money-fixed stablecoins are ongoing.”

Bitcoiner Michael Saylor's Call to Action as Bitcoin (BTC) Trades Above $71,100

Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of the MicroStrategy behemoth, has taken to the X social media network (formerly known as Twitter) to send a Bitcoin-themed message to the global BTC community.He published his tweet as the world’s leading cryptocurrency strives to hold above the $71,000 level, which it has lost and then regained over the past couple of days.Michael Saylor's bullish Bitcoin callMicroStrategy is the only company that has been regularly buying Bitcoin since the August of 2020 and speaking publicly about it. Besides, over the past couple of years, it has been raising investor funds to purchase even more BTC. As of now, the company holds 214,400 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, and this amount is valued at roughly $7.538 billion. Saylor’s enterprise continues to accumulate more BTC.As his company adopted this Bitcoin purchasing strategy, Saylor started to publish several daily short tweets about BTC accompanied with AI-generated images. The tweet posted by Saylor today contained just one word, but it did look like a bullish call to the Bitcoin community: “HODL.” At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at close to $71,500.Robert Kiyosaki: Bitcoin will hit $350,000 in AugustEarlier today, prominent investor and author of the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” book Robert Kiyosaki tweeted a mega-bullish Bitcoin price prediction. The investor and entrepreneur stated in his post that he expects Bitcoin to skyrocket as high as the $350,000 level by Aug. 25 this year.He underscored, though, that he wants this prediction to be true, and that it is “only a prediction,” further clarifying that he indeed expects Bitcoin to hit $350,000 - if not in August then just at some point this year. He also revealed that he continues to hold not only more Bitcoin but also more Ethereum and Solana.The reason for him buying those altcoins is not because he believes in their massive potential, he said, but because he has no trust in the U.S. government, the Fed and their fiscal policies. Crypto trader and analyst Willy Woo found that target unlikely to happen this year. He wrote: “I suppose if you happen to have a spare 2.2 trillion dollars lying around to buy BTC before 25th August, I guess you could make it happen.”

New ‘Glimmers of Speculative Activity’ Appearing for Bitcoin After False Alarm of Mt. Gox Sell-Off: Glassnode - The Daily Hodl


								Bitcoin (BTC) has flashed “glimmers of speculative activity” after consolidating for a couple of months, according to the crypto analytics firm Glassnode.
In a new analysis, Glassnode notes that new buyers and investors who have held BTC between six months and three years are holding unrealized profits.










“This observation is bolstered by the fact that only 0.03% of the Long-Term Holders are in a position of loss, which is typical of the early euphoric phase of a bull market.
Over the last 2-months, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for both Long and Short-Term Holders has reset and returned to an equilibrium. This suggests that a majority of profit and loss which was likely to be taken in this price range, has been, and hints to an increased risk of substantial volatility in the near future.”
The sell-side risk ratio takes the sum of all profits and losses realized on-chain and divides that by the realized cap, which represents the value of each Bitcoin when it last moved rather than its current market value.
Source: Glassnode/X
Glassnode also notes that the market reacted to a “false alarm” last month after the news broke that bankrupt crypto exchange Mt. Gox rearranged nearly $10 billion in BTC.
Mt. Gox moved roughly $9.66 billion worth of BTC to three newly created wallets in four batches per address.
While there was initial worry that the exchange was considering liquidating its coins, former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpelès clarified on the social media platform X that the coin movements were only preparations for a distribution likely to happen later this year.

Ethereum ETFs To Attract Over $4 Billion In Inflows, Says K33 Analyst - Benzinga

In late May 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved the spot Ethereum ETF applications into the next stage of deliberation, opening the door for the funds to begin trading as soon as this Summer. The approvals surprised many, as the SEC had not addressed the issue much after approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. With the approvals, many are speculating on what the ETFs could look like once they begin trading. Some predict they could be wildly successful. Don't Miss:Many consider net inflows a key metric for determining an ETF’s success. This figure provides a strong indication of the ETF's performance and sustainability over the long term. According to market analytics and brokerage firm K33 Research, Ethereum ETFs could gain up to $4.8 billion in net inflows in the first five months after launching. The firm made the prediction using current figures on futures-linked Ethereum ETFs and comparing them to Bitcoin products. Additionally, K33 Research believes Ethereum will begin to outperform Bitcoin and the broader crypto market after the ETFs launch. This would align with Bitcoin’s performance following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs when BTC's price increased more than 60% and reached all-time highs. J.P. Morgan also predicted the ETFs would bring in $3 billion in inflows in the first five months.The spot Bitcoin ETFs have set a high bar for ETF launches. The 11 ETFs were the most successful in history, accumulating more than $12 billion in net inflows in just over two months. The funds hold over $30 billion in total inflows, netting around $15 billion after accounting for outflows from Grayscale. Many believe the Ethereum ETFs will be successful, albeit less so than the Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin is considered the safest bet among crypto investments due to its size and longevity. While Ethereum has similar characteristics, Bitcoin's greater degree of these attributes makes institutions more open to Bitcoin investments. Despite Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market, Ethereum has established itself as a solid #2 token, emphasizing decentralized finance and community-built applications. In the long run, these use cases could potentially elevate Ethereum over Bitcoin, as Ethereum may have more room to adapt to changing market conditions. However, as it stands, Ethereum is still behind Bitcoin, which is expected to be reflected in ETF trading figures. Read Next:Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Ethereum ETFs May Not Receive As Much Interest as Bitcoin, According to Analysts! Here's Why! - Bitcoin Sistemi

The launch of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, could face significantly less demand compared to spot Bitcoin products, casting a shadow on Ethereum's outlook, according to analysts.
Doubts Over US Ethereum ETF Demand Pose Challenge for Second-Largest Cryptocurrency
BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments are among the issuers seeking to list Ethereum ETFs pending final approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).


But JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists predict that net inflows into Ethereum ETFs will be much smaller than the $15.3 billion flowing into Bitcoin ETFs this year.
Five-month-old Bitcoin ETFs have capitalized on a narrative that positions Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a concept that Ethereum lacks.





Additionally, Ethereum ETFs will not offer staking rewards for blockchain maintenance, a return that can be achieved by holding the token directly.
“Ether does not have the profile of Bitcoin,” said Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets Pty. Bitcoin's $1.4 trillion market cap is three times larger than Ethereum's. “It won't have the same impact,” he said.



Last month, the SEC unexpectedly pivoted to approving spot Ethereum ETFs after allowing Bitcoin funds following a court reversal in 2023.
This decision briefly boosted the price of Ethereum, but the token's 109% rise last year fell short of Bitcoin's 169% rise, which reached a record high in March.





JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou estimate that prospective Ether ETFs would attract a “modest” $1 billion to $3 billion in net inflows over the remainder of the year.
These products may struggle to reach the 20% of Bitcoin ETF assets in the U.S., which now total $62.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.

Shiba Inu, Cardano Seeing Explosive Whale Activity, Santiment Reveals


																The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed how Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) are among the altcoins seeing high whale activity recently.
Shiba Inu & Cardano Have Seen High Interest From Whales Recently
In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about how some altcoins have been seeing a high Whale Transaction Count recently. The “Whale Transaction Count” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the number of transactions happening on any cryptocurrency network that are valued at $100,000 or more.
Generally, only the whale entities are capable of moving such a large amount of capital with single transfers, so transactions of this scale are associated to movements related to them.

	Related Reading


When the value of the indicator is high, it means the whales are making a large number of moves on the network right now. Such a trend could imply these humongous investors have an active interest in trading the coin.
On the other hand, the metric being low could imply the big money investors may not be paying much attention to the asset currently as they aren’t making too many transactions.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Whale Transaction Count for three altcoins: Shiba Inu, Cardano, and JasmyCoin (JASMY).
The value of the metric appears to have been high for these assets in recent days | Source: Santiment on X
As displayed in the above graph, all three of Shiba Inu, Cardano, and JasmyCoin have seen the metric spike for them recently. Naturally, this means that the whales are actively trading these assets right now.
As for what this could mean for the prices of these cryptocurrencies, a high whale transaction count can be a predictor for volatility. The indicator doesn’t contain any information about whether the transfers are tending towards buying or selling moves, though, so it can usually be hard to say about where exactly such volatility could take the asset.
Since the transfers have started, however, all three of these coins have seen some level of price appreciation, hinting that the whale activity so far may have been leaning towards accumulation after all.
The analytics firm also appears to believe that buying could be the goal behind these transactions. “The amount of $100K+ transactions on each of these networks have all more than doubled this week compared to usual 2024 averages, signaling accumulation,” notes Santiment.

	Related Reading


Whatever the case be, if the high value of the Whale Transaction Count persists for Shiba Inu and company, it’s likely that their prices would continue to see some sort of fluctuations in the coming days.
SHIB Price
While JasmyCoin has seen a considerable amount of profits following the spike in whale interest, Shiba Inu has only been able to see a relatively minor surge. Following this latest rise, the SHIB price has so far been able to recover to $0.00002570.
Looks like the price of the coin has been going up over the last few days | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView

Core Scientific rejects CoreWeave buyout bid after big HPC deal - Blockworks


Though Core Scientific was willing to ink a deal with CoreWeave, the bitcoin miner has turned down the cloud provider’s offer to buy the company. 
CoreWeave and Core Scientific on Tuesday entered into various 12-year contracts whereby the bitcoin miner will offer roughly 200 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure to host CoreWeave’s high-performance computing (HPC) services.
CoreWeave followed that deal up by offering to buy all outstanding Core Scientific shares in cash for $5.75 per share.   
Core Scientific’s stock price was $7.30 Thursday morning after jumping 40% on Tuesday on the back of the HPC contract.
The company’s board of directors determined the CoreWeave proposal “significantly undervalues the company and is not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders,” Core Scientific said in a Thursday press statement.
It is unclear if CoreWeave will make another offer. A spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.
Just getting started
The rejection comes as Core Scientific has touted the value of its infrastructure. 
Read more: Rival miners Marathon, Core Scientific each think they have an edge over peers
The Texas-based miner’s latest deal with CoreWeave proves it seeks to lock in long-term projected revenues through that business line.
But the company is just getting started, as supporting artificial intelligence (AI) applications will continue to be a key part of its strategy, CEO Adam Sullivan told Blockworks this week. 
Of Core Scientific’s 1.2 gigawatts of contracted power capacity, the company can provide about 500 MW of HPC power tailored for alternative compute workloads, he noted.
Cloud provider CoreWeave is set to use about 40% of that 500 MW. 
Core Scientific is in discussions with other potential clients about the remaining 300 MW or so of capacity.
“Our new HPC contracts transform and expand our hosting business and earnings power with stable, predictable, high-margin and long-term revenue that will provide balance to our bitcoin mining business and the more volatile nature of bitcoin pricing,” Sullivan said. 
Modifications to the miner’s sites are set to start in the second half of 2024 and be operational in early 2025.
Core Scientific estimates the 12-year contract to drive average annual revenue of $290 million.

Capital unlock could be coming after stock soars
Investors clearly view the growth of a seemingly stable, cash-flowing business line super attractive.
Spurred by the CoreWeave deal, Core Scientific’s stock price rose roughly 40% Tuesday and went up nearly 5% on Wednesday. 
The share price rally is especially significant given that the company needed shares to hit $6.81 to convert its so-called Tranche 1 warrants and unlock $670 million in cash.
That was a condition of the bitcoin miner’s reorganization plan when it emerged from bankruptcy in January. The plan reduced Core Scientific’s net debt to $571 million by converting equipment lender and convertible note holder debt to equity. 
It appears Core Scientific’s stock price will need to remain at that $6.81 volume-weighted average price over 20 straight trading days, according to company filings.
A Core Scientific spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment on the process of exercising those warrants and how the company would use the capital. 
Compass Point Research and Trading analysts Chase White and Joe Flynn said in a January research note that they expected 100% of the Tranche 1 warrants to be exercised by the fourth quarter, “allowing [Core Scientific] to pay down additional debt.”
Sullivan noted the importance of hitting certain share price levels — such as the $6.81 mark — in a March interview with Blockworks.

He added at the time: ​​“All of those things would provide us an opportunity here to really outpace our competitors in a way that everyone saw us do for multiple years as we ramped up through 2022.”

XRP Bulls Eye Long-Overdue Price Rebound

XRP has remained relatively stagnant this month, despite ambitions to curb the negative growth trends June has been known for over the past decade. While the reality is glaring, XRP bulls are eyeing what analysts labeled as a long-due price rebound that might help the coin retest its highest level over the past year, pegged at $0.8875.What is XRP doing differently?While pressing for price growth, fundamentals are typically associated with imminent price growth moves. In the case of XRP, most of the efforts of XRP Ledger developers have yielded little to no major price jumps.Despite the release of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) engine and the emergence of several functioning pools on the Ledger, the price of XRP remains bound between the $0.4879 and $0.5561 price range over the past month. The impact of the Ripple escrow lockup has also not impacted the price of XRP in the most preferred ways. With millions of XRP locked up and released from escrow monthly, there is an optimal level of dilution that has helped keep XRP in tune with meeting liquidity demands.Overall, market observers are concerned about XRP's growth trajectory, especially with the lingering lawsuit between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its associated blockchain payments firm, Ripple Labs. More innovators are suing for more decentralized applications (dApps) on the XRP Ledger that can help drive the demand for XRP and ultimately its price.Whale influenceMany analysts considered the slow growth in the price of XRP as its latent period. This is because the coin is highly favored by whale transactions that generally see billions of XRP traded daily.When these fundamentals converge, analysts are optimistic that the price of XRP will not only breach the $1 price level, but it might retest its ATH of $3.84.

In the race to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, Grayscale set its fee significantly higher than its competitors, at 1.5%, which appears to be one of the main reasons why investors have pulled billions of dollars out of the fund and the fund lost its early lead, in terms of assets, to BlackRock.

Animoca Brands and Sandbox invest in the future of the metaverse

The Sandbox, a division of Animoca Brands, has announced an investment of $20 million, reaching a maximum valuation of $1 billion, with the goal of further developing the creator economy within an open metaverse. 
This division of Animoca Brands is creating a decentralized virtual world where culture merges with the playful element, with more than 1,000 user-generated experiences and a community of over 5.7 million members.
Let’s see all the details below. 

Animoca Brands, operatore di The Sandbox, invests in the future of the metaverse 
Animoca Brands, un’azienda impegnata nella promozione dei diritti di proprietà digitale nel metaverso aperto operatrice di The Sandbox, una piattaforma di metaverso, ha annunciato oggi la raccolta di $20 million tramite cambiali convertibili, con un tetto di valutazione di $1 billion. 
This strategic funding was led by Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands, with the participation of LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures. 
I possessori delle note hanno la possibilità di convertirle in azioni di Bacasable Global Limited alle stesse condizioni delle azioni privilegiate esistenti.
Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, commented as follows: 
“We are extremely honored by the continued support for The Sandbox’s vision and excited about the future of UGC games.”
McKinsey has predicted that by 2030 the metaverse could contribute 5 trillion dollars to the global economy. Today, games like Minecraft and Roblox are among the most popular, but they do not offer their users digital property rights. 
Sandbox represents the evolution of UGC games in the era of digital ownership.
The financing will be used to continue developing The Sandbox’s vision of a decentralized virtual world, where culture merges with gaming and the community can actively participate in growth and benefit from it. 
In line with this vision, The Sandbox will continue to improve earning opportunities for creators on its platform. 
This through the update of the Game Maker and VoxEdit 3D editor tools, the introduction of new social interactions and skills for the avatars. 
Furthermore, also through the expansion of gaming possibilities via a new multiplayer rules system, expected in Beta by the end of this year and to the public in 2025. 
Guide to the metaverse with the power of fandom and global partnerships
The Sandbox is also developing a version of its decentralized metaverse for mobile devices, scheduled for 2025.
Recently, The Sandbox has reached the milestone of 1,000 user-generated experiences, published on its virtual map, with over 5.7 million user accounts linked to the criptovalute wallet.
The Sandbox has consolidated its position as one of the leading flagship applications in Web3, attracting new users thanks to the support of fans and pushing the audience to explore the metaverse. 
With over 400 global partnerships, including Lionsgate, Hellboy, Magnificent Century, Habbo and many others, the platform is currently working on over a hundred experiences with global brands, scheduled for 2024.
In the last 12 months, more than 330,000 unique creators have adopted The Sandbox’s no-code Game Maker. The platform is now ramping up its efforts to engage emerging creators through educational initiatives, bootcamps, and game jams.
So far, over 60,000 NFT avatars have been sold and used to play in the virtual world of The Sandbox, including NFT from 19 official collections such as Hellboy, Magnificent Century, Rabbids, and others. 
Arthur Madrid, CEO e co-fondatore di The Sandbox, ha sottolineato: 
“The open metaverse offers everyone the possibility to express themselves and discover new cultures. Our mission is to promote equity and opportunities for creators in all aspects of culture in the metaverse.”
Sebastien Borget, COO and co-founder of The Sandbox, added: 
“We enthusiastically welcome new partners who share our vision of an accessible and inclusive metaverse for a global audience, where brands and communities collaborate to shape the future of gaming and entertainment.”
Anshul Agarwa, CEO di LG Technology Ventures, commented:
“We support the visionaries who are driving the adoption of Web3 and innovation in consumer entertainment. Sandbox’s distinctive approach could transform the global creator economy.”
Exponential growth and global expansion
In the last six months, The Sandbox has achieved several significant milestones. Among these, there is the success in enabling over 25,000 owners of virtual lands to publish their LAND experiences for the public. 
Furthermore, the Marketplace on L2 of Polygon has been inaugurated, offering creators the opportunity to create and sell their digital goods. This has led to the creation of a thriving economy, with more than 11,000 unique digital goods minted and sold over half a million times.
Currently, the ecosystem of The Sandbox includes over 250 Trusted Partner, individuals and agencies trained and certified to assist brands and intellectual property holders in creating metaverse experiences for their fans. 
The number of Trusted Partner is expected to continue to grow, as The Sandbox will explore new markets in Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Africa and beyond.

Florida man admits to US$8.4 mln crypto fraud scheme


Juan Tacuri, a 46-year-old from Florida, confessed to orchestrating an US$8.4 million Ponzi scheme involving cryptocurrency.



Tacuri, a principal promoter for the now-defunct Forcount operation, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, the United States Attorney’s Office said on Wednesday.



This crime has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.



As part of his plea, Tacuri will surrender nearly US$4 million in profits and property obtained through the scheme, which targeted Spanish-speaking investors. 



Tacuri’s admission of guilt is a development in the legal proceedings against Forcount, later rebranded as Weltsys.



From 2017 to 2021, the operation defrauded investors of approximately US$8.4 million, falsely promising high returns on crypto investments.



Tacuri recruited victims at various expos and events across the U.S., including in the Southern District of New York, where Judge Analisa Torres will determine his sentence.



Investors were promised that their money would double within six months through Forcount’s supposed crypto trading and mining ventures. 



In reality, these operations did not exist, and funds from new investors were used to pay earlier participants and finance the lifestyles of Tacuri and his associates, said the Department of Justice.



The online platform provided to investors tracked their “profits,” but most victims lost their entire investments as they could not withdraw any supposed earnings.



Legal actions against Tacuri’s co-promoters, Francisley Da Silva and Antonia Perez Hernandez, are ongoing, with neither having entered a plea or been found guilty. 



Tacuri’s sentencing is scheduled for late September 2024.

Hot: One of the World's Largest Cryptocurrency Exchanges is Said to be Preparing for an IPO - Will History Repeat Itself? - Bitcoin Sistemi


Kraken, the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the USA, is preparing for an IPO and is negotiating pre-IPO financing, according to Bloomberg.
Previously, Coinbase went public and this coincided with the last period of the cryptocurrency bull at that time.


The exchange is likely to seek more than $100 million in funding in this round. With cryptocurrencies on the verge of reaching new all-time highs and regulatory pressure on digital assets easing in the US, companies in the sector have begun to attract renewed interest from investors and revive talks to go public.
The fundraising is expected to be completed by the end of the year, possibly in what is called a pre-IPO round, according to the sources, who asked not to be named due to the private nature of the discussions. “We are always exploring strategic paths towards Kraken's Mission of accelerating the global adoption of crypto,” Kraken said in a statement, declining to comment specifically on the fundraising or IPO.





Kraken is reportedly looking for a “significant” company to join its board to help it achieve a successful IPO early next year.

Sushi goes live on Bitcoin sidechain Rootstock - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Sushi is now live on Bitcoin (BTC) sidechain Rootstock
Rootstock’s integration with the decentralised exchange (DEX) will expand DeFi on Bitcoin.
Users can now leverage Sushi’s advanced trading functionalities and other features while tapping into Bitcoin’s security and decentralisation.

SushiSwap, a decentralised exchange (DEX) deployed across over 30 blockchains, is now live on Rootstock, a pioneering Bitcoin (BTC) sidechain.
The Sushi team announced the integration with Rootstock, which seeks to bring decentralised finance (DeFi) to the Bitcoin ecosystem, on Thursday. 
SUSHI price rose slightly after the news, increasing by about 3% to reach $1.23.
Major news as Sushi integrates with Bitcoin sidechain Rootstock
Rootstock is the first EVM-compatible Bitcoin (BTC) sidechain, having launched in 2018 as the crypto industry experienced exponential growth across smart contracts projects.
With security enhanced via Bitcoin’s mining mechanism, Rootstock aims to expand the world of DeFi on Bitcoin through Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. The network provides for the critical features of high scalability, fast transactions and interoperability.
Sushi’s integration will allow SUSHI holders to trade and provide liquidity on the Bitcoin sidechain, with users able to tap into Bitcoin’s security and decentralisation.
The integration will allow for the expansion of SushiSwap’s trading functionalities to Rootstock’s DeFi ecosystem.
“This collaboration marks a significant expansion into the DeFi sector for Rootstock, enhancing its ecosystem with Sushi’s advanced trading functionalities. It also strengthens Sushi’s multi-chain expansion by adding Rootstock to the network, offering users diverse options for including Bitcoin in DeFi,” the Sushi team said in an announcement.
Sushi is therefore helping to bridge Bitcoin-Fi and DeFi, giving the community access to new opportunities that leverage BTC assets.
Some of the features Sushi brings to Rootstock are token swaps and liquidity provision. Users can leverage these via Sushi’s V2 and V3 Automated Market Maker (AMM), a DEX aggregator, and Route Processor 4 (RP4). The latter provides for efficiency and optimised trading.
Rootstock users can access DeFi protocols and other dApps using RBTC, a native token pegged 1:1 to BTC.

Donald Trump Vets Vice Presidential Candidates: GOP's Top Contenders, Betting Odds - Benzinga

Former President Donald Trump is one of the leading candidates in the 2024 presidential election.After a falling out with former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump is set to select a new vice-presidential candidate to join his campaign for the 2024 election.What Happened: Trump remains the betting favorite to win the 2024 presidential election after being found guilty on 34 federal counts in a highly publicized criminal trial alleging falsified business records.While Trump awaits sentencing and an appeal in the legal process, attention on the 2024 election campaign for the former president is turning to who he will select as his running mate.Trump's campaign team has begun vetting top contenders as reported by the Associated Press.The list of vice president candidates who received vetting requests from Trump's campaign team include:North Dakota Gov. Doug BurgumSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)  Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio)Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.)Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.)Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.)Ben CarsonSources said that candidates have been asked for various levels of paperwork as part of the vetting process.The vetting process could signal a vice-presidential pick coming sooner than later, but Trump's campaign team cautioned that the process is still early."Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump," Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement shared by the Associated Press.The Republican National Convention in July could serve as one potential event to announce a running mate according to a report.Several of the candidates who have been vetted recently were among the key people who showed up at Trump's hush money trial to show support for the former president and in some cases to criticize the legal process and individuals involved as a way for Trump to get around a gag order.Related Link: Trump Found Guilty On All 34 Counts In Hush Money Criminal Trial: Here’s What Happens NextBetting Odds: With the recent list of candidates being vetted, the betting odds on prediction market Polymarket have changed.Calling itself the world's largest prediction market, Polymarket offers betting on items in categories such as politics, sports, cryptocurrency, pop culture and more.On Polymarket, users deposit to Polygon MATIC/USD using USDC USDC/USD and can deposit with Ethereum ETH/USD.

Magnetic X's Farming Protocol Drives Liquidity to XRP Ledger


							

Magnetic X’s DeFi platform on XRP Ledger fuels yield farming rewards for users.



Total value locked in XRP Ledger AMM pools surpasses $5.3 million.



High APRs drive growing interest in yield farming on the XRP Ledger.




Magnetic X, a protocol facilitating applications on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has reported significant growth in its DeFi ecosystem.



Over 37 days, 703 users (“farmers”) have collectively earned over 50,000 XRP through Magnetic X’s platform, showcasing its potential for generating rewards.







The protocol’s total liquidity now stands at 1.9 million XRP, bolstering its MAG token, currently priced at 2,240 XRP. This growth coincides with the recent surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) in XRPL AMM pools, surpassing 10 million XRP as of June 3rd.



While the recent introduction of AMM functionality to XRPL faced initial challenges with low fees, “farming” has emerged as a potential solution. By offering higher income opportunities, farming incentivizes users to provide liquidity, thereby revitalizing the AMM ecosystem.









It is to be noted that on April 30, Magnetic X had introduced XRPL farming, which quickly became popular within the community.



Notable farming pools, such as the MAG/XRP pool and a pool with a 68,000 XRP TVL and 63.56% APR, have attracted significant attention due to their high returns. The 666/XRP pool, with a TVL of 108,000 XRP and an impressive APR of 180.45%, further demonstrates the growing interest in XRPL farming.







This surge in activity aligns with a broader trend of increasing TVL in XRPL AMM pools, which has grown from 7.4 million XRP six weeks ago to over $5.3 million as of today.

'The Sandbox' Ethereum Game Valued at $1 Billion With New Funding - Decrypt

The Sandbox, an Ethereum metaverse game platform, announced Wednesday that it has raised $20 million in convertible promissory notes at a $1 billion valuation. That makes the long-running project the latest crypto “unicorn,” based on the billion-dollar valuation.The latest funding round was led by Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands; Animoca, a prominent metaverse investment firm, is also the parent of The Sandbox’s operating company, Bacasable Global Limited. LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures also participated in the round."We are deeply honored by the continuing commitment to the vision of The Sandbox, and we're incredibly excited about the future of composable user-generated content games," said Animoca co-founder and executive chairman Yat Siu, in a statement.With the new funding in tow, The Sandbox’s development team said that its key priorities include improving creator tools, adding new social and gameplay features, and developing a mobile version scheduled for 2025.The Sandbox is one of the most prominent blockchain games, thanks to partnerships with over 400 celebrities and brands—including Snoop Dogg, Gucci, and Paris Hilton—and previously immense demand for in-game land plots sold via NFTs. In fact, someone paid $450,000 worth of crypto for a land plot near Snoop Dogg’s metaverse mansion in 2021.The game’s SAND token on Ethereum remains one of the 100 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world based on market cap, per data from CoinGecko. However, the price of its NFT land plots has fallen sharply since metaverse hype peaked in early 2022—from 3.9 ETH ($11,700) to 0.08 ETH ($300) today."Our mission at The Sandbox is to develop creative tools and technologies that bring fairness and new opportunities for all types of creators in the open metaverse," said The Sandbox co-founder and CEO Arthur Madrid, in a release.Editor’s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

Ethereum’s Prospects for Hitting New All-Time High a ‘Certainty,’ Says Crypto Trader - But There’s a Catch - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst believes Ethereum (ETH) is heading to new all-time highs (ATHs).
Pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 216,900 followers on the social media platform X that ETH will likely have a massive breakout against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).










However, the trader warns that the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) continues to act as resistance for the ETH/BTC pair and there may be more downside before a breakout.
“ETH: ETH/BTC has underperformed for a while now, interesting to see that the 200-week exponential moving average is still bearish (last time it was bearish like this was March 2021). To be determined if this recent price action is ‘the bottom.’ ETH to ATH is still a certainty, but I think that this is still disturbing to watch.”



Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X



ETH/BTC is trading for 0.05384 BTC ($3,841) at time of writing, up nearly 1% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum reached an all-time high of about $4,900 in November 2021.
The analyst also believes that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), which tracks the percentage of the total market cap that belongs to Bitcoin, will continue to be bullish until the fourth quarter of this year, meaning altcoins could lag behind BTC until then.
“You should probably accumulate shitcoins from now until late Q4. Hard to say what the particular timing is but most alt/BTC pairs are going to continue to go down in my opinion. But once Q4 rolls around, expecting BTC.D to come down and for there to be some alt action.”
Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X
Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests BTC.D will reach a peak level at around 64%, about 10% higher than the current level.

Bitcoin Miner Selling Intensifies, BTC Reserves Fall To 3-Year Lows | Bitcoinist.com


								Bitcoin miners’ reserves have seen a steady decline over the past few months since the halving event in April. The latest figures indicate a massive decline to 3-year lows, signaling intense selling pressure from miners amidst fluctuating BTC prices and market volatility.
Bitcoin Miner Holdings Drop To New Lows
Before the Bitcoin halving event on April 20, market experts foresaw potential challenges for Bitcoin miners as block rewards become reduced by half. This prediction is showing true, as BTC miner holdings have witnessed a severe decline over the past few months. 

According to the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin miners’ reserves have fallen from 1.84 million BTC in the previous year to about 1.80 million BTC presently. This drop suggests that BTC miner holdings are currently at their lowest levels since Bitcoin’s Satoshi era days, which was approximately 14 years ago. 
CryptoQuant also disclosed that BTC miner reserves are down 50% from previous highs, indicating an increased selling volume from miners. This selling pressure is likely induced by the increased mining operational costs as investors continue selling off their Bitcoin holdings to acquire better mining equipment to remain financially stable. 
The cost of BTC mining is escalating as electricity prices rise and mining rewards reduce. The need for more efficient hardware has also become increasingly urgent in order to keep up with the complexities associated with BTC mining.  
Moreover, Bloomberg reported that BTC miners stand to lose $10 billion in revenue annually, spurred on by the far-reaching effects of the Bitcoin halving cycle. This pessimistic outlook is also magnified as BTC mining hash rates reach 3-year lows after witnessing its largest crash since 2021. 
Excluding miner reserves, the price of Bitcoin witnessed massive declines after the halving event in April. At the time, its trading volume plummeted significantly, suggesting a decline in investor demand and interest in the cryptocurrency. 
Currently, BTC seems to be steadily approaching its all-time high, surging past the $71,000 mark earlier this week. The unexpected momentum has been partly attributed to the increased inflows from investors into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs has also had a positive impact on the price of BTC, indicating investors increasing interest in the cryptocurrency. 
BTC Miners Turn To AI
Amidst Bitcoin miners dwindling reserves, many are now turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a way to generate more revenue. Recently Core Scientific, a BTC mining titan, announced a 12-year collaboration with Core Weave, a specialized cloud provider and AI hyperscaler. 

Core Scientific has revealed plans to support CoreWeave, expanding the relationship between the two companies in the hopes of generating more than $3.5 million in revenue over the next 12 years.

BNB's Impossible Pump | Bankless


Sudden Surge. Binance founder CZ just started his 4-month prison sentence, but that hasn’t stopped the native token of his exchange’s closely affiliated BNB Chain from achieving its highest price ever! Why is BNB outperforming this week?BNB has gained over 20% off Monday’s lows, breaking out above $700 for the first time in history. It has not given back a rally since shortly after Binance’s November settlement announcement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.Although BNB is exhibiting outsized strength at the moment, it is not alone in the pump. This move up comes at the same time as many cryptos, stocks, and commodities have gained on investor optimism as major Western central banks commence their rate cut processes.Source: TradingViewMany onchain BNB metrics have ticked steadily upwards this week, with daily transaction fees and DEX volumes seeing the greatest impacts from the surging speculative activity that has resulted from BNB’s gains; both metrics have more than doubled from Monday!While the majority of blockchains – from Solana to Sei and Arbitrum to Optimism – have seen on-chain usage statistics slide lower this week, BNB Chain has been one of the few holdouts to experience increases in daily active addresses and transaction counts.Unfortunately, these recent increases are merely blips from a longer-term time perspective, and every major onchain BNB metric remains well below its March 2024 local highs set after BTC obtained new all-time highs.Indicating that this rally has largely been driven by speculation, open interest on BNB perpetual swaps has exploded by 50% during this week's move up to reach $1.05B, the highest level on record, suggesting that leverage traders (who will eventually need to close their positions) heavily contributed to the gains.Source: CoinGlassShould crypto prices continue to rise in the coming months as global central banks lower their interest rate targets, BNB likely ascends alongside, and is a prime candidate for outperformance among the majors.BNB’s relative strength has increased by a respective 29% and 35% against BTC and ETH during 2024, and despite the fact that there is zero possibility this token receives a spot ETF at any time in the future like these two alternatives, its holders could be positioned for enhanced upside if recent performance holds.

Top Crypto Analyst Shuffles Altcoin Portfolio Before Ethereum ETF: Here's What He Rotated Into - Benzinga

Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe shared insights about recent adjustments to his altcoin portfolio in a new podcast episode.What Happened: Van de Poppe remains optimistic about altcoins, focusing on higher ROI prospects, influenced by the pending approval of the Ethereum ETH/USD ETF. He detailed that around four weeks ago, he went all-in on altcoins but has since adjusted their specific holdings."Altcoins are going to do really well," he said, attributing recent underperformance to Bitcoin ETF impacts. He noted his high-risk appetite, quoting, "That’s how I made a lot of money and that’s how I lost a lot of money."He adds that the reason for markets to trade sideways is due to the Ether ETF has not been entirely approved, with only the 19B-4 filings greenlit but not the S-1 filings. He predicted, "Once that kicks in, the interest starts to come into the markets and into the ETF."Altcoin Rotation StrategyHe emphasized targeting altcoins with higher potential returns, specifically those affected by Binance’s recent focus on low floating high FDV coins. Coins like Celestia TIA/USD saw significant runs after listing on Binance, illustrating the exchange's market-moving power.Focusing on market movers like Binance and BlackRock is crucial as BTC price surge was led by BlackRock’s ETF involvement. He stressed the importance of shifting from older altcoins like Atom ATOM/USD and Curve CRV/USD which have underperformed, to newer projects with better upside potential. Some examples include:
Renzo RENZO/USD: This one dropped around 70% since and is showing an opportunity.



Portal PORTAL/USD: A gaming coin with a relatively higher floating supply. It has seen a drop of 70 to 80% and starts to grind up.



Wormhole (CRYPTO: W): Added to the portfolio due to expected higher returns based on recent performance.

ECB rate cut could spur Bitcoin and stablecoin growth in Eurozone, experts highlight - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates by 0.25% today, making it the first cut in five years and reducing it to 3.75%. Crypto industry experts shared with Crypto Briefing that this movement is important for different reasons, as it raises important questions about stablecoins in the European Union and the demand for Bitcoin in the Eurozone.Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research analyst at Nansen, explained that the ECB’s rate cut was already priced in by the markets, so investors shouldn’t have surprises. 
“In general, the ECB has less influence than the Fed on crypto markets, and the ECB follows the Fed, not the other way around. The reason why the ECB cut earlier than the Fed is the weakness of growth in the Eurozone vs the US,” Barthere added.
As reported by BBC, Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB said the outlook for inflation had improved “markedly”, paving the way for the rate cut. Yet, Lagarde warned investors to keep their hopes in check, as inflation might average 2.5% in 2024, and the ECB would keep interest rate policy “sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary.”Nevertheless, the ECB decision might benefit the crypto market indirectly, highlighted Eneko Knörr, CEO of Stabolut. “While European economic policies might not have a direct influence on global crypto trends, lower interest rates generally drive investors toward higher-risk, higher-return assets,” he explained.As a result, crypto might become more attractive as investors seek better yields. Therefore, the rate cut could boost interest in crypto as part of a broader search for higher returns.Moreover, Bitfinex analysts assessed that this move aims to stimulate economic growth amid signs of a slowdown in the Eurozone, although this might weaken the euro. This is good news for crypto, as investors in the European Union could ramp up their demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin. “The increased liquidity from this monetary easing could also support risk assets, including crypto.”Kevin de Patoul, CEO of Keyrock, is also keen to believe that the rate cuts are a bullish signal for markets with higher risks and potential returns. Additionally, the stablecoin sector in the Eurozone might witness a significant impact. 
“This move raises important questions about the future of EURO stablecoins, especially in light of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation coming into effect in June. The rate cut could significantly impact the financial outlook for EURO stablecoin issuers.”
Weighing if this decision affects the FOMC meeting next week in the US, Knörr stated that the Fed decisions are largely irrelevant to ECB actions, and vice-versa. However, the ECB’s rate cut might signal to markets that inflation concerns may be easing.

Jim Cramer is right: Dog coin ETFs are this bull market’s missing spark - Blockworks


All things considered, there probably won’t be a BONK ETF anytime soon.
But the notion that cryptocurrencies might one day invade the stodgy stock market via ETFs is seriously compelling. 
Mad Money host Jim Cramer was on the right track during his CNBC appearance yesterday. “Why shouldn’t there be a BONK ETF?” Cramer asked SEC Chair Gary Gensler.
However, the real trick to getting SEC approval has turned out to be courting CME, which is regulated by the CFTC — and not Gensler’s agency. Bitcoin and ether both had futures markets for years before spot ETFs were approved.
Perhaps a dog coin fund might be an easier sell. Coinbase Derivatives, which is also regulated by the CFTC, launched its own dogecoin futures markets not long ago.
CME Group denied it had any plans for dogecoin futures when rumors circulated in 2021. What better time to revisit that decision than now?
CNBC talks memecoins — a bull signal?
It wasn’t even just a BONK ETF that was floated on CNBC yesterday. Cramer also made the case for ETFs backed by sushiswap, polkadot, cardano (he called it “cordano”), immutable, ronin and osmosis and myneighbouralice.
“[They have] all traded millions — I’m talking millions of dollars this very morning… I would think that BONK is a natural, and osmosis… shouldn’t we have some sort of product?”
Gensler sidestepped by redirecting the question to the matter of disclosure. Today is the SEC’s 90th birthday, he said, and reminded the audience (talking into the camera) that President Roosevelt created the Commission to ensure sellers of securities openly inform prospective investors so they can make better decisions.
The moment Gensler found out about $CRAMER, which spiked up to 500% following the segment (Source: CNBC Television)
Gensler’s point was that those disclosures supposedly aren’t happening across crypto. If you ask lobbyists, industry lawyers and founders, this is because issuers and protocol stewards simply don’t consider the tokens securities or investment contracts — so there’s no disclosure required. And in many cases, there’s no centralized entity through which to disclose.

Then Gensler came for the crypto exchanges. 
“These crypto exchanges, Jim, are doing things we would never allow this New York Stock Exchange to do,” Gensler said. “Our laws don’t allow you to trade against your customers.”
But the previous questions were awkward for Gensler, even before Cramer brought up memecoins that borrow likenesses of celebrities and other media personalities, including himself and the SEC chair.
(Gensler said those should be registered as securities, but it’s unclear whether he fully grokked the concept of memecoins about public figures that weren’t issued by the actual person.)
Cramer may not have remembered, but the SEC already labeled cardano a security in both Coinbase and Binance lawsuits filed last June, alongside a dozen others including solana, polygon, BNB, internet computer, filecoin and Axie Infinity. 
So far, the companies and entities working to build out those ecosystems haven’t been sued — just crypto exchanges found listing them. Tron founder Justin Sun was sued separately months before over TRX and bittorrent (BTT), while the SEC stung Ripple Labs for XRP in December 2020 and sent Uniswap Labs a Wells notice in April.


The colorful band of lines beneath the cross pulls downward following the lawsuits — but few have recovered
Still, the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits coincided with a severe drop in the bitcoin ratios for the tokens singled out by the SEC. 
Most had fallen more than 10% against bitcoin in the three days following the suits, with those losses doubling over the next two weeks or so. Bitcoin itself dropped around 7% over the same period.
To date, only bitcoin ratios for solana and near have made it back out of the 13 tokens named by the SEC, followed by ICP, which is only just short. Ironically, near and ICP have been largely invigorated by the AI narrative, of which Gensler is a huge fan.
However, beating bitcoin (and thus growing the bitcoin ratio) has been tough this bull market, and tons of cryptocurrencies that haven’t been named as securities by the SEC have underperformed. 
This bull market has been lacking a true altcoin season. Perhaps a few filings for dogecoin ETFs will be the catalyst.

Stablecoin bill may pass before the election, says JPMorgan

Photo: Mike Segar (Reuters)The stablecoin bill is likely to be approved before the presidential election and poses a threat to Tether’s dominance, according to JPMorgan, as reported by CoinDesk. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is now less likely to issue a central bank digital currency after a House bill last month banned the central bank from doing so, per the report.Softening jobs market could actually be good news, says strategistIn light of the current state of crypto regulations in the U.S., JPMorgan shared its report on what is likely to happen in the near future. Analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team have reported that new regulatory measures seem to oppose the Federal Reserve’s development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), per CoinDesk. According to the investment bank, regulators may favor U.S.-compliant stablecoins, potentially reducing the dominance of non-compliant stablecoins, such as Tether— the biggest stablecoin, as reported by CoinDesk. Notably, stablecoins – the type of cryptocurrencies pegged to assets or fiat currencies – have faced scrutiny from regulators over their functionality. The analysts said the stablecoin bill, named “Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act,” has the potential to be passed before the 2024 presidential election. Moreover, the bank stated that U.S. banks would be discouraged from involvement in cryptocurrencies, per the report. JP Morgan did not immediately respond to a Quartz request for comment on the reported analysis.Last month, the House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which now has to be approved by the Senate and by the president. It is unlikely to happen before the election, according to the bank.

What Lower Interest Rates Mean for Crypto Investors


The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BoC) have cut interest rates, marking a pivotal shift in monetary policy. 
The ECB reduced its key rate to 3.75% from 4%, a move anticipated by markets despite ongoing inflationary pressures in the eurozone. Meanwhile, the BoC lowered its key policy rate to 4.75% from 5%, becoming the first G7 nation to do so in the current cycle.
ECB, BoC Slash Interest Rates

The ECB’s decision, influenced by an updated inflation outlook, reflects the need to moderate monetary policy after a period of steady rates. The ECB’s latest projections show a slight increase in inflation expectations for 2024 and 2025, with 2026 remaining stable at 1.9%. 

“Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady,” Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, said in a statement.

This cut is the first since September 2019 and follows a series of hikes that began later than other central banks but now places the ECB ahead in reducing rates.
On the other hand, the BoC’s rate cut aims to ease the burden on highly indebted consumers. Governor Tiff Macklem emphasized that future cuts would depend on continued downward inflation trends. 

“Governing Council is closely watching the evolution of core inflation and remains particularly focused on the balance between demand and supply in the economy, inflation expectations, wage growth, and corporate pricing behaviour,” the BoC Governing Council said in a statement.

These rate cuts have several implications for the crypto market. Lower interest rates typically reduce borrowing costs, encouraging both consumer spending and business investment. This increased liquidity can boost investments in higher-yielding assets, including cryptocurrencies. Additionally, lower returns on traditional savings can drive investors toward riskier assets like crypto.
Furthermore, the rate cuts might lead to higher prices for crypto. With safer investments offering lower returns, investors often seek higher returns in the crypto market. This shift can increase demand for digital assets, potentially driving up their value.

However, the moves by the ECB and BoC come with caution. Both institutions indicate that future cuts will be data-dependent, highlighting a cautious approach amid uncertain economic conditions. Economists suggest that the ECB may wait until September for another cut, while the BoC might move again in July.

European Central Bank Cuts Rates-What It Means for the Fed and Bitcoin - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsThe European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its three key interest rates by 25 basis points each on Thursday—and crypto bulls are anticipating a potential boost to Bitcoin's price, particularly amid speculation that the Fed could follow suit.The organization’s new rate for its main refinancing operations is now 4.25%. Meanwhile, the rates for its marginal lending facility and deposit facility are now 4.5% and 3.75%, respectively. This marks the central bank’s first rate cut in nearly five years.“Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly,” wrote the ECB in a Thursday press release. “It is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady.”The ECB’s decision proves that a global central bank pivot is now well underway, after monetary authorities across the globe raised rates to address surging inflation during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Swiss Central Bank already announced its first 25 basis point cut in March, while the Bank of Canada confirmed its first cut in four years on Wednesday.The question now is whether the United States Federal Reserve will soon follow suit. A similar move could prove bullish for stocks and crypto alike, which historically perform well during periods of cheap borrowing and money supply growth.However, unlike other regions, inflation in the United States remains stubbornly above 3%, while Fed officials refuse to accept any result less than its 2% target.In a Monday interview, Neel Kashkari—president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis—argued that citizens would rather put up with a shrinking economy than with persistently high inflation.Combined with continued resilience in wage growth and the labor market, he expects rates to remain high for some time.“If I look at this resilience and economic activity, that does not look like an economy that is under pressure of very high, very tight monetary policy," he saidAccording to CME FedWatch, the consensus view is that rate cuts will arrive later this year—possibly in September, and almost certainly by November. June, however, is considered to be almost certainly a write-off.“The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” wrote the Federal Reserve in a statement following its last meeting in May.Interest rate cuts are historically positive for Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, with some analysts pegging BTC's recent price uptick on bets that the Fed and others will indeed trim down rates.Even so, prominent BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has theorized that money supply growth—and hence, new highs for Bitcoin—will happen regardless of whether the Fed cuts rates or not.The U.S. Treasury, for example, must continue making high interest rate payments to bondholders while rates are elevated, putting money in people’s pockets and counteracting the intended effect of higher rates.“When you combine Fed and Treasury activities, the net is an injection of $21 billion per month,” Hayes wrote to Twitter in February. “This is one reason why tech/AI [and] crypto are pumping and will continue to pump.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

Ethereum ETF Approval Sparks Altcoin Frenzy, Meme Coin Mania: What Investors Need To Know - Benzinga

The approval of Ethereum ETFs stirred the competition between Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD for dominance in the smart contract arena. Should Solana also receive ETF approval, the rivalry is expected to escalate, potentially influencing both platforms’ market dynamics. Analysts suggest that Layer 1 blockchains such as Avalanche AVAX/USD and Cardano ADA/USD might benefit from a broader market surge despite the initial focus on Ethereum.Altcoins: A Mixed BagAccording to analysts, the influx of new investors through the Ethereum ETF might create a "rising tide lifting all boats" effect. Established altcoins such as Cardano and Polkadot DOT/USD, known for their strong utility functions and established developer communities, could see substantial price increases. These altcoins, offering real-world solutions, may attract investors seeking broader blockchain ecosystem exposure beyond Ethereum.However, a "flight to quality" scenario might emerge. New investors, prioritizing perceived stability, could favor Ethereum over riskier altcoins, potentially causing a temporary decline in prices of smaller altcoins, especially those grappling with scalability or unclear roadmaps.Meme Coins: A Speculative PlayDue to increased crypto market attention, meme coins like Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD could experience a surge in interest. Platforms such as Binance Square anticipate a meme coin frenzy. However, this spike might be short-lived. Many meme coins lack strong utility and rely heavily on social media hype.Projects with long-term value propositions and proven technologies may become more attractive to investors as the market matures, possibly leading to a "meme coin top" where only the strongest meme coins with real-world applications or unique features survive.Ethereum vs. Solana: The Battle for SupremacyThe Ethereum ETF could see Ethereum's price reach new heights due to increased investor interest. However, Solana’s potential ETF approval might balance the competition in the long term. The success of both platforms depends on addressing scalability issues. Ethereum's transition to Ethereum 2.0 promises improved transaction speeds and reduced fees, while Solana offers high speed and low fees but faces challenges like network congestion and potential centralization. The platform that balances speed, security and scalability will likely dominate the smart contracts space.Layer 1 Blockchains: Potential ResurgenceDespite recent challenges, Layer 1 blockchains such as Avalanche and Cardano could benefit from a broader market surge. Avalanche is known for its high transaction speeds and low fees, while Cardano focuses on security and a research-driven approach. These projects must attract developers and build robust decentralized ecosystems to thrive. Layer 1s offering genuine alternatives to Ethereum are more likely to experience a resurgence.Navigating a Fiery MarketThe Ethereum ETF marks a pivotal shift in the cryptocurrency market, bringing opportunities and challenges for different sectors. Investors should focus on specific use cases, technological advancements, development roadmaps and community engagement of various projects.Staying informed about regulatory developments and technological innovations is crucial for navigating the evolving Web3 space. While meme coins may offer short-term excitement, established altcoins and Layer 1s with strong development teams and clear value propositions are likely better bets for long-term gains.Where To Learn MoreAs Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event approaches, the insights on Ethereum and its impact on the broader cryptocurrency market are particularly relevant. Scheduled for Nov. 19, 2024, at Convene, 225 Liberty St. in New York City, this one-day event promises a comprehensive exploration of digital asset innovation. Attendees can look forward to networking opportunities and discussions with industry leaders, making it a must-attend for anyone interested in the future of digital assets.Photo: Courtesy Shutterstock

Bitcoin Open Interest Sets New All-Time High: Is Price Next?


								Data shows the Bitcoin derivatives Open Interest has shot up to a new all-time high (ATH) recently. Here’s what this could mean for the asset’s price.
Bitcoin Open Interest Has Registered A Steep Rise Recently
In a post on X, CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn has discussed about the latest trend in the Open Interest for Bitcoin. The “Open Interest” here refers to the total amount of derivatives positions related to the cryptocurrency that are currently open on all exchanges.

When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market right now. Generally, the total amount of leverage in the sector goes up when this trend forms, so it may lead to the asset’s price registering a higher degree of volatility.
On the other hand, a decrease in the indicator suggests the derivatives users are either closing up positions of their own violation or getting forcibly liquidated by their platforms. Either way, the coin could become more stable following such a drop, due to the decreased leverage.
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past few years:

The value of the metric seems to have been climbing up over the last few days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X
As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest had sharply risen earlier in the year when the cryptocurrency’s price had witnessed its rally towards the new ATH.
In this surge, the indicator had surpassed its record value set during the peak of the 2021 bull run. As the price fell to consolidation following the mid-March ATH, though, the metric also observed a cooldown.
With the latest recovery run for Bitcoin, however, the trend has once again seen a reversal for the Open Interest, as investors have rapidly started opening new positions. The indicator’s value has now surpassed the high seen earlier in the year, and by a margin at that.
It would appear that speculation has made a return in the market in full force and as it has often happened historically, these extreme levels of Open Interest could once again result in some sharp price action for the cryptocurrency. The direction of these fluctuations, of course, can be in either direction.
As mentioned earlier, the reason volatility goes up after an increase in the Open Interest is due to a rise in the leverage. When leverage increases, mass liquidations become more probable to take place in the market. It’s these high amount of liquidations that can trigger chaos in the market.

In an earlier X post, Maartunn had shared how the the aggregated Open Interest in the cryptocurrency sector as a whole had been approaching an ATH. Therefore, it would appear that Bitcoin isn’t the only coin that has been witnessing an increased appetite for speculative activity recently.

Robert Kiyosaki Confident Bitcoin Will Hit $350K By August 2024, Here's How


																Robert Kiyosaki, financial guru and author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has made a staggering prediction for bitcoin’s (BTC) price in the next two months.
In a recent tweet, Kiyosaki said he is confident that BTC will be worth $350,000 by August 25.
BTC to Tap $350K in August
Kiyosaki said while his prediction may be “suckers bait,” speculation, and an opinion, it is not a lie because any forecast about the future is not false. Nevertheless, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author revealed that he wanted the BTC at $350,000 prediction to come true.
As a years-long Bitcoin supporter and proponent, Kiyosaki has touted the cryptocurrency, alongside gold and silver, as a must-have asset for individuals and entities who want to survive the impending crash of the United States dollar.
Earlier this year, he predicted that BTC would tap $100,000 in June 2024 and $300,000 by the end of the year. At the time of writing, BTC had yet to surpass its all-time high of $73,700 and hovered around $71,000. However, all hope is not lost as the crypto market is known for its extreme pumps and could pull a surprise that would see BTC surge past the predicted price within hours or days.




Kiyosaki’s latest prediction is a step up from its previous forecast of BTC at $300,000 by year-end. The absence of a major Bitcoin event or upgrade that could trigger a rally strong enough to push BTC past $300,000 in the next two months raises the question of the source of Kiyosaki’s confidence in such a prediction.
The financial guru attributed his confidence to the incompetence of U.S. leaders, including President Joe Biden, Fed chair Jerome Powell, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Although Kiyosaki’s BTC prediction remains a wish, he said he is certain about the incompetence of the American leaders, who he tagged stooges.
Kiyosaki Endorses ETH and SOL
Interestingly, Kiyosaki has added Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) to his list of safe-haven assets, along with gold, BTC, and silver. He urged his followers to buy more of the cryptocurrencies and precious metals to protect themselves from the three stooges.
“I am confident Bitcoin will hit $350,000 sometime in 2024 but for it’s only a target, a dream, and a wish.  I keep buying more Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, because quite certain their prices will continue to rise,” Kiyosaki stated.

Congress Considers Benefits of Tokenizing Real World Assets - The Defiant

“Tokenization can leverage the efficiency and transparency of blockchains to help modernize U.S. markets,” said Congressman French Hill.On June 5, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing titled "Next Generation Infrastructure: How Tokenization of Real-World Assets Will Facilitate Efficient Markets."The discussion focused on tokenization, the process by which real-world assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate are represented digitally on a blockchain.“With the help of blockchain, tokenization can automate some of [the] critical processes within a financial transaction, bringing along streamlined settlement and lower costs,” said committee Chairman Rep. French Hill of Arizona in his opening remarks.One of the examples discussed was BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has distributed $1.7 million in dividends to date using the Ethereum blockchain, highlighting the technology’s ability to streamline and automate aspects of asset management and financial transactions. BUIDL has grown to a $462 million market capitalization in less than three months.BUIDL Market CapU.S. lawmakers heard testimony from several industry experts, including Nadine Chakar, the global head of DTCC Digital Assets, who emphasized the transformative potential of tokenization for established markets such as U.S. equities and Treasuries.The DTCC is no stranger to the technology, having recently conducted a ‘Smart NAV’ pilot to evaluate the feasibility of distributing mutual fund Net Asset Value (NAV) data on blockchain networks.Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, shared insights into his company's efforts in creating regulated platforms for tokenizing and trading financial assets on public blockchains."This technology can improve how money flows from companies to investors so investors can redeploy their assets and get better returns," he said.Robert Morgan, CEO of the USDF Consortium, discussed tokenization's potential to improve financing options for consumers and small businesses. By offering more efficient payment solutions and reducing credit costs, tokenized mechanisms like bank-minted deposit tokens could enhance financial inclusion, according to Morgan.Chairman Hill also criticized the anti-crypto stance of U.S. financial regulators, such as the SEC and Federal Reserve.“The private sector should not have to pursue a financial regulator’s endorsement prior to exploring the latest innovation in technologies for a possible way to save the company and consumers money and have a more effective product,” he noted.

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Responds To Celebrity Memecoins: 'How Do We Push Things In A Better Direction?' - Benzinga

When Vitalik Buterin helped found Ethereum in 2013, he envisioned using the platform and blockchain technology as a force for good. He envisioned the network as a means to increase social welfare and provide users access to valuable projects. It makes sense, then, that Buterin has criticized the meme coin craze overtaking the crypto community in 2024. Buterin stated he is not a fan of the meme coin frenzy and prefers the community push "things in a better direction."Don't Miss:Buterin's comments were in response to a post on X regarding the Mother Iggy (MOTHER) token, a project centered on rapper Iggy Azalea. "If $MOTHER breaks into sustainable value creation, it'll also be the mother of this cycle's celebrity experimentation," said Chris Burniske on X. The Ethereum co-founder responded, stating he is "feeling quite unhappy about with [sic] ‘this cycle's celebrity experimentation' so far," and that he can respect the means "if the end is worthy (health care, open source software, art, etc)."Buterin argues that the creators of these tokens use celebrities' names to attract investors while providing little value in return. He contends this practice detracts funds from more useful projects and contradicts his original vision for Ethereum. Celebrity memecoins have recently become popular among crypto investors. Tokens centered around celebrities like Donald Trump, Caitlyn Jenner, and Elon Musk have attracted billions in investment without providing much value. While most of these meme projects are antithetical to Buterin's grand vision for Ethereum, he mentioned one project that used its funds to add value, though not to the scale he hoped for."Ashton and Mila’s Stoner Cats was vastly more honorable than anything we’ve seen from this 2024 celebrity memecoin era — at least there was an actual show being funded," Buterin noted. The Stoner Cats project featured an NFT collection, which funded an animated show. The project raised enough to hire Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Chris Rock, and Buterin himself as voice actors. Stoner Cats is an example of how crypto project funds can create valuable content. However, the SEC sued Stoner Cats over its NFT offering, resulting in a $1 million civil penalty.With many projects aiming to drive up token prices or make quick money, Buterin asks, "How do we push things in a better direction?" It will be interesting to see how projects respond to his call-out. Read Next:

How Many Users Does Farcaster Actually Have? - The Defiant

A Dune dashboard says 55,000 daily active users (DAU) , but their API says it may be a tenth of that.Farcaster is the blockchain-based social media darling of this cycle, enjoying parabolic growth and a billion-dollar valuation, but data show active users may be a fraction of the most widely-cited numbers.Farcaster has a public API endpoint, which fetches “Power Badge” users, defined as users “who are active, interesting to others and not spammy,” according to the app’s documentation. As social media is overrun by bots, Farcaster’s Power Badge users offer a more reliable way to gauge actual daily active users (DAU).The Defiant ran the numbers and found there are 4,360 daily Power Badge users, compared with the 55,000 daily active users shown on the most popular Dune Analytics dashboard for the app. The dashboard measures DAUs by users performing some action on the platform, and is often cited by Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero."It's Just Bots"The findings signal crypto-based social media adoption is still a niche use-case, even by crypto standards. For reference, exchanges Coinbase and Uniswap boast about 300,000 DAUs. Activity on crypto-based social media, also known as SocialFi, is negligible compared with web2 social media. X has 250 million DAUs.The discrepancy between a superficial reading of Farcaster’s user data and the power-user numbers also signal how untrustworthy web3 activity metrics are as bots muddle the data.“It's quite painful that I see a lot of those decentralized social projects, they try to say, ‘hey, we have this much DAU,’ – No, it's not real.The data is all open,” Suji Yan, the founder of Mask Network, one of the earliest blockchain-based social media networks, said in an interview. “It's an elephant in the room. Everyone should know that it's just bots.”Entrepreneur Liron Shapira pointed to the relatively low Farcaster DAUs the public API was fetching in a May 23 X post. “I now believe Farcaster has between 50 and 5k DAUs, not 45k as a naive reading of Dune Analytics would suggest,” he wrote. He told The Defiant that the reason is that Dune “counts bots.”Romero did not publicly reply to Shapira’s claims or to a request for comment from The Defiant.Activity SlidesBut even using Dune Analytics’ data, activity on Farcaster’s has been sliding lately. Reactions and casts–the equivalent of X’s posts or likes– have more than halved to 3.1 million from 6.1 million a month ago.Farcaster DAUs - Dune AnalyticsFarcaster isn’t alone. In recent months, SocialFi has dipped towards its all-time low in activity, with most networks trending downwards with haste. BitClout, which launched in 2021 and is backed by big-name investors including Winklevoss Capital has all but faded out.Another formerly popular SocialFi app, Friend Tech, showcases a meager 230 DAUs, down 97% from its peak.Farcaster launched in 2020 with its founding team composed of Dan Romero and Varun Srinivasan. In June the protocol announced its most recent funding round, a $150 million Series A at a valuation of $1 billion, led by Paradigm Capital, a16z, and Huan Ventures among others. Srinivasan said Farcaster is “sufficiently decentralized.”White-Listed AccountsOther analysts say Farcaster’s active users may be even lower than what the Power Badge user numbers suggest. Geoff Golberg, founder of Social Forensics, which specializes in social media analytics, said of the 4,344 accounts he found using the API on May 9, roughly 21% or 918 accounts didn’t register any activity.Farcaster documentation shows accounts must be active to earn a Power Badge, which leads to an unsettling implication: A large number of accounts appear to have been white-listed to have Power Badges, Golberg said.Golberg said he came to this conclusion after digging into the data when he found he had lost his Power Badge after criticizing Farcaster for inflating its metrics.“It certainly feels as though the Farcaster team is attempting to silence my voice by reducing the visibility of my account,” he wrote in a May 9 post. “Web2 social’s shadowban has evolved to Web3 social’s shadowban.”Walking the Web3 TalkThe implication that Farcaster is unilaterally and opaquely white-listing or shadow-banning accounts goes directly against the ethos of blockchain-based social media. Web3 proponents say SocialFi will offer users permissionless access to open source social networks. The web3 ideal is that users will control their data and assets, and share the upside of the platforms’ growth.Golberg’s analysis is likely not enough to prove that Farcaster is manipulating user engagement in a centralized way.But the platform’s API does show that so far, a small subset of crypto users are walking the talk when it comes to using SocialFi.

Tether (USDT) Report from JPMorgan - Here is the Bank's Assessment - Bitcoin Sistemi


JPMorgan noted in a recent research report that U.S. crypto regulations are moving in a direction that favors the launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), looks negatively on crypto adoption by local banks, and non-compliant stablecoins.
The bank notes that regulatory initiatives have increased in the US in recent months, raising questions about the direction of crypto regulation ahead of the presidential elections later this year.


Analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a report on Wednesday: “They are against a coin tied to the Fed, against U.S. banks dealing with cryptocurrency, against non-compliant stablecoins like Tether (USDT), and against all tokens other than Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) being securities.” “They are against being classified as such,” he wrote.

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), passed by the House of Representatives last month, still needs to be approved by the Senate and ultimately the President. The bank said this was unlikely to happen before the election.





JPMorgan noted that Congress passed a resolution overturning the SAB 121 accounting rule that made it harder for banks to store crypto assets, but the resolution was vetoed by President Joe Biden.
The report said the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Anti-Surveillance Act is an attempt to block a U.S. CBDC, preventing Fed banks from offering certain products to consumers and using a central bank digital currency for monetary policy. The bill banning the FED from issuing CBDC was passed by the House of Representatives last month, but it is unclear whether it will be accepted in the Senate.

The Sandbox Raises at $1B Valuation | Bankless


Crypto gaming startup The Sandbox has raised $20M at a $1B valuation. Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands led the investment, which was supported by LG Tech Ventures and True Global Ventures.What's the scoop?Token Reaction: Following the funding announcement, the SAND token increased by 4.5%, though this new round speaks to the broader challenges in the NFT and gaming spaces. The company’s private valuation went from a targeted $4B in 2022 to an actualized $1B today.Future Plans: The capital will go towards enhancing features and developing a decentralized metaverse for mobile devices, which is expected to launch in 2025. Updates to some of its other tools are also planned.Bankless Take:While the “metaverse” stood out as a central narrative last cycle, we have yet to see it return to those heights this time around. That being said, the ability to build one’s own metaverse for friends or a community remains an intriguing prospect, evident from the reported 5.7M users and >1K unique experiences developed via The Sandbox since its Alpha release last November. With projections that the metaverse may add $5T to the global economy by 2030, this forever sought-after virtual land continues to draw investment, especially from the Web3 angle that believes digital ownership via blockchains would be a way for users, not just providers like Minecraft or Roblox, to share these riches.

Terraforms Explained: ETH's Best Onchain Art? | Bankless


My two favorite NFT projects are Nouns and Terraforms. Nouns, I intend to join. Terraforms, I intend to keep collecting. Full disclosure: I hold a few Terraforms right now! I’d like to have a lot more, and honestly, the driving motivation isn’t financial. I find these digital artifacts mesmerizing and likely to age like fine wine in various senses atop Ethereum. The magic here is due in no small part to the creator duo, Mathcastles, being new masters who have used Ethereum as an artistic medium, a computational creative engine, to an extent we haven’t seen before. That said, I feel confident that in 100 years, the art world will look back on Terraforms as important, a major first mover in runtime art because they will see what I see now: a series that broke new ground in a way that expanded the possibilities of art itself. This is high praise, of course, but Terraforms is also hard to explain. It has many nuances and transcends genres. For this post, let’s catch you up on the basics of this unique collection and why, in my humble opinion, it’s one of the best examples of onchain art on Ethereum today! First, What Is Runtime Art?Runtime art is a burgeoning genre within the digital art world that leverages the unique capabilities of blockchain tech, e.g. Ethereum, to create dynamic and evolving artworks. Unlike traditional digital art, which is typically static and stored offchain, runtime art is generated and maintained entirely on the blockchain. This means that the artwork is not just a stored image but an active, living entity that evolves over time based on the underlying smart contract code.At its core, runtime art is about creating art that is dynamically computed at the smart contract level. When I say "runtime," I’m referring to the period during which a program is running. In the context of Ethereum, this means that the art is continuously generated and updated by the smart contract moment by moment, every time it is interacted with. The art can change and adapt in response to various inputs, in other words, such as time, blockchain data (like gas prices or block hashes), or user interactions.While runtime art is still a young genre, several projects have already made significant impacts here. Among these, Terraforms by Mathcastles stands out as one of the prime examples. 
That’s because the Terraforms collection takes full advantage of Ethereum's capabilities to create a series of artworks that are not only visually stunning but also dynamically generated and continuously evolving. This makes Terraforms a trailblazer in the realm of runtime art, pushing the boundaries of what digital art can be and setting a high standard for future projects in this genre.What Are Terraforms?VIDEOLaunched on the Ethereum blockchain in December 2021, Terraforms is the brainchild of the anonymous duo known as Mathcastles, comprised of 0x113d and xaltgeist. At its core, Terraforms is a generative art project that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to create dynamic, interactive, and fully onchain artworks. Each NFT in the Terraforms collection represents a "parcel" of land within a conceptual 20-level virtual "Hypercastle." These parcels are not mere static images but are living pieces of art that evolve over time, driven by the underlying smart contract code.via the Unofficial Terraforms Community FAQ The Terraforms Hypercastle is a complex, multi-layered virtual structure. Each of the 11,104 parcels within the Hypercastle is a 32x32 grid of Unicode characters, creating a visually striking and symbolically rich piece of art. These parcels are categorized by several traits, including:Zones: 75 distinct color palettes.Biomes: 92 sets of glyphs used for animation.Chroma: The pace of animation akin to a heartbeat.Topography: The heightmap of each parcel, introducing a temporal dimension as the height fluctuates over time.Additionally, Terraforms offers a unique system of “modes” that enhance the interactivity and dynamism of the series. Each parcel within the Terraforms collection can exist in different modes, each with its own characteristics and functionalities. Here's a brief overview:Terrain ModeTerrain mode is the default state of a Terraforms parcel. In this mode, the parcel displays a pulsing ASCII design that resembles a topographical map.This mode showcases the initial generative art created by the smart contract. It is static in terms of user modification, but the visuals are dynamic and continuously evolving.Daydream ModeWhen a parcel is switched to Daydream mode, it becomes a blank slate that the owner can use to create custom ASCII art.Owners can activate Daydream mode by entering a command directly into the contract via Etherscan. They can then use community-built tools to draw on their parcel.Once a parcel is switched from Terrain to Daydream mode, this change is irreversible. However, modifications within Daydream mode can be reversed.Terraform ModeTerraform mode is activated when the custom drawings made in Daydream mode are saved back to the blockchain.Parcels can switch between Daydream and Terraform modes indefinitely. This flexibility allows owners to continuously refine and update their designs.In Terraform mode, the custom ASCII art becomes a permanent part of the parcel's blockchain record, viewable by others.Antenna ModeAntenna mode is a new feature introduced with the Terraforms 2.0 upgrade. It allows parcels in Daydream or Terraform modes to receive broadcasts and updates from new artwork programs, i.e., new smart contracts.To activate Antenna mode, owners need to interact with the contract on Etherscan, providing their parcel IDs and enabling the feature.Antenna mode can be turned on or off, offering flexibility and control over the parcel's interaction with new broadcasts.The contract tracks when a parcel enters Antenna mode, with timestamps used for seasonal updates. For instance, parcels activated during "Season 0" can receive special broadcasts and participate in unique events.5 Reasons Why Terraforms Are Great Onchain Art on Ethereumvia On-Chain Checker 1. Fully Onchain and ImmutableTerraforms is among the minority of NFT projects that are fully onchain. Unlike many NFTs that store images offchain and only use the blockchain for ownership records, Terraforms stores all its data directly on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes the code that generates the art, ensuring it is immutable and will last as long as Ethereum exists. This full onchain approach guarantees the permanence and integrity of the artwork. It cannot be altered or lost due to external factors, providing an unprecedented level of artistic authenticity and reliability.2. Dynamic and Runtime ArtTerraforms is a prime example of runtime art, meaning the artwork is dynamically generated at the moment of viewing through the underlying smart contract. The visuals are not static images but are created in real-time based on the code.This approach introduces a new dimension to digital art, where each interaction with the artwork can be unique. It leverages Ethereum as an "always on" computer, continuously generating art that evolves over time, reflecting the blockchain's state.3. Composability and InteractivityTerraforms, thanks to being fully on Ethereum, is highly composable, allowing new artwork programs and features to interact with existing parcels. The introduction of the Antenna mode in Terraforms 2.0 exemplifies this, enabling parcels to receive broadcasts and updates, thereby integrating new artistic elements over time.Zooming out, composability allows Terraforms to continuously evolve, making it more than just a static collection of NFTs. It fosters a dynamic environment where community members can develop new tools, create derivative works, and build on top of the existing infrastructure, enhancing the project's longevity and relevance.I’ve lurked in the Terraforms Discord for years. I can’t lie, it’s one of the smartest and most sincere online groups I’ve ever seen, filled with onchain builders and creatives par excellence constantly sharing their works and thoughts. These aren’t posers; these are the people art schools will be studying in a century. And I don’t say that lightly, it’s not true for most NFT-centric projects today. In a word, Terraforms via Mathcastles has cultivated a robust community that actively and meaningfully contributes to its development. This includes creating visualizers, tools for interaction, and other enhancements. The community engagement is evident in the rich ecosystem of resources that have emerged around Terraforms, like terrafans.xyz, erraformexplorer.xyz, and jaydenkur.com/terra/.Community-driven projects tend to have greater resilience and innovation, as they benefit from the collective creativity and effort of their members. This collaborative spirit is a cornerstone of Terraforms' success and sustainability.5. Designed for LongevityAlong with being fully onchain, which makes it time-resistant, Terraforms includes a built-in decay mechanism that can cause its terrain to collapse over a long period, potentially spanning thousands of years. This decay is a deliberate feature, symbolizing the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of digital art.However, this collapse is not inevitable. Holders can prevent their parcels from decaying by actively switching between modes. Transitioning a parcel to Daydream or Terraform mode helps prevent the decay process, allowing the wider series to persist in its current state.Currently, enough parcels have entered Daydream mode to prevent this collapse from ever occurring. With that said, Terraforms is still one of the few projects on Ethereum today that has been hard-coded with instructions designed to span centuries. What to Watch Going Forward?“[It’s] this notion of a Culture Settlement Layer, which is how I see Ethereum, and one lens of how I've come to see Terraforms and Project 2 as art pieces. The bundle of described patterns / protocols / technologies described above … they treat Ethereum as a way to bootload and sustain new networks.” — 0x113d, Terraforms co-creatorThe more you dig into Terraforms, the more you realize that it poses more questions than answers when it comes to art and the role of computers in our lives. Even in this article, I know I’ve failed to capture the full magic of this collection as I and others see it. Like I said before, it defies straightforward explanation. Some of the magic is intangible. But in some senses, Terraforms is a gateway. It’s enough to learn about it and then explore for yourself from there, and if it resonates, you’ll never not find it interesting. It’s a new kind of artwork that functions as a cultural settlement layer, and toward that end, it’s one of the greatest expressions of onchain art on Ethereum today.All in all, then, I honestly believe Terraforms stands out as a beacon of innovation, creativity, and longevity in the 21st century art scene. If you’re an art enthusiast, or a tech aficionado, or simply curious about the intersection of these worlds, Terraforms offers a glimpse into the future of onchain creativity. Study it!

Firm Attacks US Miners, Bitcoin Network Growing Stronger


								Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm, has launched a scathing attack on the Bitcoin mining industry in the United States, branding it a haven for “snake oil salesmen” that devour investor capital and harm the environment. 
Investment Firm Attacks Bitcoin, Claims Mining Model Flawed
In a post on X, the management firm announced that it had started its war on the burgeoning industry by drafting two letters to Texas authorities.
One is addressed to the Navarro City Commission, where Riot Blockchain has set up its base. Another letter was sent to the Texas state senators.

The investment firm is urging them to crack down on Bitcoin mining in the state, comparing it to the fraudulent Chinese schemes exposed a decade ago. 
What stands out is that their fight will be centered on Bitcoin mining operations in Texas. Considering its low energy costs, the state is a major hub for Bitcoin mining in the United States. 
Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView
If anything, their opposition to Bitcoin mining has led Kerrisdale Capital to disclose that they are actively shorting Riot Blockchain’s stock. The investment firm thinks the mining farm is a “prime example of a dysfunctional Bitcoin mining business model” trapped in “a vicious cycle of cash burn.”
In their assessment, these public mining firms mostly rely on continuously issuing new shares to fund operations, even when Bitcoin is at or near all-time highs. The investment firm argues this is a sign of a flawed business model.
Kerrisdale Capital also pointed out profitability issuers for these Bitcoin mining operations, even when prices are at record levels. In these cycles, they claim that Riot Blockchain has struggled to be in green. Beyond this, they cite environmental concerns and increasing regulatory scrutiny surrounding mining. 
Additionally, they think the availability of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) means owning shares of mining farms is an unnecessary risk. Over the last six months, spot ETF issuers in the United States have bought billions worth of BTC on behalf of their clients.
Miner Fights Back, Network Strong
As expected, the attack has sparked outrage. Bob Burnett, the founder of Barefoot Mining, has vehemently rejected the “snake oil salesman” label, emphasizing the dedication and hard work of securing the network. 

Of note, the founder points to the resilience of many mining companies during challenging market conditions and their role in maintaining the integrity of the broader ecosystem.

Even with the criticism, Mempool.Space data shows that the total hash rate remains high and steady at over 500 EH/s when writing. At the same time, even after Halving, Foundry USA remains the largest mining farm in the world by hash rate.

Bitcoin over BTC miner shares? Hedge fund makes this prediction! - AMBCrypto



Hedge fund predicts that Bitcoin miners’ shares will go to zero. 
BTC and MSTR have performed better than overall BTC miner shares on a YTD basis. 

After going short on MicroStrategy’s MSTR stock in March, TradFi hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital is back with another short strategy, this time targeting Bitcoin miner Riot Platform’s RIOT share. 
So, what’s the beef with RIOT? Kerrisdale Capital’s CIO Sahm Andrangi told Yahoo Finance that, 
“Our investment thesis is that this sector is not going to be around in five years,’
On X (formerly Twitter), the hedge fund slammed Riot further and called it a ‘dysfunctional hamster’ and ill-equipped to offer better rewards to shareholders. 
‘Like other US-listed miners, $RIOT’s biz model is a dysfunctional hamster wheel of cash burn, which is why it loots retail shareholders with non-stop ATM issuance to fund operations. Even with $BTC near all-time highs, post-halving $RIOT’s mining ops aren’t profitable.’
Interestingly, Andrangi was against the whole Bitcoin mining sector, termed it the ‘stupidest business model’, and predicted that it would ‘ultimately go to zero.’
Bitcoin as a hedge against BTC miners
In such a bearish scenario, the hedge fund maintained that BTC would always perform better against BTC miner shares. So, it would be used as a hedge against BTC miner shares – long BTC, short BTC miners. 
However, since Kerrisdale Capital’s last short strategy against MSTR in March, the stock has soared 37%. 
This tipped some market watchers to adopt a contrarian approach and ‘thank’ the fund for calling BTC miners’ shares ‘bottom’ for the rest of 2024. 
Another X user outrightly wondered how flawed the fund’s strategy was. 
‘This genius is shorting #Bitcoin miners and $MSTR heading into the greatest crypto bull market in history.’
However, the fund was right on BTC outperforming miner shares. On a YTD (year-to-date) basis, MSTR was up 147%, and BTC had 67% gains as of press time. 
However, RIOT was down 37%, while overall BTC miner shares tracker, based on Valkryie Bitcoin Miner ETFs (WGMI), was modestly up only 6% over the same period.

That said, the WGMI has been trending higher as BTC rises. But, it remains to be seen whether the hedge fund’s ‘BTC miners going to zero’ projection will turn out.

$1,500,000,000 Liquidation Cascade Waiting for Bitcoin at $72,000, According To Willy Woo - The Daily Hodl


								On-chain analyst Willy Woo says there’s a “cascade” of liquidation that’s primed to begin when Bitcoin (BTC) hits $72,000.
Woon tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that $1.5 billion worth of short positions are “ready to be liquidated all the way up to $75,000 and a new all-time high.”










Source: Willy Woo/X
Woo also looks at the Bitcoin Macro Oscillator (BMO), which is a composite of four signals: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator, volume-weighted average price (VWAP) ratio, cumulative value-days destroyed (CVDD) and the Sharpe Ratio.
MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought at) and is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued.
VWAP represents the average traded price of an asset throughout the day, taking into account both volume and price. Traders use the VWAP to help them determine whether an asset is trading underbought or overbought based on its intraday price action.
The coin days destroyed metric looks at the value of each Bitcoin transaction while giving weight to the number of days since the coins were last moved. The CVDD tracks the cumulative sum of the coin days destroyed metric as a ratio to the market age.
The Sharpe Ratio aims to compare the return of an investment with its risk by dividing a portfolio’s excess returns by a measure of its volatility.
Explains Woo,
“This 2.5 months of consolidation under bullish demand has been very good for Bitcoin, it means price has more room to run before topping out.
Chart: BMO moves 1 level down, now has 2-3 levels to climb before a macro market top.”

Altcoins Are Ready for Their Big Run, According to Crypto Analyst Michaël van de Poppe - Here’s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl


								A widely followed crypto analyst says that altcoins are poised to spark a massive rally starting at the end of June.
In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 719,600 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are gearing up for a ride “back to normal values.”










“The altcoins are ready for their upwards run. I think we’ll be seeing a lot of momentum from late June until September – October. A repricing back to their normal values after the big cascade of the first period of the year.”
Van de Poppe goes on to say that a trio of cryptocurrencies are also showing strength. According to the trader, Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing signs of upward momentum, noting that if the crypto king can hold the $70,000 price level, it could reach new all-time highs.
“The upwards momentum [of] Bitcoin continues to happen. $70,000 broke upwards, through which the important level is to hold $70,000 now for continuation to the all-time high.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Bitcoin is trading for $71,595 at time of writing.
Moving on to Ethereum (ETH), Van de Poppe says the leading smart contract platform by volume would benefit from financial institutions getting their S-1 filings for ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
“Ethereum focusing on generating that higher low. I think certainty regarding the S-1 approvals is going to lead to a strong upwards move and the higher low. Just a matter of patience.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
Ethereum is valued at $3,847 at time of writing.
Concluding his analysis with layer-2 scaling solution Polkadot (DOT), the analyst says there’s still time to accumulate despite its price slowly moving upwards.
 “DOT is doing great in fundamental growth. They are focusing on RWA (real-world assets) and have multiple great projects within the ecosystem (Centrifuge and Energy Web). Right now, the price starts to crawl upwards and I think it’s still a great time to accumulate a position.”
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
DOT is trading for $7.28 at time of writing.

Bitcoin BTC/USD surpassed the $71,000 mark, indicating increased market confidence in potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This streak of daily increases is the longest in three months, just 4% below its all-time high of $73,798 set in mid-March, per Bloomberg.Investors should also note that the short-term correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 Index is at its highest since early 2023, indicating that further gains in the tech-heavy index may coincide with a rise in the crypto market leader.ETFs like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITO, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust BITB should now be in focus.Will Fed Cut Rates Soon?Traders are increasingly pricing in the likelihood of a Fed rate cut as early as September following data indicating a slowdown in U.S. inflation and a softer job market. Inflation, which resumed its climb in the first quarter of 2024, is finally showing signs of cooling. Also, the manufacturing sector slowed further in May. Job openings also dropped to new 3-year low. There is now 55.3% probability of a 25-bp Fed rate cut in September, as per the CME Fedwatch Tool, up from 51.3% recorded on Jun 3, 2024. This has led to a decrease in Treasury yields lately, easing financial conditions and benefiting speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Notably, benchmark US treasury yield dropped to 4.33% on Jun 4 from 4.61% recorded on May 29, 2024.Tom Couture, Vice President of Digital Asset Strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, noted that crypto assets are responding positively to the decline in rates.

Humane AI Pin Implosion? Poor Sales, Fire Risk, and Potential Acquisition - Decrypt

The Humane AI pin is hot—in all the wrong ways.After heavy launch hype, Humane AI’s $700 AI Pin was met with a wave of harsh reviews. Amid poor sales, the device is now struggling with a faulty accessory. On Wednesday, Humane AI warned users to “immediately stop using and charging” the AI Pin’s optional charging case because of “a fire safety risk.”“Upon receiving a single report of a charging issue while using a third-party USB-C cable and third-party power source, we identified a quality issue with the battery cell supplied by a third-party vendor used in your Charge Case Accessory,” the company said.Humane noted that not all battery cells were affected but that they were telling all users to stop using the case “out of an abundance of caution.” The company also noted that the AI Pin itself—as well as add-on battery and charging pad—were unaffected.Humane declined to provide additional comment to Decrypt.What is the Humane AI Pin?The world got an early preview of the Humane AI pin when it was worn by iconic supermodel Naomi Campbell on the runway during Fashion Week in Paris in September.Designed to be pinned to a lapel or other article of clothing, the AI Pin includes a generative AI model that can answer questions, recall schedules, and search online with the push of a button.“Anything you would search the web for or even use ChatGPT for, you can use on your pin,” Humane AI said during a demonstration in March.From hype to fizzleThe Humane AI pin got lots of buzz, in part due to backers that included Qualcomm, OpenAI, Microsoft, T-Mobile, and TIDAL, and the fact that the Humane AI’s team included veterans from Apple, Samsung, Google, and Amazon.Reviewers delivered a harsh reality check, most notably top technology YouTuber Marques Brownlee. Complaints included its price tag, required monthly subscription, and poor usability—it was declared “too bare bones” and “clunky” by Wired Magazine. “It is an expensive product and expensive subscription for a device that does less,” Mac Rumors writer Steve Moser said on Twitter. “You can only have one expensive aspect for a successful gadget.”The long-term prospects for the company dimmed even before the latest charging case debacle. Humane AI is in the process of looking for a buyer—courting legacy technology company Hewlett-Packard (HP)—according to a report by the New York Times.According to the Times, the Humane AI pin only received 10,000 orders, compared to the 100,000 orders the company reportedly hoped to receive.Humane AI began shopping itself around a week after reviews of the product began coming out, valuing itself at $1 billion after a new fund round, according to the Times report.While the company may be in dire straits, Brownlee did acknowledge a good use case for the fashionable device—which was pitched as a way to leave your smartphone behind.”You’ll have a new phone number, you’ll have to charge another device… but you’ll have less screen time,” he said.A new niche marketWearable technology is not new—smart glasses and watches are well-represented on the market. However, since the launch of OpenAI’s flagship product ChatGPT in November 2022, there has been a race to bring generative AI to the masses in form factors besides smartphones.In September, Facebook's parent company, Meta, announced the launch of its new augmented reality (AR) glasses that include a connection to the company's new MetaAI chatbot.While not a “wearable” the Rabbit R1 offered a personal AI assistant at a more reasonable $200 and does not require a subscription to use. The Rabbit R1 demo in January at CES was so impressive Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella compared it to the reveal of the iPhone.“I thought the demo of the Rabbit OS and the device was fantastic,” Nadella told Bloomberg. “I think I must say, after Jobs and the launch of iPhone, probably one of the most impressive presentations I've seen.”“Overall I’m impressed with this device and I think the R1 is really a standout product,” tech reviewer Justine “iJustine” Ezarik said in her review. “It combines solid hardware with smart adaptive software and it’s really user-focused designed."While the reviews for the Rabbit R1 were notably more kind than the reception, the Rabbit R1 still drew some criticism, from being dismissed as a dressed up Android app to being declared “barely reviewable” by Brownlee.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

VanEck Analysts See Ethereum Price Hitting $22,000 By 2030 ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
Analysts at global investment firm VanEck said on June 5 that they had raised their 2030 price forecast for Ethereum to $22,000 — up from just $11,800 last year. That would represent a massive jump from Ether’s current market price.



Ethereum’s Unique Value Proposition



Asset manager VanEck, which has filed paperwork to list an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), predicts that ETH ETFs will be much bigger than their Bitcoin peers owing to Ether’s disruptive power and cash flow generated for token holders.







While Ethereum has yielded $3.4 billion in revenue in the last year, VanEck sees that figure hitting $51 billion by 2030.



“We believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world. ETH can be thought of as ‘Digital Oil’ because it is consumed by engaging in activity on Ethereum,” the Wednesday report authored by Matthew Sigel, Patrick Bush, and Denis Zinoviev stated. “The Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech.”



VanEck portrayed Ethereum as the heart of its financial ecosystem. Its network currently secures more than $90 billion in stablecoins, roughly $7 billion in tokenized assets, and $308 billion in digital assets.

&nbsp



“Compared to Web2 applications, Ethereum ($3.4B) generates more revenue than Etsy ($2.7B), Twitch ($2.6B), and Roblox ($2.7B) […] Ethereum is a vibrant economic platform that can be considered a “Digital Mall” whose usership has grown ~1500%, and revenue has surged at a 161% CAGR since 2019,” the report added.



$2 Trillion Market Cap



VanEck also recognizes Ethereum’s potential to disrupt the infrastructure, artificial intelligence, marketing, advertising, social, and gaming industries.



“Should it do so while maintaining its dominant position among smart contract platforms, we see a credible path to $66 billion in fresh cash flow to token holders supporting a $2.2.trillion asset or $22,000 per coin, by 2030.”



$22,000 by 2030 would mark a 487% increase from the current price of $3,845.64. Notably, $22K is VanEck’s base case price estimate. The most optimistic and bearish price projections were $154K and $360, respectively.



Spot Ether ETFs In The Works



The prognostication is also based on the expectation that spot ether ETFs will soon be greenlighted for trading. These new products will boost Ethereum’s appeal among more conservative institutional investors, just as the recently launched spot BTC ETFs drew strong investor demand, amassing a total net inflow of $15 billion since their inception.



“We anticipate that spot ether ETFs are nearing approval to trade on U.S. stock exchanges,” according to the report. “This development would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold this unique asset with the security of qualified custodians and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs.”



After clearing BTC ETFs in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission failed to engage much with applicants on ether ETFs. However, that changed when the regulator gave the nod to 19b-4 forms tied to the ETFs. The SEC, however, must first approve S-1 filings before investors can buy the spot ETH products.

FTX creditor group files objection against bankruptcy reorganization plan

A group of FTX creditors led by Sunil Kavuri has objected to the reorganization plan filed by the defunct exchange’s bankruptcy managers.According to a June 5 court filing, the creditors argued that the plan failed the best interest test. Justifying the objection, Sunil noted that it is unconfirmable as a matter of law as it includes releases not in the interest of the estate. He added that the plan also ignores property rights issues.Notably, the creditors argued that FTX’s cash repayment would force a taxable event that could be avoided through in-kind repayment. As such, creditors would be forced to pay tax on declared gains upon the cash receipts. They wrote:“Because the Debtors state that they will take the position that this ‘forced exchange’ is a taxable event, it will inflict additional hardships on customers through forced taxation that could be avoided by making an ‘in kind’ distribution.”Kavuri made reference to the current lawsuit against the estate’s law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, over its ties to the exchange prior to its collapse. He claimed that the plan included an exculpation clause “so they and no one involved [can be] sued for misconduct.”The creditors further stated that FTX must update the disclosure statement for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlement and include the examiner report. The objection follows a recent agreement to settle tax claims with the IRS.The settlement plan will see the IRS receive a $200 million priority claim within 60 days after the approval. Additionally, they also receive another $685 million lower-priority claim paid after customers have been fully paid.On May 7, FTX bankruptcy managers announced a reorganization plan that would see creditors gain full cash repayment. Per the plan, creditors with claims below $50,000 would be eligible for a 118% recovery within 60 days of the court approval.Similarly, other non-governmental creditors would also receive their total claims with up to 9% interest as compensation.Mentioned in this articlePosted In: FTX, BankruptcyLatest Alpha Market Report

How to Sell ETH to Wall Street | Bankless


Ethereum’s spot ETFs could begin trading any day now! One big question remains: how will we sell ETH to Wall Street?It's a question that has perplexed the industry at many times. While Bitcoiners have solidly clung to the easy-to-understand narrative of “digital gold,” Ethereum’s fans have often had a tougher time landing on a shared, succinct narrative that sparks external interest in the ecosystem.Today, we’re evaluating six of the most prominent narrative contenders that encapsulate the essence of Ethereum. We then explain the thought process behind why each could be potent in onboarding the next generation of investors to Ethereum, and assign each one a narrative grade ranking based on how successful we think they will be in courting adoption among prospective ETF buyers👇"It's a Tokenization Platform"Tokenization has already been touted by financial luminaries, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, as representing a paradigm shift for financial markets for its promises to drastically decrease friction and cost while improving accessibility and liquidity. Additionally, it aims to unlock unprecedented levels of transparency and composability!Explaining Ethereum as the world’s leading tokenized asset platform spells out why the Network is important in terms that TradFi participants can understand.Although tokenization does not delve into the positive relationship between increasing onchain activity and ETH price, it demonstrates the central role Ethereum could play in modernizing the financial system; achievement of this goal alone would make ETH the most valuable crypto asset in existence.The narrative captures Ethereum’s role as a global settlement layer for real world assets, making it easier for TradFi to rationalize Ethereum’s role as the global settlement layer for an interconnected network of chains and its pursuit of modular scaling.Narrative Grade: BDespite stated excitement for tokenization from numerous financial institutions, the narrative is hampered by some regulatory uncertainty, but fortunately, investor excitement for tokenization could catalyze needed legislative action to provide regulatory clarity on digital assets and their role within financial markets.
"Ethereum is the Onchain App Store"Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum offers highly expressive smart contracts that unlock financial programmability for developers, enabling the network to become an onchain equivalent of Apple’s App Store.Those who download and fund an Ethereum-compatible crypto wallet receive unfettered access to a litany of consumer applications that facilitate a wide variety of financial, gaming, and cultural interactions. In this digital economy, ETH must be used to pay for gas fees, inciting demand for ETH the asset, and transaction fees payments become revenue for Ethereum, which then trickles down to holders via the Burn – a crypto-native version of stock buybacks!An investment in ETH is akin to buying direct ownership in the App Store, a purchase many investors would be willing to make given its lucrative cash flow generation capabilities and its strong network effects – both qualities which Ethereum possesses.Narrative Grade: C While this narrative has gained traction in recent weeks as the best way to present ETH to TradFi and draws similarities to familiar products, it is unclear if external participants have a good understanding of the types of interactions that can be performed onchain, potentially leading them to ascribe little value to such activities.
"It's an Internet Bond"Parallels can easily be drawn between crypto-native staking schemes and fixed income instruments in TradFi.In exchange for providing 32 ETH as validator collateral (principal), stakers accrue rewards (interest). Unlike in TradFi, this relationship does not depend on any party’s ability to repay the loan, and is instead backed by immutable code and the future economic activity of Ethereum – in the form of block fee revenue and inflationary block rewards.Investors of all kinds love earning passive income off their assets, leading many to assume this would be a slam dunk narrative for Ethereum, particularly in comparison to the only TradFi traded alternative: non-productive BTC.Narrative Grade: CUnfortunately, spot ETH ETFs will not be launching with staking, and while crypto natives can continue to generate yield via this avenue, it is unlikely that the “Internet Bond” narrative will be compelling among investors who can not access this feature, at least until staking-enabled ETFs are launched. ETH: The Internet Finance Bond on BanklessRead our analysis of Ethereum’s internet finance bond with the launch of Ethereum 2.0"ETH is Ultra Sound Money"Bitcoin maximalists have long espoused their chosen digital currency’s “sound money” principles, emphasizing that the network’s programmatic block reward issuance schedule is resistant to debasement, giving BTC its store of value status.“Ultra Sound Money” was created by the Ethereum ecosystem to meaningfully differentiate it as an investment against Bitcoin, and was was first popularized by Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake in September 2020 immediately prior to last cycle’s boom.Although Ethereum does not presently have a guaranteed emissions schedule, ETH supply can turn deflationary as block demand increases thanks to EIP-1559, reducing the number of tokens in circulation over time to theoretically imbue the token with superior store of value qualities, thus creating an “ultra sound money.”Narrative Grade: DSurging prices throughout 2021 made the idea of a deflationary token highly attractive, but this narrative become decidedly less attractive alongside the sharp drop off in inflation; should policy makers resort to debasement to stimulate a global economy in decline, Ultra Sound Money could emerge as as premier narrative. Then again, it may be too degen of a descriptor for Wall Street.
"It's Digital Oil"Bitcoin may have already taken the moniker of “digital gold,” but who cares about a shiny rock when you can own an alternative decentralized commodity that fuels the global economy?When making transactions on the Ethereum L1 and many of its L2s, users must pay for their transaction fees using Ether to get execution; due to the widespread prevalence of onchain transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, many see ETH as the digital corollary for oil.Like oil, which derives intrinsic value for its usage as a key commodity input, Ether benefits from usage of the applications on Ethereum that require the payment of gas to access.Narrative Grade: DIncreasing usage of Ethereum’s onchain applications should have positive implications for Ether by showcasing the close connection between activity and price, but this narrative seems difficult to sell to traditional market participants who have displayed resilience in making onchain interactions and do not fully grasp what the onchain economy is.
"It's Internet Money"By virtue of Ethereum’s expressive smart contracts, developers can create applications on the blockchain as discussed in the case above for representing Ethereum to TradFi as the next generation equivalent of the App Store.Within this ecosystem, ETH is the native “internet money,” serving as the medium which many store their value in and use for payments. Further, the existence of these smart contracts makes this money programmable, enabling its automated usage by applications.Among earlier generations of crypto users who sought out utility for their assets, the ability to use Ether as money was an attractive use case that drove many to adopt crypto technology, however, it is probably far-fetched to assume that the narrative can produce any excitement for remaining TradFi hold outs.Narrative Grade: FTo start off, the concept of internet money may not be taken seriously by the types of sophisticated/older investors that ETFs are meant to attract. Moreover, people do not typically invest in monies due to their inherent inflationary properties and propensity to lose purchasing power over time, an association which could make it difficult for investors to see value in an asset categorized as such.
🧐 Wait, why no “A” grades?Keen-eyed readers may have noticed that none of the above narratives received an “A” grade! While each narrative certainly comes with its own attractive features, none in isolation are the silver bullet solution required to onboard the next generation of investors to Ethereum.All are either stale or unproven, and while narratives help investors understand aspects of Ethereum, an understanding of the network in its entirety is necessary to fully grasp the revolutionary impacts this technology could yield…For the non-crypto natives that spot ETFs are intended to attract, it will likely be the concept of tokenization that allows them to recognize that importance of block space, the acknowledgement of which is a prerequisite to grasping the notion of Ethereum is the onchain equivalent of the App Store and unlocks their ability to appreciate Ether as digital oil and a new form of money!Regulatory clarity is required for Ethereum’s tokenization and internet bond narratives to truly gain traction, but in the meantime, the ecosystem can always fall back to Ultra Sound Money should policy makers resort to debasement to kickstart the faltering global economy.Ethereum may be too complex to distill down to a single narrative, but efforts to do so present the ecosystem in an approachable format to external investors that could potentially pique their excitement and lead them to dive deeper down the crypto rabbit hole!

Biden Vetoes Bipartisan Bill To Overturn SEC's Crypto Custody Rules - Benzinga

On Monday, President Joe Biden has vetoed a bipartisan resolution aimed at overturning the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) crypto custody guidance. The resolution passed both the House and the Senate and sought to invalidate the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121.Presidential Veto ExplainedIn a letter to the House of Representatives, Biden stressed the importance of the SEC's guidance in safeguarding investors. “SAB 121 reflects considered technical SEC staff views regarding the accounting obligations of certain firms that safeguard crypto-assets,” Biden stated. He emphasized that the resolution would “inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues.”Biden further clarified, "This reversal of the considered judgment of SEC staff in this way risks undercutting the SEC’s broader authorities regarding accounting practices. My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors."Legislative BackgroundThe Republican-led legislation garnered notable bipartisan support. It passed the House with a 228 to 182 vote, including backing from 21 Democrats. The Senate approved the bill with a 60 to 38 vote, with eleven Democrats supporting the measure.Political and Regulatory ContextThis veto arrives amid heightened scrutiny of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD. The Biden administration's stance on digital assets is closely watched, especially with the 2024 election on the horizon. Voters have been increasingly considering candidates’ positions on cryptocurrency regulation.Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump, Biden’s anticipated Republican challenger, strongly supports the crypto industry. Recently, Trump began accepting crypto donations and pledged to uphold investors’ rights to self-custody their assets. Benzinga’s Future of Digital AssetsAmid this regulatory backdrop, the upcoming Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event in New York City on Nov. 19, 2024, is poised to be a crucial gathering. This one-day event will bring together digital asset innovators and institutional investors at Convene, 225 Liberty Street. Attendees can engage in extensive networking, attend executive roundtables, and participate in 1:1 meetings, making it an essential event for those involved in the digital assets space.Since its inception in 2022, the conference has consistently attracted thousands of participants. The 2024 edition promises significant improvements in the agenda and will welcome a diverse array of investors, founders, operators, and thought leaders globally. This year’s conference is set to offer unparalleled networking opportunities and deal-making sessions, reinforcing its reputation as a pivotal event in the digital assets industry.Now Read: Kamala Harris Gets Her Own Cannabis Strain ‘Kamala Kush’ Whether She Likes It Or Not: Watch Jimmy Kimmel Break The News To HerImage: President Joe Biden.

When Is An XRP ETF Coming? Ripple President Joins The Conversation To Provide Answers | Bitcoinist.com


								Ripple President Monica Long has shed light on the potential launch of an XRP ETF, clarifying the crypto payment company’s stance on the subject. She addressed the growing interest within the market, stating that the introduction of an XRP ETF would be a reasonable progression. 
Ripple President Deems XRP ETF Plausible
In a recent interview with CNBC, Long addressed the growing curiosity surrounding the possible launch of an XRP ETF. When questioned about the likelihood of an XRP ETF in the near future, Long remarked “I think it will make a lot of sense.”

She cited XRP’s current regulatory status within the United States as the basis for a potential XRP ETF, emphasizing that only XRP and Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, have obtained regulatory clarity regarding their status in the United States. 
Long lauded XRP’s performance in the crypto market, declaring that it currently ranks among the top 10 cryptocurrency assets by market capitalization and is among the top 5 digital assets in terms of trading volume. Her endorsement of XRP as a major player in the crypto market further solidifies her conviction that the market might see an XRP ETF soon.
Following the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF and an Ethereum Spot ETF, XRP has remained firmly in the spotlight, as numerous crypto analysts predict that the cryptocurrency could be next in line for an ETF. 
Despite the excitement and hopes for an XRP ETF, the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could pose a significant challenge. 
Before the SEC’s approval of an Ethereum ETF, various crypto analysts had low expectations of an Ethereum ETF in 2024. They pointed out that the SEC’s implicit classification of Ethereum as a security could hinder its ETF approval process.  
The same analysis could be applied to XRP, which has been entangled in a nearly four-year court battle with the SEC. In its lawsuit against Ripple, the US SEC accused the crypto payments company of selling unregistered securities in XRP. This claim has been rigorously disputed by Ripple in court, winning a victory after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that programmatic sales of XRP were not considered unregistered securities. 
In spite of these regulatory hurdles, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse has maintained an optimistic outlook for an XRP ETF, predicting a possible approval by 2025. 
Ripple Stablecoin Set To Launch This Year
In the interview, Long shared valuable insights on the development and launch of Ripple’s stablecoin. While specific details about the stablecoin launch date and features remain undisclosed, the Ripple President revealed that the crypto community can look forward to a possible launch later this year. 

She emphasized the importance of stablecoins within the volatile crypto market, highlighting that stablecoins had a multi-billion dollar market capitalization and have emerged as a reliable payment option for users who want to move and store their assets safely.

Giant Whale Dumped This Altcoin: Chart Shows Sudden Drop - Bitcoin Sistemi


Onchain data witnessed a whale having an impressive impact on the price of an altcoin today.
According to data provided by Lookonchain, within two hours, a cryptocurrency whale sold a total of $7.08 million worth of UniSwap (UNI) tokens, causing the UNI price to lose approximately 4% of its value. This depreciation shows itself strikingly on the UNI chart.


The cryptocurrency whale in question bought these UNI tokens for an average of $10.54 by paying $13.7 million. At the time of writing this article, UNI price is trading at $10.46.
Graph showing the decline in the UNI price.

Despite selling a large amount, the giant whale still has 969,808 UNI tokens worth $ 7.46 million. The amount of profit made by the whale, who accumulated these tokens in 3 different wallets, from the last sales is around 800 thousand dollars.





Uniswap wants to introduce a fee switch mechanism soon, and this mechanism, which has received great support from the community, will transfer some of the transaction fees on the platform to UNI token holders.

$1.5 Trillion Asset Manager Franklin Templeton Explores New Crypto Fund For Solana, XRP, Shiba Inu ⋆ ZyCrypto

&nbsp

&nbsp
$1.64 trillion Wall Street asset manager Franklin Templeton is mulling the launch of a new private fund that would invest in tokens other than Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).



Franklin Templeton Eyes Altcoin-Focused Crypto Fund 



According to a June 6 report from The Information citing anonymous individuals with knowledge of the plans, the private fund will target institutional investors and will be dedicated to altcoins like Solana, XRP, Shiba Inu, Cardano, and the like.



Franklin Templeton is no stranger to the crypto ecosystem. The Wall Street titan forayed into the digital assets world in 2018. It introduced a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in mid-January and has also applied to offer a similar offering for the industry’s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. In fact, Franklin Templeton was recently the first issuer to announce its sponsor fees for its spot ETH ETF in its updated S-1 statement.



“We are excited about ETH and its ecosystem. Despite the midlife crisis it’s recently experienced, we see a bright future with many strong tailwinds to push the Ethereum ecosystem forward,” the company previously stated in an X post.



By venturing beyond the top two major crypto assets, the asset management firm is signaling comfort with the class of tokens that the SEC has long deemed unregistered securities.

&nbsp



While the report does not indicate which altcoins in particular would be included in the new crypto fund’s basket, Franklin Templeton has publicly hailed the growth of the Solana network in 2024, commending Anatoly Yakovenko’s vision of “a single atomic state machine as a powerful use case of decentralized blockchains.”



Staking Rewards And Global Expansion



Franklin’s Thursday announcement comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s shocking approval of key regulatory filings related to the spot Ether ETF applications in late May — despite the top financial cop having reportedly classed Ethereum internally as an unregistered security for more than a year. 



Notably, staking rewards were not included in the proposed Ether funds when the SEC gave its regulatory blessing to the first stage of applications last month. However, Franklin Templeton is considering offering investors staking rewards with the new altcoin fund.



Although Franklin Templeton’s spot BTC ETF has not been as successful as the financial instruments offered by peers BlackRock and Fidelity, the report noted that the company is keen to grow its crypto assets business outside the US.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Compressed Below $72K, But Dovish Fed Amid Soft U.S. Data, Global Rate Cuts May Bring All-Time Highs

The big question going forward is if the U.S. Federal Reserve might join the rate cutting trend, and while some members of that central bank have suggested any monetary easing could be a 2025 story, recent data has shown softening in both inflation and economic growth. Tomorrow will bring the government's May employment report and a weak read could boost the odds of an imminent Fed rate cut.

"Cheater" Alert on this Altcoin: Analytics Firm Warns - Insider Investor Bought Nearly Half of Total Supply - Bitcoin Sistemi


There were interesting developments in today's onchain data, especially on the memecoin side.
It has been observed that, most likely, an insider, that is, a person from the altcoin team, made a high profit by purchasing a large amount of a cryptocurrency as soon as it was released.


The suspicious altcoin was a newly launched memecoin called EgyptCat (SPHYNX). According to Onchain data, a cryptocurrency whale purchased a large amount of tokens by paying a high transaction fee as soon as this altcoin was launched, in a process called “sniping”.

According to the data, the cryptocurrency whale in question purchased SPHYNX by paying 120 SOL just seconds after the altcoin was launched. Balina wallet then sold these cryptocurrencies for 3,257 SOL and made a total profit of 540 thousand dollars within an hour.





However, cryptocurrency analysis platform Lookonchain claimed in its statement that the SPHYNX altcoin launch was an unfair launch. According to Lookchain, one insider purchased 49.62% of the total SPHYNX supply using 10 different new cryptocurrency wallets. The insider, who spent a total of 670 thousand dollars, later distributed these tokens to almost 300 different wallets.

Charles Hoskinson Blasts Media's Negative Portrayal of Cardano's Prospects


																Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has dismissed claims that the network suffers from weak fundamentals.
He criticized media outlets for their continued negative portrayal of the ecosystem, asserting a stark contrast between the reality of Cardano’s progress and the media’s depiction.
Cardano Founder Refutes Media’s Gloomy Forecasts
In a sharp rebuke this week, Hoskinson accused the media of wrongly predicting the downfall of the blockchain network and affirmed that the ecosystem is here to stay.
Hoskinson highlighted the significant advancements made by Cardano over the years and outlined a major hard fork in the offing, which he described as the most significant in the project’s history.
He pointed to the rapid growth of community DApps, Cardano’s role in scaling research and development, and the importance of upcoming events such as Rare Evo, the Foundation Summit, and Token 2049.




He also noted the maturation of technologies like Hydra, the development of partner chains, initiatives like Midnight and Prism, and numerous community events, including Catalyst and the constitutional convention in Argentina.
Despite these positive developments, Hoskinson expressed dismay over the negative headlines in the media, exemplified by speculation about Cardano’s potential collapse. While condemning these narratives as “beyond pathetic,” Hoskinson went on to criticize the low quality and effort put into covering Cardano’s ecosystem.
In his latest tweet, the IOG exec expressed his frustration by stating,
“Never in my career have I seen such a profound disconnect between reality and opinion with the cryptocurrency influencer and media perception of Cardano versus its actual fundamentals.”
He reiterated his belief in Cardano’s resilience and its potential to drive the cryptocurrency industry forward, addressing significant economic, political, and social issues.
Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork
The Cardano ecosystem is gearing up for the upcoming Chang hard fork, which is scheduled for the second quarter of this year. This upgrade represents a new era of governance for the Cardano blockchain.
The fork will introduce two significant upgrades: Chang Upgrade Number One and Chang Upgrade Number Two. The first upgrade will deploy governance features on the Cardano network, initiating the technical bootstrapping phase outlined in SIP 1694, setting the stage for decentralized voting and governance actions, etc.
Building upon this, Chang Upgrade Number Two will transition SIP 1694 out of the technical bootstrapping phase, unlocking the full potential of on-chain governance, including delegated representative participation and treasury withdrawals. This will enable the Cardano community to propose and fund new projects, ensuring the ecosystem’s sustainability and continuous evolution.

Scammers Ask for Crypto on Fake SpaceX Elon Musk Livestream by Dubbing an AI Voice Over Real Video: Report - The Daily Hodl


								A new report shows that over 100,000 people viewed a fake SpaceX livestream combining real video with an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated Elon Musk voiceover.
According to a report and screenshot from TrustNodes, over 125,000 people were watching a SpaceX livestream on a fake YouTube channel with a QR code asking for crypto donations on the screen.










Source: TrustNodes
The QR code remained on the screen for the entirety of the livestream.
The YouTube channel, @SpaceXFromElon, has nearly 3 million subscribers, despite its prominent lack of a check mark. The real SpaceX YouTube channel, @SpaceX, has 6.7 million subscribers and, perhaps most importantly, a verified check mark.
In the fake live stream, the AI-generated Elon Musk voice, after expounding on the benefits and future profits of Bitcoin (BTC), directly asks for viewers to scan the QR code in a pitch to make them crypto-rich.
AI-generated crypto scam videos have been on the rise with the explosion of the technology. Elon Musk is a common target, and the same channel used the same live stream during the eclipse just two months ago.
Musk is well known in the crypto community as a Dogecoin (DOGE) supporter.
Metrics on how many viewers followed the QR code are currently unavailable.

Dogecoin Bullish Outlook: Analyst Predicts 4x Surge, Eyeing New All-Time High | Bitcoinist.com


								As the meme coin mania persists, popular cryptocurrency expert and enthusiast Javon Marks, in a bullish outlook for Dogecoin (DOGE), has predicted the crypto asset to undergo a 4x surge, projecting it to reach a new all-time high and potentially climbing higher.
Impending 4x Spike For Dogecoin To New All-Time High
This optimistic forecast, which indicates tremendous growth potential for Dogecoin in the upcoming months, coincides with a more general upward trend in the cryptocurrency sector. The crypto analyst attributes the positive outlook for the popular meme coin to the pattern of previous breakouts and runs.
Back in April, Javon Marks shared an intriguing prediction for DOGE that it could witness a massive rally to the pivotal $12 price mark. “A $12 DOGE (Dogecoin) could be well on its way and the process may have already begun,” he stated.
DOGE set for 4x spike to new all-time highs | Source: Javon Marks on X
A month later, the crypto expert reiterated the bold forecast, noting that the trend is still present. According to Javon Marks, Dogecoin was held in a broken-out state once more, and these runs, the expert confirmed, have gotten bigger one after the other, due to the pattern of previous breakouts and runs. This indicates that the next run, which might already be in its early phases, might be bigger than the last run, where DOGE saw a move of more than 20,000%.
The post read:
DOGE (Dogecoin) holds in a broken-out state once again and based on the trend of prior breakouts and runs, these runs have consecutively gotten larger, meaning the upcoming run, which may be in the early stages now could be larger than the previous run, which was an over 20,000% move.
As a result, Javon Marks anticipates another huge run from the asset’s price at that time that might trigger a move of over 7,500% to the $12 price target, if not higher. He further highlighted that possibly the trend might be at the beginning, suggesting that the coin could be poised for constant gains from this point.
And now, the analyst asserted that the trend shows DOGE could experience a  4x spike to new all-time highs and potentially much higher. Given the momentum of this trend, Javon Marks now believes a $10 mark might be forthcoming for DOGE, maybe even toward the $12 level.
DOGE Seeing Positive Movement
Presently, the biggest meme coin, Dogecoin, is experiencing a positive movement along with other well-known cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). 
After falling as low as $0.155 during the start of the month, DOGE has experienced a rebound to the $0.16 threshold. Given the current momentum in the meme coin market, DOGE may be in a position to attract more gains in the coming months.
At the time of writing, DOGE had a market capitalization of over $23.64 billion, a 24-hour trading volume of over $684 million, and a price increase of 2.82% in the past week, trading at over $0.1635. Its market cap in the past day has increased by 0.62%, while its trading volume is seeing a negative drop of over 19%.

Crypto Trading Activity Declines: Centralized Exchanges See 20.1% Drop in May | Cryptoglobe


                                
The total cryptocurrency trading volume on centralized exchanges has plunged 20.1% last month to a total of $5.27 trillion while major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum remained rangebound, with a sudden volatility spike after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Ether exchange-traded funds in the US.



According to CCData’s latest Exchange Review report, spot trading volumes on centralized exchanges last month fell 21.6% to $1.57 trillion to record their second consecutive monthly decline in trading activity.



Derivatives trading volumes were also hit, dropping 19.4% to $3.69 trillion, in a smaller decline that meant the market dominance of derivatives products has grown to its highest level since December 2023.



Source: CCData



The derivatives market share growth can be attributed to a surge in interest from traders following the unexpected approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC, which as CryptoGlobe reported led to an ETH price rise of over 20% in a single day. The report suggests that traders flocked to the derivatives markets to capitalize on this regulatory development.



The report adds that open interest on centralized exchange rose by 30.5% to $55.2 billion in May with the three largest derivatives trading platforms – Binance, OKX, and Bitget – seeing rises of 33.2%, 22.1%, and 39.2% respectively.







On the CME, open interest for Ethereum futures notably rose 59.3% to $1.25 billion with sentiment for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization growing significantly after the SEC’s surprised approval of spot Ether ETFs.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

That same exchange, as a result of the approval, saw Ethereum options trading volumes rise to a new all-time high of $931 million, while ETH futures contracts rose 37.5% to $20.5 billion in a month in which the CME saw overall derivatives volumes drop 7.42% to $115 billion.



Open interest for Ethereum instruments across the cryptocurrency space notably rose 50.3% to $14 billion, according to CCData’s report. Notably, Ethereum whale accumulation has been growing, as according to an analyst from cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoQuant, over 800,000 ETH worth around $3 billion has moved off of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in little over a week.



The analyst noted that institutions preparing for a spot Ethereum ETF to start trading in the United States could be behind the centralized exchange outflows in a bid to meet the potential demand from investors for such a fund.



IntoTheBlock, a cryptocurrency intelligence firm, has noted that whale accumulation has recently intensified, with 41% of the supply of the second-largest cryptocurrency now being held by addresses with more than 1% of its total circulating supply, up from 36% at the beginning of the year.



Per the firm, the trend highlights the increasing confidence in ETH among large holders.

Roaring Kitty Reveals Livestream Return as GameStop Stock Blasts Off - Decrypt

We do the research, you get the alpha!Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!Go to Alpha ReportsQuintessential meme stock GameStop (GME) skyrocketed 48% in a single day, closing out Thursday at $46.55, hours after its biggest booster Keith Gill—better known as Roaring Kitty—publicly scheduled a YouTube livestream for noon ET on Friday.The move came after eagle-eyed fanatics noticed a small update to his YouTube account earlier in the day. GME was already up 9% intraday at the time, capping off a dizzying few days where the share price popped 16% yesterday alone, and its strong growth led to potential losses of $1 billion for short sellers who expected its price to weaken.The price of GME is up 185% over the past month; its returns over the past six months and year-to-date show roughly the same rise.Moments after markets closed, Gill's DeepFuckingValue account on Reddit posted a new “YOLO update” that showed GME's closing price, and another massive set of gains.The stock—along with other nostalgia-tinged "meme stocks" like AMC Entertainment—rocked the markets in 2021 when retail investors rushed to buy, many hoping to hurt large institutional investors that had bet heavily against it.GME has again been on a roll since Roaring Kitty returned to Twitter on May 12. Even though his cryptic video clip posts did not mention GameStop, it caused enough of a frenzy that GME trading had to be halted several times the following day.After a couple of weeks of silence, Roaring Kitty returned to both Twitter and Reddit this week, with a new post under Gill's DeepFuckingValue account on Sunday explicitly indicating GameStop stock holdings—and a massive $200 million bet that the game retailer's stock will be worth more than $20 on June 21.Gill's revelation of direct participation in the GME rally he sparked was enough to prompt investment giant Morgan Stanley to reportedly consider removing him from its ETrade trading platform, and drew the scrutiny of federal and state regulators concerned about market manipulation.With Twitter and Reddit accounts revived, Gill's return to YouTube was perhaps inevitable.The last Roaring Kitty livestream was in April 2021 and has garnered 1.1 million views since. Anticipation is high for the upcoming show, with over 14,200 YouTube users already signed up to watch as of writing. The associated chat is already overflowing with a constant stream of live comments.While meme stock, crypto traders, and everyday investors wait with bated breath to hear what Gill might have to say on Friday, the livestream description includes a frank disclaimer similar to the ones that have always preceded one of his videos.“The Roaring Kitty channel and livestreams are for educational and entertainment purposes only,” it reads. “I don't provide personal investment advice or stock recommendations during the stream.”Edited by Andrew HaywardDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

‘Hamster Kombat’ Telegram Game Hits 100 Million Players-Here's When the Token Is Coming - Decrypt

Hamster Kombat, the latest Telegram-based game to follow in the footsteps of crypto gaming sensation Notcoin, is seeing skyrocketing interest ahead of the upcoming token launch on The Open Network (TON). Now the team has revealed a massive milestone for players and has teased a launch target for the impending token.On Wednesday, the Hamster Kombat team announced that it has drawn 100 million players into the Telegram mini app to date, blasting upwards from a claimed mark of 60 million players last Friday.That’s an enormous amount of players for any game, let alone one that is set to have a crypto token in the near future. There’s very little friction to start playing, to be sure, and the game itself is built around a simple clicking mechanism.It’s not difficult to get people to hop in and start playing Hamster Kombat, though whether they stick around is another story. For now, screenshots of data shared by Hamster Kombat point to something in the range of 40-45 million daily active users (DAU), though a large chunk of that may be people playing for the very first time given the influx of new users.Hamster Kombat is also seeing significant social media attention, giving some credence to the claimed player base stats.The game now has the single largest Telegram channel on the messaging app with over 27 million subscribers, or more than three times that of the official Notcoin announcements channel, for example. It has also racked up nearly 17 million YouTube subscribers, and has almost six million Twitter followers as well.Why are people tapping their screens incessantly and operating a hamster-led fictional crypto exchange? Most players are likely in it for the eventual token airdrop, given how well Notcoin—its spiritual predecessor—landed for players recently. And now we have a target for when the token might drop.In a Twitter Spaces held with the TON Foundation earlier this week, a Hamster Kombat team member who went by “Hamster Girl” said that the current token listing target is in July—though that could change based on various factors. A TON Foundation representative separately confirmed to Decrypt’s GG on Thursday that the game’s team is aiming for July.“It can be a little bit sooner, it can be a little bit later, because there's obviously different moving parts involved including compliance [and] negotiations,” Hamster Girl said on the Twitter Spaces.Notcoin’s token listing, for example, was delayed for about a month. It was originally scheduled to happen in parallel with the Bitcoin halving on April 20, but just days before the planned drop, developer Open Builders pushed back the NOT launch. It then missed an end-of-April target before finally launching on May 16.But the NOT launch proved to be well worth the wait for players, particularly those who held onto their tokens—it’s up 350% in the last two weeks and is now one of the top 60 cryptocurrencies overall by market cap at $2.15 billion.Hamster Kombat players are undoubtedly hoping for similar buzz once their token is available. And Toncoin, the native token of The Open Network, may be benefitting from the Hamster Kombat buzz too. Now the 10th most-valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, TON hit a new all-time high price of $7.76 early Wednesday.And for players who enjoy the tapping gameplay, fear not: Unlike Notcoin, Hamster Kombat apparently doesn’t plan to pause the gameplay once the token launch nears.“Obviously, the game will never stop,” said Hamster Girl. “It will not stop after the listing. It will keep rolling, and a lot more mechanics are coming, a lot more cards [...] and a lot more incentive to invite even more friends and play along with each other.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Did Hulk Hogan Really Pump and Dump a Solana Meme Coin? - Decrypt

One week after celebrities Caitlyn Jenner and Iggy Azalea launched buzzy meme coins, it appeared as if legendary professional wrestler Hulk Hogan had done much the same on Thursday with the HULK token on Solana.But after the coin was quickly “rugged” at the expense of investors, Hogan took to Instagram to urge fans to ignore any crypto post that came from his Twitter account.“Please do not take notice of any posts posted today,” Hogan shared on Instagram. “They are not from me and will be promptly removed.”Indeed, there’s no sign of the purported crypto scam on Hogan’s official Twitter account. In fact, there’s nothing on his feed anymore—everything’s been deleted.It’s not immediately clear whether Hogan’s Twitter account was hacked to share an elaborate crypto scheme—as we’ve seen in the past with other celebrities and public figures—or if perhaps someone connected to Hogan and the account had used it maliciously.The website URL on Hogan’s otherwise empty Twitter profile still points to a website created for the token, and a quick search of his name reveals the wreckage left in the crypto community on Thursday.Hogan’s account had shared dozens of posts about the HULK meme coin, including tweeting at Iggy Azalea about her coin. The account also shared an apparent video endorsement of the coin, but journalist Matt Binder tweeted that it’s actually pulled from an unrelated 2023 video about a karaoke competition and didn’t specifically mention cryptocurrency.According to on-chain data from DexScreener, the HULK token quickly skyrocketed to a market cap of nearly $19 million. That’s before the price quickly plunged, apparently due to the person who originally deployed the token selling large quantities—a crypto “rug pull” on buyers—or a classic pump-and-dump, for that matter.HULK now sits at a market cap of just $3 million, down about 85% from the short-lived peak, with some $82 million worth of trading volume in just a matter of hours. Traders have taken to Twitter to complain about feeling swindled by the legend—though that apparent dismay, in some cases, may be softened by the glow of nostalgia.“LMFAO man, I was the biggest Hulk Hogan fan growing up… literally would watch wrestling in the electronic store TV from outside every week,” tweeted pseudonymous trader and influencer Wizard of SoHo. “If I could tell my 8-year-old self that someday Hulk Hogan would scam me for 20K … holy shit LMFAO.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

New York Sues Crypto Miner and Exchange for $1 Billion In Fraud - Decrypt

New York Attorney General Letitia James has levied another billion-dollar lawsuit against crypto scammers in the state that she says defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors.James’ office accused crypto exchange NovaTech and mining firm AWS Mining of “engaging in illegal pyramid schemes” that robbed investors, including 11,000 New Yorkers, of over a billion dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency, according to a Thursday press release. She now seeks to ban both firms from doing further business in New York.“These cryptocurrency companies targeted immigrant and religious communities with promises of financial freedom but instead stole their money and drained their life savings,” said James, noting their use of common crypto scam channels including social media and WhatsApp groups.According to the lawsuit, AWS Mining and its promoters–naming Panama residents Cynthia and Eddy Petion, among others–promised investors “15 to 20 percent monthly returns” through crypto mining business, including bonuses for roping in new investors.Unable to sustain its promised returns for long, the company collapsed in 2019, after which the Petions moved on to launch NovaTech. The startup trading platform recruited customers using similar tactics: high-return promises and recruitment bonuses.While supposedly paying investor returns using the company’s weekly profits, investor profits were actually generated using money coming in from new investors. Despite taking in over a billion dollars between 2019 and 2023, prosecutors say the platform only ever processed $26 million in actual crypto trades.“We are seeing the real dangers of unregulated cryptocurrency platforms with schemes like these, but New Yorkers can rest assured that we will use the tools at our disposal to crack down on crypto fraudsters,” James vowed.The NYAG has led a slew of high-profile cases against crypto industry leaders, securing $2 billion from crypto trading desk Genesis Global following its late 2022 collapse.She also secured $22 million from crypto exchange KuCoin last year for failing to register as a commodities and securities exchange. The lawsuit famously alleged that Ethereum is an unregistered security rather than a commodity—a debate that regulators nor lawmakers have yet sorted out.The US House of Representatives recently passed legislation in an attempt to clear the air on how commodities and securities law applies to crypto, and how exchanges can properly register with each agency.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.

We’ve been working on improving the infrastructure tremendously,” he said. Tenev highlighted the company’s 24-hour market trading, which allows customers to trade stocks 24 hours a day, five days a week. “So much of this activity starts on the weekends or late at night, Sunday evening in this case,” he said.Tenev was asked what he was doing Sunday night when Gill posted his $115 million GameStop holdings (which he updated to $586.459 million on Thursday), igniting trading activity. “I think I was at home, just usually working on Sundays.

Bitstamp is a global company with operations in many of the major markets,” he told Fox Business.“We’ve been thinking for a long time that there is a need for a new exchange in the marketplace, and this paves the way for a new player.”Tenev also mentioned the move into the institutional business. “Many of our market makers say that a new exchange is needed, one that’s trusted, takes regulatory compliance seriously, and has an advantage in technology,” he said. Robinhood aims to provide the lowest cost trading and superior user experience, recently reducing margin rates to the industry’s lowest.Looking ahead, Tenev sees the convergence of traditional assets and crypto technology. “We think that in the future, crypto technology and the traditional financial system, including stocks, could converge,” he said. This vision aligns with Robinhood’s strategy to lead in both the crypto and traditional financial markets.Now Read: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Losing Steam Before ‘Fifth Attempt To Break This BTC $72-$73K Resistance Level’This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock

Kraken looking to raise $100 million in preparation for 2025 IPO

Kraken is reportedly planning to raise $100 million through a final funding round by the end of the year before an eventual IPO in 2025, Bloomberg News reported on June 6, citing people familiar with the matter.The report said that Kraken is currently looking for a marquee company to join its board to help organize the IPO. However, discussions with companies have only involved verbal exchanges of terms and valuations without formal documentation.Kraken did not confirm the plan and only told Bloomberg that it is “fully focused on investing” in its goal of “accelerating the global adoption of crypto.Earlier IPO rumorsRumors around a Kraken IPO have circulated since at least February 2021, when Bloomberg reported that the firm could go public at a $10 billion valuation.In March, Kraken’s co-founder and then-CEO Jesse Powell confirmed that the company was considering an IPO and called $10 billion a “low valuation.” He anticipated a 2022 IPO but emphasized that such an offering was not guaranteed.The IPO did not come to fruition before Powell announced plans to step down as CEO and become chairman in late 2022, a transition completed in April 2023.In November 2023, new CEO Dave Ripley declined to comment on any specific IPO plans but said the company sought private and public funding alike.Crunchbase data indicates the firm has raised more than $30 million in over 20 funding rounds.SEC has sued KrakenKraken would need to register its IPO with the SEC, which is currently embroiled in a legal tussle with the exchange.The SEC filed a lawsuit against Kraken in November 2023, alleging that the exchange was operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency, among other concerns.Kraken has opted not to settle and is combating the lawsuit in court. It is unclear how the lawsuit might impact any future Kraken IPO.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

Shiba Inu Open Interest Returns To February 2024 Levels, What Happened Last Time?


																Shiba Inu has seen a notable uptick in its open interest that has sent renewed vigor through investors. While the meme coin’s open interest is yet to break its Match 2024 all-time high, it is on a bullish trend that could see an attempt soon.
Shiba Inu Open Interest At February Levels
The total Shiba Inu open interest has climbed back above $97 million across multiple exchanges, bringing it to one of the highest levels so far for the year. According to data from Coinglass, the SHIB open interest is now sitting at $97.08 million as of June 6, 2024.

	Related Reading


This figure is notable because the open interest has been struggling over the last few months. After hitting an all-time high of almost $136 million in March 2024, the Shiba Inu open interest fell rapidly, losing more than half of its value by mid-April.
However, the SHIB open interest began to recover in May, and with June rolling around, the open interest has surged. From the March lows to the currently June figures, the Shiba Inu open interest is now up almost 100%, showing a notable spike in interest from investors.
Source: Coinglass
Currently sitting above 97%, the SHIB open interest is now around 60% away from making a new all-time high. The possibility of this happening has significant implications for the SHIB price hitting a new all-time high as well.
Why A Rise In Open Interest Is Important
The Shiba Inu open interest is on the rise is significant not just to measure investor interest but in how it affects the SHIB price. Looking at the March figures when the SHIB open interest had hit a new all-time high, the price had rallied right alongside it. So the current increase could translate into a price rally as well.

	Related Reading


If the open interest were to go back to its $136 million ATH, going by how much the price rose the last time, it could see the Shiba Inu price touch $0.00004 once more, and hit a new yearly high. This is because in March, the SHIB price more than doubled when the open interest surged.
However, in the last 24 hours, there has been a small slow down in the open interest, with an overall 0.42% decrease. The SHIB price is currently trending at $0.0000256 at the time of writing, representing a 4.41% decrease in the last week.

Bitcoin (BTC) Hidden Disaster Incoming? XRP Reaches Turning Point: What's Next? Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Path to Victory?

When Bitcoin recently broke through the $70,000 barrier, it achieved a major milestone. However, the development of a double top pattern around the $71,900 level may be a warning sign that this achievement is approaching.According to technical analysis, a double top pattern is a bearish signal that is on the verge of finishing on the BTC chart. It appears when an asset reaches its peak, retraces its steps and then reaches its peak once more before beginning to decline. This pattern indicates that there may be a downturn and that the asset may find it difficult to sustain its upward momentum.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAn analysis of the current Bitcoin chart: In the case of Bitcoin, the price tried to rise after crossing $70,000 but encountered resistance close to $71,900. Bitcoin may finish the double top formation, signaling a possible end to the current rally if it is unable to overcome this resistance and retreats.Relative Strength Index (RSI): A price correction is usually preceded by overbought levels, which are approaching for Bitcoin.Trading volume: The volume has not been particularly high during the recent upward trend, which implies that the buying pressure may be waning.Broader market context: The general sentiment of the market is still largely positive despite these cautionary signals. The increasing acceptance of Bitcoin by the general public and institutions could offset any possible bearish trends.Important levels to keep an eye on: Support at $70,000: Should Bitcoin fall below this mark, it may validate the double top pattern and trigger a downturn. The resistance is at $71,900. A high volume surge over this point could invalidate the bearish pattern and indicate that the upward momentum is still there.XRP's positive dynamicsXRP is finally showing some positive dynamics, yet cautiously. The asset's price is moving upwards and might soon reach the 100 EMA resistance level (orange line). For now, the consolidation at the 50 EMA continues and a bounce off of it would be a go-to scenario for the asset.The price of XRP has been consolidating recently around the 50 EMA (green line). The market may be waiting to act decisively before making a move, as indicated by this consolidation. If XRP is able to overcome the 50 EMA support, it might proceed to the 100 EMA, which is a crucial resistance level that might dictate its next significant move.The Relative Strength Index is not overbought or oversold at this time, indicating neutrality. This state of neutrality may signal a major move in prices. The volume has exhibited a degree of stability, suggesting that the market is in equilibrium with minimal buying or selling pressure. In either case, a volume spike might indicate a breakout.Key levels to watch: 50 EMA support: This is an important level of support. Bullish momentum may be indicated by a significant rebound from this level. Resistance at 100 EMA: An important resistance level is found at the 100 EMA, or orange line. Victory here might pave the way for increased costs. Long-term moving averages: The 200 EMA, or black line, continues to be a level of long-term resistance. To validate a long-term upward trend, XRP must break above this.Shiba Inu's pathSupporters of SHIB have been encouraged by its recent price movement. Strong support is being provided by the bounce off the 50 EMA. The critical resistance at $0.000027 may be tested shortly if the price can maintain its current upward momentum. If this barrier is broken, there may be a major trend reversal and additional gains.The positive outlook for SHIB is supported by a number of technical indicators. As of right now, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neither overbought nor oversold. Instead, it is in a neutral zone. This shows that there is still potential for growth without running the immediate risk of a reversal because of overbought circumstances.The market appears to be in equilibrium as the trading volume has remained steady. The impetus required for SHIB to overcome significant resistance levels may be a spike in volume.A crucial level of support for SHIB is at 50 EMA. As we are seeing right now, a significant recovery from this level frequently denotes bullish momentum.Resistance at $0.000027: There has been a lot of resistance at this level. Breakouts above $0.000027 may allow SHIB to rise to all-time highs. It will also be crucial to keep an eye on the 200 and 100 EMAs. A break above these long-term resistance levels would confirm SHIB’s bullish trend.

Feds Charge UK Nationals With $3 Million ‘Evolved Apes’ Ethereum NFT Scam - Decrypt

Three UK nationals are charged with orchestrating a $3 million scam related to the “Evolved Apes” NFT collection, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday. Mohamed-Amin Atcha, Mohamed Rilaz Waleedh, and Daood Hassan are accused of wire fraud and money laundering in what authorities called a pump-and-dump scheme.The DOJ said the charges stemmed from a 2021 scheme to get NFT collectors to purchase one of “10,000 unique” Ethereum-based NFTs called Evolved Apes that could then be used in an online battle royale game. The defendants made off with 798 ETH, worth around $2.7 million at the time.“As alleged, the defendants ran a scam to drive up the price of digital artwork through false promises about developing a videogame,” U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in a statement. “They allegedly took investor funds, never developed the game, and pocketed the proceeds.”The DOJ alleges that Atcha and Waleedh aggressively promoted Evolved Apes, including hiring an unnamed social media influencer to shill the project.A pump-and-dump scheme is when investors are enticed to buy an asset based on misleading information. The fraudster uses early interest to drive up the price of the asset, only to sell everything off and disappear—or “rug pull”—leaving unwitting victims holding worthless tokens.According to case documents, Waleedh identified himself as the lead marketing manager for Evolved Apes when attempting to withdraw funds that had been stuck on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange that the group was using. When Waleedh was allowed to access the funds, the DOJ alleged, he transferred them to a cryptocurrency address controlled by Hassan.“Digital art may be new, but old rules still apply: making false promises for money is illegal. As we allege, thousands of people believed these false promises and were tricked into buying these NFTs, including here in the Southern District of New York,” Williams said. “NFT fraud is no game, and those responsible will be held accountable.”If convicted, the trio faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.Rug pulls are rampant in the cryptocurrency space. Most recently, two rug pulls made headlines, including in May when a purported “mother and son” duo staged a scandalous livestream to pump the “LIVEMOM” token and made off with $300,000. This was followed by another scheme in which a pseudonymous creator shilled the “HANDS” meme coin.“I don’t have hands, I cannot rug you guys, chill,” the creator said during a livestream on the NoHandsNoRug Twitch channel—only to reveal his hands before selling the 7 SOL accumulated in the scheme, worth around $1,000.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.GG NewsletterGet the latest web3 gaming news, hear directly from gaming studios and influencers covering the space, and receive power-ups from our partners.

Goldman Sachs Predicts Incoming ‘Wall of Money’ Could Fuel Summer Stock Market Rally | Cryptoglobe


                                
Goldman Sachs is raising a bullish flag for the stock market in early July, anticipating a surge driven by a ‘wall of money’ from passive investment vehicles over the beginning of the third quarter and second half of the year.



According to Scott Rubner, managing director and tactical specialist in Goldman’s global markets division, share prices could also benefit from strong seasonal trends and a potential increase in retail investor participation, as Bloomberg reported.



In a note, Rubner wrote he is seeing a “re-emergence in retail traders during the summer, they tend to come around in July,” and noting that since 1928 the first 15 days of that month have been the best two-week stretch for equities, with returns tending to taper off after July 17.



The S&P 500 itself boasts a winning streak in July for nine consecutive years, averaging a return of 3.7%. The Nasdaq 100 fares even better, with 16 straight Julys in positive territory and an average return of 4.6%.



Based on his calculations, Rubner estimates an influx of roughly nine basis points of new capital each July. In the context of today’s market, this translates to approximately $26 billion considering the $29 trillion pool of passive assets available for investment.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Retail investors could also benefit the cryptocurrency space, which has been seeing institutional investors add to their exposure via the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in the United States back in January.



As CryptoGlobe reported, earlier this year BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw its BTC holdings surpass those of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), making it the world’s largest exchange-traded fund offering investors exposure to the price of Bitcoin.

Analysts attribute this shift to Grayscale’s higher fees, which have driven investors towards BlackRock’s lower-cost alternative after GBTC was converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF at the same time several of these ETFs started trading in the United States.



Notably, BlackRock’s income and bond-focused funds have recently added exposure to its own spot Bitcoin ETF, with regulatory filings showing that BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund and Strategic Global Bond Fund purchased shares of iShares Bitcoin Trust.

Analyst Says Dogecoin Ready To See A Breakout Massive Whale Accumulation | Bitcoinist.com


								Crypto analyst Kevin (Formerly OG Yomi) has highlighted a bullish pattern on the Dogecoin (DOGE) chart, which shows that a breakout is imminent. His prediction follows the recent wave of accumulation by DOGE whales, with these buys likely contributing to the potential breakout. 
Dogecoin Indicator Flashing Breakout Signal
Kevin mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the two-month Bollinger Bands breakout indicator on Dogecoin is flashing an imminent breakout, which is set to occur for the foremost meme coin for the first time since November 2020.

He added that DOGE was also about to see the first two-month Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) bullish cross since November 2020. 
Source: X
The analyst sounded confident about this imminent breakout, suggesting it was inevitable. Crypto analyst Kaleo also shared a similar sentiment, claiming in a recent X post that Dogecoin looks ready for that parabolic move to the upside. Crypto Kaleo is so bullish on Dogecoin that he predicted that the meme coin will outperform Bitcoin in this bull run. 
Source: X
Kevin had also made a similar prediction earlier in April, claiming that Dogecoin could outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle if it continues to hold up well. The analyst had also previously predicted that DOGE could rise to as high as $3 based on historical patterns. A price surge of such magnitude will almost certainly out the meme coin above the flagship crypto. 
Meanwhile, DOGE’s imminent breakout could be triggered by recent purchases made by Dogecoin whales. These investors have purchased over 900 million DOGE in the last seven days. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also recently suggested that Dogecoin’s price might skyrocket soon enough. 
He mentioned that DOGE’s market sentiment was as bearish as it was in early February, just before its price skyrocketed by 200%. Interestingly, Martinez believes that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $6 in this bull run. He had also noted that DOGE’s current unimpressive price action was part of its “usual behavior” before massive bull runs. 
DOGE Might Reach $10 In This Market Cycle
Crypto analyst Javon Marks has offered a more ambitious price prediction than Martinez’s. He raised the possibility of Dogecoin rising to $10, highlighting a breakout trend that suggests that the meme coin may soon be on its way to this price level. Interestingly, the chart he shared showed that DOGE could even rise to as high as $16. 

Marks was referring to the breakout trend in which Dogecoin’s run has continually increased in every subsequent bull run. As such, he believes this upcoming bull run won’t be different, with DOGE surpassing its rally of over 20,000% in the 2021 bull run this time around. 
At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.16, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Treasury Secretary Yellen warns of financial stability risks posed by AI

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expressed significant concerns about the potential dangers artificial intelligence (AI) poses to the stability of the financial system.Yellen made the remarks during a keynote address at a conference on AI and financial stability on June 6. Her speech stressed the urgency of addressing these emerging risks and called of both the government and private sectors to collaborate on finding solutions.The Treasury secretary said:“This [AI] is a rapidly evolving field. We have our work cut out for us.”Increasing riskYellen acknowledged the advancements AI has brought to the financial sector, such as improved fraud detection and enhanced customer service through chatbots.However, she and other experts cautioned that deeper integration of AI could lead to increased risks, including the potential for AI to be misused in scams or market manipulation through misinformation.Yellen warned:“Insufficient or faulty data could also perpetuate or introduce new biases in financial decision-making.”She highlighted the complexities of AI models, the inadequacies in current risk management frameworks, and the reliance on a limited number of models by numerous market participants as key areas of concern.The Treasury Department has issued a request for information to gather insights from stakeholders about the uses, opportunities, and risks of AI in the financial services sector. This initiative is intended to inform future policymaking by incorporating expert opinions and current practices.Yellen said:“The tremendous opportunities and significant risks associated with the use of AI by financial companies have moved this issue toward the top of Treasury’s and the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s agendas.”AI under scrutinyYellen’s warning comes amid a wider governmental scrutiny of both AI and the companies behind the technology. The DOJ is reportedly preparing to investigate multiple tech giants, including Nvidia and Microsoft, over antitrust and competition concerns related to AI technology.US antitrust enforcer Jonathan Kanter announced plans to investigate the AI sector due to concerns about potential monopolies, according to a Financial Times report.Kanter highlighted the need to examine AI’s competitive landscape, focusing on areas like computing power, data for training large language models (LLMs), cloud services, engineering talent, and hardware.Kanter emphasized the urgency of acting to prevent dominant tech firms from monopolizing the AI market. He suggested real-time regulatory intervention to be effective and less invasive.A particular concern is the scarcity of graphics processing units (GPUs) necessary for training LLMs, with rising demand impacting chip allocation.Mentioned in this articleLatest Alpha Market Report

DuckDuckGo Launches a Private Portal to Top AI Chatbots - Decrypt

DuckDuckGo, renowned for its privacy-focused search engine and web browser, has announced a new service that allows users to interact with popular AI chatbots privately and anonymously. The service, called DuckDuckGo AI Chat and accessible at Duck.ai, is globally available now.The interactions on Duck.ai are private because "neither DuckDuckGo nor the chatbot providers can use the users’ data to train their models," the company explains. They are also anonymous, as DuckDuckGo doesn’t require users to set up accounts, or provide personal information before start interacting with it.DuckDuckGo even strips away metadata, such as server or IP addresses, so that queries appear to originate from the company itself rather than individual users.Although the supported commercial AI chatbot providers—OpenAI and Anthropic—do keep access logs, DuckDuckGo says it has “agreements in place with all model providers to ensure that any saved chats are completely deleted by the providers within 30 days, and that none of the chats made on our platform can be used to train or improve the models.”That makes preserving privacy easier than changing the privacy settings for each service.Duck.ai features a light and clean user interface and lets users choose from the two commercial, closed-source models and two open-source models. The closed-source models are OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo, which powered the free version of ChatGPT until recently, and Claude 3 Haiku, Anthropic’s small version of its Claude 3 model. The open-source models are Meta’s Llama-3 70Bn and Mistral AI’s Mixture of Expert model Mixtral 8x7b.DuckDuckGo said it will add more models in the future, further expanding the range of options available to users.This new service is a welcome addition for privacy conscious individuals, joining the recent launch of Venice AI by Crypto founder Erik Voorhees. Venice AI features an uncensored AI chatbot and image generator that doesn't require accounts and doesn't retain data.As for which AI tool to usel? It depends on your needs.In terms of text generation, DuckDuckGo's offerings of GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3 Haiku are superior to Venice's Hermes and Dogge LLMs. DuckDuckGo also provides additional functionalities for users of its browser, including DuckAssist, an integrated assistant being developed into a native AI companion.However, Venice AI offers a wide set of Generative Image models, which DuckDuckGo doesn't, and its models are uncensored, both in text and image generations which is a major point against its competitors.DuckDuckGo's AI service is free to use “within a daily limit.” The company said it is considering launching a paid tier to reduce or eliminate these limits, akin to Claude, OpenAI, and even Venice.DuckDuckGo said its AI Chat service is a complementary partner to its search engine and not just a hype-driven experiment.“We view AI Chat and search as two different but powerful tools to help you find what you're looking for – especially when you're exploring a new topic,” the company said. “If you start with Search, you may want to switch to AI Chat for follow-up queries to help make sense of what you’ve read, or for quick, direct answers to new questions that weren’t covered in the web pages you saw.”Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Kraken Is Targeting An IPO Next Year: Report


																Kraken, one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, is orchestrating a large funding round before a potential initial public offering next year, according to a new report from Bloomberg.
Sources contacted by the outlet say the exchange likely aims to raise $100 million before the move.
Kraken To Go Public?
If Kraken were to follow through, it would become the second publicly traded pure-play crypto exchange in the world after Coinbase, its larger rival.
The supposed plans are a response to investor inquiries on the matter fueled by the crypto market rally in recent months, which has boosted trading volumes from which exchanges like Kraken generate profit.
Two of the people contacted said Kraken would raise the money in a “pre-IPO round” with the intention of completing it by the end of the year.




An IPO could be completed as soon as next year, the people said, after Kraken can find a “marquee” company to join its board. Only verbal discussions have occurred regarding terms and valuations without any formal documentation, one person said.
“We are always exploring strategic paths toward Kraken’s Mission: accelerating the global adoption of crypto,” said Kraken, declining to comment specifically on fundraising or IPO matters. “We remain fully focused on investing in this goal.”
Public stock and crypto trading platform Robinhood said on Thursday hat it would acquire crypto exchange Bitstamp. Earlier this year, stablecoin issuer Circle also announced plans to go public.
A Maturing Crypto Market
Kraken’s parent company, Payward, was founded in 2011. While the exchange has intended to go public for years, a mix of volatile crypto market downturns and regulatory issues have continued to thwart its efforts.
As of today, momentum is turning around on both fronts. Bitcoin is now experiencing a newfound wave of demand from Wall Street, with experts believing tens of billions of dollars are yet to enter the newly launched ETF products.
Meanwhile, policymakers are starting to open up to crypto, and are pushing forward legislation to create legal clarity for the industry. Last month, the House of Representatives passed comprehensive legislation to clarify which crypto assets are commodities vs securities, and how crypto exchanges can properly register with regulators.
Kraken has run into its share of trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) already, paying a $30 million fine last year for failing to register its staking as a service product. It now faces a lengthier lawsuit for allegedly listing dozens of unregistered securities on its platform, which it is fighting back against in court.

Ashton Kutcher Says AI Will Make Movies Better-Hollywood Disagrees - Decrypt

Actor and entrepreneur Ashton Kutcher has waded into hot water again after he suggested that AI could someday be used to create Hollywood-quality movies without the need for studios, actors, or crew.Kutcher's comments came during an on-stage conversation with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt at the Berggruen Institute, a Los Angeles, Calif.-based think tank last week. A video excerpt from the exchange has since been set to private and is no longer visible on YouTube.The co-founder of Schmidt Futures asked Kutcher what the future holds for Hollywood in the age of AI. In response, Kutcher questioned why—when tools like Sora AI are available—a filmmaker would go through the trouble of shooting on location.“Why would you go out and shoot an establishing shot of a house in a television show when you could just create the establishing shot for $100? To go out and shoot it would cost you thousands of dollars,” Kutcher said, according to a report by Variety. “Action scenes of me jumping off of this building, you don’t have to have a stunt person go do it, you could just go do it.”In February, OpenAI unveiled its Sora AI model that uses text-based instructions to create minute-long, high-definition videos. Sora is currently in an invitation-only closed beta, but Kutcher said he had early access.Kutcher went further, suggesting that content creators could use the AI model to create their own movies using content they find online—omitting acknowledgement of the obvious copyright and intellectual property ramifications of his suggestion.“You input the shot that you want to see or scene that you want to see, the trailer that you want to watch, and it invents that thing,” Kutcher said, adding this would lead to a proliferation of new content.That tidal wave of new, AI-facilitated content, Kutcher said, would change the paradigm of how movies are made, and how success is measured.“The bar is going to have to go way up because why are you going to watch my movie when you could just watch your own movie?” he said.His colleagues in the entertainment industry strenuously disagreed on social media.“Not even AI could make a movie where Ashton Kutcher is a good actor,” comedian and actor Gianmarco Soresi wrote on Twitter.Many critics pointed out that Kutcher is co-founder of an investment fund focused on AI, and that his comments clearly support the disruptive technology and not the industry being disrupted.“The fact that Ashton Kutcher has a venture capitalist firm that is currently investing in AI should have been disclosed,” tweeted Alice Herring, who lists membership in The Animation Guild in Hollywood. “He's not speaking as a filmmaker (because he's never been a director, DP, writer, or editor), he's speaking as a salesman for investments.”Kutcher responded to the backlash late Thursday, posting on Twitter that he does not think “AI will replace the film industry or creative arts.”“It's an amazing tool that we should learn to work with to become more prolific and efficient as [artists],” he wrote. Acting like it doesn't exist will be catastrophic.”Kutcher recently courted controversy for another tech project he launched with wife and fellow actress Mila Kunis.“If you're wondering if Ashton Kutcher also fell for the Metaverse, crypto, and NFTs... yes. The answer is yes,” Lincoln Michel, author of “The Body Scout,” wrote, referring to Kutcher and wife Mila Kunis’ Stoner Cats NFT project.Stoner Cats remains in limbo after the production was slapped with a notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had violated federal securities laws when it sold NFT passes to watch the show in September. The federal regulator hit the Stoner Cats project with a $1 million fine.In 2023, the union members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) took to the picket lines after negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) broke down over a myriad of issues including the use of generative AI in film and television productions.The strike lasted over six months before contract negotiations were resolved in September. "In a contract valued at over one billion dollars, we have achieved a deal of extraordinary scope that includes 'above-pattern' minimum compensation increases, unprecedented provisions for consent and compensation that will protect members from the threat of AI," SAG-AFTRA wrote on Twitter.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.

Kraken Eyes $100 Million Funding Before Potential IPO


On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Kraken, a US-based crypto exchange, is considering raising a final funding round of more than $100 million ahead of a possible initial public offering (IPO).
This strategic move aligns with the digital asset market’s resurgence, drawing potential investors and showcasing a recovering industry.
Regulatory Challenges Loom as Kraken Prepares for IPO

Kraken aims to complete this fundraising by the end of the year, leveraging the favorable market conditions to prepare for the IPO. The exchange is also seeking a “marquee” company to join its board, aiming for a successful IPO as soon as next year.
Kraken reportedly has been discussing an initial public offering since at least 2021. At the time of publication, Kraken declined to comment specifically on the fundraising or IPO plans. However, the company reaffirmed its commitment to boosting global crypto adoption.

“We are always exploring strategic paths toward Kraken’s Mission: accelerating the global adoption of crypto. We remain fully focused on investing in this goal,” it stated.

Despite its IPO plan, Kraken has faced significant regulatory challenges in recent years, including a high-profile case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2023, the company settled charges related to its staking services, agreeing to pay a $30 million fine and cease these services in the US.
This year, the company is facing a new case with the agency. The SEC accused Kraken of operating an unregistered securities broker-dealer, clearing agency, and exchange.
These charges resemble those previously levied against another US-based crypto exchange—Coinbase. However, Kraken continues to dispute new allegations from the SEC.

The prospect of a Kraken IPO has generated considerable buzz within the crypto community. Market observers speculate that a successful IPO could indicate a positive shift in the regulatory environment for digital assets.

“If VCs are gonna fund Kraken here assuming an IPO, they must be assuming a complete 180 in crypto regulatory issues given the Coinbase lawsuit,” Leigh Drogen, general partner at investment firm Starkiller Cap, speculated.

Renowned crypto trader Satoshi Flipper also remarked that Kraken’s IPO might mirror the timing of Coinbase’s IPO in 2021. This potentially marks a peak in the market cycle.

China's First Crypto Fraud Trial Ends With Student's 4-Year Prison Sentence | Bitcoinist.com


								In a groundbreaking case that has drawn significant attention in China, a college student named Yang Qichao has been sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison and fined 30,000 yuan ($41,000) for “fraudulently” issuing a cryptocurrency called BFF on the Binance’s BNB Chain. 
The case, which took place at the People’s Court of Nanyang High-tech Industrial Development Zone in Henan Province, marks the first criminal trial in China involving the issuance of a virtual currency. The Asian country has strict regulations that prohibit people from participating in the issuance, trading, or investing in these assets.
Criminal Trial On Crypto Fraud
According to local media reports, the incident began in May 2022 when Yang Qichao, a senior student at a university in Zhejiang, created a digital virtual currency called “Blockchain Future Force” (BFF) on the Binance chain. 
It is alleged that Yang Qichao injected liquidity into the currency and then withdrew the funds, causing the value of BFF coins to depreciate significantly. One individual, Luo, who purchased BFF coins, suffered losses of 50,000 of Tether’s USDT stablecoin (equivalent to approximately 330,000 RMB).

Yang Qichao’s defense lawyer argued that Luo, “an experienced participant” in cryptocurrency transactions, should have been aware of the risks involved. 
The lawyer contended that Luo had a “clear understanding” of the speculative nature of crypto investments and acknowledged the industry’s lack of regulatory oversight. 
The lawyer questioned whether Luo’s decision to exchange 50,000 USDT coins for BFF coins resulted from misjudgment, given that virtual currency transactions inherently carry investment risks.
Profitability Amidst Alleged Fraud
During the trial, the issue of whether virtual currencies should be considered protected property under criminal law was also debated. 
Although cryptocurrencies do not possess currency attributes, the court acknowledged that they can be traded on international platforms, yielding economic benefits and demonstrating undeniable property characteristics. 
As a result, the court recognized the conversion of the 50,000 USDT coins into the country’s official currency, the yuan, as “a relevant factor” in determining the sentence.
Furthermore, the defense lawyer highlighted that despite Luo’s initial claim of being defrauded, subsequent analysis of his transaction records revealed a series of rapid and profitable trades. This led to the argument that Luo had actually profited from the investment, thereby calling the notion of fraud into question.

Per the report, the case has sparked a broader discussion about the legal status and regulation of virtual currencies in China. With the country’s legal policies yet to fully recognize the legitimacy of virtual currencies, issues surrounding their issuance, trading, and protection remain ambiguous. 
The outcome of this case may serve as a precedent for future legal proceedings involving virtual currencies, shaping the legal landscape in this emerging field.

Maker Metrics Under The Microscope: Clues To MKR's Price Path Ahead


																Amidst the crypto market resurgence, the smart contract platform Maker and its native token MKR have experienced a challenging period, with MKR demonstrating a consistent downtrend after reaching a yearly high of $4,070 in April, plummeting to as low as $2,440 just one week later. 
Dive into the protocol’s key metrics and observe notable levels to gain insights into potential price movements and actions for the MKR token in the near term. 
Maker Protocol’s Updated Metrics Reveal Positive Growth 
The Maker protocol, known for its decentralized stablecoin DAI, recently disclosed updated metrics highlighting its health and growth over the past month in a post on social media site X (formerly Twitter). 
DAI, governed by MakerDAO’s decentralized blockchain, enables the borrowing and lending of cryptocurrencies. The current DAI supply, exceeding 5 billion DAI, is a critical metric reflecting the total amount of DAI created and circulating. 

	Related Reading


Total Value Locked represents the dollar value of assets locked within the Maker Protocol. Despite being live on one chain since its inception, Maker has approximately $8.76 billion locked, making it the fourth-largest decentralized finance (DeFi protocol). 
The Maker Protocol allows the minting of DAI by depositing accepted assets into Maker Vaults. The ETH-C Vault type holds the largest share, with approximately $2.07 billion worth of ETH locked. 
The system surplus needs to reach 50 million DAI to achieve a complete MKR burn. On the other hand, the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) represents the rate at which the Maker Protocol rewards users for locking their DAI within DSR contracts. Currently, the DSR cost amounts to approximately 153 million DAI.
Currently, the protocol notes that most DAI remains within DeFi, with externally owned Accounts (EOA) and the DSR serving as the top use cases, holding over 2.3 billion and 1.96 billion DAI, respectively. 
In terms of revenue generation, SparkLend D3M and Spark’s MetaMorpho D3M lead the way, generating an estimated $155 million in annual revenue based on their deposit APYs. This highlights the significance of various collateral types and revenue streams within the Maker ecosystem.
Potential Catalyst For MKR’s Price?
Despite the growth and investor interest in the Maker ecosystem, the upcoming Endgame Plan, a proposal to revamp its governance and tokenomics, is expected to act as a catalyst for the MKR token, potentially boosting its price. 
The proposal aims to establish a self-sustainable equilibrium called the Endgame State, envisioning a resilient ecosystem where Maker Core’s scope and complexity will no longer change.

	Related Reading


Currently, MKR is trading at $2,612, experiencing a slight decline of over 2% in the past 24 hours and around 8% in the last 30 days. CoinGecko data also indicates a recent 4.7% decrease in trading volume, totaling only $72 million compared to the token’s $2.4 billion market cap.
If the Endgame plan indeed generates renewed interest in the token and acts as a catalyst for MKR, the next significant obstacles to monitor in the short term are situated around the $2,660 level, which has impeded the token’s ability to surpass higher levels in the past few days. 
Additionally, on its potential path to reclaim the $3,000 milestone, resistance levels at $2,710 and $2,760 would need to be overcome before potentially retesting the resistance at $2,845. Moving forward, on the MKR/USD daily chart, the levels at $2,905 and $2,950 act as the final hurdles before reaching the $3,000 milestone.

It remains to be seen whether further developments and growth in key metrics, coupled with the anticipated Endgame proposal, can stimulate a significant bullish momentum for MKR, enabling it to overcome resistance levels and regain its bullish trend.

Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Expert Predicts Doom For ETH's Price - Here's Why


								Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser has recently reiterated his stance on Ethereum, predicting a dire future for the cryptocurrency against Bitcoin. Keiser’s latest critique, shared on social media platform X, revives his longstanding view that Bitcoin outshines Ethereum and other altcoins on fundamental levels.
According to Keiser, Ethereum is “heading to zero against BTC,” citing fundamental differences in their underlying technologies and legal classifications.

Commodity Status And Decentralization Concerns
Keiser’s argument hinges on the idea that Ethereum is not centralized and lacks the commodity status and a decentralized proof-of-work algorithm that “bolsters” Bitcoin’s appeal.
He points out that in countries like El Salvador, where he advises President Nayib Bukele on Bitcoin initiatives, Ethereum is regarded as an unregistered security rather than a commodity—a status that Bitcoin has maintained in regulatory circles in the United States.

Despite the criticisms from Bitcoin proponents, ETH continues to hold a substantial market position, trading above $3,800 with slight gains of 0.8% in the past 24 hours and 2% over the past week.

While Bitcoin maximalists like Kaiser remain critical of the altcoin, many experts maintain a positive outlook, anticipating that ETH could mirror Bitcoin’s historical performance of a parabolic rise.
Notably, ETH’s recent performance comes amid positive forecasts from major financial analysts, including those from investment firm VanEck, which recently adjusted their prediction for Ethereum’s long-term price potential.
Contrasting View: VanEck Predicts A Bright Future For Ethereum
In a recent post updating its forecast for ETH, Investment firm VanEck has offered a more optimistic view, projecting ETH’s price could reach $22,000 by 2030. This bullish outlook is based on ETH’s role in the smart contract platform space, its ongoing development, and its ability to disrupt traditional markets.
The report from VanEck credits Ethereum’s “robust” framework for developers and its potential impact on finance and Big Tech as pivotal factors for its future valuation.

The analysts at VanEck also point to the imminent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a key driver for ETH’s adoption and price increase. They argue that such developments will enhance ETH’s accessibility and demand, potentially leading to a significant market capitalization boost.
The VanEck analysts particularly noted:
Driven by a strong value proposition to entrepreneurs, the Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech. Should it do so while maintaining its dominant position among smart contract platforms, we see a credible path to $66B in free cash flow to token holders supporting a $2.2 trillion asset, or $22k per coin, by 2030.

Record High: $Near $100 Trillion Global Liquidity ‘Most Important Chart’ for Bitcoin Price | Cryptoglobe


                                
The price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC) is set to benefit from the growth of money supply in the United States as global liquidity has recently surged to near the $100 trillion mark, at a time in which BTC itself is trading at $71,000.



According to a chart shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) by the founder of on-chain data service LookIntoBitcoin, Philip Swift, global supply – known as M2 – is nearing a historic high around $100 trillion.



This unprecedented level of liquidity is historically correlated with Bitcoin price movements, according to Swift. His platform, as Cointelegraph first reported, tracks global M2 data and compares it to Bitcoin price behavior, and shows that the current M2 of $94 trillion dwarfs the figure observed in late 2021, when Bitcoin hit its previous all-time high of $69,000, with a $3 trillion increase.







Furthermore, M2 has rebounded a full 10% since dipping to $85 trillion in late 2022, coinciding with the depths of the crypto bear market.  These findings resonate with other recent liquidity-based analyses, which also project a bullish outlook for Bitcoin.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

The relationship between Bitcoin and the U.S. M1 money supply is also noteworthy. This metric is currently breaking out of a seven-year consolidation period – the longest in Bitcoin’s history – suggesting significant room for growth.



Institutional investors appear to be using Bitcoin as a way to diversify their portfolios, with cryptocurrency investments products year-to-date having seen $15 billion of inflows, of which $14.74 billion were to products offering exposure to BTC.



Products betting on the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum’s ETH, saw $33.5 million inflows in the week, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cleared the path for the listing of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the country, bringing their year-to-date flows to just $11 million.



Meanwhile, products offering exposure to Ethereum rival Solana ($SOL) saw $5.8 million worth of inflows, bringing year-to-date flows to $35 million. Products focusing on multiple digital assets saw $2.7 million of outflows last week.

Ripple CTO Sends Crucial Warning To Community - Here’s What It Is | Bitcoinist.com


								Ripple CTO David Schwartz has sent a crucial warning to the community members in regards to a number of scams that have been proliferating. With the crypto market prices recovering once more, scammers are back in full force and they tend to hone in on a community as their target victims, warranting warnings such as this.
Ripple CTO Warns Community Of Scams
A new type of scam targeting X (formerly Twitter) has made the rounds, seemingly harnessing the fear of accounts getting banned as a way to hack user accounts. The DM, which was posted by another X user who goes by @3YearLetterman, reveals a threatening message from someone pretending to be from the X team.

The contents of the DM show an initial accusation that the X user’s account was being investigated for copyright violations. They further went on to ask the recipient to provide feedback on this issue through completely a form.
However, the link attached to the DM is a malicious one which will trick the X user into sharing their account details, and thereby compromising their account. The DM is then signed with X Support Team, presumably to sell the illusion that this was actually a correspondence from the real X team.
Responding to the post, the Ripple CTO urged users to ignore all messages like these when they receive them as they are just trying to steal their login information. “CAUTION: If you receive a DM anything like this, it is fake. The link goes to a phising site that will collect your login and personal information,” Schwartz said.


Crypto Scams Are On The Rise
Recently, another prominent figure in the crypto space warned community members of rampant scams. DaVinci, a Shiba Inu team member, posted about scammers creating multiple variations of the team’s unlaunched TREAT token to steal investors’ funds.
Just like the Ripple CTO, DaVinci urged individuals to be careful when interacting with tokens on the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange. He explained that given the decentralized nature of the exchange, they cannot stop these tokens from trading, but they can warn investors and have them informed.

Last month, Canadian authorities also took the initiative to warn its citizens due to the alarming rise in crypto scams. One of the major scams targeting investors include romance scams, where the scammer convinces their victims to invest in a crypto site, which ends up being fraudulent.
This comes as the number of investors who are holding cryptocurrencies continue to be on the rise. Due to the rather anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, it makes it a prime hunting ground for these scammers.

Kraken Pre-IPO Fund Raising Round Aimed at $100 Million Amid Crypto Surge - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Kraken pre-IPO fund raising round is seeking over $100 million, and it is aiming to complete the round by the end of the year to set the stage for a potential IPO.



The exchange faces ongoing regulatory challenges but remains focused on accelerating global crypto adoption and enhancing its board for better IPO prospects.




Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is reportedly in discussions to secure over $100 million in pre-IPO funding, according to Bloomberg.



Kraken Pre-IPO Fund Raising Round Aimed at $100 Million Amid Crypto Surge 4



Kraken Pre-IPO Fund Raising Targets $100M



Kraken pre-IPO fund raising round is anticipated to close by the end of the year, setting the stage for a potential initial public offering (IPO).



Founded in San Francisco in 2011, Kraken is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchange is eyeing this final funding round in response to heightened investor interest fueled by the recent rally in digital asset markets. This resurgence in interest coincides with a notable increase in cryptocurrency valuations and a perceived easing of U.S. regulatory pressures on digital assets.



Kraken’s journey towards an IPO has been ongoing since at least 2021, but the company has encountered challenges due to past downturns in crypto prices and regulatory hurdles. The company has had contentious interactions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including settling one case last year and contesting another involving allegations of operating as an unregistered securities broker, dealer, clearing agency, and exchange. Kraken has consistently denied these allegations.




Growing Investor Interest in the Crypto Sector



In a statement, the exchange reiterated its commitment to accelerating global crypto adoption but declined to comment specifically on Kraken pre-IPO fund raising round or IPO plans. “We remain fully focused on investing in this goal,” the statement read.



As part of its IPO preparations, Kraken is reportedly seeking to add a high-profile company to its board to enhance its public offering prospects, potentially as soon as next year. So far, discussions have involved verbal negotiations on terms and valuations without formal documentation.



The broader crypto sector is attracting increasing attention from investors and policymakers alike. Robinhood recently announced plans to acquire Bitstamp, another prominent crypto exchange. Additionally, U.S. regulators have shown a more favorable stance towards crypto, exemplified by the SEC’s approval of exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin and steps towards approving similar funds for Ether. Cryptocurrency has also become a significant topic in political circles, with presidential candidates striving to present themselves as industry supporters.

Ethereum ETFs Brace For Sluggish Reception, JPMorgan Expects Modest $1-$3 Billion Inflows | Bitcoinist.com


								According to a Bloomberg report, analysts suggest that the debut of the recently approved Ethereum ETFs in the US may generate significantly less demand than spot-Bitcoin products. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, await final approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list the long-awaited Ethereum funds. 
However, JPMorgan strategists anticipate much smaller net inflows into Ethereum ETFs than the $15.3 billion flowing into Bitcoin vehicles this year.
Analysts Divided On Ethereum ETFs’ Potential
Per the report, the success of the five-month-old Bitcoin ETFs can be attributed to a controversial narrative that presents Bitcoin as digital gold, a concept that Ether lacks. Additionally, the Ether funds will not offer staking rewards for blockchain maintenance, a feature available to those who hold the token directly.
Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets Pty, highlights that ETH lacks the same profile as Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market value of $1.4 trillion is three times larger than Ether’s. This discrepancy indicates that the Ethereum ETFs in the US may not have a comparable impact.


In a surprising shift, the SEC recently signaled its willingness to approve spot Ethereum ETFs, following its earlier acceptance of Bitcoin funds due to a court reversal in 2023. While this development boosted Ether’s price, its 109% gains over the past year still lag behind Bitcoin’s 169% surge, including its record high in March.
JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou estimate that prospective Ether portfolios will attract a “modest” $1 billion to $3 billion in net inflows for the remainder of the year. 
However, as Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, reports, these products may struggle to capture 20% of the current $62.5 billion Bitcoin ETF assets in the US.
Despite these reservations, Vetle Lunde, a senior research analyst at crypto specialist K33 Research, remains optimistic, predicting $4 billion worth of net inflows in the first five months for the Ethereum ETFs and a significant “supply absorption shock” that could boost ETH’s price.
VanEck Bullish On Ethereum
Fund manager VanEck, which aims to launch an Ethereum ETF, sees potential in the popularity of the Ethereum blockchain underlying the token, particularly for applications in crypto financial services. 
Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s Head of Digital-Asset Research, believes that investors will eventually recognize the greater potential for application and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem than Bitcoin.
It is worth noting that the launch of nine new US ETFs for Bitcoin on January 11 initially caused a decline in Bitcoin’s price, coupled with outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. However, the strength of demand for the new ETFs eventually overshadowed these concerns, and Bitcoin resumed its upward trajectory.
Similarly, asset manager Grayscale plans to convert its $11 billion Ethereum offering into an ETF, similar to its Bitcoin fund. While redemptions from the Grayscale fund may create selling pressure on ETH, the overall market impact remains unclear.

As of the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,830, while Bitcoin continues to approach its record levels of $73,7000 reached in March. Ether is still some distance away from its all-time peak of $4,866, achieved during the 2021 bull run.

Bitcoin's CPI turns positive after 10 days - What does it mean for prices? - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index is now positive.
This signals a spike in coin accumulation by US-based investors.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] Coinbase Premium Index (CPI) has turned positive after returning negative values for about ten days, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst BQYoutube has found in a new report.
This metric measures the difference between BTC’s prices on Coinbase and Binance. When its value is positive, it suggests that the coin is priced higher on Coinbase compared to Binance. It is interpreted to mean strong buying interest from US-based investors. 
Conversely, when it declines, and its value is negative, it signals less trading activity on the US-based exchange.
At press time, BTC’s CPI was 0.006.

Confirming the resurgence in activity from US-based BTC holders, BTC’s Coinbase Premium Gap was 4.48 at press time. 
According to CryptoQuant data, this was the first time the metric had returned a positive value since 18th May.

BTC traders in Korea look away
Although BTC’s Korean Premium Index (KPI) has trended downward since 15th April, it remains above the zero line. Also referred to as the Kimchi Premium, this index measures the gap between BTC prices on South Korean exchanges and other exchanges.
Source: CryptoQuant
At 0.78 at press time, BTC’s Kimchi Premium was at its year-to-date low, signaling that regional demand for the coin by Korean investors is at its lowest since the beginning of the year. 

Negative sentiment follows the coin
At press time, BTC exchanged hands at $71,148. Its price has risen by 10% in the past 30 days. During that period, the coin traded briefly at $71,315 on 21st May before witnessing a pull back.
However, despite BTC’s recent price rally, negative sentiment trails the coin. At press time, its weighted sentiment was -0.355. In fact, the value of this metric has been negative since 24th May. 
Source: Santiment
This indicates that despite its price rally in the past few weeks, there is still a bearish bias toward the leading coin among market participants.
This has been the case even with the daily profits made by coin holders.

 AMBCrypto assessed the daily ratio of BTC transaction volume in profit to loss (using a seven-day) moving average and returned a value of 1.8.

This showed that for every BTC transaction that ended in a loss in the past few weeks, 1.8 transactions have returned a profit.

BitMEX Co-Founder Dumps PENDLE Stake, Triggering Market Volatility


							

Arthur Hayes unstakes $9.41M PENDLE, sparking market concerns.



Hayes holds 1.69M PENDLE with $6.46M unrealized profit.



PENDLE price slightly drops after Hayes’s transaction.




Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, unloaded 1.55 million PENDLE tokens valued at $9.41 million, fueling concerns among PENDLE token holders. This move raises concerns about a potential price dump, given Hayes’s significant holdings of 1.69 million tokens and the possible impact on the market.



Hayes is an influential crypto trader. Currently, he retains 1.69 million PENDLE tokens, with an average purchase price of $2.24 per token. This holding translates to an unrealized profit of approximately $6.46 million. Despite the recent un-staking, some believe Hayes’ commitment to PENDLE remains strong. Just days before this move, he acquired additional tokens at an average price of $6.15.







For those uninitiated, Pendle Finance is an algorithmic trading protocol whose associated PENDLE tokens allow users to tokenize and trade future yields. This novel approach attracted not just intrigue but funding as well, thus influencing the price of the token.



Hayes’s advocacy for Pendle Finance also boosts the credibility of the company within the DeFi space. He has endorsed the protocol several times, stating it as a major derivative exchange.







Source: CoinMarketCap









The market was quick to react to Hayes’s un-staking. The price of PENDLE, which had reached a high of $7.10 in late May, fell to $5.9 immediately following the transaction. In the last 24 hours, the token’s price has declined again by almost 1% at the time of writing, which reflects the community’s cautious sentiment.



Hayes’s recent purchase of PENDLE tokens suggest confidence in the token’s future. As the DeFi landscape evolves, Hayes’s moves will likely continue to shape market dynamics, making Pendle Finance a project to watch.

ProShares Files to List Spot Ethereum ETF on NYSE


ProShares, a leading exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuer, has filed a proposal to list and trade spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF shares under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
This move reflects ProShares’ commitment to expanding its digital asset offerings, providing investors with a secure and regulated option to gain exposure to Ethereum.
SEC Filings Clarify Staking Policies for ProShares Ethereum ETF

The ProShares Ethereum ETF will use Coinbase Custody Trust Company for ETH custody. Like other asset managers’ filings, ProShares also emphasized that the firm or any affiliated parties will not engage in activities related to Ethereum staking.
BeInCrypto reported that potential spot Ethereum ETF issuers have updated their 19b-4 and S-1 filings to remove the staking aspects. These actions aim to clarify the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance on staking for spot Ethereum ETFs.
Read more: Ethereum ETF Explained: What It Is and How It Works
However, approving these ETFs without incorporating staking capabilities could disadvantage investors interested in earning additional yield from staking rewards. Those who purchase, hold, and stake ETH have the opportunity to receive staking rewards, which can result in extra yield. By omitting the staking feature, spot Ethereum ETFs will be unable to provide additional benefits for investors.
The SEC has 45 days, extendable to 90 days, from the notice publication date to respond to the filing. Since ProShares filed on June 6, 2024, approval could come as early as late July 2024.
This proposal follows ProShares’ recent announcement of two Ethereum-linked ETFs, ProShares Ultra Ether ETF (ETHT) and ProShares UltraShort Ether ETF (ETHD), which target 2x and -2x daily ETH returns, respectively. These ETFs are expected to be listed on the NYSE this Friday.
ProShares is known for launching the first Bitcoin-linked ETF in 2021, the Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which invests in futures contracts. However, ProShares has not pursued a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, unlike some asset management giants.

This latest proposal aligns with recent comments from Matteo Greco, a Research Analyst at Fineqia. Greco highlighted the growing interest and commitment from traditional finance players in digital assets.

“These recent developments underscore the global demand among traditional finance investors to diversify their portfolios by increasing exposure to digital assets. Earlier this year, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US paved the way, followed by similar product launches for BTC and ETH in Hong Kong. Additionally, news of spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US and spot Bitcoin ETF trading in Australia further highlights the industry’s momentum,” he told BeInCrypto.

However, it is important to note that these spot Ethereum ETFs need approval for both filings to trade in the market officially. The approval in May was only for the 19b-4. Analysts predict that the final approval for these ETFs could occur sometime in July 2024.

A new Bitcoin all-time high? Here's your June price forecast... - AMBCrypto



Bitcoin is only entering the second, more aggressively bullish phase of the cycle, according to one metric.
The security and network fundamentals remained intact, bolstering confidence.

Bitcoin [BTC] reached its all-time high against the U.S. Dollar on the 14th of March, 2024, reaching $73,777. Previously, the Bitcoin all-time high was at $69,000, set on the 10th of November.
Against other fiat currencies, Bitcoin has already established an all-time high. The Turkish Lira, the Argentine and Philippine Peso, and the Indian Rupee are just a few.
This showed that USD faced a lower inflation rate than these currencies, but also meant that Bitcoin is increasingly likely to be seen as an inflation hedge.
The reason behind the belief in Bitcoin
In a recent AMBCrypto report, the Thermo Cap ratio metric was explored. The findings were that the network fundamentals were strong and the value invested into the network was growing steadily.
However, it was also noted that the Network Value to Transactions metric was dropping. This meant users were not transacting enough volume to justify the BTC prices. The growing investor confidence and the rise of the “inflation hedge” argument.
Another report showed that the futures market participants remained sidelined and the funding rate was subdued.
A strongly bullish piece of news was needed to shake Bitcoin out of its lethargy. The $886 million inflow into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday, the 4th of June, did just that.
Examining on-chain metrics to understand the bull run

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Axel Adler pointed out that the price performance of Bitcoin on the higher timeframes has not yet gone parabolic.
In the 2017-18 run, 380 days of steady gains were followed by another 351 days of parabolic uptrend.
If it repeats, BTC could see another 12 months of uptrend.

The short-term holder (STH) Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) has not peaked either. According to the analyst, it would need to climb above 0.4 to mark the end of the current bull run.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25

The highest it has gone was 0.29 in March which was followed by a large correction as BTC consolidated over the past two months.
Therefore, the Bitcoin all-time high is very likely only a matter of time from here on.

$2.2 Billion Crypto Options Expire as Macroeconomic Data Looms


The crypto market is preparing for potential temporary turbulence, with over $2.2 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options set to expire today.
Can the expiration cause greater volatility in the market, and will it affect the price of the two leading cryptocurrencies?
Examining the Impending Options Expiration for Bitcoin and Ethereum

Approximately $1.24 billion in Bitcoin options contracts and $984 million in Ethereum options contracts are due to expire. Depending on how traders react to the event, the expiration of these options contracts could trigger a new wave of sell-offs or buying pressure.
According to Deribit data, 17,609 Bitcoin contracts are set to expire, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.67. This ratio suggests a prevalence of purchase options (calls) over sales options (puts).

Expiring Bitcoin Options. Source: Deribit
Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s maximum pain point is around $70,000. The maximum pain point is the price level at which the asset will cause financial losses to the greatest number of holders.
Analysts at crypto option trading tools provider, Greeks.Live, have suggested a positive outlook for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices despite the upcoming options expiration. They explained that the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, has shown signs of strength following the announcement of interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada (BOC) and the European Central Bank (ECB).

“US Non-Farm Payrolls and Unemployment Rate have also become more interesting, with The Fed rate cut expectations now at the center of macro trading. Short-term [implied volatility] IV is now clearly rising, with the weekly [at-the-money] ATM IV back above 50% but still below 50% at the end of the week, just as traders are betting on [today’s] data to exceed expectations, with slightly stronger bullish forces,” they noted.


In the Ethereum market, 259,641 contracts are set to expire. The put-to-call ratio stands at 0.64. Ethereum’s maximum pain point is $3,650.

While options expirations can cause temporary market disruptions, they are often followed by stabilization. Traders should remain vigilant, analyzing technical indicators and market sentiment to navigate the anticipated volatility effectively.
As the week concludes, Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience. Bitcoin reached a two-month high of $71,713 before slightly retreating. On the other hand, Ethereum is trading at $3,805, having experienced a minor decline.

Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Will Include EIP-7702 and EVM Object Format for Optimized Experience - Coincu



	

Key Points:




Ethereum Pectra upgrade will introduce the EVM Object Format (EOF).



Vitalik Buterin’s proposed EIP-7702 will enable Ethereum account addresses to temporarily function as smart contract wallets during transactions.



Petra, slated for release in the first quarter of 2025, is set to be one of Ethereum’s most comprehensive upgrades.




Ethereum’s core developers have reached a consensus to incorporate the EVM Object Format (EOF) in the forthcoming Pectra upgrade, as outlined in EIP-7692.



Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Will Include EIP-7702 and EVM Object Format for Optimized Experience 4



Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Introduced EOF and EIP-7702



This addition, encompassing approximately 11 EIPs, introduces an optional container for EVM code, aiming to enhance code validation and introduce innovative features.



Should EOF pose any challenges, it will be partitioned into separate forks to ensure the continuity of the Pectra upgrade without significant delays. Notably, EOF will not be integrated into the initial version of devnet 1. The Ethereum Pectra upgrade will also include the account abstraction standard, EIP-7702, proposed by Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type enabling Ethereum account addresses to transiently function as smart contract wallets during transactions, with their original state restored thereafter.



Pectra is heralded as a “comprehensive” upgrade, slated to encompass 19 EIPs, positioning it as one of the most extensive upgrades in Ethereum’s history. Ethereum’s core developers have expressed their ambition to roll out the Pectra upgrade by the first quarter of 2025.




Ethereum’s Ambitious Upgrade Targeting Enhanced User Experience



Pectra upgrade marks Ethereum’s next significant advancement, succeeding the Dencun upgrade, which was successfully implemented in March 2023. The Ethereum Pectra upgrade aims to address the user experience challenges within the Ethereum network and its ecosystem, complementing the solutions provided by the Dencun upgrade, particularly regarding transaction fees on Layer 2 platforms.



Additionally, the upgrade is anticipated to integrate EIP-7251, aiming to increase the maximum effective balance within Pectra. This modification will empower individual validators to stake more than 32 ETH, with a capped maximum of 2,048 ETH, diverging from the current 32 ETH limit. Elevating the maximum effective validator balance seeks to streamline operations by allowing operators to manage fewer but higher-stake validators, potentially reducing complexity.

Kraken Bolsters IPO Ambitions With Plans Of A Massive $100 Million Funding Injection | Bitcoinist.com


								US-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, is reportedly considering a final funding round as it explores the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO), according to sources familiar with the matter. The exchange has received inquiries from potential investors amid the current rally in the digital asset market.
Kraken Gears Up For Pre-IPO Funding Round
According to a Bloomberg report, sources suggest that Kraken is likely to seek more than $100 million in funding. The renewed interest from investors, coupled with a perceived shift in US regulatory attitudes towards digital assets, has reignited discussions about companies in the crypto sector going public. Just recently, Bitcoinist also reported that Robinhood acquired another crypto exchange Bitstamp.

Kraken has been contemplating an IPO since at least 2021. The funding round, potentially designated as a pre-IPO round, is expected to be finalized by the end of the year, according to one source. 
Kraken, founded in 2011 in San Francisco and operating under its parent company Payward, has stated that it remains committed to its mission of accelerating global adoption of cryptocurrencies.
While Kraken has expressed its intentions to go public for several years, previous market downturns and regulatory challenges, including ongoing legal battles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have hindered its progress. 
Kraken settled one case with the SEC in 2020 but is still involved in another case in which it is accused of operating an unregistered securities broker-dealer, clearing agency, and exchange. The company disputes these allegations.
Favorable Regulatory Winds
In recent months, US regulators and politicians have taken a more favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies as the US presidential campaigns have shifted, with crypto becoming one of the main issues in the race for the White House. 
The US SEC’s approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investing in Bitcoin and its steps towards approving similar funds for Ethereum, also indicate a growing acceptance of digital assets. 
According to Bloomberg, with the surge in crypto prices throughout the year, Kraken is projected to generate revenue between $1 billion and $2 billion this year, according to insiders. 
In comparison, Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange, which went public through a direct listing in 2021, is estimated to achieve revenue of $5.9 billion, as compiled by Bloomberg analysts.

Kraken is now actively seeking a company to join its board and ensure a successful IPO, potentially as early as next year. The discussions thus far have involved informal exchanges of terms and valuations, without formal documentation.

The total crypto market capitalization now stands at $2.5 trillion, while Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency on the market, is consolidating above the key $70,000 threshold.

US Bitcoin ETFs attract record inflows with new all-time high in sight - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in Bitcoin (BTC) have seen net inflows for a record-breaking 18 consecutive days, contributing to the alpha crypto’s nudge toward a new all-time high (ATH).According to data compiled by Bloomberg, net subscriptions for the group of nearly a dozen products reached $15.6 billion through Thursday since their launch on January 11, bringing total assets to $62.3 billion.Bloomberg reports that the Bitcoin funds offered by major players like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments have emerged as some of the most successful debuts in the ETF sector’s history. The report also claims that the crypto industry’s “center of gravity” is shifting back from Asia to the US.ETF demand and expectations of future Fed interest-rate cuts are highlighted as factors for considering how Bitcoin would surpass its most recent ATH of $73,798 before June ends.Sean Farrell, head of digital-asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, noted the “massive inflows into spot-Bitcoin ETFs” and stated that the macro environment continues to favor crypto, with slower economic growth at a non-recessionary pace and ongoing signs of disinflation.Compounding this projection, BlackRock’s $21.4 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust has become the world’s largest fund for the token, surpassing Grayscale Investments LLC’s $20.1 billion Bitcoin trust. The $12.3 billion Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ranks third.The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reluctantly allowed spot-Bitcoin ETFs in January following a court reversal in 2023. In May, the agency also surprisingly pivoted toward approval of funds for Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency.However, under Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC remains critical of the digital-asset industry’s alleged non-compliance with regulations, while Congressional efforts to provide legislative clarity for crypto have recently gained momentum, with more support from the Senate and federal judiciary courts to strike down the SEC’s overreach in other sectors such as traditional finance and banking.

Meme Coin Crashes 85% Due to Insider Selling


The price of the HULK cryptocurrency has dropped by nearly 85% due to insider selling, according to a recent post by cryptocurrency analytics firm Lookonchain. An insider managed to secure a gain of 812x, making nearly a million dollars in hours. They spent just $1,200 worth of Solana (SOL) tokens in order to buy 190 million HULK tokens. Within just three hours after the trade, the trader dumped all of their newly acquired tokens, making the HULK price collapse.This comes after former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan was busy promoting the celebrity meme coin in now-deleted posts on the X social media network. Hogan even took a shot at rapper Iggy Azalea and her viral Mother Iggy (IGGY) token made headlines due to massive gains.In his Instagram post, Hogan denied promoting the cryptocurrency, urging his followers not to take notice of any posts from him. "They are not even from me and will be promptly removed," the former professional wrestler said. Even before Hogan's clarification, it was obvious that there was something off with the latest celebrity meme coin. A video posted by Hogan that was meant to promote the token had no mention of HULK. In fact, it is an old video from December 2023 that is not even related to crypto.It is not clear what happened to Hogan's social media profile, but it is possible that he got hacked or scammed. The HULK token is now basically worthless after reaching a market cap of nearly $19 million on June 6.

Hulk Hogan-Themed Crypto Loses $15M in Market Cap In Minutes: Here's Why - Benzinga

A Solana SOL/USD-based memecoin promoted by Hulk Hogan reportedly suffered a $15 million loss in market cap after the wrestling legend allegedly deleted social posts shilling the cryptocurrency.What Happened: HULK‘s value plunged from $17 million to a mere $2 million within minutes of Hogan’s supposed deletions, according to a post by a Solana-associated X account Thursday. Widely-followed journalist Matt Binder posted screenshots, allegedly showing promotional posts by Hogan earlier in the day. In one of the posts, Hogan wrote, “Website hulkhogan.com is #updated with the $HULK info! I’m all jacked up for tonight!” The posts have been removed as of this writing, and Hogan later clarified on Instagram that the posts were not from him.See Also: Here’s How Much Just $100 In Bitcoin Will Be Worth If Cathie Wood’s BTC Prediction Is CorrectWhy It Matters: The recent surge in celebrity-endorsed memecoins has been a topic of concern in the cryptocurrency community. Launching memecoins has become easier than ever before thanks to launchpads such as pump.fun. However, fears of pump and dump and rug pulls have caused market anxiety.Ethereum ETH/USD creator Vitalik Buterin expressed his disapproval of the fad earlier this week, criticizing the trend and urging the community to steer “things in a better direction.” He argued that the creators of these tokens use celebrities’ names to attract investors while providing little value in return.Interestingly, there appears to be a correlation between the involvement of celebrities in cryptocurrency markets and cycle tops. Referencing events from previous cycles, it was seen that when celebrities begin promoting cryptocurrencies, the market typically experiences a final surge before hitting a local top.Photo by CMP_NZ on ShutterstockRead Next: Kitty-Themed Crypto Pumps 65% In Anticipation Of ‘Roaring Kitty’ YouTube Livestream, Trading Volume More Than Doubles

Bitcoin on Cusp of Major ‘Blue Sky Breakout’, Says Crypto Analyst Kevin Svenson - Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl


								Analyst and trader Kevin Svenson is saying that Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing a bullish signal amid the flagship crypto asset’s double-digit bump over the past month.
In a new video, Svenson tells his 78,400 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is on a parabolic trend and is close to a “point of going vertical.”










“Bitcoin is near what is called a Blue Sky Breakout. A Blue Sky Breakout is when an asset breaks above all previous historic price action and experiences what’s called price discovery. So a Blue Sky Breakout is likely what’s coming up very, very soon.”
Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube
According to Svenson, Bitcoin is in a parabolic trend and could go up by around 26% from the current level.
“We are following this exponential rise in price, an accelerating trend… the target is $90,000. In mathematics, a parabola can only be so steep before it turns backward. So you have to understand that we are going to break it at some point. But I think we have a lot higher prices to see before that happens. Going from $70,000 to $90,000 is no joke. That is a huge gain for all the top players out there.”
Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube
Svenson says that if history repeats itself, Bitcoin could hit the $90,000 price in about two months.
“So if we were to get the vertical push and reach $90,000 by about August or so September is the worst month of the year on record for Bitcoin and the stock market going back in time, of all of history.
And so if we are going to follow some level of seasonality, well that’s perfect timing here… going vertical into August and then seeing a major pullback in September followed by an October bounce, which is also quite common, a sideways consolidation and a push into the New Year.
So this parabolic trend prediction of $90,000 is not a cycle peak target – it is simply a trend target. The current trend on the weekly and I think that this cycle is going to be continuing to expand into 2025.”

Bitcoin is trading at $71,200 at time of writing, up by around 12% over the past 30 days.

Three Important Polkadot (DOT) Price Predictions to Watch


																TL;DR

Polkadot’s native token, DOT, is currently priced at around $7.20, showing a modest 2% weekly increase, despite a booming cryptocurrency market.
Analysts, including Michael van de Poppe and Crypto Thanos, predict a potential bull run for DOT, with targets up to $17, driven by fundamental growth, improved use cases, and advancements in AI and gaming.


DOT’s Next Target
While the cryptocurrency market has been booming lately, Polkadot’s native token – DOT – has not recorded as substantial gains as most of the leading assets. Its price currently stands at around $7.20 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 2% increase on a weekly scale.

DOT Price, Source: CoinGecko
Many well-known analysts, though, remain optimistic that DOT is yet to experience a bull run, praising its merits. One example is the X user Michael van de Poppe, who claimed that the coin “is doing great in fundamental growth.”
He believes the moment is perfect for investors to enter DOT’s ecosystem, envisioning a 130% rally toward $17. However, he added, the price must first overcome the “crucial resistance” at $9.30.
Crypto Thanos and il Capo of Crypto also gave their two cents lately. The former assumed that DOT is “still in accumulation range” and “is improving their use cases day by day.” The analyst has high hopes for it based on several fundamentals such as “radical change in the use” of the token, “supersession of the old model of parachain auctions,” reduction of inflation via the burning of fees, and others.




For their part, il Capo of Crypto argued that DOT is “forming a new bullish trend” and is leading among major blockchains in advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and gaming. 
“It ensures secure data transfers, decentralized processing for AI, and seamless asset integration in gaming, with enhanced security and governance,” the analyst concluded.
Previous Forecasts
Other analysts touching upon the matter in the past few weeks include Block Diversity and Altcoin Sherpa. The former predicted a price increase as long as DOT stays above the $6.90 mark. Recall that its value briefly dropped below that level on May 31 before reclaiming it. 
Altcoin Sherpa envisioned a bull run but claimed that DOT won’t be able to outperform the rest of the market. As such, they think selling holdings during the next pump is the right move.
One important on-chain indicator that signals that the asset’s price is yet to surge is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. A ratio above 70 suggests that DOT could be headed for correction. The latest data shows that RSI has been hovering below that level since May 22.

China Never Banned Bitcoin Mining, Researcher Reveals


								In a striking revelation that challenges widely-held perceptions, Daniel Batten, a Bitcoin environmental impact analyst, disclosed that BTC mining was never officially banned in China. According to Batten’s research, despite widespread reports to the contrary, the so-called “ban” was actually a temporary suspension, and mining activities have largely resumed across the country.
Bitcoin Mining Was Never Banned In China
Batten’s report highlights that the hashrate within China, which is a measure of the computational power used in mining and processing Bitcoin, currently accounts for approximately 15% of the global total. This information stands in stark contrast to the dominant narrative that emerged in May 2021, when numerous major news outlets reported a comprehensive crackdown on cryptocurrency transactions and mining operations by the Chinese government.

Batten argues that the drop in network hashrate, which fell from 179.2 EH/s to 87.7 EH/s—a 51.1% reduction—was temporary and misinterpreted as a definitive ban. “If you are a disruptive student, and the principal sends you away from school, those ‘days absent from school’ don’t mean you’ve been expelled. It could mean you’ve merely been suspended,” Batten explained, drawing an analogy to clarify the situation in China.
Further investigative reporting supports Batten’s assertion. For instance, reports immediately following the “ban” indicated that many miners remained operational and unfazed. CNBC and NBC both reported on ongoing mining activities within China. Additionally, by December 2021, mining activity had rebounded to 19.1% of the global hashrate, as per Cambridge data, signaling a significant recovery.
“We’ve talked to multiple mining companies and mining distributers in China. The message is clear: if you’re small, useful and not using it to get money out of China, you’re welcome. This philosophy has made Bitcoin mining more distributed and more clean-energy based,” Batten added.
Innovative uses of Bitcoin mining in China have reportedly included harvesting wasted renewable energy and recycling heat, pointing to a more nuanced approach towards Bitcoin mining than previously understood. Batten also noted that local provincial governments often actively support Bitcoin mining, particularly when it involves small-scale operations that contribute to local energy solutions without attempting to circumvent capital controls.

“If you have 200-500 miners and want to do renewable-energy mining, you’re welcome. This is particularly in Inner Mongolia, the Texas of China, which has a lot of wasted renewable power they want to monetize,” Batten stated and added that “China let back the miners that served a specific purpose.”
Moreover, there’s no off-grid coal-based mining any more. “Mining is mostly hydro, much of which is sub-1MW,” Batten revealed. This is in line with China’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Thus, the Bitcoin mining “ban” seems part of a broader effort to reduce the energy intensity of high-consumption industries.
According to Batten, Western media outlets have largely misreported these dynamics. This misunderstanding has perpetuated a false narrative about China’s stance on Bitcoin mining, which Batten aims to correct. Supporting this perspective, Jaran Mellerud from Hashlabs noted, “There are still several big miners operating in China. The local government lets them operate as they desperately need economic activity there.”
These findings not only challenge the mainstream media’s portrayal of China’s policies but also highlight a broader pattern of misinterpretation and sensationalism in reporting on Bitcoin mining’s legal and regulatory status worldwide.

Jasmycoin set for another rally? Potential 60% gains ahead! - AMBCrypto



Jasmycoin has a strongly bullish outlook based on the on-chain metrics.
The Fibonacci extension levels showed the token could rally another 60%.

Jasmycoin [JASMY] noted high volatility over the past two days. On the 3rd and 4th of June, prices rose by 25% within 36 hours. They retraced by 11.1% over the next two days and traded at $0.039 at press time.
Despite the lower timeframe volatility, the higher timeframes signaled bullish promise. How high can the move go, and does the on-chain metric support the idea of continued expansion?
The social metrics promised vast JASMY gains

Like the February rally, the social volume, as well as the daily active addresses, were both surging. When it happened on the 20th of February, JASMY rallied 263% over the next two weeks.
While this does not guarantee another 260% rally, it showed that hype and momentum can drag an asset a long way forward.
The dormant circulation spikes were small in recent weeks, showing that a large wave of selling was not yet in sight.
During the February rally, despite a dormant circulation surging to indicate profit-taking, the prices continued to climb. Hence, even if the dormant holders wake up soon, investors have reason to hold on and not panic.
Robust bullish sentiment was detected based on these two metrics

The 30-day MVRV shows whether short-term holders are in profit or not. The mean dollar invested age (MDIA) downtrend is a signal that the network is not stagnating. Together, they were strong evidence for a bullish JASMY.
The NVT ratio was not high, which indicated the coin was not overvalued based on its transaction volume. Overall, the metrics were positive.
Source: JASMY/USDT on TradingView
The 50% Fibonacci retracement level served as support from March to May before the recent uptrend occurred. Using the same move, a set of extension levels were plotted. The $0.0415, $0.05, and $0.064 are the next bullish targets.

Read Jasmycoin’s [JASMY] Price Prediction 2024-25

The RSI on the 3-day chart showed intense bullish momentum and the CMF’s reading of +0.12 supported the idea of firm capital inflow.
Hence, it is likely we see another 30%-60% move higher. In case of a retracement, the $0.0256-$0.0288 region would offer a slightly aggressive long-term bullish re-entry.

Mastercard and Visa Payments Return After a Hiatus on Binance


							

Binance has announced the resumption of its payment services through Mastercard and Visa.



The new move comes after a period of restrictions following Binance’s legal struggles with the SEC and CFTC.



Mastercard states that its decision to resume its alliance with Binance is the result of severe scrutiny of the exchange.




Binance has announced the reinstatement of crypto payment services through Mastercard and Visa. Binance revealed this decision via a recent X post, stating, “Use Mastercard, Visa, or SEPA for bank transfers and experience seamless transactions!”







A Binance spokesperson shared insights into the rigorous scrutiny the platform underwent in recent months. The spokesperson asserted:




 “Over the past several months, we have reviewed the enhanced controls and processes that Binance has put into place. It is based on those efforts that we have decided to allow Binance-related purchases on our network.” 




It is to be noted that Mastercard and Visa had severed their partnerships with Binance amid the exchange’s legal battles with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Back in August 2023, Mastercard announced its decision to discontinue its alliance with Binance in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Bahrain. In October, Binance had to cancel its Visa debit card program in the European Economic Area (EEA).









Following a period of restrictions, Binance has re-enabled the “Buy Crypto” options via Mastercard. The feature allows a maximum one-time purchase of up to 5,000 euros (approximately $5,440) for euro-based transactions and up to $20,000 for U.S. dollar-based purchases. The Binance spokesperson commented:




 “Following an extensive review of the rigorous controls and processes that Binance put into place, Mastercard made the decision to allow Binance-related purchases on its network. We look forward to adding support for further products, such as withdrawals, at a later date.” 




Mastercard and Visa’s decision to resume their relationship with the crypto exchange signals a potential easing of Binance’s legal challenges. This demonstrates Binance’s initiative to reclaim its position as a leader in the crypto industry, providing customers with flexible and convenient transaction options.

Can Whales Help Worldcoin (WLD) Price Reclaim Former Glory?


Worldcoin’s (WLD) price is on a bullish path propelled by one of the most influential cohorts, the whale addresses.
This investors’ accumulation has enabled WLD to recover recent losses with the help of investors potentially.
Worldcoin Investors Accumulate

Worldcoin’s price is above the $5 mark but still attempts to break past a crucial resistance level. However, the whales could be the altcoin’s savior, as the large wallet holders have consistently added WLD to their holdings.
In the past two weeks, addresses holding between 100,000 and 1 million WLD have bought over 6 million WLD. This supply, worth nearly $30 million, proves investors are optimistic about a price rise.

Thus, they are accumulating now to reap profits once Worldcoin’s price breaks out.

This sentiment is shared by retail investors and is also evident in their behavior. Upon distributing the participation, i.e., active addresses, by profitability, we can observe that the potential for selling is rather low.
In the case of WLD, less than 6% of all addresses conducting a transaction on the network are in profit. Generally, a dominance of this cohort hints at profit booking, but currently, WLD holders are HODLing overselling.

Worldcoin’s price could capitalize on this as accumulation and minimal selling create the perfect atmosphere for a rally.
WLD Price Prediction: Rise and Shine

Worldcoin’s price recently bounced off the support at $4.53 after failing to breach the resistance at $5.14. This barrier has been unbroken since mid-May, making it crucial in initiating recovery.
With the help of the investors’ bullishness, WLD could breach this resistance and flip it into a support floor. This would enable a rise to $5.64, which is the next major barrier for the altcoin.

However, a failed breach would keep Worldcoin’s price consolidated between $5.14 and $4.53. A fall to the latter would also increase the potential for a breakdown, invalidating the bullish thesis.

The stock Nvidia surpasses Apple for market cap in the race for shares

According to recent data, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple among the most valuable tech stocks in the world. However, the competition for the top spot is tight, with Microsoft holding a slight edge over all. 
Let’s see all the details below. 

Nvidia stocks in strong growth briefly surpass the value of Apple
As anticipated, on June 5, Nvidia, the American chip manufacturer, briefly surpassed Apple, becoming the second most valuable company in the world by market capitalization, before returning to third place.
The surge in Nvidia’s market capitalization, which reached over 3.01 trillion dollars, brought the company very close to Microsoft’s peak value of 3.1 trillion dollars. However, Apple’s recovery has been just as swift.
On June 6, in fact, at the opening of the US markets, Apple regained its position, returning to second place with a valuation of 3.007 trillion dollars. 
In the same period, Nvidia settled in third place with a valuation of 2.973 trillion dollars. These values represent new all-time highs for Nvidia, Apple, the NASDAQ, and the S&P 500. 
Further movements are expected in the coming days, as the global technological landscape continues to evolve. Despite the fluctuations, Microsoft has maintained its advantage, remaining the most valuable company of all time by market capitalization. 
However, the dynamic technological context, combined with imminent product launches, partnerships, and potential regulatory interventions, could cause significant changes in the rankings.
Furthermore, on June 10, the Worldwide Developer’s Conference of Apple will be held, and analysts predict a series of announcements on artificial intelligence (AI) from the Cupertino company, including a potential partnership with the ChatGPT producer, OpenAI.
Apple tries to close the gap with Microsoft
According to numerous reports, Apple executives are concerned about falling behind Microsoft, which has invested over 13 billion dollars in OpenAI. 
Rumor has it that Apple is rapidly forming partnerships with OpenAI and other related companies, as well as integrating artificial intelligence technologies developed by former employees of rivals like Google.
In any case, Nvidia could be the main beneficiary of the increase in AI stocks expected for 2024. 
His chip GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) continue to see a growing demand, consolidating themselves as the reference hardware platform for the development of artificial intelligence.
The dominant position of Nvidia in the AI market is evident, with its chips used by tech giants like Microsoft and Google. However, the influence of Nvidia extends well beyond, involving other industry leaders such as OpenAI, Amazon, and Elon Musk’s xAI.
The growing adoption of Nvidia GPUs is driven by the need for advanced computing power for artificial intelligence applications. 
With the continuous development and implementation of AI technologies, Nvidia is in a strategic position to capitalize on this trend, offering hardware solutions that have become essential for many of the world’s biggest technological innovators.
Looking at 2024, Nvidia seems poised to maintain and perhaps expand its leadership in the AI sector. 
With a customer base that includes the most influential names in global technology, the company is well positioned to reap the benefits of the surge in artificial intelligence, continuing to drive innovation and growth in this dynamic field.

Blockchain.com: the crypto company launches its Web3 domain

Blockchain.com, the leading crypto finance company, has formed a new partnership with Unstoppable Domains to launch its new Web3 domain: “.blockchain”. This domain will be enabled for DNS through a request to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

Blockchain.com: the crypto company and its new Web3 domain enabled for DNS 
Blockchain.com collaborates with Unstoppable Domains to launch its new DNS-enabled Web3 domain: “.blockchain”. 
In practice, the leading crypto finance company has announced its strategy to create one of the first Web3 domains enabled by DNS through a request to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
Together with Unstoppable Domains, the Web3 domain of “.blockchain” will be presented in time for the anticipated six-year ICANN registration program next year.
This would mean that if the request is accepted, the .blockchain domain will be ready to join the ranks of generic top-level domains registered by ICANN such as .com, .net, .org, .biz, .info, and others. 
In this regard, Lane Kasselman, president of Blockchain.com commented as follows: 
“Joining forces with Unstoppable Domains to drive the next evolution of web domains is exciting. Our joint efforts underscore our dedication to a user-centric web. We look forward to engaging with ICANN to realize our shared vision”
Blockchain.com: the crypto company partners with Unstoppable Domains for the Web3 domain
With a solid experience in generating adoption, Blockchain.com is the perfect partner to help Unstoppable bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 domains. 
Just think that over 40 million verified users on Blockchain.com have created more than 90 million wallets and the company has supported over 1.2 trillion dollars in cryptocurrency transactions.
Not only that, its all-encompassing and sector-specific nature makes .blockchain an ideal candidate to promote widespread adoption of blockchain-based companies in the Web2 ecosystem.
On the other hand, to date, Unstoppable Domains has been at the forefront in using blockchain technology to give users and brands control over their digital identities.
Sandy Carter, COO di Unstoppable Domains, commented:
“We are excited to collaborate with Blockchain.com in this ambitious venture. Our alliance is ready to launch with a Web3 domain to test and provide a low-cost solution. This is a step forward to ensure we can plan and strategize the next works of ICANN”.
The success of this partnership will allow any brand to collaborate with Unstoppable to expand the reach of existing Web3 domains, providing a low-cost integrated naming solution before the next ICANN round. 
This opportunity extends beyond companies to include cities and locations, with Unstoppable Domains responsible for creating the first city-focused Web3 domain, “.Austin”.
.
Unstoppable Domains and Women in Tech sponsored by President Macron
Recently, Unstoppable Domains formed a partnership with the renowned organization Women in Tech, on the occasion of their Global Summit, sponsored by President Emmanuel Macron.

Roaring Kitty’s YouTube Livestream Sparks Meme Coin Surge


Meme coins are experiencing a significant surge after an announcement by Keith Gill, widely known as Roaring Kitty or DeepF**kingValue. Gill revealed plans for an upcoming YouTube livestream scheduled for June 7 at 16:00 UTC. 
This announcement ignited an immediate and explosive reaction in the crypto and stock markets.
Roaring Kitty on the Way to Become a Billionaire

Specifically, Solana blockchain-based tokens like GME, AMC, and KITTY have substantially increased. GME meme coin, unrelated to the GameStop (GME) company, has experienced the most remarkable rise, soaring 110% in just 24 hours and accumulating a staggering 560% increase over the past week. 
Consequently, GME has become one of the top performers among all Solana-based meme coins. Traders are considering the GME meme coin as an alternative to the GME shares in case there are restrictions on trading the shares.
Furthermore, GameStop shares surged by 47.5% in a single day, with the price per share reaching $46.55. According to a screenshot shared by Gill, the notional value of his stake in GME stocks now exceeds $586 million.

This includes his holdings of 5 million shares, valued at over $232.75 million, and call options worth more than $324.30 million. Gill’s unrealized gains from these investments total approximately $382.51 million.

“Roaring Kitty is set to be a billionaire as GameStop stock, GME, surges to $67.50/share in after-hours trading. If GME opens at or above current levels tomorrow, his shares will be worth ~$325 million, and options worth ~$700 million for a combined ~$1 billion,” the Kobeissi Letter said.

This financial juggernaut began to gather momentum on June 2. On that day, Gill disclosed on Reddit—his first post since April 2021—that his holdings in GME shares and call options had surpassed $180 million in notional value.
Additionally, the low market cap meme coin Roaring Kitty (KITTY) mirrored the explosive trajectory of GME, with an impressive 199% increase in a single day. Similarly, AMC tokens also felt the positive effects, nearly doubling in value. This indicates a broader market trend.

Encouraged by Gill’s announcement, crypto traders are aggressively acquiring positions in these high-risk assets. 
According to Lookonchain, an on-chain analysis platform, there’s notable activity from major traders. One such investor, who owns the Solana wallet – coux7, made significant investments in GME and KITTY coins.

This trader allocated 5,000 Solana tokens (SOL)—worth approximately $850,000—to purchase 35.99 million GME coins. Moreover, he spent an additional 1,460 SOL—valued around $248,000—to acquire 8.6 million KITTY coins.

Bitcoin ETFs Are Hot, But Prices Are Not: Here's Why


							

Eric Balchunas said that BTC holders are selling their tokens.



Despite billions of inflows into Bitcoin, the price of the coin remains stagnant.



An analyst stated that ETFs hold only 5% of supply, while BTC whales hold 95%.




In a series of conversations on X platform, Frank Makrides, an investor, questioned Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas about why the price of Bitcoin (BTC) remained range bound despite record inflows into the spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs).



Eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications were approved in the United States by the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year and have since attracted billions of dollars in inflows, with BlackRock leading the demand.



Makrides also called for Bitcoin ETF issuers BlackRock and Fidelity, along with other asset management firms and their market maker, JPMorgan Chase, to “show us exactly what they’re doing with their funds.”









On the other hand, Balchunas was swift to reply, stating, “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the call is coming from inside the house” and added:




“This is not ETFs doing, obvious because they buying like crazy lately, it’s bitcoin holders selling or leveraged flushers or whatever. Time and again ETFs go on flow-a-thons and its met with selling from other holders.”




Another analyst, Jimie, commented on Balchunas’ post, explaining that spot Bitcoin ETFs worldwide hold around 5% of the total BTC circulating supply while the rest is held by whales. He noted that “ETF inflows are significant and yet minimal compared to the volume of BTC being traded and sold by these groups,” stating that for every buyer, there needs to be a seller.

Buy Now, Crypto Bull Market Returns, Says Arthur Hayes


																In a new essay titled “Group of Fools,” Arthur Hayes, the outspoken co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, casts a critical eye over recent macroeconomic developments and their implications for the crypto market. Hayes, known for his direct and often provocative commentary, employs a blend of technical analysis, central banking critique, and currency market insights to build a case for what he believes is the return of a Bitcoin and crypto bull market.
A “Group Of Fools”
He begins by emphasizing the significance of the dollar-yen exchange rate as a macroeconomic barometer. According to Hayes, this metric crucially influences global financial stability and policy decisions. “The dollar-yen exchange rate is the most important macroeconomic indicator,” he asserts.
Hayes revisits his earlier proposal for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to engage in extensive dollar-for-yen swaps with the Bank of Japan (BOJ), a move he argues would empower the Japanese Ministry of Finance to bolster the yen through targeted interventions in the forex markets. Despite the theoretical benefits of this strategy, Hayes notes with a mix of irony and frustration that the G7 nations, which he refers to as the “Group of Fools,” have opted for a different route.

	Related Reading


The narrative then shifts to a critical examination of the G7’s central banking strategies. Hayes points out the stark discrepancies in interest rates among the major economies, with Japan maintaining a near-zero rate while other nations hover around 4-5%. He critiques the conventional wisdom that supports rate cuts as a tool to manage inflation, which universally targets a 2% rate among G7 countries, despite their diverse economic conditions.
“The G7 central banks—with the exception of the BOJ—have all raised rates aggressively in response to inflation spikes,” Hayes writes. However, he highlights yesterday’s unexpected rate cuts by the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank despite prevailing inflation trends, suggesting a deeper, unstated economic strategy aimed at bolstering the yen against a backdrop of geopolitical and economic tensions with China.
He describes this move as a cessation of what he terms “rate hike Kabuki theatre,” a maneuver he believes is designed to maintain the dominance of the Pax Americana-led global financial system.
Why The Bitcoin And Crypto Bull Run Returns
It is in this context that Hayes pivots to the implications for the crypto market. Looking ahead, Hayes turns his gaze to the crypto markets, suggesting that these recent shifts signal a fortuitous environment for investment in digital assets. Hayes speculates that the coordinated actions of central banks to adjust interest rates downward, despite high inflation, are setting the stage for increased liquidity in global markets, which traditionally benefits riskier assets like Bitcoin and subsequently altcoins.

	Related Reading


“The June central banking fireworks kicked off this week by the BOC and ECB rate cuts will catapult crypto out of the northern hemispheric summer doldrums. This was not my expected base case. I thought the fireworks would start in August, right around when the Fed hosts its Jackson Hole symposium,” Hayes noted.
He argues that these monetary policy shifts are likely to ignite a bull market in Bitcoin and crypto, particularly as central banks appear to be entering a cycle of rate easing. “We know how to play this game. It’s the same game we have been playing since 2009 when our Lord and Saviour Satoshi gave us the weapon to defeat the TradFi devil. Go long Bitcoin and subsequently shitcoins.” Hayes declares, referencing the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.
As the G7 meeting from June 13-15 looms, Hayes anticipates further developments that could influence global financial markets. He expects the communiqué from this gathering will likely address currency and bond market manipulations explicitly, or at least signal continued accommodative policies. Additionally, Hayes forecasts that despite conventional caution against policy shifts near major political events like the US presidential election, unusual circumstances might prompt unexpected moves.
Hayes concludes his essay by reinforcing his bullish stance on Bitcoin and crypto, driven by his analysis of G7 monetary policies and their impact on global exchange rates and financial stability. His call to action for the crypto community is to capitalize on these developments, positioning themselves for what he predicts will be a lucrative phase in the markets.
“For my excess liquid crypto synthetic-dollar cash, […] it is time to deploy it again on conviction shitcoins. […] But suffice it to say, the crypto bull is reawakening and is about to gore the hides of profligate central bankers,” Hayes concludes.
At press time, BTC traded at $71,200.

Crypto Whales Are Buying Up Bitcoin Like It's 2020 Again


							

Large investors buying Bitcoin at pre-bull run pace.



Spot ETFs drive record Bitcoin holdings in the U.S.



Ethereum demand rises, whales hold record amounts.




According to a CryptoQuant weekly report, large investors, known as “whales,” are accumulating Bitcoin at a pace similar to that seen before the 2020 bull run. The firm’s data reveals daily injections of $1 billion into Bitcoin and a significant increase in holdings by these whales. This mirrors similar activity observed in mid-2020.











Source: Cryptoquant



CryptoQuant also highlights a surge in Bitcoin purchases from spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States. These ETFs track the price of Bitcoin but trade on traditional stock exchanges. The chart shared by CryptoQuant shows that total spot ETF Bitcoin holdings in the U.S. have reached record highs, indicating growing institutional investment.



Source: Cryptoquant



Ethereum is also exhibiting positive signals. CryptoQuant reports a rise in Ethereum demand since May 20th, likely driven by the recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. Daily purchases by long-term holders, or “permanent holders,” have risen to 40,000 ETH.



Adding to the bullish sentiment, CryptoQuant reveals that large investors currently hold a record number of Ethereum, totaling 16 million ETH. This suggests whales see value in Ethereum and are actively accumulating cryptocurrency.









While the outlook for Bitcoin and Ethereum appears promising, CryptoQuant cautions that Tether’s USDT stablecoin market cap growth has decelerated significantly. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and are used to facilitate trading. CryptoQuant suggests that a lack of stablecoin liquidity could hinder a sustained price rally for Bitcoin.



Overall, CryptoQuant’s analysis paints a positive picture for Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, investors should remain mindful of potential challenges like slowing Tether growth and conduct their own due diligence before making any investment decisions.

Economic Data Fuels Bitcoin's Surge to $71,000


Bitcoin (BTC) has recently experienced a significant boom, reaching over $71,000 due to positive macroeconomic indicators and rising interest from institutional investors.
This surge, the longest in three months for the cryptocurrency, stems from anticipation of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Such adjustments could favor speculative assets like Bitcoin.
Institutional Confidence Bolsters Bitcoin’s Resurgence

Market optimism has grown regarding the Federal Reserve’s potential lowering of interest rates this year. Traders now see a higher likelihood of a rate cut as early as November.
This shift follows reports indicating slowing US inflation and a weaker jobs market, alongside notable dips in some Treasury yields. Financial conditions seem easing, which could benefit speculative investments, including cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s value hit $71,177, an over 4% increase over the last week.

Banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. predict the Federal Reserve might reduce rates as soon as next month. Despite previous skepticism in April, traders now expect stable rates until November.
However, the recent trend suggests a possible quicker adjustment. The globe’s bond market has also seen its most prolonged rally since December.
This Friday’s employment data release is pivotal before next week’s Fed rate-setting meeting. It will reveal whether traders or banking forecasters better align with the Fed’s monetary policy direction.
Amid these developments, Bitcoin attracts institutional buyers like Semler Scientific (SMLR). Pending market conditions, the healthcare company decided to make Bitcoin its primary treasury asset.
It acquired 581 Bitcoin for $40 million, bringing its total holdings to 828 Bitcoin worth $57 million. Semler Scientific views Bitcoin as a stable value store and worthwhile investment. The company appreciates its scarcity and potential as an inflation hedge.

“We believe that Bitcoin’s unique attributes discussed above not only differentiate it from fiat money, but also from other cryptocurrency assets, and for that reason, we have no plans to purchase cryptocurrency assets other than Bitcoin,” the company stated.


Additionally, crypto-focused firms are also showing optimism. Bybit, a global crypto exchange, reportedly would allow Chinese expatriates to open accounts and trade.
This move aims to meet the growing demand for secure and user-friendly crypto trading solutions among the Chinese diaspora and worldwide Chinese communities. The development occurred following reports on Wednesday suggesting that Bybit may have facilitated signup and verification processes for users located in China despite the country’s well-known ban on Bitcoin.

These activities are part of a broader pattern in which major financial organizations and crypto companies strategically position themselves to take advantage of Bitcoin’s potential. This is a strong indication of the increasing optimism regarding the future of this cryptocurrency.

Data Dive: Why Almost Every Bitcoin Holder is Winning Right Now


							

Santiment confirmed that a 98% supply of Bitcoin is currently in profit. 



ADA and MATIC have 53.5% and 35% of the supply in profit, respectively.



Ethereum (ETH) ranked second with 95% of supply in profit.




Blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported on X that nearly 98% of Bitcoin’s (BTC) total supply is currently profitable, marking substantial gains for investors since the cryptocurrency’s inception.







To clarify its methodology for readers unfamiliar with blockchain data analysis, Santiment explained:




“Think of it this way – If a BTC coin was mined and first introduced at $60K, it is considered in profit since BTC is currently valued at $70.8K. If a BTC coin was mined at $73K, then it is not. We calculate this for each coin to find the total % that are in profit vs. not in profit.”




Ethereum (ETH) follows closely behind with 95.1% of its supply in profit, along with 86.8% of Chainlink’s (LINK). Additionally, 82.2% of Dogecoin’s (DOGE) supply and 78.8% of XRP’s supply have also experienced appreciation over time.









Cardano (ADA) holds the lowest ranking among these digital assets, with 53.5% of its supply currently profitable. Polygon (MATIC) fares even worse, with only 35% of its supply in profit. Santiment attributes this to MATIC’s introduction during the 2019 bear market, terming the period of MATIC’s launch as its “handicap.”

Solana's rising trade volume has THIS impact on SOL prices - AMBCrypto



Solana’s popularity remained high as investors actively traded SOL.
A few metrics and market indicators hinted at a price increase. 

Solana [SOL] witnessed much traction in the recent past as several investors withdrew SOL to buy other Solana-ecosystem tokens. While activity around SOL remained high, its price action turned bearish in the last 24 hours.
 Let’s have a closer look at what’s going on. 
Solana’s trading volume rises
Lookonchain’s recent tweets revealed that an insider used just $1.2k worth of SOL to buy 190.2 million HULK, which accounted for 19% of the latter’s total supply. 
Soon after that, the insider sold off the recently accumulated HULK for 5,760.7 SOL, which was worth $979k. 
Another whale withdrew 8,943 SOL, worth $1.54 million, from Binance to buy 8.6 million MOTHER at $0.1789. Thanks to all these transactions, SOL’s trading volume remained high throughout the last week.
In the last 24 hours alone, SOL’s tracing volume remained at more than $2 billion. 
Meanwhile, SOL managed to push its price up by nearly 3% in the last seven days. But the trend changed in the last 24 hours as the token’s value dropped by over 1%. 
According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, Solana was trading at $171.88 with a market capitalization of over $79 billion.
Will SOL remain bearish?
To see whether SOL would continue to remain bearish, AMBCrypto then analyzed its on-chain data. We found that SOL’s weighted sentiment remained in the negative zone. This meant that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market. 
Its funding rate has increased substantially over the last few days. Nonetheless, its social volume was high, reflecting its popularity in the crypto space. 
Source: Santiment
AMBCrypto’s look at Coinglass’ data revealed a bullish metric. We found that SOL’s long/short ratio increased sharply in the last four hours. 
For starters, a high long/short ratio suggests that there are more buyers than sellers in the market, which can be inferred as a bullish signal for the token. 
Source: Coinglass
Our analysis of Solana’s daily chart also revealed a few bullish indicators. For instance, the Money Flow Index (MFI) registered a sharp uptick over the last few days. 

Read Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024-25  

Additionally, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) also followed a similar trend and went up. These suggested that the chances of SOL’s price rising were high. 
Nonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained bearish as it continued to trade under the neutral mark of 0.

Injective (INJ) Jumps by 12% Daily to $30, Bitcoin (BTC) Calms at $71K (Market Watch)


																The inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs have been nothing short of impressive in the past several days, but BTC has failed to make a major move out of its current trading range of around $70,000 to $71,000.
The altcoins are also quite sluggish on a daily basis, with BCH emerging as the top performer from the larger caps.
BTC Stalls at $71K
As reported over the weekend, the trading action during that period was quite uneventful. BTC had recovered some ground following the late Friday drop and stood at around $67,500.
However, the market picked up on Monday, and bitcoin quickly pumped to over $70,000. It failed there at first as the bears stopped the rally, but BTC was not confined and initiated another leg up that propelled an impressive rally to a multi-week peak of $71,767 amid the growing ETF inflows.
Since then, though, the asset has failed to maintain its run, even though the ETFs continue to experience substantial inflows. As of now, the cryptocurrency trades at $71,000 once again, with its market cap standing still at $1.4 trillion.

Its dominance over the altcoins has not moved either, sitting at 50.4% on CG at the time of this writing.

INJ, BRETT, JASMY on a Roll
Most of the larger-cap alts have mimicked BTC’s performance in the past few days, meaning that they sit quietly on a daily scale now, too. ETH, BNB, DOGE, SOL, SHIB, AVAX, TRX, and DOT are slightly in the red, while XRP, LINK, TON, and ADA have charted insignificant gains.
Bitcoin Cash is the only notable gainer from this cohort of assets, having jumped by 4% to $513. In contrast, FET and KAS have dropped by 3-4%.
The top 100 alts have produced a few double-digit gainers, including BRETT (26%), JASMY (13%), and INJ (12%). In fact, INJ has tapped $30 following today’s surge.
The total crypto market cap, however, has remained sluggish at $2.8 trillion on CG.

4 altcoins to buy under $1 for end of 2024


    Although many assets in the cryptocurrency market are struggling to maintain their bullish momentum, taking the lead from the market’s representative – Bitcoin (BTC) – some altcoins, still worth under $1 per wholecoin, represent a great purchase for the end of this year.



Indeed, this has been a bullish year for the majority of participants in the crypto sector, as many digital assets are recording constant increases, marked by occasional hiccups, but these four altcoins should not have many obstacles to explosive growth by late 2024.



#1 Shiba Inu (SHIB)



Specifically, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the altcoins that looks like a great investment opportunity for the end of 2024, particularly as one of its largest whales, which has profited over $120 million trading SHIB in its early days, has recently bought more than 700 SHIB tokens, demonstrating strong confidence in the meme token.

Indeed, Shiba Inu, the token in which this trader has invested more than $18 million, is currently trading at $0.00002527, down 1.09% on the day, also declining 2.40% across the previous week, but nonetheless an increase of 11.23% in the last month, as per data on June 7.

#2 XRP (XRP)



Secondly, XRP is generating optimism thanks to the continuous legal wins in the courtroom battle between blockchain company Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with one analyst suggesting its consolidation period could end with a massive breakout.







Meanwhile, the XRP token costs $0.52442, which suggests no price change on the day, a gain of 0.91% in the past week, while also accumulating an advance of 0.66% on its monthly chart, according to the most recent charts retrieved by Finbold.

#3 Dogecoin (DOGE)



Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) has shown potential reflected in heightened interest coming from the market’s largest holders, as observed by crypto expert Ali Martinez, as well as showing technical analysis (TA) indicators that point to an imminent breakout, similar to its past chart patterns.







At the moment, Dogecoin is changing hands at the price of 0.16099, recording a slight decline of 0.37% on the day while advancing 0.95% over the week, and the popular doge meme token making a positive growth of 8.55% in the last 30 days alone.

#4 Cardano (ADA)



Finally, Cardano (ADA) is currently awaiting for its next critical update – the Chang hard fork set for late June, with an aim to bost governance, functionality, and responsiveness in the bull market, which might ignite a price rally for the popular token after it takes place.



According to Cardano pioneer Charles Hoskinson, its main advantage is the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Ouroboros protocol:




“The advantage of Proof-of-Stake is that because you don’t have that gargantuan overhead and energy expenditure for deciding who gets to make a block, it means you can put a lot of your magic in the other two stages. So you end up getting protocols that are much lighter and massively more energy efficient.”




For now, Cardano is trading at the price of $0.46349, writing down a growth of 1.09% in the last 24 hours, as well as advancing 3.32% across the previous seven days, adding up to the 4.76% increase accumulated on its monthly chart, as per data on June 7.

Conclusion



Ultimately, the above four altcoins – the crypto assets other than Bitcoin – might represent a great opportunity as the year 2024 draws to its end, but things in this sector can sometimes change on a whim, so doing one’s own research and weighing all the risks is critical when investing in them.

Telegram Seeks to Disrupt App Store Model with In-App Token


							

Telegram CEO Pavel Durov announced the launch of Telegram Stars, an in-app token focused on new payment methods.



The Telegram Stars allows users to purchase digital goods and services on the platform.



The in-app token is available on both Google and Android and is compliant with their crypto sales policies.




Telegram CEO, Pavel Durov, unveiled the platform’s new payment system for digital purchases. The innovative in-app token, Telegram Stars, allows users to purchase digital goods and services directly on the platform.



In a Telegram post, Durov shared insights into the platform’s innovative development, stating, “With Telegram Stars, mini apps can now accept payments for digital services using the most seamless payment method possible – in-app purchases on Android and iOS.” The CEO added:




 “The recent mini app boom has already made Telegram the main destination to launch new apps. Stars and ad subsidies bring this to a new level – unprecedented in the history of social media.” 




Notably, Durov has elaborated on the processes involved in purchasing goods via Telegram Stars. According to his post, app developers can swap their Stars for Toncoin (TON), the native token of Telegram’s The Open Network, through Fragment. Fragment is a platform primarily used by the community to buy and sell Telegram usernames.



As reported, Telegram Stars is available on both Google and Apple platforms. Telegram’s CEO explained the in-app payment system’s compliance with Apple and Google’s digital product sale policies, stating:




 “Apple and Google take a 30% cut when users buy Stars from them, but Telegram will subsidize ads purchased with Telegram Stars. So if developers reinvest Stars in promoting their app, the overall commission will be nearly 0%. As a result, launching apps on Telegram makes more economic sense than launching traditional mobile apps.”




Subsequently, Telegram released a post detailing the terms and policies of Telegram Stars. Emphasizing that it’s just the beginning of the system, the platform added, “Future updates will bring additional features and functionality to Stars – like gifts for content creators and more.”

‘We Will Continue To Pursue Our Strategy of Purchasing Bitcoins With Cash’, Says Semler Scientific CEO | Cryptoglobe


                                
Semler Scientific, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMLR), a company at the forefront of developing technology products for healthcare providers, has announced the purchase of an additional 247 bitcoins, amounting to $17 million in cash. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 828 bitcoins, acquired at an aggregate cost of $57 million, inclusive of fees and expenses, as of 6 June 2024. This acquisition underscores Semler’s strategic initiative to incorporate Bitcoin as a key component of its financial strategy.



Semler Scientific, renowned for its innovative medical products and services, primarily markets QuantaFlo®, a rapid point-of-care test cleared by the FDA. QuantaFlo® measures arterial blood flow in the extremities, assisting in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, particularly peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The company is pursuing new 510(k) clearance to broaden QuantaFlo®’s applications, enabling healthcare providers to evaluate patients’ risks of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).



On 28 May 2024, Semler Scientific revealed its acquisition of 581 bitcoins for $40 million, including fees and expenses. This move reflects the company’s confidence in Bitcoin as a reliable store of value and an attractive investment.



Eric Semler, the company’s chairman, highlighted Bitcoin’s significance as a major asset class. He emphasized Bitcoin’s scarcity and finite supply, presenting it as a viable hedge against inflation and a safe haven amid economic uncertainties. Semler noted that Bitcoin’s digital resilience and architecture provide advantages over gold, which has a market value approximately ten times that of Bitcoin. He suggested that Bitcoin’s potential acceptance as digital gold could yield significant returns.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Semler also pointed to the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, underscored by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of 11 Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on 10 January 2024. These ETFs have garnered over $13 billion in net inflows from nearly 1,000 institutions, including global banks, pensions, endowments, and registered investment advisors. Institutions now hold over 10% of all bitcoins.



Before deciding on Bitcoin, Semler Scientific’s board and senior management evaluated various uses for their cash reserves, including acquisitions. Eric Semler explained that after considering different options, the company determined that investing in Bitcoin was the best use of its excess cash.



According to a press release issued on 6 June 2024, Dr. Doug Murphy-Chutorian, MD, Semler Scientific’s CEO, had this to say about his firm’s latest Bitcoin purchase:



“Semler remains focused on our two strategies of expanding our healthcare business and acquiring and holding bitcoin. The company now holds 828 bitcoins, underscoring our view that bitcoin is a compelling investment and can serve as a reliable store of value. We will continue to pursue our strategy of purchasing bitcoins with cash.”

This Project Developed by Coinbase Became the Largest Layer 2 Network, Surpassing the Optimism (OP) Network! Here are the Details - Bitcoin Sistemi

Base, a Layer 2 Ethereum network developed by Coinbase, has surpassed OP Mainnet to become the largest Layer 2 network in the OP Stack-based 'Superchain'.
Base Surpasses OP Mainnet to Become the Largest OP Stack-Based Layer 2 Network
According to DeFiLlama data, the network's total value locked (TVL) has increased by 20% since the beginning of May to $1.7 billion.


Base's mainnet, which went public in early August 2023, is positioned as the third most valuable Layer 2 blockchain in terms of TVL, behind Arbitrum at $3.81 billion and Blast at $2.26 billion.
This major milestone highlights Base's rapid growth and increasing adoption among decentralized applications (dapps).





The network's prominence was significantly boosted by decentralized exchange Aerodrome, which contributed $714 million in deposits. Uniswap follows as the second largest participant with $312 million.

These developments place Base at the forefront of the Superchain ecosystem, an interconnected Layer 2 rollup network built using the OP Stack software suite.


This ecosystem aims to increase the scalability and efficiency of Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain, thus reducing the load on the main Ethereum blockchain.
Optimistic rollups, including Base, Arbitrum, Blast, and OP Mainnet, work by default by assuming that all transactions are valid and validating them only when evidence of fraud is presented.





This method contrasts with zero-knowledge rollups such as zkSync, Linea, and Scroll, which provide ex ante cryptographic proofs of transaction validity.
Base's impressive growth and strategic integration within Superchain highlights its potential to drive greater innovation and scalability within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Three Reasons Why Bitcoin's (BTC) Bull Run is Yet to Escalate


																TL;DR

Bitcoin has surpassed $71,000 with a market cap of over $1.4 trillion, showing potential for further growth due to low trader euphoria (FOMO) and a stable RSI at 60.
Negative BTC exchange netflow suggests reduced selling pressure as investors move to self-custody, indicating bullish market sentiment.


No FOMO
Bitcoin (BTC) has been thriving lately, with its price surpassing the $71,000 mark and market capitalization exceeding $1.4 trillion (per CoinGecko’s data). The asset is 14% up on a monthly scale and 165% yearly, but some essential indicators signal that a further rally could be in the cards.
BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko
One such element is the lack of Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). According to the market intelligence platform Santiment, traders are not as euphoric at the moment as they were at previous peaks. 
FOMO is a psychological phenomenon characterized by the anxiety that others are having fulfilling or rewarding experiences without you. It often manifests as a compulsive desire to stay connected with what the masses are doing.
In the context of crypto, FOMO refers to the fear of missing out on potential investment gains in a particular digital asset that has been performing quite well. 




However, the phenomenon can cause people to enter the market emotionally rather than rationally. Investors might ignore necessary due diligence and investment strategies, leading to impulsive buys at high prices. This, in turn, could lead to crucial losses in the event of a severe market correction.
In many cases, FOMO has occurred during market peaks and has been followed by significant price declines. The lack of it (as of the moment) may indicate that BTC’s bull run is yet to show its full potential.
RSI 
Another metric hinting that BTC’s price may continue its uptrend in the near future is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This technical analysis tool identifies whether the asset is overbought or oversold. 
It ranges from 0 to 100, with a ratio above 70 signaling that a correction might be imminent. The latest data shows that BTC RSI is 60, crossing the aforementioned level only four times in the past 30 days. 
BTC RSI, Source: Crypto Waves
Abandoning Exchanges
Last but not least, we will touch upon the Bitcoin exchange netflow which has been predominantly negative in the last week (according to CryptoQuant’s data).
Shifting from centralized platforms to self-custody methods is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.

Cardano's Blockchain Tech Finds New Home in Argentina's Entre Ríos


							

Cardano Foundation partners with Argentina’s Entre Ríos to promote blockchain adoption.



Ethiopia’s 2021 initiative and Argentina’s 2024 partnership signal growing Cardano use in national projects.



ADA price rises 1.12% in 24 hours, highlighting market response to new partnerships.




The Cardano Foundation has announced a new partnership with the province of Entre Ríos in Argentina.



The collaboration, formalized by a public signing between Entre Ríos Governor Rogelio Frigerio and Cardano Foundation’s LATAM Lead for Business Development Rafael Fraga, aims to foster blockchain adoption within the region. This development underscores Cardano’s commitment to expanding blockchain communities and driving innovation across Latin America.







This partnership in Argentina follows a notable precedent set by Ethiopia in 2021. The Prime Minister of Ethiopia, with a background in computer engineering and transformational leadership, outlined an ambitious plan to leverage Cardano for national development.



This multifaceted initiative includes using Cardano for various applications such as voting, payments, insurance, trade, savings, and investments. The Ethiopian government’s strategic vision aims to integrate Cardano into the nation’s technological and economic infrastructure, thereby fostering a tech-driven economy.







Argentina’s decision to embrace Cardano technology highlights the potential for blockchain solutions to address local challenges and promote innovation across various sectors.



This partnership is expected to create new opportunities for technological advancement, stimulate economic growth, and improve efficiency in public and private services within the region. Additionally, it underscores the growing recognition of blockchain’s potential to drive substantial progress in developing countries.









Amid these developments, the price of Cardano (ADA) has shown a positive trend. ADA currently trades at $0.4638, with a 24-hour trading volume of $277,105,195.07. The cryptocurrency has experienced a 1.12% price increase over the past 24 hours and a 3.43% rise in the last seven days. These price movements reflect a growing interest and confidence in Cardano’s potential as a transformative technology.



Analysts attribute this upward trend to the recent strategic partnerships and growing adoption of Cardano’s blockchain solutions in various national projects. The increasing use of Cardano for real-world applications has likely strengthened investor sentiment, further driving the cryptocurrency’s market performance.

Robert Kiyosaki's Bold Bitcoin Prediction: $350,000 By August "Is Not A Lie" | Bitcoinist.com


								Amidst a confluence of market optimism and favorable conditions, popular Bitcoin investor and acclaimed author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” Robert Kiyosaki in a striking forecast has predicted that BTC will reach an astonishing $350,000 by August this year.
This projection from Kiyosaki demonstrates his robust belief in the largest cryptocurrency asset by market cap as a store of value and a promising alternative investment during times of economic uncertainties.
Impending Massive Gains For Bitcoin
The “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author, Robert Kiyosaki shared the intriguing forecast for Bitcoin on the X (formerly Twitter) platform. His forecast comes at a time when optimism and technological developments are supporting the cryptocurrency industry, indicating that Bitcoin may be ready for historically high increases in the months to come.

According to Kiyosaki, the value of BTC will be $350,000 by August 25, 2024, and this is not a lie. Rather it is a prediction, a speculation, and an opinion, as he believes no forecast about the future is false. Kiyosaki further underscored his desire for the crypto asset to reach the aforementioned target. “I want $350,000 Bitcoin to be a fact, and I want it to be true, but it is only a prediction,” he stated.
While the author is confident BTC will reach $350,000 sometime in the year, it is only a target, a wish, and a dream. This is due to the uncertainty and volatility surrounding digital assets, as their trajectory can not be fully determined. Despite all of this, Kiyosaki has highlighted his dedication to acquiring more BTC and other notable cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), citing his belief in these assets to attract significant gains in the near future continuously.
The author’s major purpose in making such a move is due to his confidence in the incompetence of the current leaders in the United States such as the country’s President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin, and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome H Powell.
Kiyosaki claims in actuality these leaders of the nation are the 3-Stooges, and he is very positive they are completely incompetent. Thus he has urged the community and his followers to protect themselves from these 3-Stooges by purchasing more BTC, Ethereum, Solana, Gold, and Silver.
Strong Belief In BTC’s Value Growth
Distinguished for his book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Robert Kiyosaki has been an outspoken supporter of Bitcoin, citing several price targets over time. In April, Kiyosaki publicly expressed his alignment with Ark Invest’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Cathie Wood’s audacious forecast for Bitcoin to reach $2.3 million.

Wood claims by putting more than 19% of the world’s assets, worth a staggering $250 trillion into BTC, it could soar to an all-time high of $2.3 million. Although this forecast seems unreasonable, Kiyosaki is confident about the prediction because he believes Wood is exceptionally clever and has sound judgment.

Arthur Hayes adjusts Bitcoin outlook: Predicts surge following rate cuts - AMBCrypto



Hayes tips a BTC break out as central banks start cutting interest rates. 
However, the Fed’s meeting on 12th June could help define the next BTC price direction. 

Bitcoin [BTC] could be primed for a bullish breakout from its months-long range as major central banks start cutting interest rates, per BitMEX founder and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes. 
Hayes had earlier projected that the breakout could happen in August. However, he has adjusted his outlook following rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BOC). 
‘The June central banking fireworks kicked off this week by the BOC and ECB rate cuts will catapult crypto out of the northern hemispheric summer doldrums’ 
This will mark the start of central bank ‘easing cycles’, and the US will forced to jump in, per Hayes. As a result, the executive nudged, 
“Go long Bitcoin and subsequently sh*tcoins. The macro landscape has changed vs. my baseline. Therefore, my strategy shall change as well.”
Macro outlook and key catalysts
BTC has been holding above $70K for the past two days and was poised to flirt with $72K or the March ATH if key macro events in the next few days play out in its favour. 
Most market watchers opined that Bitcoin could set a definite price direction after the Fed’s meeting next Wednesday (12th June). 
Recently, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, summarized the macro outlook and stated, 
‘The market needs conviction that Powell is going to cut in July. That could come from a weak jobs report Friday, weak CPI and/or dovish Fed next Wednesday.”
However, even if the Fed doesn’t cut immediately, the US mitigation against the massive fall in the Japanese Yen’s value could induce more money supply and lead to the same outcome, per Hayes. 
Reacting to a reported Japan’s offloading of US treasuries to boost its Yen, Hayes noted that, 
‘Uh oh, Bad Gurl Yellen got some work to do. $JPY must strengthen to prevent the UST apocalypse.’
Already, the surge in the US money supply has begun in earnest, and most analysts expect it to boost BTC and overall risk assets. 
In the meantime, BTC Open Interest (OI) rates have spiked to a record high, demonstrating a massive influx of liquidity into the king coin. Crypto derivative tracking platform Coinglass noted, 
‘#Bitcoin open interest hits all-time high of $37.66B’
Source: Coinglass
The OI spike underscores bullish expectations for the king coin. That said, more momentum and direction could be set next week after the Fed’s decision.

Meme Dream Come True: Investor Turns $777k Into $9.4M In Just 8 Days Betting On Iggy Azalea's Coin - Benzinga

A trader is laughing all the way to the bank after having invested in a memecoin themed on Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, the latest in the growing fad of celebrity-endorsed cryptocurrencies.What Happened: According to an X post by on-chain tracking platform Lookonchain on Thursday, the investor invested $777,000 to buy 50.35 million of the token, called MOTHER, from the period between May 29 and June 1.In 8 days, his stash ballooned to $9.4 million, netting an eye-popping profit of 1110%. As of this writing, he continues to HODL, indicating that he is still bullish on the token.See Also: GameStop-Themed Cryptocurrency Surges Following Roaring Kitty’s Social Media ActivityThe token has been trending hot on social platforms since the rapper began aggressively pushing it via her official X account. Since its launch last week, the Solana SOL/USD-based memecoin has amassed a market cap of more than $213 million, according to CoinMarketCap. In the last 24 hours, it gained 37%, with trading volume rising by 159% to $211 million. Why It Matters: The success of the MOTHER token comes amidst criticism of celebrity cryptocurrencies by Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin has expressed his disapproval of the meme coin frenzy and urged the community to push “things in a better direction.”However, the MOTHER token’s performance contrasts with other celebrity-themed coins like the Hulk Hogan-themed HULK, which lost $15M in market cap in minutes after some insider pulled off a pump-and-dump strategy.Another coin, promoted by reality TV star and former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, saw steady gains of 17% over the week, after cratering from the initial euphoria.Read Next: Former Federal Agents Rally Demand For Release Of Detained Binance Executive In Nigeria, Urge State Secretary Blinken To Step Up EffortsPhoto via Shutterstock

Can XRP Break Out of Its Slump? All Eyes on Crypto Regulations


							

Global regulations could unlock XRP’s potential, shaping its journey in the crypto landscape.



Technical analysis hints at consolidation for XRP, with potential bullish momentum awaiting.



Investors await clarity on regulatory developments to gauge XRP’s future amid legal uncertainties.




The cryptocurrency sector is on the verge of potentially transformative global regulatory developments, with Ripple and its associated cryptocurrency, XRP, at the center of this evolving narrative. Clearer regulatory frameworks could significantly impact XRP’s trajectory, potentially boosting its adoption and usability in the financial sector.



Regulatory clarity is crucial for XRP, given its association with Ripple, a company focused on revolutionizing cross-border payments. Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over XRP’s classification as a security underscores the need for definitive regulations. Transparent rules could resolve these ambiguities, fostering a more stable operating environment for XRP.



However, the actual impact on XRP’s adoption and price depends on the specific nature of the regulations implemented. Restrictive laws could inhibit growth, whereas supportive regulations could accelerate the cryptocurrency’s progress.



Turning to market indicators, XRP currently shows signs of consolidation. It is trading at $0.5237, having dipped 0.06% over the last day. Technical analysis reveals that the 20-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are positioned above the current price. This alignment might indicate a short to medium-term downtrend or market consolidation.







Source: TradingView



Additionally, trading volume has fluctuated, with notable spikes suggesting increased trading activity during significant price movements. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) presents a potential bullish crossover, hinting at increasing buying momentum, though with overall low momentum suggested by its proximity to the zero line.









The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 50, reflecting neutral market momentum. This indicator suggests that the market is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a balanced but undecided trading environment.



If XRP maintains its consolidation phase and shows growing momentum, a breakout above the SMAs could signal a bullish trend reversal. Such a move could push XRP towards higher resistance levels, potentially around $0.60. Conversely, a breakdown below recent lows might see it testing lower support levels.

Crypto traders eye Memeinator (MMTR) amid bullish projections for Bitcoin - CoinJournal



                    

                    
Analysts are bullish on Bitcoin, Ethereum as prices hover above $71k and 3.8k respectively.
The outlook has investors eyeing new gems, with Memeinator (MMTR) potentially top target among memecoins.

Crypto traders have seen a massive run for memecoins over the past month or so. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spiked above $70,000 this week and has analysts projecting further gains amid unprecedented spot ETFs inflows.
While the current political buzz has several meme coins going parabolic, Memeinator (MMTR), a new market entrant, is among those likely to outperform in coming months largely due to its strong utility.
Bitcoin and crypto reacts to ECB rate cut
Crypocurrencies rose slightly as the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates for the first time in five years. Market experts say the Fed and other central banks will soon follow this trend, aiding the long term outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) amid cheap money flow.
This week also saw reports emerge that Franklin Templeton, a $1.6 trillion asset manager, is looking to launch a crypto fund that will give investors exposure to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The fund will target institutional investors, The Information reported.
But notable from this is that crypto is on the ascendancy when it comes to the adoption curve, and recent traction in the spot ETFs market points to this.
For instance, Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $488 million on June 5, and $218 million on June 6. Over the past three days, net inflows have reached over $1.5 billion.
Analysts’ bullish price predictions for BTC, ETH
While prices have largely remained ranged for BTC and ETH, analysts are bullish on what’s next. Standard Chartered analysts this week projected Bitcoin could hit $100,000 ahead of the upcoming US election.
The Fear & Greed Index, currently at 78 and showing extreme greed suggests traders are confident, while open interest is at a historic $38 billion
Similar sentiment surrounds ETH. The total ETH futures Open Interest is currently over $16.6 billion as traders target the spot Ethereum ETF trading debut. 
VanEck analysts recently noted that Ethereum price could rise to over $22k by 2030.
Crypto outlook and new gems like Memeinator (MMTR)
As top cryptocurrencies dominate bullish price predictions, analysts are also highlighting memecoins, AI tokens and the emerging Bitcoin-Fi (DeFi on Bitcoin) ecosystem as areas likely to see an epic bull market.
While the likes of Pepe and Floki have memecoin traders bolstering positions, Memeinator (MMTR) offers a new opportunity.
Memeinator recently made its trading debut after successfully navigating its presale. The project aims to be the top utility-focused meme coin, riding an ecosystem that includes a play-to-earn model, NFT marketplace and staking.
These features have Memeinator poised as one of the meme coins with a solid outlook in its growth trajectory. A big plus for Memeinator could be the upcoming launch of meme-inspired game Meme Warfare.
Although the token’s debut coincided with a broader dip for altcoins, MMTR price is above a key level.

Insider trader turns $1,000 to $1 million in three hours


    The crypto market rally of 2024 has already featured many of the hallmarks of a cryptocurrency bull market, including the release of multiple new coins and tokens, a new all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin (BTC), and various stories of rapid wealth-building.



The most recent of the rags-to-riches stories came late on June 6 when data from Solscan revealed that an insider acquired more than 190 million Hulkmania (HULK) – 19% of the total circulating supply – at the cost of just 7.1 Solana (SOL), worth $1,200 at the time. 



The trade enabled them to, within a mere three hours, sell the 190 million HULK for more than 5,760 SOL – worth just under $1 million at the time.







 In total, the investment returned more than 81,000% and grew about 812 times, per the calculation published on X by Lookonchain.



A side-effect of the selling was that it drove the price of the HULK token into the ground, reducing the value of the cryptocurrency by some 85%.

The meme coin continued plummeting after the incident, and the mystery surrounding HULK only deepened as Hulk Hogan himself made an Instagram post claiming that his X account was compromised and urging fans to disregard any cryptocurrency-related posts.



Solana remains popular for new projects



Throughout 2024, Solana has been a highly popular blockchain for the launch of new cryptocurrencies thanks to its consistent uptime, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.



The native token of the Solana blockchain SOL has also benefitted from significant enthusiasm, driven in part by its market performance.



Indeed, the token saw a rapid rise in late 2023 when it rocketed from about $20 in October to above $100 on New Year’s Day, and its strong performance continued into 2024.



Following the rise – which, by the time of publication, amounted to 69.63% on the year-to-date (YTD) chart – Solana price today reached $171.96.

The risks and rewards of a crypto bull market



Despite the other highly successful trades – which have seen various investors make hundreds of thousands, millions even within just hours – it is worth noting that caution remains highly important in the crypto market.



Along with the string of positive news and developments, the 2024 bull market has featured its fair share of mishaps and scams.



A team member behind the meme coin Slerf (SLERF), for example, accidentally burned some $10 million worth of investments shortly after launch while the team behind CondomSol seemingly pulled off an old-fashioned rug pull.

Crypto Analyst Charles Edwards Explains Why Bitcoin Has Not Hit $100K Already | Cryptoglobe


                                
On 7 June 2024, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, shared an insightful thread on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), discussing the current state and future prospects of Bitcoin’s price. 



Edwards is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, known for his technical analysis and investment strategies. He is the founder of Capriole Investments, a digital asset hedge fund focused on outperforming Bitcoin through quantitative strategies and stringent risk management.  Edwards’ expertise covers a broad range of topics within the crypto industry, including valuation metrics, technical analysis, and macroeconomic conditions. 



Edwards began by questioning why Bitcoin hadn’t yet reached $100,000, despite significant institutional activity. He noted that since the launch of US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11, these ETFs have acquired 200% of the Bitcoin mined during this period. With Bitcoin’s price up 50% to $71,000 since the ETFs’ inception, he acknowledged the notable growth but highlighted that many expected more substantial gains. 



Next, Edwards discussed the influence of long-term holders on Bitcoin’s price. He explained that the share of Bitcoin held by long-term holders (those who have held their assets for more than two years) has decreased from 57% in December 2023 to 54% as of June 2024. While a 3% decrease might seem minor, Edwards pointed out that this equates to approximately 630,000 Bitcoins being sold. This selling pressure from seasoned holders counteracts the buying pressure from new institutional investments, contributing to the slower-than-expected price increase.







            
            

            
            

            
            

        

Edwards also highlighted that the effects of the recent Bitcoin Halving, which occurred in April, have not yet been fully realized. The Halving event reduced Bitcoin’s daily issuance by 50%, meaning fewer new Bitcoins are being introduced into circulation. He predicted that over the next year, the difference between spot ETF demand and Bitcoin supply will grow significantly, as institutional processes for investment often require several quarters to complete. This delayed response could lead to more pronounced price movements in the future as the supply squeeze tightens.



In the final part of his thread, Edwards outlined three key factors that could drive strong price appreciation for Bitcoin: increased daily buying by ETFs, reduced selling by long-term holders, and growth in US liquidity. He emphasized that for substantial price growth, at least one of these conditions would need to be met. Edwards expressed optimism that these factors would align over the coming months, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price could see more significant upward momentum as these dynamics play out.



At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $71,027, up 69.13% since the start of the year.

Injective (INJ) Price Set To Skyrocket 33% On Bullish Signal


																In an analysis shared on X, renowned crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom) forecasts a significant 33% rise in the price of Injective (INJ) based on a classic bullish chart pattern known as the inverted head and shoulders (iH&S). The chart suggests a strong reversal possibility from recent bearish trends, potentially steering the cryptocurrency’s price to new local highs.
Injective Price Prepares For Lift-Off
The iH&S pattern, prominently featured in Olszewicz’s chart, is a revered formation among technical analysts for predicting bullish reversals following a downward trend. This pattern is identified by three troughs: the middle trough (head) being the deepest and flanked by two shallower troughs (shoulders), which are approximately of similar depth.

	Related Reading


On the chart, the left shoulder forms around mid-April, dipping below $23.50. The head is seen in May, dropping to a low near $21.08. The formation completes with the right shoulder in early June, reaching down around $23.90, mirroring the left shoulder.

The neckline, which is a key component in this pattern, is drawn across the peaks that connect the shoulders and the head. On Olszewicz’s chart, this line is positioned at approximately $28.70. A breakout above this neckline is typically interpreted as confirmation of the pattern’s completion and an impending bullish trend. According to the chart, the price of INJ is about to break above this critical threshold.
The analyst’s chart also integrates the Ichimoku Cloud, which provides a dynamic look at potential support and resistance areas. Presently, the price of INJ is hovering near the lower edge of a red cloud, indicating an upcoming resistance zone, which traders might watch closely.

	Related Reading


Further enriching the analysis are the Fibonacci extension levels drawn from the lowest point of the head to the neckline of the iH&S pattern. These levels project potential price targets if the bullish breakout is confirmed. The 1.618 Fibonacci extension is marked at $34.74, and a more ambitious 2.0 extension reaches $39.09. These targets represent potential resistance levels where traders might take profits, hence they are crucial for understanding possible future price movements.
Josh Olszewicz’s reliance on the iH&S pattern combined with other technical indicators such as the Ichimoku Cloud and Fibonacci extensions presents a comprehensive view. This analysis suggests that INJ’s price could escalate towards $34.74 and might even extend to $39.09, marking a 33% increase from the current price.
Investors and traders need to monitor INJ’s price movement closely, keeping an eye on trading volumes and market sentiment which could either accelerate or hinder the predicted bullish momentum.
At press time, INJ traded at $29.51.

GameStop Reports Missed Q1 Results Early, Before Roaring Kitty's Livestream - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) has disclosed its financial results for the first quarter of 2024, ending May 4. The company reported net sales of $0.882 billion, a significant drop from the $1.237 billion reported in the same quarter of the previous year.



This decline in net sales was accompanied by a reduction in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which decreased to $295.1 million from $345.7 million in the prior year’s first quarter. However, the SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 33.5%, up from 27.9% in the previous year.



The earnings were released earlier than expected, and the timing is interesting as Keith Gill, one of the key figures of the GameStop short squeeze, is set to return to YouTube with a live stream, with many expecting the price of the stock to surge shortly again.



GameStop’s First Quarter Performance



The net loss for the quarter was $32.3 million, an improvement from the $50.5 million net loss in the first quarter of 2023. The company ended the quarter with $1.083 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and maintained limited long-term debt, primarily a low-interest, unsecured term loan from the French government’s COVID-19 response.



The gross profit for the quarter was $244.5 million, down from $287.3 million in the previous year. The operating loss narrowed to $50.6 million from $58.4 million, reflecting the company’s efforts to manage costs amidst declining sales. Despite these efforts, the company’s overall financial health remains a concern, with significant reductions in key areas such as net sales and gross profit.





GameStop Misses Revenue and EPS Expectations in Q1



When comparing GameStop’s current performance against expectations, the results are mixed. Analysts had anticipated an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.045 and revenue of $1.05 billion for the quarter. However, the actual EPS came in at -$0.11, significantly below expectations, and the revenue of $0.882 billion also fell short of the forecasted $1.05 billion.



This shortfall in revenue and higher-than-expected losses per share indicates that the company is facing more significant challenges than anticipated. The decline in sales across all segments, including hardware and accessories, software, and collectibles, underscores the difficulties in maintaining market share and revenue growth in a competitive and evolving industry.



The gap between expectations and actual performance highlights the need for GameStop to reassess its strategies and address the underlying issues affecting its financial health. Despite the cost-cutting measures, the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales suggests that the company needs to find more effective ways to streamline operations and improve efficiency. The lower-than-expected revenue also points to potential weaknesses in the company’s market positioning and product offerings, which need to be addressed to meet future expectations.



GameStop Did Not Provide Specific Guidance for Upcoming Quarters



Looking ahead, GameStop’s guidance remains cautious. The company has not provided specific financial guidance for the upcoming quarters, reflecting the uncertainty in the market and the challenges it faces. However, the management has emphasized the importance of strategic and transformation initiatives aimed at improving profitability and sales growth. The focus will be on expanding technology expertise, enhancing retail and e-commerce experiences, and managing cost reduction initiatives effectively.



The company’s liquidity position, with over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities, provides some cushion to navigate through the current challenges. However, the significant decrease in current assets from $2.25 billion to $1.87 billion and the reduction in total assets from $3.07 billion to $2.58 billion indicate that GameStop needs to stabilize its financial position and work towards sustainable growth.

The First Step Act may not apply to SBF or Ryan Salame


While Protos, along with other media outlets, was quick to point out that the Donald Trump-era law the ‘First Step Act’ could be a road to early release for Sam Bankman-Fried, Ryan Salame, and other first-time, nonviolent offenders, it turns out that the law is less about ‘the letter of the law’ than it is about a judge’s discretion.
Indeed, if we take a look at a previous example of a massive financial fraudster attempting to use the act to get early release, it seems incredibly unlikely that Bankman-Fried or Salame can expect to have a significant amount of time shaved off their sentences.
What is the First Step Act?
Though it’s been repeatedly discussed, it’s worth going over some of the minutiae of the First Step Act. The main point of contention regarding the act is that inmates can, possibly, get out of prison in half of the time they’ve been sentenced to. However, it’s important to note that there are many caveats.
First of all, while a former federal prosecutor told CNN that Bankman-Fried could possibly shave 12.5 years off his sentence, it’s simply not clear that’s true. Buried within the details of the bill is a section that describes ineligible prisoners, specifically “Section 1030(a)(1), relating to fraud and related activity in connection with computers.”
Bankman-Fried was found guilty of wire fraud, securities fraud, and commodities fraud, all seemingly revolving around computers and his trading.
This doesn’t mean that he can’t take any time off his sentence whatsoever: federal prisoners are still eligible to take off over 50 days a year if they involve themselves with programs to reduce recidivism and don’t cause problems while incarcerated. In this sense, Bankman-Fried will likely be able to knock a few years off of his 25-year sentence.
No matter how you look at it, a major factor will be whether or not a judge believes at some point that Bankman-Fried has repented for his actions, served enough time in prison, and is no longer a threat to society. It remains to be seen if or when this metric will be met.

Bad news for Bankman-Fried and Salame
On that note, the outlook for both felons seems less than optimistic. Bankman-Fried is guilty of one of the largest frauds in history and Salame, as he’s stated on X (formerly Twitter) himself, is charged with the “largest case of campaign finance fraud in American history.” These are prime examples of when individual cases can be used to prove a point to the public at large.
Similar to Bankman-Fried, Samuel Israel III led a massive financial fraud, bilking investors out of $450 million in the late 1990s. After serving 11 years of a 22-year sentence, Israel attempted to utilize the First Step Act to get early release in 2019.
Unfortunately for him, this request was denied, with the judge saying “It would make a mockery of the sentencing statute if this financial fraudster, who ruined the lives and finances of hundreds of people while living the high life of an ostensibly successful hedge fund manager, were to have his sentence reduced.”
With that in mind, it’s difficult to imagine that either Bankman-Fried or Salame would see a dramatic reduction in their sentences.

Meme Coin Mom Vs. Ethereum Dad: Did Iggy Azalea Just Shade Vitalik Buterin? - Benzinga

Rapper and composer Iggy Azalea, who launched the MOTHER MOTHER/USD token on the Solana SOL/USD blockchain, recently took a jab at Ethereum ETH/USD co-founder Vitalik Buterin. What Happened: Azalea posted a meme depicting herself holding a baby with Buterin's face, along with the caption, "he was just hangry (sic)."This mockery came in response to Buterin’s critical remarks about the trend of celebrity meme coins, where he expressed his disapproval of the “financialization as a final product” premise driving many of these projects.Commenting on Azalea’s post, Hayden Adams, CEO of Uniswap UNI/USD said, “No issues with memecoins or celebcoins – I think there's value to memetic attention and it's cool to create markets for it. That said, the underlying purpose and value of the tech goes way beyond financial games. And the best builders in the space are motivated by positive social change. Iggy could have responded positively and used profits to donate to a social cause or something. Instead, she condescends the best builder in the entire space, proving his point.”Also Read: Bitcoin Could Reach $150K By Year-End If Trump Wins: Standard CharteredOver the past week, the MOTHER token has experienced a dramatic surge, increasing in value by 1305.7% and reaching a market capitalization of over $200 million.

Coinbase exchange’s layer-2 scaling solution, Base, has outranked many of its peers on sustained growth since the start of this year. According to data from DeFiLlama, the Base Total Value Locked (TVL) has now jumped to its all-time high (ATH) in value at $1.784 billion. Base crossed the $1 billion milestone earlier in March.Base-Optimism flipIn relation to their relative ages, Base is a relatively newer protocol compared to Optimism. However, the emergence of Base came with a very defined embrace that has helped it keep up pace with growth figures.While it currently boasts of a TVL ATH of $1.78 billion, Optimism has only managed to rake in $878.62 million. Though Base was designed using the OP Stack, both layer-2 protocols currently operate on a very different adoption rhythm. On Base, the largest application is Aerodrome with a TVL of over $712 million. This protocol is also deployed on Optimism, however, with $147.01 million in value locked. The other intersecting application in the top five for both Optimism and Base is Uniswap. Again, the TVL of Uniswap on Base is $314 million, while that of Optimism comes in at $73.97 million.The OP Stack ecosystem itself is bigger than the duo of Base and Optimism, with other DeFi, gaming and media protocols designed using the technology. Popular examples on this front include opBNB, Farcaster and Zora Network, among others.While each of these protocols has recorded impressive growths over the past year, Base remains in the lead, per current data.OP Stack and growth hurdlesDespite the growth of Base and its recognition on the market, the protocol still faces significant backlash from critics. Most of the conversation in this regard hinges on the emergence of meme coins with a very short shelf life.Activities on Base have often forced network congestion that generally leads to a halt in the Coinbase ecosystem as a whole. The OP Stack ecosystem is also known to suffer attacks, with Sonne Finance’s $20 million exploit one of the latest in the ecosystem.

Bitcoin Whales Stockpile Despite Lackluster Market Performance


							

Major cryptocurrencies have shown minimal price movement in recent months.



Large investors (“whales”) are accumulating Bitcoin at a rapid pace.



The lack of price movement creates uncertainty about the market’s future direction.




In a recent tweet, influential crypto analyst CryptoGodfatha highlighted the lackluster performance of several major cryptocurrencies since his predictions in March.







On March 14, 2024, CryptoGodfatha tweeted a list of cryptocurrencies to watch in 2024, noting their then-current prices: Bitcoin at $73,000, Ethereum at $4,000, Solana at $165, Ston at $4.10, Wrapped Filecoin (WFIL) at $3.00, Dogecoin at $0.168, and Sui at $1.643. His message was succinct: “Eyes on these for 2024.”



In his latest tweet, CryptoGodfatha compared those prices to current values: Bitcoin at $71,000, Ethereum at $3,800, Solana at $170, Terra at $7.43, Wrapped Filecoin at $3.26, Dogecoin at $0.16, and Sui at $1.12. The comparison reveals minimal price movement for most assets, signaling a period of stagnation.



“Not much growth since March,” he commented on the disappointing performance. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has dropped slightly from $73,000 to $71,000. Ethereum also saw a small decrease from $4,000 to $3,800.



Solana, a top altcoin, experienced a minor increase from $165 to $170. Terra, not included in the March tweet but added to the latest update, stood at $7.43. Wrapped Filecoin saw a slight rise from $3.00 to $3.26, while Dogecoin and Sui declined slightly from $0.168 to $0.16 and $1.643 to $1.12, respectively.Despite this stagnation, a recent CryptoQuant weekly report indicates that large investors, known as “whales,” are accumulating Bitcoin at a pace similar to that seen before the 2020 bull run. The firm’s data reveals daily injections of $1 billion into Bitcoin and a significant increase in holdings by these whales.

How Telegram Stars Enhances Mini Apps Like Notcoin


Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has introduced “Telegram Stars,” an in-app token designed to streamline the purchase of digital goods and services. This new feature broadens Telegram’s scope from a secure messaging platform to an expansive digital marketplace.
Telegram Stars facilitates transactions within the app’s ecosystem. Users can obtain these tokens through in-app purchases on platforms like Apple, Google, or PremiumBot. 
How Telegram Plans to Enhance Its Ecosystem Through Stars

Users spend these Stars on digital products, including e-books, online courses, and items for Telegram games.
Compliant with Apple and Google’s policies on digital sales, Telegram Stars aims for a seamless integration into mobile app stores. Furthermore, Telegram plans to allow developers to convert earnings from their bots into Toncoin (TON), enhancing the versatility of these digital tokens.
Read more: What Are Telegram Bot Coins?

Telegram Stars strategically enhances the visibility and usage of mini-apps like Notcoin, which do not require installation. Users can utilize Stars to conduct transactions within such mini-apps, and developers can also use Stars to promote their apps on Telegram.

“Apple and Google take a 30% commission when users buy Stars from them, but Telegram will subsidize ads purchased with Telegram Stars. So if developers reinvest Stars in promoting their app, the overall commission will be nearly 0%,” Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, explained.

The influence of these innovations is evident in the crypto market, particularly with Notcoin (NOT). It is currently trading at $0.022, up by 4.17% in the past 24 hours. 
Although the short-term impact on its price has been minimal, Notcoin has climbed into the top 60 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Earlier this week, Notcoin briefly made it to the list of top 50 cryptocurrencies.

The rapid success of Notcoin is backed by significant support from Durov himself. Earlier this month, he noted that assets in his account, initially worth $6.8 million, appreciated fourfold within two weeks, reaching nearly $25 million. 

Durov’s strategy involves holding these tokens with the expectation that their value will increase by 100 times. He targets a staggering $680 million valuation for his Notcoin portfolio.
Durov has praised Notcoin’s growth, declaring it “the largest cryptocurrency community in the history of social media.” He also highlighted the advantages of Telegram’s large user base and scalability for deploying crypto applications.

As Notcoin gains momentum, achieving record trading volumes and market cap milestones, it highlights Telegram’s transformation into a key platform for crypto solutions.

Whale activity spikes on Solana amid Roaring Kitty's GME update - AMBCrypto



Whales accumulated large amounts of GME and KITTY after Roaring Kitty’s announcements.
Activity on the Solana network surged while revenue generated declined.

The attention around GameStop stock jumped sharply on Thursday after Keith Gill, a popular online investor known as RoaringKitty shared an update on his significant investment in the company.
GameStop won’t stop
Gill revealed on Reddit that his holdings in GameStop stock and options weren valued at a combined total of $586 million. He also announced a livestream on YouTube scheduled for 7th June.
This update sent GameStop shares soaring by 47% by the end of the trading day on 6th June.
Interestingly, the surge in GameStop stock wasn’t contained to just the traditional stock market. The excitement rippled through the digital asset market as well.
Solana-based meme token GME, inspired by GameStop but with no official connection to the company, surged more than 80% over the past 24 hours according to CoinGecko data.
This jump came even though the broader cryptocurrency market was pulling back. Similarly, the micro-cap AMC token, which shares the name of the struggling movie theater chain AMC but has no affiliation with it, also jumped by 83%.
Additionally, the KITTY token on the Solana network also grew by 108.73% over the last 24 hours.
Source: CoinMarketCap
Whales also began accumulating large amounts of these tokens. According to Lookonchain’s data, a trader spent 6,460 SOL amounting to $1.1 million to buy GME and KITTY on the Solana network.
Specifically, the trader spent 5000 SOL amounting to $850,000 to buy 35.99 million GME at $0.02362 and 1,460 SOL which came up to $248,000 to buy 8.6 million KITTY at $0.02891.
Source: X
How is Solana doing?
Sustained whale interest can cause the price of these tokens to surge even further, which may attract more investors to buy these tokens.
Solana will be the network that would gain the most from this memecoin mania. Due to the cheap fees on the Solana network, most users opt for Solana while making these kinds of tokens to capitalize on these crypto trends.
AMBCrypto’s analysis of the token terminal’s data revealed that the number of active addresses on the Solana network grew by 23.0% over the past month.
Despite the surge in price, the overall revenue generated by Solana had declined by 37.6% during the same period.

Next Ethereum Upgrade Pectra Is Set To Be 'The Largest' Ever


								Christine Kim, a researcher at Galaxy Digital, has labeled the forthcoming Ethereum upgrade known as Prague-Electra aka Pectra as “possibly the largest in Ethereum’s history.” In a thread on X, Kim laid out the code changes and highlighted how Pectra could fundamentally alter Ethereum’s operational and security paradigms.
Why Ethereum Pectra’s Uprade Is Massive
Pectra follows the successful implementation of the Dencun upgrade, which was rolled out in March 2023, marking it as the next significant advancement for the Ethereum network. It integrates a variety of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that target key aspects of network functionality from cryptographic enhancements to system efficiency improvements. Here’s a closer look at each the Prague changes:

EIP-2537: This EIP aims to add operations for the BLS12-381 curve as a precompile. This move is crucial for performing operations like BLS signature verification, enhancing security through more robust cryptographic proofs, and facilitating better interoperability with the Ethereum Beacon Chain.
EIP-2935: Authored by Vitalik Buterin and others, EIP-2935 proposes to store the last 8192 block hashes in storage slots of a system contract. This allows for stateless execution and is a foundational step toward the upcoming Verkle trees upgrade, which aims to drastically reduce state size and improve network scalability.



EIP-7685: Authored by Lightclient, this proposal introduces a general-purpose bus for sharing EL triggered requests with the CL. Its implementation is expected to streamline the process of code testing and the deployment of execution-triggered requests, such as those related to consensus layer changes.
EOF (Ethereum Object Format): This is a collection of 10 EIPs that revamp how EVM bytecode is processed. The expected result is an improvement in the dapp developer experience by making smart contract code execution more efficient, logically sound, consistent, and upgradeable.
EIP-7702: Proposed by Vitalik Buterin, Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, and Matt Garnett, this EIP aims to introduce a new transaction type that allows setting the code for an Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) during a transaction. This could significantly enhance user experience by enabling transaction batching, sponsored transactions, and more flexible control over EOAs.

Several key EIPs have been confirmed for the Electra part of the upgrade, addressing crucial aspects of validator operations and system efficiency:

EIP-6110: This EIP proposes providing validator deposits as a list of deposit operations added to the Execution Layer block. This change simplifies the validator experience by removing the need for deposit voting, reducing client software complexity, and decreasing the delay between submitting a deposit transaction and its processing on the consensus layer.



EIP-7002: Authored by Danny Ryan and others, this allows validators to trigger exits and partial withdrawals using their execution layer withdrawal credentials, enhancing the design of trustless staking pools.
EIP-7251 and EIP-7549: These proposals focus on optimizing validator balance configurations and improving the efficiency of attestations within blocks, which could reduce network bandwidth requirements and enhance overall security.

Uncertainties And Timeline
Kim also revealed that “alongside EIPs confirmed for Pectra, devs are also working on a few parallel initiatives like PeerDAS, history expiry, and light client development. Depending on how these go, we could see new EIPs included in Pectra later on.”
She highlights that multiple EIPs are currently being staged for implementation on development networks (devnets), which marks a shift in the Ethereum governance process. This strategic staging allows the community to adjust the upgrade scope based on real-world testing outcomes, ensuring robustness and stability before full deployment.
The active involvement of the Ethereum developer community is crucial, with ongoing discussions, testing, and feedback shaping the final configuration of the Pecta upgrade. The next stages involve further devnet implementations and community reviews, with the potential for some EIPs to be deferred to subsequent upgrades depending on their readiness and impact assessment.
Finally, “it’s unclear how large or small Pectra will actually end up being given that devs aren’t sure what EIPs will be activated together and what they’ll activate separately,” Kim concluded. Ethereum’s core development team has set a target to deploy the Pectra upgrade by the first quarter of 2025.
At press time, ETH traded at $3,807.

BTC Futures Positions Top Record $37B as Analysts Predict Bitcoin Surge to $83K

Bitcoin could be primed for a surge to $83,000, according to analysis by 10x Research. The breakout is contingent on BTC moving above $72,000 to complete an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern in which an asset experiences three price troughs with the middle one being the deepest. This pattern suggests it is "only a matter of time" before the BTC price reaches a new high, 10x founder Markus Thielen said. A breakout above $72,000, a mere 1% climb above its current price of around $71,300, may hinge on U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, scheduled for release at 08:30 ET. Weak data may strengthen the case for Fed interest-rate cuts, adding to upward momentum in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe updates his altcoin portfolio


    After going all-in on altcoins four weeks ago, professional crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe has shaken up his altcoin portfolio, removing some of the cryptocurrencies he considered underperforming to replace them with better alternatives that could offer a better return on investment (ROI).



Indeed, van de Poppe explained that altcoins suffered due to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but that some of them provided opportunities for strong gains, in a video streamed on his YouTube channel on June 6.



Altcoins out: ATOM and CRV



Specifically, one of the altcoins that the crypto expert has removed from his portfolio is Cosmos (ATOM), which he said was “fundamentally really strong but hasn’t been performing at all,” considering that “ATOM at this point has been seeing a correction that has been up to 50%. That is a lot.”

Furthermore, as another example of a crypto asset to remove from his portfolio, van de Poppe singled out Curve (CRV), which “has also been underperforming (…)” lately, “with a performance that’s been super-weak.,” and “continues to fall” against Bitcoin and Polygon (MATIC).



At the same time, he pointed out that these “might not be bad projects (…) but have been underperforming substantially” and “I just see less arguments of having them in my portfolio as they are underperforming heavily in the last period already.”



Altcoins in: SEI and TIA



On the other hand, the crypto market analyst pointed out that he wanted to position himself “into coins that do not have these back-holders, (…) are likely to have a higher return because the repricing didn’t take place yet” and which offer the opportunity cost of having them in his portfolio.



For instance, one of these altcoins with great potential, in his view, is Sei (SEI), which “has been seeing a (…) listing correction, and after that, it went up to close to 8x against Bitcoin even due to the fact that Bitcoin went live with the ETF.” As van de Poppe further highlighted:




“After that period, we basically went down, which means that this one is just going to rotate back up again. I think this is a very safe one actually that is just getting crushed due to the fact that Bitcoin ETF went live, so this one dropped approx. 70% since and is fuelling an opportunity.”

Moreover, the crypto trading expert mentioned Celestia (TIA) as “another one that has been providing the exact same peaks in the week of the Bitcoin ETF launch, went up 650% and corrected 75%,” reiterating his view that “those are opportunities that are substantial.”



Conclusion



All things considered, van de Poppe is a seasoned trader who has seen his share of gains and losses, risks and opportunities and is well aware of what he is getting himself into when trading crypto assets, illustrating the importance of doing one’s own research before making any major investing decisions.

Bitcoin Demand Shock: Potential For Explosive Price Growth?


The current situation for Bitcoin (BTC) reveals a pronounced demand shock, with prices steady at around $71,000. Demand from institutional investors, especially through spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), fuels this increase. 
Spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced unprecedented net inflows. For the past 18 days, they have recorded continuous positive inflows, the longest streak since their inception. 
Is Bitcoin Awaiting Explosive Price Growth?

Among Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is particularly noteworthy. It accumulated $350 million on Thursday, the highest in the last two trading months. In total, IBIT has acquired nearly $780 million worth of Bitcoin over the past three trading days.
This week alone, Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw inflows exceeding $1.7 billion. Significantly, June 4 marked the highest daily inflow of the week, with spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracting $886 million.

“That’s the highest weekly inflow since launch (+$1.7 billion) – and we still have one day left,” crypto analyst Miles Deutscher said.

Additionally, the discrepancy between Bitcoin miners’ output and ETF purchases highlights the shock in demand. Crypto investor Adam Back highlighted that while Bitcoin miners produced just 450 BTC on June 4, ETFs bought a staggering 12,508 BTC.

Despite these bullish activities, the Bitcoin funding rate remains neutral. This rate is crucial for maintaining market equilibrium and is a fee exchanged between traders of perpetual future contracts. It aligns the contract’s price with the Bitcoin spot price. 
Despite high Bitcoin prices, a neutral funding rate suggests a balanced market sentiment with a reduced risk of sudden downturns. 

“Last time we were here (in March/April) – it was a sea of orange/red (high funding rate),” Deutscher added.

Furthermore, the open interest in the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group is rising, approaching all-time highs once again. Analyst Vetle Lunde from K33 Research reports that this increase is driven by more direct participant exposure and solid inflows into leveraged ETFs. 
Open interest, which represents the total outstanding derivative contracts not yet settled, has reached an 11-week high, surpassing 75,000 BTC. This measure indicates growing market liquidity, and mirrors heightened market sentiment and engagement. 

Moreover, according to CryptoQuant data, the supply of Bitcoin on crypto exchanges is at a one-year low. 

“Right on time for a second wave of ETF Flows. Demand shock + Inelastic supply,” Bitcoin investor, Thomas Fahrer said.

This traditional economic scenario of high demand coupled with low supply suggests potential explosive price growth for Bitcoin. The convergence of increasing institutional demand, balanced market mechanisms via neutral funding rates, and a tightening Bitcoin supply outline a promising outlook for its near-term valuation trajectory.

Ethereum ETF Demand May Be Muted Compared To Bitcoin ETFs, Analysts Say - Benzinga

The highly anticipated launch of Ethereum ETH/USD exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States may see a more subdued response compared to the initial excitement surrounding Bitcoin ETFs, analysts predict.What Happened: JPMorgan strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, estimate that Ethereum ETFs will attract a modest $1 billion to $3 billion in net inflows by the year’s end, a stark contrast to the $15.3 billion garnered by Bitcoin ETFs, according to a Bloomberg report.Ethereum’s 109% price increase over the past year lags behind Bitcoin’s 169% surge.James Davies, CPO and founder of Crypto Valley Exchange, told Benzinga that analysts are expecting lower demand for Ether ETH/USD as its prominence relative to Bitcoin is not as broadly known and accepted by the public.”Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets Pty, concurred, noting, “Ether doesn't have the profile of Bitcoin,” and emphasized Bitcoin's BTC/USD market value of $1.4 trillion, which is three times that of Ether.SEC Approval ProcessDavies is optimistic about the approval process under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, stating, “Everyone sees that ETH ETFs will pass very soon.” He added that denial of these ETFs would likely lead to lawsuits, mirroring the legal actions seen with Bitcoin ETFs. Marko Jurina, CEO of Jumper.Exchange, also expects approval, saying, “Chances of issuance are imminently favorable,” given recent regulatory developments.Long-Term Advantages Of Ethereum ETFsDespite the expected lower demand, Ethereum ETFs offer unique benefits.“ETH has utility mostly not present in the Bitcoin ecosystem, so much of the overall crypto ecosystem is tied to ETH,” Davies noted, suggesting significant long-term growth potential. VanEck's Head of Digital-Asset Research, Matthew Sigel, supported this view, stating, “Over time, we expect investors to conclude that the potential for application and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem could be much larger than that of Bitcoin.”Also Read: JPM - Benzinga">JPMorgan: US Crypto Regulations Signal Opposition To CBDCs And Non-Compliant StablecoinsPotential Selling Pressure And Market DynamicsConcerns remain about selling pressure from Grayscale's planned conversion of its $11 billion Ethereum fund into an ETF. Davies warned, “The potential ‘selling pressure’ on Ether from redemptions in Grayscale’s Ethereum fund could be significant.” However, he also noted that net inflows to BTC ETFs could potentially offset this pressure.Broader Investor SentimentEther continues to trade below its all-time high of $4,866, with global investors showing less enthusiasm compared to Bitcoin. ByteTree Asset Management's Charlie Morris observed, “Global investors have been less enthusiastic about Ether, which they have had access to through Europe and Canada for years.”The implications of these developments and broader trends in digital asset investments will be a key topic at the Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19. Industry leaders will provide valuable insights into how these strategic moves and regulatory changes are shaping the future of the cryptocurrency market.Read Next: Is Robinhood’s Crypto Exchange Deal Really ‘Massive’ And The ‘First Domino To Fall?’Image: Shutterstock

‘Quiet Before the Storm’ - Trader Says Top Ethereum Rival Mirroring 2021 Price Action That Preceded 700%+ Rally - The Daily Hodl


								A closely followed crypto analyst believes that one Ethereum (ETH) rival is gearing up for a massive gain.
Pseudonymous trader Kaleo tells his 641,800 followers on the social media platform X that Avalanche (AVAX) may be about to mirror a 2021 bullish pattern against Bitcoin (BTC).










“AVAX/BTC: I still wouldn’t sleep on Avalanche here. Chart looks like it’s at a spot similar to where it was in July of 2021. Big gains to start the year, followed by months of bleeding out before it started to rip. Quiet before the storm.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his chart, the trader suggests that AVAX/BTC may breakout of a descending channel to 0.0014 BTC ($99.87) similar to how the trading pair soared from around 0.0003 BTC in July 2021 to about 0.0025 BTC in December 2021, a gain of 733%.
AVAX/BTC is trading for 0.0005105 BTC ($36.42) at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the analyst predicts that memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) will have a parabolic breakout against Bitcoin (DOGE/BTC).
“DOGE/BTC: you just have to bullieve.”
Source: Kaleo/X
Looking at his chart, the trader suggests DOGE/BTC could soon soar beyond 0.00000380 BTC ($0.27). DOGE/BTC is trading for 0.00000227 BTC ($0.16) at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.
The trader believes altseason will officially kick off once Ethereum breaks through the key resistance level against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) currently around 0.054 BTC ($3,852).

ETH/BTC is trading for 0.05370 BTC ($3,798) at time of writing, down 1% in the last 24 hours.

Not SEC, Issuers Will Show Green Light To Ether ETF


                                SEC Chair: Ether ETFs Approval Hinges on Issuers' Responsiveness                                The current and future regulation of cryptocurrencies in the United States is complex, especially with the expected approval of spot Ether ETFs. Some of the recent statements by the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler have given a clear perspective on the timelines involved and what is expected in these approvals.What's the News?The Chair of the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler has mentioned that the moment when spot Ether ETFs will be introduced will heavily rely on issuers’ activity regarding the comments of the Commission. This statement was made following the approval of eight spot Ether ETFs through Form 19b-4 applications to trade on various exchanges in the United States. However, these ETFs can only trade after they have been registered with an S-1 registration statement.Gensler highlighted that the SEC is supposed to ensure investors receive enough information and that all parties are acting fairly. He also stated that the staff of the SEC has analyzed the filings and found out that they are similar to the approval of Bitcoin. However, the issuers have to be more receptive to the comments of the SEC. “It is really up to them how much they want to be responsive,” Gensler said implying that the pace of approval is at the issuer's discretion.Gensler reiterated that while spot Ether ETFs are approved in principle, they still require S-1 filings to be finalized. The approval process could take additional weeks or months, with the first week of July being a speculative target for some analysts. Gensler pointed to the importance of having strong rules and requirements for disclosure and compliance in the crypto space. He added that most of the exchanges lack enough transparency, which is crucial to avoid fraud and manipulation.Factors affecting the SEC’s decisionIt appears that the SEC has changed its approach to spot Ether ETFs based on the precedent set by Grayscale in a case regarding Bitcoin ETFs in 2023. The most crucial factor that Grayscale was able to prove its case was the approval of the SEC on Bitcoin futures ETFs. Gensler pointed out that Ethereum has a similar regulatory approach, as the relations between Bitcoins and Ether markets are studied by the SEC. This legal backdrop may have facilitated a more favorable view of Ether ETFs.Another angle to the SEC’s decision is linked to Commissioner Jamie Lizárraga, whose past ties to influential Democratic figures like Nancy Pelosi may have played a role. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart suggested that internal political dynamics and concerns over crypto’s popularity among Democrats could have influenced the SEC’s decisions.ConclusionAs the SEC continues to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency regulation, the approval of spot Ether ETFs will largely depend on issuer responsiveness and ongoing compliance with disclosure requirements, CoinGabbar concluded. The SEC’s actions might also reflect broader political dynamics, with significant support for crypto legislation among Democratic lawmakers. The passing of FIT21 in the House of Representatives exemplifies this trend, potentially shaping the SEC’s regulatory approach. The evolving regulatory landscape promises to bring more clarity and opportunities for investors and issuers alike.Also Read: US Antitrust Chief’s Vision For Preventing AI Monopoly

GameStop Dips in Premarket After Early Q1 Results, Equity Sale Announcement - Tokenist


					
Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.



GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) released its first-quarter financial results for the fiscal year 2024 earlier than anticipated, coinciding with the much-awaited return of Keith Gill, also known as “Roaring Kitty,” to YouTube. The video game retailer reported a net loss of $32.3 million, an improvement from the $50.5 million loss in the same quarter last year.



However, the company missed analysts’ expectations on both revenue and earnings per share (EPS), with net sales declining to $0.882 billion from $1.237 billion in Q1 2023.



GameStop Misses Q1 Earnings, Plans to Sell Up to 75 Million Shares



GameStop’s gross profit for the quarter declined to $244.5 million from $287.3 million year-over-year. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to $295.1 million from $345.7 million, but increased as a percentage of net sales to 33.5% from 27.9%. The company ended the quarter with $1.083 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, while maintaining limited long-term debt, primarily a low-interest, unsecured term loan from the French government’s COVID-19 response.



In a separate announcement, GameStop revealed plans to sell up to 75 million additional shares of Class A common stock through an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC, entered into on May 17, 2024. This move follows a previous sale of 45 million shares, which generated gross proceeds of approximately $933.4 million.



The new share offering, deemed an “at the market offering” under Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act, could significantly dilute existing shareholders.





GameStop Stock Sees Extreme Premarket Volatility



As of June 6, 2024, GameStop’s stock price closed at $46.55, with a pre-market price of $42.78 at 7:26 AM EDT, representing a decline of 8.1%. The stock has experienced extreme volatility over the past year, with a 52-week range between $10.01 and $48.75, and daily trading volumes ranging from 1,731,300 to 206,979,100 shares.



Despite the mixed financial results, GameStop’s stock has delivered a year-to-date return of +165.54% and a 1-year return of +91.48%.



The significant pre-market surge in the stock price can be attributed to the anticipation surrounding Keith Gill’s return to YouTube.

Is Now the Time to Buy Shiba Inu? Crypto Analyst Says Yes


							

Popular crypto analyst Thescalpingpro has urged his followers on X to buy SHIB during its current dip.



SHIB’s trading volume has decreased by 43% to $397.78 million over the past week. 



SHIB faces strong resistance at $0.000026, where many traders tend to sell. Holding above $0.000025 is crucial for another upward push.




Crypto analyst, Thescalpingpro, has urged investors to buy Shiba Inu (SHIB) during its current dip. In an X post, the pseudonymous analyst emphasized that this might be the last opportunity to buy SHIB before a potential price increase.







Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.00002529, reflecting a 1.43% intraday dip and a 2.18% decline over the past week. SHIB’s trading volume has also fallen by 43% to $397.78 million over the same period. Similarly, its market capitalization has dipped by 1.50%, reaching $14.88 billion.



According to TradingView data, SHIB’s price has shown relatively stable movement with moderate volatility this month. The price consistently finds support around $0.000022 and encounters resistance at $0.000027, struggling to break through this level.



Furthermore, volume trends reveal a few noticeable spikes, which are significantly lower than in previous periods, such as during the March surge. Meanwhile, lower volume indicates decreased trading activity, often accompanying consolidation phases. These periods usually precede significant price movements as traders anticipate a breakout.



On June 5, SHIB reached a high of $0.00002633 after surpassing the $0.000025 level and 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). This development brought mid-term bullish momentum, supported by Bitcoin’s resurgence and a broader market uptrend.



However, the $0.000026 threshold remains a significant resistance level. According to IntoTheBlock data, 64,320 addresses purchased 69.74 trillion SHIB tokens at an average price of $0.000026. Each time SHIB retests this price, these addresses tend to sell off their holdings, increasing selling pressure and leading to a price correction.



As SHIB retraced most of its recent gains and slipped below $0.000026, it now aims to hold above $0.000025 to prepare for another potential upward push when bullish sentiment returns. Coincodex currently predicts that SHIB’s price could rise by 226.28%, reaching $0.00008195 by July 7, 2024.

GameStop’s shares jumped 19% shortly after his revelation.The trader’s return has also sparked a surge in Kitty-themed memecoins and the Solana-based token GME, which has no association with the retail game company.On Monday, GME surged 300% in a few hours after Roaring Kitty returned to X. The memecoin skyrocketed nearly 100% yesterday night following Gill’s livestream announcement.

Solana trader turns $53,500 into $2.86 million in five months


    GameStop stock (NYSE: GME) is up 165% year-to-date, and the cryptocurrency market has navigated this hype with a GME memecoin. A Solana (SOL) DeFi trader has made $2.8 million in unrealized profits with this purely speculative meme token.



In particular, the account ‘7eTbufa‘ purchased the GME token on January 29 and April 3 while trading at low prices. Overall, the trader stacked 90.23 million GME in Solana year-to-date and patiently held despite months of low volume.



This strategy is paying off, as these holdings were worth $2.86 million when Lookonchain reported the achievement. Specifically, GME traded at $0.03120 on the decentralized exchange Raydium, while Solana currently trades at $171.







However, the trader might face liquidity issues, and it’s not guaranteed that he can realize his profits with the Solana version of GME, which has no real value or relation with the GameStop stock.

GME stock hype and a meme coin mania among Solana traders



Meme coins like Solana’s GME have been trending among cryptocurrencies since May 13. Renewed interest surged when the famous meme trader Keith Gill returned to social platforms. Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, inspired the GameStop stock short squeeze in 2021.



His appearance is visible on the chart above. Notably, there was a price surge at that time, followed by a crash once the influencer went silent. The Solana trader held his GME meme coin untouched during the pump and the following crash.



Nevertheless, Roaring Kitty’s Reddit account disclosed a $180 million position on GameStop on June 3, pumping these meme assets again. GME stock currently trades at $44.07, up 164.37% year-to-date.

In this context, it is worth the warning that trading meme coins or meme stocks can be extremely risky. The risk of ruin with this asset class is high, and most traders will lose money instead of accruing gains.



Furthermore, experts warn of “The Greater Fool” theory dynamics that resemble financial bubbles, when the “mania” disappears and the late buyers remain with massive losses of assets that have no organic demand besides the highly speculative nature of traders trying to outplay the market, but being outplayed as soon as the “music stops.”

Ripple sells 150 million XRP of June reserves, pressures price


    Ripple, the XRP Ledger (XRP) developer and largest holder, sold 150 million XRP from this month’s reserves on June 7. The sale is worth $78 million, representing 0.25% of XRP’s $29.25 billion capitalization at $0.52 per token



On June 1, the company released 1 billion XRP from the initial distribution, locked in monthly escrows until 2027. Ripple then sent 200 million XRP to its treasury account and locked the remaining 800 million in new escrows.



Additionally, the ‘Ripple (35)‘ account sent an extra 200 million tokens to the sell-off reserves, totaling 400 million XRP.







As usual, the selling activity resulted from the treasury account, labeled ‘Ripple (1),’ sending tokens to the unlabeled account ‘rP4X2hTa‘. This action causes XRP supply inflation—by putting tokens that have never circulated before into circulation for the first time.

So far, the amount remains in the ‘rP4X2hTa’ account, which will likely be distributed to ‘rhWt2bhR‘ and other intermediary addresses before landing in cryptocurrency exchanges, as happened in previous months.

XRP price analysis amid Ripple sell-offs



It is noteworthy how Ripple sales directly impact XRP’s price, considering the supply pressure they create on the spot market. Historically, XRP suffered a local crash most of the time Ripple sold its tokens.



Year-to-date, only five of the 12 sell-off days had positive price action: February 5, 11, April 14, May 13, and 20. All the other seven days were of local crashes, evidencing the importance of monitoring the company’s activities.



Moreover, XRP had a negative monthly performance in three of the first five months of 2024, year-to-date.

As of this writing, XRP trades at $0.523 with an increasing supply pressure over its spot price. Therefore, investors should closely monitor Ripple’s dumps in June, as they could slow down an expected bull rally this cycle.

Bitcoin Open Interest reaches record levels: Could $80K be next? - AMBCrypto




The coin’s open interest hit the highest point since March, suggesting that BTC could break past $73,750.
Exchange withdrawal increased while the funding rate was positive, reinforcing the bullish bias.

For the first time since it hit its all-time high of $73,570, Bitcoin [BTC] Open Interest has hit a new high. Specifically, the Open Interest was $37.66 billion, according to data from Glassnode. 
Open Interest (OI) is the value of outstanding contracts in the derivatives market. If the OI decreases, it means traders are increasingly closing their positions, and this could lead to a price decrease. 
However, an increase in OI like Bitcoin has done recently is a sign that new money is entering the market. If sustained, this could back BTC’s uptrend and lead to a higher price.
Source: Glassnode
BTC aims higher, backed by exchange flow
As of this writing, BTC changed hands at $71,200. This represented a 3.89% jump in the last seven days. With increasing interest in the token, there is a high chance that it could surpass its all-time high and possibly reach $80,000.
Despite the bullish prediction, it is important to look at the spot trading activity on exchanges as this could also affect the price action.
One of the ways to do this is by looking at the supply on exchanges and the supply out of it. In addition, the balance held by some of the top exchanges could give an idea.
For instance, AMBCrypto found that Binance and Coinbase’s historical balance was down, indicating that users were withdrawing their BTC from the platforms. However, Kraken recorded a surge in BTC purchases on the 30th of May before the recent decline.
It seemed that many holders were buying more coins on exchanges and withdrawing them for the long term. If this continues to be the case, Bitcoin might evade selling pressure, and the price could hit an all-time high before the end of June.
Source: Santiment
Traders continue to bet on a rally
On the other hand, the prediction could be invalidated if supply on exchanges begins to rise. This is because an increase in the supply would mean that investors are willing to book profits. If this happens, BTC might lose hold of $70,000.
However, traders seem not to share the viewpoint of price decrease. This was based on the Funding Rate data obtained from Coinglass. 
According to the derivatives information portal, Bitcoin’s Funding Rate was positive. If the reading of the metric is negative, it implies that shorts are paying longs a fee to keep their position open. 
In this instance, the broader sentiment is bearish.
Source: Coinglass

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025

However, the positive reading of the metric indicated that longs are dominant, and are expecting BTC’s price to increase. Should Bitcoin rise to $74,000 as it is being talked about, traders with long positions would be rewarded.
 This could also give way to $80,000 provided bears fail to nuke the uptrend.

DYdX To Complete v5 Upgrade Next Week - The Defiant

DYdX v5 introduces Isolated Markets, allowing users to partition their collateral across multiple positions.DYdX, a decentralized perpetuals exchange, is set to complete the rollout of its highly anticipated v5 upgrade next week.Announced on June 7, dYdX’s v5 iteration introduces a suite of new features including isolated markets, batch orders, liquidity vaults, and new price oracles. The dYdX community voted to implement the v5 upgrade with 98.4% on June 3.DYdX commands a total value locked (TVL) just shy of $500 million, placing it among the top 20 DeFi projects by TVL​, data from DefilLama shows. The protocol ranks second among perpetual DEXes, sitting behind GMX with $544 million.DYdX is followed by Jupiter and Hyperliquid with $412 million and $392 million, respectively.The protocol’s multiple iterations have generated more than $120 billion in cumulative trading volume​, the dYdX Foundation shared in an April blog post.New featuresThe introduction of Isolated Markets is among the biggest changes introduced by v5. Previously, all markets on dYdX shared the same collateral pool, limiting the number of markets available. With Isolated Markets, each market now has a distinct collateral pool, enabling the launch of up to 800 new markets on the protocol.Isolated Margin is another key feature in the update. It allows traders to treat each market as an isolated position with distinct risk parameters, rather than having all positions cross-margined against a single pool of collateral.“Traders have the ability to confine collateral to a specific position and manually adjust the collateral for that given position,” dYdX said in an announcement. “We believe this will allow users to more intuitively understand and adjust their collateral management.”The update includes price oracle integrations from Slinky and Raydium, a Solana-based limit order book DEX. The Slinky integration will enable block-by-block price updates with improved latency by leveraging dYdX’s validators, while the Raydium oracle provides price data on all assets traded on the Raydium exchange.V5 also introduces batch order cancellations allowing users to cancel up to 100 short-term orders simultaneously.The update will additionally introduce liquidity provider (LP) vaults providing automated LP strategies in the coming weeks.Season 5 incentivesDYdX’s v5 launch will likely coincide with the project’s fifth season of incentives for users. The campaign will offer $5 million in DYDX tokens to traders and will run until mid-July 2024, pending a governance vote.The season will also introduce a multiplier for DYDX stakers, enhanced points for front-end trading activity, and separate trading reward allocations for major markets including BTC, ETH, and SOL. Season 5 will also distribute $100 deposit bonuses to the first 500 new accounts that sign up.Migration from Ethereum to CosmosIn 2017, Antonio Juliano launched dYdX as an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.DYdX ranked among Ethereum’s top DeFi protocols for several years, with the project migrating to a dedicated Layer 2 appchain with the launch of its v3 iteration in April 2021. However, dYdX exited the Ethereum ecosystem to deploy a Cosmos-based appchain with the deployment of its fourth version in November 2023.The project attracted funding from top crypto investment firms including Paradigm, Polychain, and Andreessen Horowitz over four funding rounds.

dWallet Network brings multi-chain DeFi and gaming trust protocols to Aptos


    dWallet Network, a multi-chain technology pioneer, has announced its expansion to Aptos, a leading Layer-1 blockchain known for speed and security, as per the latest updates shared with Finbold on June 7. 



The integration aims to introduce Zero Trust Protocols (ZTPs) and seamless multi-chain interoperability to Aptos’ (APT) decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming ecosystems. 



By leveraging dWallet’s Zero Trust architecture, ZTPs on Aptos will be able to execute transactions on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other blockchains.







Effortless multi-chain Web3 interactions 



Aptos stands out for its high-throughput, low-latency blockchain utilizing the Move smart contract language to create a robust platform for building advanced applications with minimal gas fees. 



With the dWallet Network integration, developers will have the tools necessary to create ZTPs with decentralized, noncollusive dWallets, enabling effortless multi-chain interactions across Web3.



This development is particularly significant for DeFi projects on Aptos, as it allows for native BTC and ETH transactions. 



dWallet technology



Additionally, dWallet Network’s technology introduces a foundational building block that allows asset control and enforces logic across any network. 



dWallet-generated signatures are indistinguishable from a regular user signature, even on non-smart contract networks like Bitcoin.



Such capability facilitates the creation of ZTPs that operate across networks without bridging or wrapping, upholding the principles of decentralization.



2PC-MPC protocols



To implement the dWallet’s Zero Trust primitive, dWallet Network uses a cutting-edge threshold protocol called 2PC-MPC.



This protocol enables the generation of an ECDSA signature requiring participation from both the end-user and numerous validators, potentially numbering in the hundreds or thousands.



Professor Benny Pinkas, a researcher at Aptos, commented on the protocol, stating:




“The dWallet team led pioneering cryptography research to introduce the innovative 2PC-MPC protocol, enabling multi-chain Zero Trust. I’m excited about developers in the Aptos ecosystem being able to develop ZTPs that operate seamlessly across all of Web3 in a cryptographically secure way.”




Toward a richer blockchain experience



Omer Sadika, Co-Founder of dWallet Network, expressed his enthusiasm about the expansion to Aptos, stating:




“We are excited to bring our decentralized, noncollusive dWallet building block to the fast and secure Aptos blockchain to enable ZTPs. Doing so broadens horizons for DeFi and gaming protocols within the Aptos ecosystem, and represents a significant leap towards realizing our vision of a seamless, Zero Trust and multi-chain future.”




Bringing dWallet Network to Aptos marks a significant milestone, promising to enhance flexibility, security, and interoperability in multi-chain DeFi and gaming. 



This integration is poised to drive innovation and accelerate adoption, offering developers new opportunities and providing users with a richer blockchain experience.

Bitcoin's Big Breakout Coming Soon? Satoshi's Ally Predicts When

Bitcoin's price has been pretty steady at around $70,000 for a while now, since mid-May. Despite this, the cryptocurrency's price has shown minimal movement, fluctuating within a narrow 6% range. This period of low volatility has frustrated market participants, particularly as Bitcoin's all-time high of $74,000 remains tantalizingly close yet seemingly out of reach.The lack of movement in the price has seriously annoyed traders and investors, and there has been a lot of talk about price manipulation. Adam Back, who is a contemporary of Bitcoin's mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto, addressed these concerns in a recent discussion. Back suggested that the current price suppression could be down to certain sellers who urgently need cash and are offloading their Bitcoin holdings. He said that these sellers, who might not be willing or able to wait for higher prices, have a limited amount of BTC to sell. Once they have sold all their holdings, the market might start to move up again, says the developer.  These comments match what a lot of people in the cryptocurrency community are feeling. Many think that things like institutional investors and trading platforms like ETFs and Coinbase might be influencing the market. The idea is that these entities, possibly in collaboration with official agencies, are trying to keep prices stable or suppressed for their own strategic advantage.When breakout?However, Back’s perspective offers a glimmer of hope in the current market conditions. The idea that current sellers' influence is temporary suggests that once their selling capacity is depleted, Bitcoin could resume its upward trajectory.BTC to USD by CoinMarketCapThis view lines up with how the price has moved historical, as there have often been periods of consolidation before big price surges.Summing up, while the current trading range and low volatility are testing the patience of market participants, Bitcoin's price could break free from its current stagnation, potentially reaching new highs once the immediate liquidity needs of these sellers are met.

Why Roaring Kitty 'Has Already Won,' According To Crypto Traders - GameStop (NYSE:GME) - Benzinga

Keith Gill and his massive bet on GameStop GME stock sparked a debate within the cryptocurrency community about its consequences and lessons for the crypto industry.What Happened: Roaring Kitty could become a billionaire on Friday if GME reaches $69 per share and many within the crypto space are celebrating Gill’s potential win.“Roaring Kitty has already won,” declared veteran trader TheFlowHorse.“After this is closed out, I think this whole performance goes down in history as one of the greatest of all time.” This sentiment resonates with the “David vs. Goliath” narrative often embraced by crypto investors, who see themselves challenging established financial institutions.Others highlighted key differences between the GME saga and the cryptocurrency market.Ludwig Wittgenstein observed that Roaring Kitty “waited years for his play, striking at the perfect moment in a career defining way.” That kind of patience, he writes, is not one of crypto investors’ strengths. They “can’t stand a ‘chop’ for more than three seconds, running from one narrative to the other.”This comment criticizes the perceived short-term focus and volatility within some crypto circles compared to Gill’s long-term strategy.Also Read: JPM - Benzinga">JPMorgan: US Crypto Regulations Signal Opposition To CBDCs And Non-Compliant StablecoinsWhy It Matters: The potential influx of new investors from the GME frenzy raises intriguing questions for the crypto space.Anthony Pompliano, investor at Pomp Investments, noted the potential crossover in his tweet: “This story will once again rip through the media and be covered everywhere. What becomes of those who step up, as they did last time? Do they come into our world, looking for that opportunity?”Cold Blooded Shiller explores this further, questioning if the success of meme stocks like GME could lead to increased interest in cryptocurrencies.“Can crypto capture some of the attention mindshare? Perhaps things like the GME memecoin on SOL… are also positives for the crypto story,” highlighting the potential for a “perfect storm” where retail investors, ignited by the GME story, might explore opportunities in crypto markets.Read Next: Is Robinhood’s Crypto Exchange Deal Really ‘Massive’ And The ‘First Domino To Fall?’Image: Shutterstock

The team has decided through a community vote to renounce the BabyDoge token contracts on the BNB and Ethereum chains. This means that the team will no longer have control over token issuance on these networks and will be unable to add any changes to it, leaving it completely decentralized. The contract on Ethereum has been renounced already, and the team is still running technical checks to do the same on the BNB chain for BabyDoge. On May 30, the team officially made a proposal to the community to start deploying BabyDoge on the Solana chain “to enhance transaction speed, reduce fees, and increase interoperability.”

Cardano eyes $0.50 milestone as whales rally behind ADA - AMBCrypto



Cardano price to surge to $0.50 if the resistance level at $0.44 is broken over.
Increased whale activity and positive active addresses and circulations indicates a bullish momentum.

Cardano’s [ADA] price is consolidating in a pennant pattern. The pennant support level has been repeatedly tested, with the most recent being a key point at $0.4394.
If the price builds up enough momentum to break over the $0.4671 resistance level, it might rise by 7.55% to $0.50.
Cardano was valued at 0.4634 on CoinMarketCap at press time, up 1.16% in the last 24 hours and 3.19% in the last seven days.

Bigger flaps by Cardano whales
According to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Santiment data, there is a significant increase in the whale activity indicated by increased frequency of the whales spikes.
This suggests that large holders are accumulating Cardano at an unprecedented rate. The surge in interest among the big players may indicate a bullish rally.
Source:Santiment
How increasing activity, circulation can fuel Cardano
The active addresses and circulation data on Santiment show an increasing trend, indicating more activity, acceptance, and demand for ADA.
This might drive a positive moment, allowing the price to break over the resistance and even reach $0.50.
The previous time the price experienced an equal number of addresses and trend was on 21st May, when the price increased by 7.55%.
If the same spike occurs, the price will increase to $0.50.
Source:Santiment
What next for Cardano?
Based on the whale activity and the technical analysis, ADA is projected to surge in the near future. 
The recent spike in active addresses and circulation trends could signal increased institutional interest and capital inflows into the Cardano ecosystem.

If the price manages to break past the resistance level at $0.4671, it may pave the way for additional upward momentum, bringing prices closer to $0.50. 
However, if the price falls below the support levels, a reversal or consolidation period is likely.

Sky Mavis says $5.7M recovered from $600M Ronin exploit - Crypto Briefing


            
            
                            
            
                            
            
            Sky Mavis has recovered $5.7 million of funds stolen from Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge, according to a Friday announcement from the team.The recovery was achieved through the collaborative efforts of various entities, including the Økokrim, a Norwegian law enforcement agency, and the FBI, said Sky Mavis. Specifically, Økokrim successfully froze and returned $5.7 million stolen from the bridge hack.
“We’d like to publicly extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who assisted in the recovery efforts, especially Økokrim and the FBI in the US, for their tireless effort to track down and recover these assets for the Axie and Ronin communities,” the team stated.
Allocation of recovered fundsSky Mavis noted that approximately 15% of the recovered assets will cover recovery efforts, while the remaining 85% will go to the Axie Infinity treasury.According to the team, recovering stolen crypto requires collaboration between law enforcement, legal professionals, financial experts, and blockchain specialists, including Chainalysis.In addition to $5.7 million in recovered funds, law enforcement has frozen an additional $40 million in stolen assets. However, recovering these funds will take longer, with no definitive timeline provided for their return.On March 29, 2022, the Ronin network suffered a major security breach, resulting in a loss of 173,600 ETH and 25 million USDC, totaling about $600 million.Following the incident, Sky Mavis raised $150 million to reimburse users. In April 2022, Binance reported that the exchange had recovered $5.8 million of funds stolen in the Ronin Bridge attack.Sky Mavis has since enhanced security measures, including partnerships with new validators like Google Cloud.

In a recent interview, Ripple’s Middle East and Africa Managing Director Reece Merrick shared his personal take on the company’s plans to create and launch its native stablecoin.He also explained why he believes it will be a success, while such popular USD-backed stablecoins as USDT and USDC have already existed in the market for many years. The video extract was shared by XRP enthusiast @BankXRP.Ripple's activity in DubaiIn particular, Merrick spoke about the sector he is in charge of, and part of it is Dubai where, recently, the Crypto Expo Dubai 2024 event took place. The executive stated that Dubai now offers “forward-thinking regulation” and a major network for Ripple to continue exploiting this region, taking up the manifold opportunities it offers.Currently, according to Merrick, Ripple has been in this area for four years, working not only on fintech expansion but also increasing crypto and blockchain adoption in that region. During the talk, the Ripple Middle East director also answered a few questions about Ripple’s plans to release its own stablecoin and take some of the market share from USDT and USDC that has been actively used not only there but around the world in general already.Ripple stablecoin's key USPWhen asked about the approaching development and the launch of the stablecoin by Ripple, Reece Merrick admitted that this seems to be a logical step for the company. Currently, he pointed out, there is a $150 billion market of stablecoins, and its is predicted to reach a staggering $2.8-$3 trillion by 2028. Besides, there is also significant demand for more businesses, which are compliant and regulated, to enter this space.Ripple now, according to Merrick, believes that there is a great need for a regulated USD-backed stablecoin to emerge on the market since around 60% of all settlements outside the U.S., including the Middle East region, are made in U.S. dollars.As for the unique selling point of Ripple’s stablecoin, Merrick said that the company has spent 12 years building a cross-border offering. “We have the infrastructure. The stablecoin was the next evolution of that.”

Fake Elon Musk Live Stream During SpaceX Launch


                                Elon Musk's Deepfake Version Deceive The Viewers During SpaceX Launch                                Over 35 YouTube channels live-streamed deepfake versions of Elon Musk during the recent SpaceX Starship launch, aiming to deceive space enthusiasts and crypto investors. The streams featured an AI-generated voice of Musk, promising viewers doubled returns on their cryptocurrency deposits.What’s The StoryOver 35 YouTube Channels live-streamed in the name of Elon Musk during the SpaceX launch. These fake streams were identified by cybersecurity researchers at Avast Threat Labs during the fourth experimental flight of SpaceX’s massive reusable spacecraft known as the Starship.  The actual event, as seen on SpaceX’s live stream, depicted the rocket re-entering Earth’s atmosphere and splashing down in the Indian Ocean as intended. However, the scam streams gained a lot of traffic by mimicking the genuine SpaceX accounts and having 170,000 viewers, which is likely to be inflated by bots to increase authenticity.The fake live streams showed Musk at a SpaceX event, speaking to the audience, while some of the streams slightly pixelated Musk’s face to hide the deepfake. An AI-generated voice replicating Musk’s speech pattern, including his stammers and hesitations said to the viewers, “This is not fake, this is a real giveaway, I guarantee it to you.” The voice instructed the viewers to send Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Dogecoin to specific addresses and guaranteed double the amount back.The streams also contained the sound of a simulated audience clapping, which helped to make it more realistic. “You get a unique opportunity to watch your crypto soar multifold as our rocket soars into space,” the AI voice said. However, the streams seemed to be genuine, but the participants were being scammed.Nine wallets belonging to three different scammers have received almost $34,000 by the 6th of June. However, it is still unknown how many people lost their money to the scammers. The fact that these wallets still contain a large amount of money points to the fact that some of the viewers were indeed victims.After the exposure, YouTube removed the fraudulent streams. However, the scammers were able to re-establish the channel renamed it to the Cardano Foundation, and proceeded to use deep fake live streams of Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson.Previous Scams Using Elon Musk's Name In Crypto SpaceElon Musk, a billionaire businessman and owner of Platform X and companies like Tesla, SpaceX is also a vocal supporter of Cryptocurrencies. Recently, a Deepfake video of Elon Musk was made with AI endorsing Crypto Trading services in Hong Kong. According to reports, a fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange named Quantum AI released a Deepfake Video featuring Elon Musk. This AI-generated deep fake video falsely triggers Crypto Users by claiming genuine crypto trading services featuring Elon Musk. It is not a secret that scammers often use Elon Musk’s image because he is a supporter of cryptocurrencies, especially the Dogecoin. In April, the same Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk found the same fake SpaceX YouTube accounts that used AI-generated Musks to advertise a double-your-money scam during the solar eclipse visible in North America.There are many rumors surrounding the market in the name of Elon Musk. One of the News circulating about Elon Musk having a Connection with Pi Coin and that he will accept Pi Coin as a payment option. However, no official statement regarding this matter was provided on social media or elsewhere. Failure to receive an official statement from Pi Coin left room for potential scams exploiting Elon Musk's name in the crypto space.ConclusionCoinGabbar highlights that it's important for viewers to be cautious and skeptical about the content they watch. This kind of scam uses advanced technology to create convincing fake videos. As the deepfake technology develops, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the original stream and a fake one. The fake streams featuring Elon Musk were part of a scam to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting viewers. Despite being taken down, the scammers quickly shifted to a new target, showing how persistent and adaptable they are. Therefore, in such a situation be cautious and double-check information online, especially when it involves sending money or personal information.Also Read: The Truth Behind SpaceX and Cryptocurrency Rumors

Crypto Analyst Decodes China's Influence on Altcoins and Bitcoin


							

Dylan, the host of Crypto Banter, highlighted several altcoins with potential upsides.



He noted a significant influence of Chinese market activities on these tokens.



The analyst discussed the European Central Bank’s rate cuts and positive job data as potential bullish triggers.




Cryptocurrency analyst and Crypto Banter host Dylan recently highlighted a list of altcoins with potential upsides. In a video, he focused on tokens including Injective, Runes, Cosmos, Floki, and Bitcoin. He emphasized several positive market developments, noting a significant influence from Chinese market activities.



The analyst identified Injective as a notable performer, having risen 7%. Other tokens, like Bret and Memes on Base, also experienced positive movements. Moreover, Dylan reviewed the Rune tokens, providing insights based on their current chart trends.



Regarding Bitcoin (BTC), the analyst noted a relatively flat trend on V bubbles but remained optimistic due to ongoing favorable market developments. Dylan stated:




“Looking flat on V bubbles but I can tell you what? it’s feeling relatively bullish out there. So let’s just take a look at what exactly they are doing to us. Yeah, is BTC on the 4H hour, and uh, you know they’re just pushing higher? We are grinding,” 




Bitcoin is currently trading at $71,284, reflecting a modest intraday uptick of 0.19%. Dylan indicated the key support levels of $70,600 and $69,800 as potential buying opportunities. Additionally, he highlighted the $72,000 mark as a crucial resistance level to watch for a bullish breakout.



The analyst also covered current trades, including positions in tokens such as AVAC, BTC, Phantom, and a newly opened position in VET, driven by a perceived Chinese narrative influencing its price.









In market news, Dylan discussed Christine Lagarde’s announcement of European Central Bank (ECB) rate cuts and positive job data. According to the analyst, this could trigger bullish sentiments in the market.



Dylan further referenced the S&P 500 index, noting potential bullish divergence but advising caution against premature market shorting. Overall, the Crypto Banter host emphasized the importance of monitoring key support and resistance levels. He also urged investors to stay informed about market developments and remain adaptable in their trading strategies.

$500 Million in Bitcoin Open Interest Erased After US Jobs Report


The recent US jobs report has significantly impacted the cryptocurrency market, wiping out over $500 million in Bitcoin open interest. 
This drastic market movement comes after mixed signals from the latest employment data.
US Jobs Report Slashes Bitcoin Open Interest

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that May saw an increase in hiring by 272,000 in the establishment survey. However, the household survey indicated a drop in employment and a rise in unemployment, which climbed to 4.0% — the highest since January 2022. 
Average weekly hours remained steady at 34.3, which often aligns with a soft economy. Additionally, average hourly earnings rose by 0.4% in May, marking a 4.1% increase from a year earlier.
Private sector hiring averaged just over 200,000 new jobs per month over the last three to six months, a notable increase from the 155,000 jobs seen at the end of the previous year. The index of aggregate weekly payrolls for private-sector workers, which combines hiring, wages, and hours, was up 5.4% over the last 12 months. This is a decline from the 6%-6.5% range observed a year ago, bringing it closer to 2018’s highs for the 2009-2020 cycle.
Following the report’s release, Bitcoin’s price saw a 2% correction, dropping from $72,144 to $70,668. This sudden price movement triggered significant liquidations. 

“Over $500 million of Bitcoin open interest wiped out within minutes. Shorts and longs were liquidated,” IT Tech noted.

The job report’s mixed signals have caused significant market fluctuations. While an increase in hiring suggests economic strength, the rise in unemployment and steady weekly hours indicate underlying weaknesses. 

The reaction from the crypto market reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic indicators but could soon revert.

“Unemployment just hit the highest level since COVID, and markets whipsawed down. Often, the first move on these announcements is the wrong one. Time will tell. But it for sure looks like unemployment has bottomed now, which suggests US liquidity will need to rise and rise soon. Rate cuts incoming,” Charles Edwards, founder at Capriole Investments, commented.

Big Shorters Bet $6.9 Billion Against Pro-Bitcoin MicroStrategy, How Are They Faring? | Bitcoinist.com


								Big shorters have placed significant bets on Michael Saylor’s business intelligence and software firm, MicroStrategy, selling stocks worth approximately $6.9 billion. Despite the substantial short positions, MicroStrategy stocks (MSTR), have continued to rise, outperforming investor expectations. 
MicroStrategy Big Shorters Lose Confidence
MicroStrategy short sellers are currently losing confidence as the price of MSTR stocks has skyrocketed over the past six months. The software intelligence firm currently holds a staggering $6.9 billion in short positions, constituting 23.14% of its market capitalization of nearly $30 billion. 

Short selling is a trading strategy where investors speculate on a stock’s potential decline. These investors, typically called shorters, borrow shares and sell them in the hopes that they will fall and then buy them back again at a lower price to take profits. 
In the context of MicroStrategy, the company’s stocks have not witnessed a significant decline since the beginning of the year. To be precise, MSTR stocks have risen by approximately 190.08% over the past six months. 
Numerous institutions are still hoping for a decline in MSTR’s price to enable them to generate profits. The high stakes and substantial capital involved in shorting MicroStrategy could pose a risk to several investors if the price of the stock does not plummet. 
Moreover, the tripling of MSTR stock value from $570 in December to $1,656 has made current short positions incredibly expensive. If the company continues to record more gains in its stock prices, short sellers may be put in a precarious position, potentially forcing many to exit their trades early to avoid bigger losses. 
Fintel, a financial data and intelligence provider has revealed a big short list, outlining the largest short positions disclosed by institutions to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the data, MicroStrategy’s biggest net short position holds approximately $2.4 billion. 
MSTR’s big short position is also the 27th largest amongst other institutions. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust currently ranks first, holding more than $114 billion in net shorts. 
MicroStrategy Stock Price Update
Short sellers have not been the only investors making big bets, as MicroStrategy founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Michael Saylor has been making substantial wagers on Bitcoin for the past few years. 

Earlier in January 2024, Saylor revealed he was selling shares to buy more Bitcoin. This decision comes after numerous Bitcoin acquisitions, positioning MicroStrategy as the top Bitcoin holder amongst public companies, according to CoinGecko. As of May 1, 2024, the software firm owned a staggering 214,400 BTC, valued at $15.2 billion, and accounting for more than 1% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. 
Moreover, in one year, MSTR stocks have risen by more than 469.66%, fueling a price increase to $1,656.63, as of writing. Google Finance data has disclosed that the stock value is still appreciating. In the last five days, MSTR is up by 3.67% and 31.75% over the past month.

Shiba Inu on-chain data shows a substantial surge of whale-tier transactions, with an almost 7% increase in the last 24 hours. The volume of transacted SHIB exceeded $8 trillion, making the network far more active than it was last week.Large transactions worth more than $100,000 have grown dramatically in number. There were 140 of these transactions in the previous day, suggesting a resurgence of interest and potentially calculated actions by significant investors, or whales. The seven-day low of 99 transactions is drastically different from this uptick, indicating a change in the dynamics of the market.SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView It is possible that whales are stockpiling SHIB in preparation for future price changes. This might be a calculated move to acquire a sizable holding of the token while values are thought to be favorable.Large volume purchases may result from institutional investors growing interest as they start to recognize the potential in Shiba Inu.The increased activity may also be the result of announcements or impending Shiba Inu-related developments and Shibarium. This includes information on new initiatives, collaborations and technological advancements within the SHIB ecosystem.Elevated interest is usually indicated by an increase in large transactions and trading volume, which can cause notable price fluctuations. As can be seen from the technical analysis, Shiba Inu is currently consolidating around its major support levels. SHIB appears to be holding steady, according to the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, but the increase in transaction volume could force the token to test new resistance levels.In general, the lack of volatility is a bigger problem for SHIB right now and will most likely become a source of suppressed performance, rather than growth.

Bitcoin BTC/USD fell over $1,300 from $71,997 to $70,663 within minutes following the release of the latest U.S. employment report.What Happened: The report indicated that non-farm payrolls increased by 272,000, surpassing the expected 182,000.Additionally, the U.S. unemployment rate rose slightly to 4%, higher than the anticipated 3.9%, while average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, above the forecasted 0.3%.The data likely led traders to infer that rate cuts in September have become less likely, causing the market’s brief correction. Bitcoin has recovered to $71,400 at the time of writing.Institutional Investors Drive Bitcoin AccumulationAccording to CryptoQuant, new whale wallets on the Bitcoin network are adding around $1 billion in BTC daily.This trend suggests significant institutional investment, with Bitcoin being transferred to custodial wallets. Over the past 30 days, permanent holders have accumulated an additional 70,000 BTC, the largest increase since late April. Additionally, Bitcoin demand from large investors is growing at a rate of 4.4% per month, indicating strong market support.The demand recovery for Bitcoin is also evident from the increased purchases of Bitcoin from spot ETFs in the USA. Holdings in these ETFs have grown from 819,000 BTC on May 1 to 859,000 BTC currently. CryptoQuant noted, “The purchases of Bitcoin from ETFs have so far this year been a meaningful source of demand.”Moreover, the selling pressure from traders has significantly decreased. The unrealized profit ratio for traders has reset to 0%, suggesting that heavy selling has been exhausted. This reduction in selling pressure enhances Bitcoin's market stability, reducing the likelihood of abrupt price drops.Also Read: Ethereum ETF Demand May Be Muted Compared To Bitcoin ETFs, Analysts SayDespite the positive trends in Bitcoin accumulation, stablecoin liquidity has not recovered its growth trajectory. The market capitalization growth of Tether's USDT, a proxy for fresh liquidity in crypto markets, has decelerated. This slowdown in stablecoin liquidity growth could potentially hinder a sustained price rally in the short term.What’s Next: These insights into Bitcoin’s market dynamics and institutional involvement will be key topics at the upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.Industry leaders will discuss the evolving landscape of digital asset investments, the role of institutional investors, and the impact of regulatory developments on market trends.Read Next: Franklin Templeton Goes Beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum, Eyes New Crypto-Focused Investment Fund For Institutional InvestorsImage: Shutterstock

Telegram launches Stars: they can be exchanged for TON

Today the founder of Telegram, Pavel Durov, officially announced on his channel the launch of Stars: the stars received can then be converted into TON via Fragment. 

The Telegram Stars and the conversion to TON
Stars is a new Telegram service that allows in-app purchases on Android and iOS on mini-apps. 
The mini-apps of Telegram are internal bots that can be used within the official Telegram app without needing additional installations. 
The most famous is @wallet, the integrated crypto wallet of Telegram. 
The traditional apps, on the other hand, need to be downloaded and installed, and this is why Telegram’s mini-apps, such as Notcoin, are growing so rapidly. The social nature of Telegram allows mini-apps to spread virally. 
Through Telegram Stars, users will be able to make payments within the mini-apps.
In fact, the service allows mini-apps to accept payments for digital services on Android and iOS, using a very simple payment method, in-app purchases.
Once the Stars are received, the owners or managers of the mini-apps can then convert them into Toncoin (the native cryptocurrency of TON) using the Fragment platform. 
Alternatively, they can use them to further promote their mini-apps on Telegram itself, with preferential conditions. 
Durov also points out that Apple and Google receive a 30% commission when users purchase Stars from them, and states that developers who reinvest the Stars in promoting their app will have an overall commission of almost 0%.
Toncoin
Toncoin has now been steadily in the top 10 of the criptovalute with the highest market capitalization in the world for a few months.
In fact, only two days ago it recorded its highest historical price, above $7.7, with a capitalization rising above 18 billion dollars. Just to give an idea, ADA of Cardano is at 17 billion, while AVAX of Avalanche is at 14. It won’t be long before TON manages to surpass even Dogecoin, ninth overall with 23 billion, and perhaps even XRP with 29.
TON is a blockchain that was created several years ago as a Telegram ICO, but was later halted by the SEC, which accused the company of issuing an unregistered security. 
Subsequently, the blockchain was detached from Telegram and officially made decentralized, even though behind the project there is always Telegram itself. 
Recently the company has been heavily promoting TON, so much so that the price of Toncoin has risen by 220% since the beginning of the year. 
The cryptocurrency TON landed on the crypto markets in August 2021, in the midst of a bullrun. 
After rising to $4.5 in November of the same year, it plummeted below $1 during the following bear-market. 
As recently as August of last year, it was around $1.2, but starting in September, it began a climb that first took it above $2.5, and then even above $7 in 2024. 
In particular, the latest real surge began in February of this year, when news started to come out about a real promotional campaign organized by Telegram itself. 
Telegram
Telegram is the second messaging app in the world behind only WhatsApp. 
It is, however, very different compared to the rival, because by now it is a true platform with various services, as well as a simple messaging app. 
In particular, its openness to the crypto world, with the launch of Toncoin and the integrated wallet, is making it a unique point of reference in the crypto sector. 
Recently, the remarkable success of the mini-app Notcoin has made it evident how useful it is for this platform to attract crypto users, and how convenient it is to use blockchain and cryptocurrencies to do business in the digital realm. 
The same NOT token of Notcoin, which landed on the crypto markets only last month at 11 thousandths of a dollar, recorded the all-time high five days ago at 28 thousandths, and still now hovers around 21 thousandths. 
The introduction of Telegram Stars on mini-apps further expands the use cases of TON on Telegram, because it effectively allows those who receive the Stars to use the Toncoin blockchain to monetize them. 
The crypto choice of Telegram might not only give further momentum to the spread of cryptocurrencies, but it could also constitute a significant competitive advantage for the messaging app itself against the competition.

Wormhole Launches Staking and Governance For W Token Holders - The Defiant

Wormhole’s governance mechanism is the first live example of its multi-chain governance protocol, MultiGov.Wormhole, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, deployed a multi-chain staking and governance mechanism for holders of its recently launched token, W.Launched on June 6, the governance system allows W holders to create and vote on governance proposals across Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. Tokenholders can move up to 100 million W tokens from Solana to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains to participate in governance daily.“Introducing stake for governance is a significant step toward decentralizing Wormhole,” Wormhole said. “This is your opportunity to participate in governance and influence the future direction of the Wormhole DAO and platform.”Users can participate in Wormhole’s delegated Proof of Stake governance model by staking their W tokens and designating their governance power to a governance delegate. Stakers are not forced to lock up their tokens and can unstake or restake at any time.Wormhole launched as a bridge enabling cross-chain transfers between Solana and other blockchains in 2021. On June 6, Wormhole handled approximately 188,800 cross-chain messages and $30 million worth of asset flows, according to WormholeScan.To date, Wormhole has processed more than 1 billion messages, $43 billion worth of cross-chain transfers, and supports 30 different blockchains.MultiGovWormhole’s multi-chain governance mechanism utilizes MultiGov, a new cross-chain governance mechanism leveraging Wormhole’s cross-chain interoperability protocol.“By allowing users to vote from whatever chain they are on you break down the barrier of high gas fees and the complexity/cost of moving funds, you [abstract] a lot of the complexity with chain-to-chain movement,” tweeted Robinson Burkey, the co-founder of Wormhole.Wormhole said any DAO on Solana, Ethereum, or EVM-compatible L2s can leverage MultiGov.Wormhole launched its W governance token in April. The project airdropped 6% of the token’s supply to more than 400,000 wallets.Last year, the protocol raised$225 million in token warrants at a $2.5 billion valuation in the largest crypto raise of 2023. The project notably suffered the second-largest DeFi exploit in February 2022 when it lost $320 million to hackers.The price of W is up 10% in the past 24 hours, last changing hands for $0.68, according to CoinGecko data. Daily trading volume also increased by 150%.Related: Wormhole's W Token Climbs to $2.5 Billion Market Cap Post Airdrop

Prison nears for Trump-supporting crypto promoters Bannon and Guo


Steve Bannon is finally going to prison, and Miles Guo is trying to get out of jail — although his trial isn’t going particularly well. The once-Donald-Trump-supporting crypto promoters might have hoped for a presidential pardon if Trump’s campaign for the 2024 US Presidency was successful. However, the pair find themselves increasingly estranged from Trump as he focuses elsewhere and, as a result, their hopes of a pardon look to be fading.
Any presidential pardon would have been the second for Bannon, who received a pardon in January 2021. Incredibly, Bannon has managed to fumble that once-in-a-lifetime clemency, and yesterday, a US District Judge ordered him to report to prison by July 1 for contempt of Congress.
Two years ago, 12 jurors convicted Bannon of refusing to provide documents and appear for a Congressional deposition. Nevertheless, the judge mercifully stayed his actual prison sentencing for those acts, pending appeals. Yesterday, however, the judge’s patience ran out. “I do not believe the original basis for my stay exists any longer,” the judge concluded.
Bannon was Trump’s White House chief strategist for half a year, then Trump fired him. Over the next few years, Bannon would go on to promote a series of failed crypto projects, including F*** Joe Biden (FJB), Himalaya Coin (HCOIN), Himalaya Dollar (HDO), and others.

Felon Steve Bannon supported Miles Guo’s crypto
One of Bannon’s favorite crypto founders was Miles Guo who used a variety of aliases: ‘Miles Kwok,’ ‘Brother Seven,’ ‘The Principal,’ or ‘Guo Wengui.’ Guo was the leader of the Himalaya-branded crypto project that Bannon promoted.
Unsurprisingly, like millions of other altcoins promoted by celebrities, Bannon’s and Guo’s tokens have collapsed to near-$0.
For his part, Guo is defending himself in his own criminal trial. US district judge Analisa Torres, who ruled somewhat favorably toward Ripple in its unrelated SEC lawsuit, is presiding over Guo’s billion-dollar criminal fraud trial.

Guo was a member of Mar-a-Lago and an ally of Trump republicans and once offered allegedly incriminating information about Hunter Biden’s laptop. He also fundraised for Trump’s ‘Million MAGA March’ and bankrolled a legal challenge to the 2020 election in Georgia.
On Thursday, Guo’s lead translator and confidante, Ya Li, cried on the witness stand while describing Guo’s sprawling, fraudulent crypto schemes. Lamenting her mistaken belief that Guo was helping investors make money or support legitimate political causes, she concluded, “the whole movement is a scam.”
Li’s final day of cross-examination continues today. The trial is led by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. Guo has been in jail for months awaiting trial and is widely expected to go to prison sometime after his trial concludes this month.

Hulk Hogan Memecoin Slammed in $17 Million Crypto Rug Smackdown


								The Wild West of cryptocurrency just witnessed another saloon brawl, this time courtesy of wrestling legend Hulk Hogan and his ill-fated meme coin, HULK. Hogan allegedly rug pulled his investors, wiping out millions in a digital bodyslam.





Hulk Hogan Crypto Crash – What Went Wrong?




The story goes like this: HULK tokens were riding high, with a market cap of $17 million, thanks in part to a social media blitz on Hogan’s accounts. Investors were giddy, primed for a moonshot.
Then, quicker than a leg drop off the top turnbuckle, Hogan’s posts promoting HULK vanished into thin air, taking the token’s value with them. HULK crashed faster than a folding steel chair, plummeting to a measly $11,000. Investors were left reeling, their dreams of financial bliss shattered like glass jaws in a steel cage match.
Hogan claims he never authorized the promotional posts in the first place. Was it a rogue social media manager channeling their inner “Hollywood Hogan?” A case of mistaken identity? The plot thickens faster than instant mashed potatoes.


Savvy crypto enthusiasts smelled a scam from the get-go. Incriminating evidence surfaced – recycled videos from December promoting a karaoke event, and a glaring lack of endorsement on the other platforms linked to Hulk Hogan. This wasn’t a strategic body slam, it was a piledriver onto investor trust.

Celebrity Memecoin Fallout




Hogan’s supposed rug pull isn’t an isolated incident; it’s the latest body blow in a string of celebrity-endorsed meme coin meltdowns. Just weeks ago, TV personality Caitlyn Jenner pulled a similar stunt with her Jenner coin, leaving fans feeling bamboozled. Boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather also entered the ring. After hyping the token “FLOYD” on social media, Mayweather abruptly deleted his promotional posts, sparking fears of another potential rug pull.
The only one seemingly immune to the takedown is Iggy Azalea, whose MOTHER coin is still being aggressively promoted to her millions of followers. But with the stench of celebrity shilling hanging heavy in the air, investors are right to be wary.

Buterin Slams Shady Memecoin Projects
This whole fiasco has drawn the ire of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who’s about as impressed with these memecoins as a referee is with a chair shot. He lambasted these projects for their lack of innovation and blatant attempts to exploit fans for a quick buck.


So, what’s the takeaway from this crypto cage match? If a celebrity is shilling a meme coin with promises of riches beyond your wildest dreams, approach it with the same skepticism you’d have towards a wrestler promising world peace.

Should Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Worry About Whales' Actions?


The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has been struggling to note bullish cues for weeks, which could continue over the coming weeks.
This is because the little support SHIB noted from its investors is now disappearing.
Shiba Inu Investors Pull Back

Shiba Inu’s price is expected to note some drawdown or sideways action due to SHIB holders’ skepticism. Evidence of this is visible in the whales’ activity and retail investors’ actions. 
The former are the most important group of investors as their moves directly impact price. A positive move leads to a rise, a negative result in a decline, and at the moment, it seems the latter could be the outcome. 
The total volume of transactions worth more than $100,000, generally associated with whales, has taken a dive. At the moment, the daily transaction volume of whales has dipped to a low of $30 million.

This decline in transaction volume is also met with high selling from SHIB holders, intensifying the bearishness.
The realized profits on the network have spiked massively, reaching a three-month high. Spikes in this metric emerge from investors selling their holdings. This selling is either the result of profit-taking or investors offsetting their losses.
In the case of SHIB, it is the latter since investors are moving their assets to secure whatever gains they have amassed. 
Read More: Dogecoin (DOGE) vs Shiba Inu (SHIB): What’s the Difference?
Shiba Inu Realized Profits. Source: Santiment
This also indicates the surge in skepticism among SHIB holders.
SHIB Price Prediction: Consolidation Continues

Shiba Inu’s price is bound to move sideways since the investors are not explicitly bullish at the moment. SHIB could likely remain consolidated within $0.00002584 and $0.00002267. The larger range would keep the meme coin moving within $0.00002835 and $0.00002093.
The aforementioned cues also raise the chances of a decline, potentially sending SHIB to $0.00002267 or $0.00002093.

If Shiba Inu’s price does manage to breach the resistance at $0.00002835, it could establish a two-month high. This is key in sending SHIB to $0.00003000 to invalidate the bearish thesis.

Andrew Tate buys 10,000 of this crypto, plans to 'crash Solana'


    The crypto community has been familiar with Andrew Tate for some time due to his general fondness of Bitcoin (BTC) – a fondness that led him to proclaim in May that he is done with fiat and is going all in on cryptocurrencies.



More recently, Tate has apparently taken to expanding his horizons when it comes to the crypto market, first predicting Ethereum (ETH) is set to hit $4,000 soon and has, by June 7, seemingly declared war on Solana (SOL).



Indeed, on June 7, the social media personality made an X post with the attached gif of the Muppets’ Elmo in front of a fire stating that he ‘will crash the Solana network.’











Near the same time, Tate announced he had purchased 10,000 of a Madonna-themed token with the explanation he had done so ‘because f*ck Madonna,’ using all capitalized letters, thus complementing his usual belligerent style.







Andrew Tate’s trading warpath



Shortly thereafter, the former kickboxing star made yet another post promising he would acquire more cryptocurrencies of dubious value and hold them ‘diamond hands’ should said post be shared more than 2,000 times.



By press time, the post was retweeted nearly 5,000 times.



Holding an asset ‘diamond hands’ refers to holding it indefinitely, no matter the circumstances. 



The term originated as a strong sign of support and belonging to a community during the original meme stock craze of late 2020 and early 2021, and Tate is, indeed, reportedly participating in the GameStop (NYSE: GME) short squeeze of 2024.



Can Andrew Tate really crash Solana?



Despite Andrew Tate’s bold claim and massive social media following, truly crashing the Solana network might prove a tall order. Indeed, the blockchain is known for its consistent uptime and scalability and has, so far, been handling significant volumes successfully.



That being said, Tate might find some success in his latest endeavor given that, while Solana has been able to maintain significant uptime, it has been known to crash at times.



The blockchain’s token has also been performing exceptionally well in 2024 and is up as much as 69.63% year-to-date (YTD).



SOL YTD price chart. Source: Finbold



The strong 2024 performance came at the heels of a late 2023 rally, which saw SOL rocket from about $20 in October to above $100 on New Year’s Day, and Solana price today, at press time, stands at $171.14.

Bitcoin Runes Dominate BTC Transactions


Bitcoin transactions continue to grow following the halving, with data showing that much of the recorded demand comes from the Runes protocol. 
Since its launch, Runes has recorded at least 150,000 daily transactions, dethroning BRC-20, which now struggles to achieve 10,000 transactions.
Runes Dethrone BRC-20 and Ordinals as Protocol Transactions Surge

On-chain data shows that the Runes token standard has effectively sidestepped BRC-20 and Ordinals. According to Dune Analytics, the number of transactions on Rune has averaged at least 150,000 per day since its debut on April 20. The highest it has ever been was 753,584 on April 23.
On average, the share of Bitcoin transactions on Runes protocol relative to BRC-20 and Ordinals is also higher for Runes, coming in at around 40%. This trajectory comes as Runes makes creating fungible tokens on Bitcoin more efficient, unlike BRC-20, which uses the Ordinals protocol.
BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals have been controversial in the past amid complaints that they clog up the network and cause fee increases. Relative to simple peer-to-peer transactions, it is complex to create and transfer BRC-20 tokens. At the very least, one would need more space on the blockchain.
Read more: Crypto Inscriptions: What Are They And How Do They Work?

Bitcoin Transactions, Source: Dune Analytics
Casey Rodarmor, BTC developer and the creator of Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes, discussed the protocol’s pros and cons in his last appearance on Hell Money Podcast.

“If Runes are successful, they’ll drain liquidity, technology, and attention away from other cryptocurrencies, and bring it back to Bitcoin. I’m not creating a shitcoin [but] a venue for people to create shitcoins, which is possibly worse and more dangerous. We’ll see,” he said.

The Game-Changers for Bitcoin’s Future
Runes, BRC-20, and Ordinals have enabled Bitcoin to evolve and become more than just a store of value. Now, it is a platform for creative expression and complex financial instruments. The three token standards have progressively developed atop each other’s strengths and weaknesses, each better than the next.
Runes launched on April 20, when the fourth BTC halving happened. It increases the efficiency of creating fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network:

Enables off-chain transactions, thereby reducing congestion on the Bitcoin network and therefore facilitates more transactions to be processed quickly and cost-effectively.
Faster confirmation times and lower fees for users, which increase accessibility and practicality of Bitcoin transactions for everyday use.


Read more: Bitcoin NFTs: Everything You Need To Know About Ordinals
The main similarity between BRC-20 and Runes is that both use Bitcoin and pay fees in BTC to create new tokens. BRC-20, launched in February 2023, was developed to create a standard for fungible tokens on Bitcoin. Its key highlights were affordability, speed, and increased accessibility relative to its forerunner, Ordinals. It also brought programmability, unlike Ordinals.
Ordinals launched in January 2023. Through Ordinals, Rodarmor enabled the creation of NFT-like “inscriptions” on the Bitcoin network. He described the Ordinals “theory” as a lens to view the Bitcoin blockchain and see the “trackable satoshis pop into view like Pokémon in the tall grass.” Its main challenge was high fees.

Social media analytics and investment tools confirm growing interest in Runes. According to Lunarcrush, BRC-20 has up to 37,169 interactions, while Ordinals has 34,299. Meanwhile, Runes has 53,008 at the time of writing.

Cardano Skyrockets Jaw-Dropping 180% in Volume: Bullish for ADA Price?

The trading volume of derivatives on Cardano (ADA) has shot up by a whopping 170% in just 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. This surge has propelled perpetual futures on the Cardano token to over half a billion dollars in trading volume during the same period.At the same time, data from CoinMarketCap shows that there has been a 117.88% increase in ADA trading volume on spot markets across various exchanges, with a total of $554.9 million traded. When you combine both spot and derivatives markets, the total trading volume of the Cardano token has reached a remarkable $1.09 billion in the past day.This surge in trading activity comes at a time when the price of the Cardano token is also on the rise. Since the opening of the latest daily candle, ADA has seen a solid increase of over 6%, reaching $0.49 — a level unseen in the past 17 days. ADA to USD by CoinMarketCapIt is likely that the volume growth is due to the FOMO among market participants. Over the past few weeks, the price action of the Cardano token has severely depleted investors and traders with its low-volatility movement. Against this background, jokes even began to appear that ADA at $0.45 is a stablecoin. The unexpected pump of the Cardano price could, on the contrary, provoke the fear and greed of market participants who were left behind, and make them ape into Cardano. In any case, the growth in trading volumes signals increased interest and attention on the popular cryptocurrency, which means increased volatility and drama.

Telegram's The Open Network is 2024's Fastest Growing Chain - The Defiant

TON's ecosystem has succesfully leveraged the messaging app's millions of users. Despite gathering little attention throughout the bear market, Telegram-integrated blockchain, The Open Network (TON), is the fastest growing major Layer 1 chain in 2024.TON’s total value locked (TVL) has increased 27 times to $386 million from $14 million this year, outpacing all competing Layer 1s and Ethereum Layer 2s on a percentage basis. The network’s native token, Toncoin, has surged too, boasting the 5th largest year-to-date gain among the top 50 tokens per CoinMarketCap, displacing competing Layer 1 Cardano from the top 10.The Open Network’s rapid ascent began in February with the launch of its Open League incentives program. The network’s ad-sharing program and Tether partnership have also driven activity and token price. TON’s growth showcases how a web2 app can successfully be a foundation for a strong web3 ecosystem, especially with a pre-existing user base of over 900 million monthly active users (MAU), like Telegram has.TON TVL vs. Price - DeFiLlamaSEC ScrutinyOriginally founded in 2013 by Pavel and Nikolai Durov, Telegram is the 4th most popular messaging app in the world by MAU.Recently, in an interview with Tucker Carlson, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov stated: “We'll probably cross one billion monthly active users within a year now”.The official Telegram team launched its blockchain, TON, in 2018 but faced scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was forced to shut down operations.In 2021, the project restarted development under the stewardship of the TON Foundation, which operates adjacent to Telegram.TON of IncentivesBut it’s been the last few months when the ecosystem started taking off. Bootstrapped by its incentives program called the “Open League”, the TON foundation is providing a multi-season rollout of $TON incentives.The Open League will distribute over $150M in rewards across the course of the program, split amongst a variety of categories such as DeFi, NFT, Token, and App ecosystems.As of March, Telegram announced its ad-sharing program built on TON. Channel owners that qualify will receive 50% of the revenue that Telegram makes from ads displayed in the respective channels, and payment distributions and withdrawals are moved exclusively through the TON blockchain.Built on TelegramThe majority of TON”s infrastructure is built on top of the messaging app, Telegram, to leverage its existing user base. TON-native wallet solutions such as Tonkeeper can operate directly within the messaging app. Tonkeeper wallets are also available as a separate mobile app or as a web application, and is currently the number 1 ranked finance app on Google Play.Tonkeeper transactions are routed through a Telegram channel, similar to how other Telegram bots function. These wallets allow for self-custody, payments, transfers, and access to applications such as NFT marketplaces, but instead of interacting with an installed browser extension, like most other Layer 1 chains, the functions are hosted in Telegram.TON raised $250 million in a 2022 round including Mask Network, FJ Labs, and MEXC Venture. The network also has strategic support from firms such as Animoca Brands and OKX. Last month, Pantera Capital announced their investment into TON, citing it as their “largest investment ever”.Pantera partner Ryan Barney wrote in a May 8 letter, “By leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and seamless UX with the vibrancy of TON’s emerging ecosystem, we believe TON has the potential to become one of the largest crypto networks.”DeFi on TONStill in its infancy, TON’s on-chain economy is small compared to Toncoin’s market cap of $17 billion. While its TVL soared this year, competitors such as Sui boast 85% more assets held in smart contacts and more native dApps, despite being valued nearly 70% lower.A sizable amount of the on-chain activity on TON takes place on the chain's largest native decentralized exchange (DEX), STON.fi, which hosts 67% of the total TVL. Outside of STON.Fi, and TON’s leading liquid staking solution, Tonstakers, DeFi on The Open Network is limited to a few small lending and derivatives platforms.Asynchronous PaymentsTON runs an asynchronous payment channel via two interacting networks called shard chains, that finalize transactions independently, and then confirm their states to the payment channel’s smart contract.This is different from other network designs, including Solana’s and Ethereum’s, which have synchronous payments, where one cannot begin the next transaction in a contract without confirmation of the initial transaction.On TON, the execution of smart contract functions will take place in a future block as opposed to the block the transaction is confirmed in. This can help the network handle high volumes of complex smart contract interactions.Blockchain Comparison. Source: MezenTON’s developer community is small. Electric Capital cites 175 monthly active developers on TON as of Dec. 31, 2023, compared to Solana’s 1,615. Despite this, TON touts the second-highest two-year growth percentage in terms of active developers, surpassed only by Celestia.The Future of TONOne of the primary goals for 2024 will be cross-chain interoperability, by integrating compatibility with Ethereum token standard ERC-20 , a founding member of the TON Core Dev Team, known as Dr. Awesome Doge on social media, said at the Web3 Festival held in April.The developer also said the team is building bridge support for other blockchains, including Bitcoin and Solana.Meanwhile, the token continues to outperform. Toncoin was the 13th best performer out of the 100 biggest coins by market cap in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko.The Open League incentives program is still underway and preparing to begin its Season 4. Season 3 concluded on May 29, and the TON foundation is currently accepting and reviewing applications for the next season's participants.

The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, much higher than analysts’ expectation of 190,000 additions. 
Unemployment rose to 4% in May — also higher than expected — marking its highest point since January 2022, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed. 
American equities initially dipped on the news before paring losses slightly. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were trading 0.2% and 0.3% lower, respectively, at time of publication. 
Bitcoin and ether similarly dipped in the hour following the report’s release. Bitcoin recovered to trade around 0.3% higher to $71,500 at time of publication while ether lost around 0.8% and was hovering around $3,800, according to data from Coinbase. 
Although the headline figure of 272,000 may suggest a labor market too hot for the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts in the fall, the report overall was still fairly hawkish, according to Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone. 
Average hourly earnings increased 0.4% month over month in May and 4.1% year over year, suggesting that the labor market is actually relatively tight, Brown said. 
“The May employment report seems unlikely to be a game-changer in terms of the Fed policy outlook,” Brown said. “[Federal Open Market Committee] members continue, unsurprisingly, to place greater weight on the inflation side of the dual mandate, and are likely to reiterate next week that they are yet to obtain the ‘confidence’ being sought on a return towards the 2% target to enable the first rate cut to be delivered.”
Rate cut expectations for September remained largely unchanged Friday after the report dropped. Fed fund futures showed a 52% chance that the first rate cut will come early this fall, about the same odds markets had earlier this week, according to data from CME Group. 
The Fed’s June FOMC meeting will begin Tuesday and central bankers will reveal their interest rate decision on Wednesday. Committee members will also report projections next week, including their target interest rate for December 2024 and predicted inflation figures. 
Ahead of the interest rate decision, markets will also get the latest Consumer Price Index figures, scheduled for Wednesday morning. The inflation figures will be a “much more significant event,” according to Brown, as central bankers will be looking to see core CPI declining on an annual basis.

Michael Saylor Changes Tone On Ethereum (ETH): Will Saylor Buy Ethereum ETFs? - Benzinga

Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, has been a strong proponent of Bitcoin, frequently discussing its benefits across various platforms. MicroStrategy owns more than 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply and Saylor's personal holdings. Despite his focus on Bitcoin, Saylor recently began speaking about Ethereum. Don't Miss:Saylor appeared on the "What Bitcoin Did" podcast at the end of May to discuss his views on Bitcoin and crypto. "Bitcoin was going to be the only asset securitized and offered as a spot ETF by the Wall Street establishment—and it was going to spread as the one legitimate crypto asset," Saylor noted. Saylor was alluding to the recent advancement of spot Ethereum ETFs to the next approval stage, which occurred just days before the interview. Although the outlook for approval was initially bleak for much of 2024, the SEC is now taking a closer look at each application. Speculation suggests that trading could begin by the end of the summer. The advancement of the Ethereum ETFs surprised everyone, including Saylor. Previously, Saylor believed that Bitcoin was the only crypto asset worthy of investment, with other cryptocurrencies merely imitating Bitcoin's success. However, the approval of the ETFs arguably legitimizes Ethereum in the eyes of institutional investors. Trending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.For years, Saylor has focused on Bitcoin's limited supply and its use of blockchain for transactions. However, during the interview, he acknowledged the advantages of Ethereum, noting that ‘digital art, NFTs, tokens,…DeFi' are all part of ‘an entire range of use cases' for crypto. Despite recognizing Ethereum's benefits, Saylor still believes Bitcoin will remain the leader in crypto. He noted that institutional investors might ‘allocate 5% or 10% to the crypto asset class, but Bitcoin will be 60% to 70% of that.' The Ethereum ETFs could attract new crypto investors who will also buy Bitcoin. This raises the question of whether Saylor will invest in the Ethereum ETFs. Based on his interview comments, his top crypto choice remains Bitcoin. While he acknowledges some benefits of Ethereum and other tokens, he believes these benefits will attract more people to Bitcoin. "I think that we are politically much more powerful [when] supported by the entire crypto industry," he said. Given this perspective, it seems unlikely that Saylor will make significant investments in Ethereum ETFs, though it is not entirely out of the question. Read Next:

Crypto Trader Michaël van de Poppe Outlines Top Altcoin Gems for This Cycle - Here Are His Picks - The Daily Hodl


								Closely followed crypto strategist and trader Michaël van de Poppe is naming his top altcoin picks for the current cycle.
In a new strategy video, Van de Poppe tells his 165,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin (BTC) investors are likely to start funneling their profits into altcoins, sending alt projects much higher.










“Altcoins are going to do really well. They are likely going to do that. They have been suffering a lot in the past period because of the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but I think that the rotation is going to be very close towards an upside for altcoins.”
The trader says that he is now bullish on several newer altcoins.
“So the altcoins that I had in my portfolio are likely going to do well, but they will be outperformed by newer assets.”
Among his newer top alt picks is Renzo (REZ), a liquid re-staking token for EigenLayer.
“Seeing the price action that has been taking place, I rotated some of the altcoins that are relatively old like ATOM, like Curve in my portfolio and I swapped them for newer coins. One of those newer coins is some project that I started to tweet which is Renzo.”

Renzo is trading for $0.172 at time of writing, up slightly in the last 24 hours.
Next up, the trader believes that Portal (PORTAL), a project that aims to unite games from different blockchains on its cross-chain token platform, has a lot of upside potential this cycle.

Portal is trading for $0.97 at time of writing, down 3.5% in the last 24 hours.
Lastly, the trader says cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole (W) could post big gains.

Kevin O'Leary Advocates For Strict Regulatory Compliance: Implications For Digital Assets - Benzinga

This transition is crucial for attracting institutional investors and fostering substantial growth in the value of cryptocurrencies.The Future of Digital AssetsThese themes will be central to discussions at Benzinga’s Future of Digital Assets event, scheduled for November 19 at Convene 225 Liberty Street, NYC.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed their second-highest net inflows for the year earlier this week.Notably, the cumulative net inflow in Bitcoin spot ETFs crossed the $15 billion mark and currently stands at $15.56 billion at the time of writing, according to data analytics platform Sosovalue.In a note shared with Decrypt, Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick have pointed out that institutional investors are flocking to buy Bitcoin spot ETFs.“The recent recovery in inflows started in mid-May which was right around the time 13F filings started to appear for end Q1 holdings of the BTC ETFs. They showed very strong and broad holdings data. For example, Blackrock’s IBIT had 414 reported holders including large banks, hedge funds, state pension funds etc.," he wrote in the note.Case in point: Medical technology firm Semler Scientific announced that it has purchased Bitcoin worth $17 million and that the firm plans on spending another $150 million on Bitcoin in the future.Standard Chartered analysts are expecting the price of Bitcoin to cross its all-time high by the end of the week if the U.S. payroll data is favorable.

But despite the guilty verdict, Trump’s campaign received donations amounting to $52.8 million within 24 hours, according to a report.Users on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, are speculating that Trump will likely win the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
